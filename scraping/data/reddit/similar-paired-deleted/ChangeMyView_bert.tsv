>Vaccine mandates are not "backed by science"  You still have not admitted this was the most retarded thing to say, which was the only reason I ever bothered to try to educate you.

And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition. You clearly aren’t willing to do that because you realize it would make you look fucking stupid. Not sure we have anything left to discuss here.	The Israelis don't lay claim to the area on that ground. Sure, that's part of the *draw* - but they claimed the land then on the basis of legally immigrating to and purchasing it. They claim the land *now* because they've been their for 3 generations, and have built a ton of infrastructure and a democratic high-tech economy from the ground-up.	0.846

Yeah, just say male or female. Same thing..	<p>You make a fair point that BDS is specifically an organization targeted towards Israel.

Except you've provided fuck all to prove this "truth" you've done nothing but assert and flame out and block people who disagree	<p>What the fuck? You first came up with me calling you self hating then you pull this &quot;our people shit?&quot; Not to mention that you&#39;re strawmanning me. I never aimed people should care more about other countries than Israel, I pointed out how the complete and utter indifference to other atrocities yet a rabid animosity towards Israel is indicative of anti-Semitism. Am I wrong? Do anti-Semites not use legitimate criticism of Israel to spread hate? Is this not a well documented phenomena? Is it not suspicious that OP wrote an entire essay explaining how he isnt anti-Semitic? Is it not strange that OP effectively said &quot;im not anti-Semitic, but&quot; and the &quot;but&quot; was over 1000 words long?</p>	0.899
It's not a reasonable conclusion and you should also, kindly, go away.	That's quite different though. People are spending time in front of a screen largely as part of an existing organization to complete certain tasks that they are paid for. They've already gone through school, had their childhood experiences and are doing this for work. Trust me, if there was a switch I could flip and keep my income, insurance and hours the same yet I'm not sitting at a desk I'd take it in a heartbeat. There's a huge difference between working in front of a computer because you need money to not go into poverty and sitting in front of a screen for hours a day because that's the only form of recreation you know of.	0.832

Lmao Reddit karma = sound argument. I've heard it all.	<p>She would probably consider it cheating because it would feel more like sex to her because its more external to one&#39;s self, and sex for her is something special that requires emotional investment. It is for me too, we just have a slight difference in what we consider sex (again, to me it&#39;s closer to masturbation, to her it&#39;s closer to sex) but it&#39;s really kind of an overlapping grey area.</p>	0.897

Yes I have. Read my fucking post.	I hear people way too often giving credit for the decline of diseases to vaccines and not to clean water, good hygiene and proper sanitation.

You claim to have heard it all, but fail to address their arguments. Interesting	>Because violence also deligitimizes agreements and thus the real source of power. In that you might obey a psychopath while he's looking at you but secretly plot to kill him the moment he isn't. And he knows that and that makes him mad. Which is why most facists turn totalitarian and genocidal pretty fast or get the Ghaddaffi or Hussein treatment. It's a pathetic ideology that leaves everybody worse off because of it. Which is again why you show fascists the door. Should they practice the supreme authority upon themselves, reducing their size and supporters by the day as they weed out ""the weak"".	0.876
That person could've read my comment. But she didn't.	<p>I agree that the risk of major complications are sufficiently low that fear is borderline irrational.  However, most people do experience a few mild &amp; temporary symptoms.

I did. It's nothing but your personal opinions on a topic that a hell of a lot of people entirely disagree with. And you ignore every criticism they provide.	>::eyeroll:: Okay, that's it. I'm done. Have a nice day.	0.851
Again, I'm not going to engage with bad faith arguments. Maybe I should rewrite this because apparently fucking no one understands.	I don't follow your logic. If 40% of the population get it that's still 60% of the population who might get some random side effect. Like how Thalimide wasn't tested on pregnant women and ended up causing birth defects and miscarriages. Pregnant women are much less than 60% of the population.	0.828
I've already said why.	Especially given that no vaccine in over 60 years has showed side-effects that didn't reveal themselves within the first two months...	0.881

Plenty of strawman arguments, maybe.	<p>I could be wrong, but I feel like you have a desire to individualise blame in this instance and ignore the systematic issues at play. You also seem eager to put down other progressives and prove you&#39;re not like them. Making claims about what other people do privately is extremely weird to me, and it feels like this viewpoint has more to do with you than them. Am I wrong?</p>	0.859
No, you ignore 90% of it and strawman the rest.	https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/cdc-says-there-have-been-less-than-6000-breakthrough-covid-cases-among-fully-vaccinated-americans.html"	0.797

Nope.	>It is my opinion that it is wrong pressure people to perform their gender's social duties. The fact that we do this necessitates the need for individuals to select their gender based on personal preference because these social pressures are incredibly difficult to deal with, but that doesn't make the expectations ok, and I doesn't make the distinctions between the genders not arbitrary.	0.894
Not at all.	This is exactly why I have this view though. I don't like the we are creating this ambiguity with a word used to convey factual information."	0.881
Once again, asserting it does not make it a true statement.	<p>Not exactly. Probably my fault for not making it clear. What I&#39;m saying is that if you&#39;re in favor of (effectively) mandated vaccinations for COVID then you should also be in favor of the same for the flu. The main counterpoint I see is that the flu kills fewer people, but that seems like a weak argument since it still kills <em>a lot</em> of people. </p>	0.842
Again, I've supported my arguments and made counters. If you want me to go into more detail. DM me in a respectful way or go to hell. But I'm not engaging with bad faith actors.	>If you're sick, stay home.	0.854
Oh enlightened one. I've just learned another noble truth of which I had no prior knowledge. Criticism is not the same as insults. Who would've known? Truly you are blessed with knowledge.	On it's own that definition is very confusing.	0.882
No, you haven't. Your "supporting arguments" are just more assertions of yours. I haven't seen you actually counter a single comment anyone left, only tiny fragments and strawman takes of their stance. You've repeatedly refused to actually elaborate on the entirety of your post, and accused people of gaslighting for calling out your flimsy arguments. If you have details to provide, provide them here. There's no reason to go to dms except to either break sub rules or to save face when no details are sent.	I dont really disagree with your second paragraph except to say again - what makes superstraight unique in this? Every significant sub I've seen that gets even vaguely ideological ends up having ""too many stupid people who don’t know where to draw the line."""	0.853
Again, I have. Plenty of times. If you don't want DMs then go ahead and engage with me respectfully here. But I'm not engaging if you're going to be bad faith.	I get that I don't have data (I wonder why they don't show data about it...), so if you can prove me wrong..."	0.888
Yes only you. Enlightened one. Are graced with this divine knowledge.	<p>We’ve also been lucky to have much more improved technology, regulations and developments that make vaccines safer (and even more applicable, if you look at mRNA technology). Noticed how the majority of your examples were from pre-1980’s. </p>	0.853
That's no an excuse. Grow up	I appreciate your take on abortion and we have common ground there.	0.852
I'm not in bad faith. I want details you have repeatedly refused to provide. Strange how directly stating what you've done is disrespectful. Perhaps it's because you consider those very things bad, and can't stand the thought of you doing them? Who's to say. Just provide details and stop trying to make excuses.	The reason people call it white culture is because a lot of those mannerisms that you would associate with that are done by white Americans as opposed to POC. And while white Americans do make up the majority of the US, I think it is safe to say that black culture (and maybe even Asian-American culture) is just as popular and synonymous with the US despite being a minimal part of the population. But  if your argument is that all those subcultures should fall under one name you would be off base. Those cultures are based on the homeland of peoples ancestors, music, clothing etc all has a place of origin. While things that people consider white culture are normally superficial things that are specific to the US and not specific ethnicity."	0.813
Grow up yourself	<p>Most of the media reporting I remember was just them saying &quot;Trump said their were fine people on both sides&quot;, which he did. They gave the full context clips most of the time.</p>	0.809
How about you engage respectfully?	And getting an abortion is a hard procedure to go for. That's why I cannot disagree more with your point."	0.818
I am. I have repeatedly asked for details you continually refuse to provide. How are statements of what you've done disrespectful?	I think encouraging people to ""come out"" as pedophiles who should be treated with understanding will have the opposite effect to what you intend, i.e. it will increase harm to kids instead of decreasing it. It will inevitably play into the hands of sickos who claim that children can consent to sex because ""love is love"" and ""age is just a number"". It will go down the same path that other ""sexual disorders"" have gone down. Eg homosexuality was once considered a sexual disorder, and illegal. Pro-contact MAPs will point to that and say ""if we can be enlightened about that, why can't we be enlightened about this?"" There are already enough of these scumbags coming out of the woodwork and we don't need to make the argument easier for them."	0.903
Oh another enlightened one. Please teach me, a plebian, a rat of these noble truths. I'm always ready to learn oh enlightened ones.	<p>Plus you said that white culture in US doesn&#39;t exist, but you say that in a roman anglo saxons language, follow an european religion, an european system. The fact that black people adopted (with force) this culture, and that it get named the american culture doesn&#39;t mean white culture doesn&#39;t exist. It just became the default option so you don&#39;t remark it.</p>	0.779
How about not having such a combattive tone?	As for the problem I have with that second article, I think that using non-standard chromosomal arrangements to argue that sex is anything but binary is a mistake. Evolution doesn't care about chromosomes, evolution only cares if your genitals work. So from an evolutionary perspective, your biological sex is about your genitals, not your chromosomes. And the fact remains that there are only two gamete types, sperm and egg. Every human that has ever existed produces one of these two, with the exception of some intersex people, who may produce both. But understand that producing both does not constitute evidence that sex is not binary. Even intersex people are limited to sperm and egg. There is no third gamete, there is no third sex."	0.853
Oh of course of course. I'm not enlightened as you. That is why.	Now take the lessons of those individual instances and extrapolate. There becomes no way to enforce accountability on a police force that acts this way. You talk about how they're not the legislature, and you're correct, but what happens when the legislature passes a law the police don't like, so the cops just ignore it? What is the answer when a law says ""choke-holds are illegal"" and they keep using choke-holds? Can you see why a group that seems to be completely above the law and effectively allowed to use force against anyone they want to would engender some ill-will?"	0.868
You first.	So it's not a population random sample, It's people who've already been arrested for actual CP. You don't have any data about the people who weren't arrested. It's just as possible that going to jail prevents people who like CP from sexual acts and therefore we should jail people who like loli porn just in case.	0.873
This is very grown up behaviour.	<p>You do realize if you want this to be law, the police will simply just chance their policy to rarely respond and take all reports by phone. If you&#39;re being attacked by someone, no officer will take any chance responding to help you knowing full well they cannot do anything to subdue the attacker since the attacker is granted full immunity to assault the officer with any level of force (including deadly force) during the arresting process. </p>	0.868
You seem to be mistaking directness for being combattative. Will you provide details or not?	<p>This would be wildly unpopular in the US, where we can&#39;t even get many people to take a vaccine that will save their lives and see wearing a mask as a violation of their rights.</p>	0.861
Nice job editing your comment	Right now, they can compete with eachother by offering to pay more. In your world how does that decision get made?"	0.807
Stop being combattive. Tell me what you want details of in the first place.	Let's use your basket of fruit example.	0.795
I wouldn't trust your judgment on that. I bet you're a bored 13 year old who has too much time on their hands.	Having said that, as an Australian I feel our private health insurance is way overpriced so I simply take that money and save it myself. But, if I ever fall sick, I can go into the public system and get treated basically for free. It's just that if I have elective surgery, going private means I won't have to wait many months to get it done.	0.855
I already did. You just ignored it. Go back and read it again if you want.	For cases of incest where no children are made, I think it would depend on what ""no"" means. Like if they always use a condom/birth control, even together, the risk is minimized but still present so I would say that is not acceptable. If the risk is actually eliminated through sterilization, or say homosexual incest, then I see no moral issue, though it would probably be best to still ban marriage in that case out of desire for legal consistency."	0.888
Oh my, too afraid to give them out?	You went from ""adults can't get jobs"" to ""children won't sit with people at lunch"". I'll gran tyou kids are way more tribal than adults. But adults, and particularly capitalism, reject racism. We're in a giant competition to win and the people who help us get there matter. A racist won't hire the best engineer because he's black. That lets me hire that engineer because he's the best engineer. I win.	0.866
Yes yes. Ofc. Bored 13 year old. Totally.	>The main protagonist is female and one of the main cast sports black skin, which is what I assume are the SJW's influence that people are blaming. I don't see how Rey being a women or Finn being black makes them bad?	0.87
Would you rather me call you a sad and pathetic adult? Regardless I think it's clear you have issues to work on. It may be a good idea to address your anger issues before it gets you into trouble.	it is the case that more desirable people will have more options in selecting a partner. I've not read the data myself so take it with a grain of salt but it matches my impression from experience.	0.822
You came to the wrong website to criticize women about anything, good for you for taking the heat lol	<p>This is a common argument I see against talking about racism. The problem with it is it ignores the world as it was and as it is. It would be absolutely wonderful if we could just cancel racism and forget about it, but we simply and obviously cannot do that so long as racism exists on a systemic level. No matter how hard we try to call racism bad, it has been baked into the very foundation of western society. Just ignoring it would not remove it from those systems. White people <em>are</em> a different group, but not because skin color actually matters. White people are a different group because western society was built on the idea that they are.</p>	0.851
Go paste it. I believe in you. Prove you're not saving face.	Saying black people got screwed over so it's okay to be racist against white people is ignoring the real problem.  It makes the people who talk about 'white fragility' feel good about themselves, but doesn't actually help stop racism or roll back the serious effects of racism and segregation."	0.899
Wtf are you talking about? You can see on your reply earlier, you quoted pretty much what i said. Your just a piece of shit w issues.  Fuck off.	Edit: and actually, a lot people make grilled cheese ""wrong"" (there is no wrong, though... that's the beauty of a grilled cheese... I really just mean inefficiently)... put the oil/butter in the pan first, and skip the super annoying step of having to butter uncooked bread. Can't do that with a toastie machine unless you're going to use cooking spray (shudder)."	0.828
But you are struggling with reading comprehension. Expecting someone to take off their pants so you can fuck them, is not as bad as asking them to pay. You are comparing apples to grenades.	<p>I will try an argument, what about people who criticize others for social clout? I.E a celebrity calling out any other celebrity to increase their own exposure. This person is probably uncaring about the damage and there does not have to be projection because there main goal is social clout to get better movie roles or something.</p>	0.835

Stay ashamed	<p>You&#39;re underestimating how much simpler life was back then. Homes were much smaller. They had fewer bathrooms. They didn&#39;t have many nice amenities. There were no cable bills, no phone bills, no internet bills, way fewer luxuries, let alone luxuries that everyone had access to like many of the ones you and I enjoy. Kids literally wore bread bags on their feet when it rained. Eating out was much more rare. And just in terms of prices, the price per square foot of US homes has gone nearly unchanged for 50 years. I def agree that we have challenges, and that housing is one of them particularly in certain areas.

I personally support the one state solution generally, and a multi-ethnic, pluralistic, Lebanon-like Jewish/Arab state in the area with a UN administered Jerusalem that is given back to that state over time. Essentially equivalent to modern day South Africa, but with much more assistance and control given to the Palestinians than what the black South Africans got.

Again, context....  You are clearly missing the context here.  Your point would be valid if this werent withing the larger context of the conversationsation being specifically about the jan 6th riot.   If were talking about tomatoes and i say how much i hate fruit, then youll know im also saying i hate tomatoes.  Not sure how you still dont understand how context works.  Literaply every respnse youve made has failed to take that into consideration.  Meanwhile you accuse me of putting words in someones mouth while you are at the same time taking words out.  Additionally, if you think my asking if you can follow a conversation is rude, the same can be said for asking if i am even making a point.  Hypocrite.

Female legislators can be just as ignorant.	0.837

How entitled are you? Have you ever paid for dinner?	<p>I&#39;ll put it this way. I&#39;m a lawyer, meaning that I&#39;m a participant in the justice system. And I have the lawful right to use violence in certain situations- everyone does, either in defense of oneself or someone else. Police are the same way, they just have expanded situations where they are allowed to use violence compared to others- but not unlimited. The rules around when they can use force are clear and public. They cannot use force against someone who is not being detained for a lawful purpose, for example. They cannot use force against a member of the general public without one of those prior justifications being present.</p>	0.843
>I don't mean to be rude it it just seems you are just making excuses on why you deserve and should get free stuff.  No, of course not./s	But is this really something *every* police officer can be blamed for? A typical officer doesn't know what causes recidivism, they are given a simple task of going out to stop crimes and arrest criminals. The current system might be a revolving door of imprisonment with little hope of rehabilitation, but surely the typical cop on the street isn't going ""Yeah, I love arresting gang members so they can spend a few years in jail building bad habits and connections so I have to arrest them again after they get out!"" Instead they are probably like the rest of us, they can see the problem but they don't have any magic solutions.

I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	What is a fact is that there is a [state of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine) now and Israeli settlers are settling on its land illegally, supported by the israelian government. **That** is all I'm saying - Israel does not have any rights to the land their settlers are on."	0.821

It doesn’t work that way. You’ll walk into the emergency for... say.. stomach pain. The doctor has an ethical responsibility to get you out of pain. He may take an X-ray or MRI. He may tell you he sees a very concerning mass in your stomach, and wants to refer you to a gastroenterologist or oncologist. Both of those specialists will want your insurance information before you make an appointment. You tell them you don’t have insurance, you’re self-pay only. That’s fine. They’ll require an up-front payment of $Xxx before they can make the appointment. Then they’ll give you a breakdown of all the costs involved. Further diagnostic testing will cost $xxx and $xxx.

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day.

As for Arab/ israelis (Palestinian/ israelis) - there are over three dozen laws that provide special rights for jews, the vast majority of poor areas are the non jewish areas due Tony equal funding and jew on Palestinian crime is almost never properly investigated or prosecuted.   ‘80% of israel is jewish’ ….. that would be be due to the ethnic cleansing of non jewish Palestinians from their land in 1948 and the refusal to let them return.   The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‘Jews escaping bla bla bla……’ this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‘jews as victims’ justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.

This is a blatant straw man. You leave no room for good-faith arguments. Their either malicious, or they are dumb.	<p>Skin colour determined what resources you got, and what you were allowed to do for a good part of American history. Now were there poor illiterate whites in those times - of course. Shit my own grandfather was white and couldnt write his middle name (although he wasn’t American, but my point is I’m intimately familiar with the idea of a disadvantaged poor white man) but at-least they weren’t as heavily restricted. A black man during Jim Crow era could have been the most educated, well spoken, political speech giver, even filthy stinking rich, and he still would be kept out of positions that would have enabled him to enact change for the majority of black people who were having a really <em>shit</em> time. The last 50 years don’t make up for the land grab, gold rush “self made man” era that African American people missed out on. They never got that chance. We still see the result of that to this day. Years ago some white people in this country decided that status quo when they brought slaves to this country, and now their descendants have to come to terms with the damage that was done, and that it can’t be undone in a lifetime. Or two. Or three. And it can’t be undone by just patiently waiting. Who knows, it might take an equal amount of back breaking hard work for 400 years like how it took for enslaved Africans to built the country in the first place. I gather you’re uncomfortable with the idea that white people have such life changing privilege that many people regard to trump other privileges- and well thats a consequence of the inhumanity that unfolded prior to your existence that youll have to live with. For hundreds of years privilege boiled down to are you black slave or are you a free white man and then they coalesced and built ontop of one another from there compounding the effect of what it meant to be white, or what to meant to be black. Eventually 400 years later, black doesn’t just mean you produce more melanin. It developed into a subconscious bias means your poor, you’re ghetto, you’re uneducated you’re incapable.</p>	0.889
>the implication is black people can't look up to and admire white heroes or vice versa.  And it's not like there aren't already a ton of prominent black superheros or anything.

That's a wild take. Are you really going to pretend that you can't make a connection between the origin of someone's name and their likely ethnicity? And are you trying to say that people should just ditch their family names? What an incredibly narrow-minded ill thought out view.	<p>There is some difference in the fact that Irish people are white and even though we&#39;ve gone through hundreds of years of historical misery- the xenophobia and dehumanisation of Irish people as an ethnicity has thankfully died out in ways that have not for darker skinned people.

If black America has its very own culture, it’s because of segregation.

If there wasn&#39;t ELO or playful taunting between opponents it wouldn&#39;t be as exciting. Same with video games, sports, etc. In fandoms about things that aren&#39;t inherently competitive (like TV shows, for example), men will <em>make</em> it a competition through tribalism or gatekeeping or whatever means they can find to create a pecking order, which is sometimes very toxic and sometimes very fun.</p>	0.87

🙌	The interest problem is not serious and again won't make the system work any worse than the current one. In the current system, in the US about 40% of people don't show even that much interest that they would vote in the national elections. So, their interests don't get any attention in the political system. It's the people who actually vote for either of the two parties that get their views represented (I mean in theory, in practice it's the donor class who gets their view represented). So, if you elected, say, 300 random members and 40% of them never show up on any vote as they are not interested, you'd still have 180 people who would represent the people who are interested in political decisions. The result would be the same as in the current system, but just without the corruption.	0.863

I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	<p>some palestinians became refugees after their attempt to genocide the jews by starting the 1948 war. the list of masscres as an example i sent you, and the opinions of their leaders such as amin al husseiny, were held far before any of them became refugees.</p>	0.831

Not hormone production, not your chromosomes, not genitalia, (I wouldn't say a vaginoplasty is literally giving me a human vagina, I would say it's an imitation. Obviously it's good enough for government work, still would be called a vagina, and really unless you're having kids no one should really care) nothing else but levels of hormones in your body, but you're still considering it changing sex.	0.877

In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.

Great answer	Sponsorship views have a level of trust implied within it. A youtuber is leveraging a viewer's personal investment in them and their content to encourage them to buy things. That level of trust can be abused if the youtuber isn't doing this in good faith or is presenting a product that is fake, scammy, or straight up illegal, such as gambling or unproven and untested products. This means that it's very easy for youtubers to create hype or drive people to buying things or investing in things that are straight up falsehoods and could cost them a lot of money - see the multitude of crypto scams.	0.808

It may not be true in all cases, but I'd say a significant number of times the presumption of potential offspring plays a **subconscious** role in the development of a heterosexual relationship. When my wife and I were struggling to conceive, and the thought it would never work set in, I had this deep-seated automatic depression set in. We eventually succeeded and it went away immediately. I don't think people are actively saying “I could never date someone who was infertile!” — rather that there is a strong biological factor at play. And while it's true that usually those subjects are left until later (or that the infertility is unknown at the time), it's rare enough that most people feel comfortable rolling the dice; whereas it's immediately a given for trans women.	0.869
Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.   To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	And	0.974
Only Yanks could make someone like that out to be a hero.	<p>As said that&#39;s the difference between good and bad comedians, a good comedian would look at the absurdity of the situation and present insights, solutions, ideas and whatnot in a humorous way and a bad one would just crack jokes with that theme.

Elon Musk sold off a lot of Tesla stock in the days before Tesla recalled nearly a half million cars. If that’s not the hallmark of a hero, I don’t know what is.   Edit: *insider trading* autocorrected to *a hero*	There isn't a single minority that hasn't felt the bigotry of low expectations and it generally isn't a concept associated with 'conservatives'.  It's generally a concept associated with those who believe they are being sympathetic,  but they aren't, they are just infantalizing groups of people because ""Oh they can't handle a team named ""Indians"" (especially considering the origins of most of these teams was not negative in context in the first place and never was).	0.829
HERO?!?  WAYYY Closer to conman than hero..  1) Hyperloop will NOT and CANNOT exist until new materials are created and more efficient ways to generate vaccums exist, this entire concept is bullshit.  2) Fully Automated cars..

Shoulda been jail time for this one  4) People traveling on earth by rocket ship... GTFO, you have to be a moron to believe this one  5) He didn't found tesla, he paid for the right to say he founded tesla  6) He got fired from leading paypal, only got the huge payout when someone else took over and turned it around  7) Flying Tesla cars?  Electric Diesel Semis that are cheaper than Rail?  Tesla Automated Taxis that can earn people 30k a year?  8) StarLink?  A system that needs 10k sattelites that have to be replaced every 5 years?  9) Even SpaceX, was built on the idea of being able to launch a rocket, recover it and launch it again in 24 hours, the fastest turn around so far that I can find is 27 days.  The reason his taxes are so high this year is because he is dumping stock like a mad man while his company is so grossly overvalued.  So what if he pays 10 billion in taxes, if he sold 50 billion in stock, thats literal chump change.	<p>How you can miss that is beyond me</p>	0.852

They KNOW HOW TO USE THEIR WEALTH. Those who don't, lose it. And that's why handouts don't work, because it does not change spending habits. It can help some people, but the ratio of people who will actually use the money properly to those who don't would be too small.	0.895

He’s a piece of shit	Imagine a world in which all women have the male sex (e.g. broad shoulders, penis, flat chest) and all men have the female sex. Everything else is identical. Would there be women (in a similar position to you) who identify as women, were born with the ""female"" sex (= a penis), but feel dysphoria to have the male sex (but still want to be a woman)? In order to answer that, let's reverse it to how things are today: Are there people who identify fully as male and want to express themselves in a fully masculine way, while experiencing physical dysphoria and want to have a vagina? I've never heard of such a person in my life. I'm sure they exist, but they are much, much, much rarer than trans people. Sure, you might find AMAB enbies who want a vaginoplasty but tend to dress in a masc way, but male-identified? There are tons of people who want to swap sexes for a day to see what it's like, some might even seriously wish they had the opposite genitalia, but to the point of genital dysphoria?	0.875
You know you are wrong when you call someone hero for stacking money ripping off pennies from middle-lower classes 🙂	It's not much of a liability.

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was “you’re old and should die” and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he’s going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of “richest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone”	Take the people you mention. Calling people out as -phobic for not being with certain type of people is probably not their whole rhetoric. Now, I don’t know what the rest of it is but I’m willing to bet it’s generally more acceptable than the other points of incel rhetoric.	0.883
It’s always so funny when someone takes the most productive human on the planet and tries to poke holes in them. What an ugly side of human nature.	And that's a big one. A shocking amount of people are practically illiterate well into their adulthood and can't get through a basic legal document if their life depended on it. Or don't read books, because it ""seems tedious"". As silly and basic as it sounds, the ability to write in cursive is consistently linked with higher literacy rates which people are going to really appreciate when you start putting your signatures on things.	0.837
Not CYV - Musk is human garbage. You’re right.	Some people ride this thought train to the end and they come to the conclusion that the way to fix this is to restore women to their ""place"". But that's evil and probably not possible since you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Another option is to consider that the masculine/feminine dichotomy was fucking stupid in the first place. Strength, loyalty, hard work, kindness, and leadership are *human* virtues.  Nurturing, grace, diplomacy, emotional intelligence, and communication skills are *human* virtues. Being a good father, partner, husband means chopping the (metaphorical) wood, carrying the water, kissing the boo-boos, and making the dinner. It's a big, complicated world and everyone needs to be able to do the work now. Getting men to reclaim virtues seen as feminine isn't a bad thing, it is reclaiming space to be a fully articulated human. Trying to restrict men to the masculine role is what's causing all the bullshit problems you identify. Being afraid to embody the entire human spectrum, to be competitive and loving, to be respectful and sexual, to care for your home and to kill it at work, is what is fucking everyone up. Trying to avoid being ""feminine"" just pushes men onto an ever-dissolving iceberg of safely masculine ideals and gives them a narrower and narrower range of ways to be. I don't want men to be feminine, I want men to be human.	0.829
https://youtu.be/Dkix4UzEbjU   🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️	And I’ve done a bit of reading on curse words and the benefits and it was quite fun to learn about.

I know if you hurt yourself and you use curse words in response it actually takes your kind away from the pain and helps. And also, the fact that it helps convey the emotions you’re feeling.

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.

From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	There isn't a single demographic on Earth that could be spared from this sentence."	0.86
if someone called me a cracker id laugh in their face.  this is so dumb.  if you’re offended by “cracker” you’re probably a racist.	I asked if there was more to it because my claim was that scientists were not being fired or blackballed for presenting valid but controversial study results; and the actions of a (student?) are irrelevant to that claim. I’m sure it was a harrowing experience, and I’m not taking away from it sofar as his trauma is concerned, only whether or not it constitutes systemic/institutional “silencing” of scientists who oppose “the narrative”"	0.848
great argument.	<p>Yes it is, if the opinion caused the person to take action. If I lie and say a person is the antichrist and needs to be stopped at all cost, and then some religious nut goes and kills that person I would be, objectively, partially to blame for that persons death. </p>	0.851
I think that the people who are offended by the use of the word cracker are frail. But the word cracker is self-evidently a racial slur. And if a service is banning people for the use of racial slurs, then a person should be banned for using the word cracker.   I see no ideological framework where the use of the word cracker is acceptable whereas the use of other racial slurs are not.	Except that isn't even true.	0.961

> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	<p>Im going with its part of American psychosis and delusion.

'Crackers' were Scottish people who settled down in the Southeast United States. They were seen as poor and low class, even as someone a black slave could look down on.  'Cracker' is a racist slur.	Infections are the most philosophical illness. Our bodies are host to billions of organisms. Some coexisting, living off our detritus and plucking back some of our entropy that way. Many, the ones we call pathogens, have the capacity to evade our front line of defense and make us sick. Mostly we fight these off, but sometimes we don't. There are chemicals which kill these, but not us. They might harm us, and they certainly harm the other organisms on our body, but on balance, if we kill them (by the immune system or antibiotics) we survive.	0.867

>The oldest attested -phobia compound of these kinds in any language is hydrophobia, attested in the Latin works of [Celsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus).

We can trace terms back to the boundary of written language, beyond which linguists develop hypothetical proto-languages as models of the sort of next stage back that might have existed but was never written.

Now I still work and do dishes and laundry and I love it. Now his next girlfriend supports him and idgaf.	The simple fact is that when kids go to school, they do so for many hours at a time and the job of the stay-at-home-mom is much simpler. Obviously that isn't true during a pandemic when distance learning challenges every parent. But I remember being in high school especially from 8 in the morning to 10 at night sometimes. What exactly would a stay at home mother would be doing then? I had very little supervision growing up, in fact. My mother fed me and made sure I had the money to be clothed and that there was always electricity and shelter. A typical suburban middle class upbringing. But as soon as I learned to drive at 15 years old, I was a lot more independent. The last time my mother helped me with schoolwork, I was 9 and was learning my multiplication tables. She never helped me with a single assignment since then. I did every single reading assigned to me in junior high school, elementary school, and high school. I was responsible for my own schoolwork. If my mom had been a stay at home mom, pray tell what was she doing all the hours I was busy taking care of my own homework and going to school?	0.91
Ahh, I see you have the I'm right and you're wrong mindset.... Very Devine of you oh great one.   Read my post and you will see that's exactly who I was talking about.

Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options.

That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	Likewise, as harmless as ""white people can't handle spice and only eat white bread"" may seem, if you where to flip it and say ""black people sure like their spicy chicken"", people may take offense to the latter statement and some may even call it racist.

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.

>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having racial biases can and do exist but making it illegal to make laws that discriminate did end systematic racism. Now a system showing racial bias can exist but that is a separate concept even if that concept is called systematic racism. The CRT use of systematic racism simply reflects that there is a correlation of race and outcome. The reasons for this are not part of the CRT evaluation bc CRT assumes it's bc of racism and not factors such as individual choice. Point is it is illegal for any system to discriminate racially so the system is actively against racism. Society also completely demonizes anyone who judges people based on race so society itself is actively against racism. What system with any power is actively FOR racism as in encouraging people to discriminate based on race? Literally the only systems pushing for racism is the democrats, the CRT praxis supporters, and the neo Nazis/white supremacists.   >The system is like a vehicle. Ask yourself who's driving it. Historically its the white male elite.  So all white males are intrinsically racist and think exactly alike? Or do you mean that minorities are so different to white males that they cannot compete in the same meritocracy? Either way that's a really racist statement.   >And it is still based on merit, although I don't think we are living in this ideal meritocracy you think we do, it's just merit that would've been passed up on because they have a black name.  You literally are more likely to get into college, get promoted, or get hired with a black name. Being white is literally detrimental to your career in today's society. A white person would need to score 150 points higher on the SATs than a non Asian minority and Asians would need to score 200+ higher. This discrimination you state just doesn't exist in reality, it's a false narrative based on outcomes not on actions.   >Affirmative action notwithstanding because I agree with that policy and see the merit in it.  Sure but it's still racist policy regardless if you see the merit in it.   >From the right it happens that its a kind of fearmongering to white nationalists that's been going on a while.  I wasn't aware the 1300 white nationalists in the states (the prison gangs can't vote) was such a big lobby. As far as fearnongering goes, when policy literally discriminates against white people is it fear mongering or just calling out unconstitutional racial discrimination?  >Charles Darwin was no genius, neither was Einstein. They were specialized in their field and at the right place at the right time. Their work benefited greatly from names you've never heard of.   They literally had 150+ IQs. To claim they weren't genius level intellects is complete idiocy. That's literally the dumbest statement I've ever heard. Everyone's work benefitted from other people and that in no way invalidates genius. I'm really struggling to justify even responding to someone idiotic enough to think this bc it shows your complete ignorance to not only basic complexity but also the complete lack of understanding the difference in ability. Oh yea anyone could come up with relativity or evolution it's no big deal. E=mc2 is a simple equation if you don't understand the gravity of what it actually means. Pun intended.   >The only problem with that sentiment is that we've built our systems in a way that makes each person a cost to their environment. It doesn't have to be that way.  You have established you know nothing about systems so your opinion is useless.   >Also, right libertarianism is just the hunger games, and the IO games we have today.  The hunger games had an authoritarian government that killed dissenters so no that's facism or authoritarian left bc they redistributed wealth...mainly to capital city bc that's what the authoritarian redistribution system traditionally does.   >And without physical violence or professional gatekeeping at play, people would be invested in maintaining that central structure because it's based on finding and distributing knowledge everyone can use to make their lives better, rather than an imaginary fear of the other that demands you give up your rights for your own good.  Dumbest statement ever. I'm a libertarian. I'm for individual rights even if they counteract the will of the majority. So your whole system required that humankind be reasonable, rational, selfless, and put the benefit of others over themselves to work? That's your system? That's retarded. That has never worked and will never work bc that is not humanity. What kind of privileged upbringing did you have to think that is in any way not complete idiocy? Your whole system requires perfect people or else it fails so it will fail and then the people will authorize force to save it from failure which is exactly what happens in every attempt at socialism. You can't redesign humanity, you have to redesign a system to work with the reality of humanity aka humans are greedy so base a system on that aka capitalism.    I'd love to continue this but you want to preach not have your mind changed. That's fine but the more I hear the more idiotic and clueless you sound. Half the stuff you say is in direct opposition to the other half. It's completely obvious you have zero real world experience and read a few socialist books and think you understand the world and all it's problems when literally you just succumbed to propaganda. I hate resorting to name calling but the level of both ignorance, hubris, and confirmation bias in your rational is mind blowing. I like libertarianism but I am aware of it's flaws. I am not ignorant enough to think it is perfect, I simply think that the cost benefit analysis for it is better than other systems. You, on the other hand, think your system is flawless even though your system requires human perfection to be realized. I can only hope that you can scrape together enough sanity to understand the gravity of that analysis. Quite frankly you are also a racist and an advocate of systematic racism but in complete denial of that fact. Sorry but not sorry.	<p>I’ll ignore the disingenuous nonsense of suggesting this translates to child rape and murder (quite the leap), but I don’t believe that having to find new employment is a comparable consequence to judicial prosecution.

No matter how hard we try to call racism bad, it has been baked into the very foundation of western society. Just ignoring it would not remove it from those systems.

So you had a car, which many people don’t have. Thanks for agreeing with my point.

As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.

Racism refers to a preconceived notion specifically about people based on their race.   OPPRESSION is power + prejudice. Racism just means you believe people are inferior based on race.

To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments.

I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different	When I played pretend games as a kid, I would always play as a gender neutral character if I could, and I often found myself wanting to play roles like ""dad"" or ""son"" while playing house. I often felt embarrassed by this want, so I rotated between ""dog"" and ""dad"" (the latter, I'd say ""because we don't have one already!"").

You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	You keep repeating that but you don't actually source the number of attacks.

Throw in some obesity and personality disorders and you get me!	But neither of these issues actually justify over-taxing every foreign competitors. It's possible to punish and refuse to work with slavers and polluters without sacrificing fair and regulated trade with other countries. The argument will always come back to ""it protects domestic jobs/industries"", but as you've already admitted, that comes at the cost of making us all significantly poorer (except for the owners of domestic corporations). That certainly doesn't give us a ""better chance at developing"", in fact is leaves us with less options and less resources to develop."	0.817
If you eliminate rental properties, then demand for decent property to own would go WAY up. Then home prices would skyrocket along with the number of trailer parks.  That's how economics works. Landlords make it possible for young people with limited resources to have a safe place to live.  I rented for 16 years before buying a house.	I'm saying that when an individual has a problem that is individual to them, unique to their experience or in this context not common enough to be of concern to society at large, the question of ""who's responsibility is it?"" loses meaning. There is no responsibility. It's not reasonable to expect society to accommodate every possible individual and it's not reasonable to expect every individual to fit within society. It's unfortunate when someone feels apart from their peers but it does happen. That's life, unfortunate circumstances do occur and their existence does not mandate a response 100% of the time nor does it always mandate a particular response when a response is necessary. Society is made up of a conglomeration of people who all by virtue of their proximity have developed a shared expectation of experience and that creates a framework for them to interpret their experiences. There will be people and experiences that do not conform to this framework. That is to be expected. The reaction to those situations is often negative because it is often the case that people and things that do not conform to the framework represent a danger to the framework it self. The same ""sense"" that tells you not to be friends with the person who makes you uncomfortable or tells you not to trust someone because of their demeanor is the same sense that causes you to be uncomfortable in uncommon or unfamiliar situations and that is useful because it causes you to avoid being in those situations because they are potentially dangerous. This is why society has an idea of what ""normal"" is and why abnormality is so often poorly tolerated. This is healthy societal behavior. This is ultimately good for societies and it helps them survive.	0.859

They can spend billions of dollars lobbying for legislation that will save them billions of more dollars and/or legislation that will let them continue shady business practices, like pollution (which will in turn cost billions of not trillions to mitigate).</p>	0.858

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids.

I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.	<p>cited <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/washington-dc-protests"">NYT</a></p>	0.871

Anecdote time!  I worked at Fuddruckers for like 6 or 7 years. For those of you who don't know, this is a burger joint just above a typical fast food restaurant, but not even as "fancy" as an outback steakhouse. It's like a lower mid range burger chain, but the food was actually good for what it was.   Anyways.   Because this place had a small arcade, claw games, and was a common location for parties, this made parents believe that they could just let their little bundle of shit run around like they own the place. Kids literally screaming at the top of their lungs while running between guests and tables not even associated with the kids. Can't tell you how many times I dome checked kids while bussing tables. They ran in my direction while not paying attention, and I stood my ground. Nothing could be done about it, oh well. I'd ask these little shit constantly to stop running around, but I'm not their fucking parent and I didn't get paid enough to care beyond that.  I understand VERY WELL that parents need a break, but not at the expense of random people I don't know.	<p>There is no real medical justification.</p>	0.805

I have maxed DL, and to reveal my bias here I was an Olympic style lifter all through HS. I found that sensation of your body tearing apart at the when doing most any max, but nothing quite compared to the bottom of a clean during a tournament winning C&J.  For HS Football, the coaches loved the traditional power lifting lifts (BS, Bench, DL) and they always seemed static, slow twitch and boring to me.  With the olympic style coach, we would do straight leg DLs, or Romanian DLs, where the idea was to actually improve your overall lifting ability by adding flexibility to the strength.  I do see what you’re saying overall though, but maybe this was a poor choice of CMV for me because my view is mostly unchanged.  Yes, I get that a heavy DL is a pure expression of the ability to move the most possible weight, how ever short the eventual distance.  But that still just seems boring overall to me.

What is this...?	And that culture of violence goes from the smallest level (individual acts of violence being glorified) to the largest level.  In terms of foreign policy, the American state has a tendency to choose violence over peaceful means to achieve its goals, and often only the former is really seen as ""real"" action, both by policymakers and by the general public. In terms of public perception and media coverage of leaders, the willingness to use violence is seen as the mark of a ""serious"" leader; killing people is an important part of being president, and a good way to generate positive media coverage and to be taken seriously. Conversely, reticence to use violence is seen as being a pushover, a mark of ""inaction"" etc. This is even true where non-violent means would have better outcomes than violent ones, or where the violence isn't really in pursuit of any real goals at all; violence is so glorified that it's its own justification, it's a noble ends in itself.

Please come back after you pass your third year philosophy classes.	It's a real and well documented problem.	0.814
I would actually like to add that even the free will argument is invalid. Suppose humans do have "free will" and that's why god doesn't intervene to stop things like genocide. First of all, that's still a shitty argument. Why not just program humans to not want to commit genocide? But more importantly, God clearly has no problem taking away free will from humans, or, creating ones that don't have any.   Think about people with mental illnesses, people who have brain injury, psychopaths etc. They all lack free will. Many of them were born that way or have had things happen to them that were completely out of their control. So God has no problem taking away free will from people when it's a tragic incident happening to them, but, when he would actually need to intervene with something like genocide or rape or murder, his followers conveniently claim that he can't, because then he would be removing free will.   Fact is, there is no way to apply the word "good" to God, because our definition of good doesn't include viruses, diseases, cancer and natural disasters.   The only thing a religious person can say is that we will find out when we die, which again, how convenient and also, how pathetic. Imagine believing your entire life that suffering is okay on earth because once you die you'll find out why it happened.	<p>Because I never used word lie or profit. Do you see what you have quoted me saying. In the next post I clarified what I ment by media portrayal. Profit is one component of the problem, but for some media it is not even true.

To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.  An "all powerful" God would have the power to keep people from unnecessary suffering, and yet millions of children still die per year needlessly, and Earth itself is on a massive decline that God isn't helping with in any way. Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	<p>Secondly, about goodness in the Christian context. I&#39;m not an expert on theology, but generally in the Christian context, doing good things is done out of love for a person and/or God. As someone has said below, Christians generally don&#39;t believe that you can earn your salvation. Salvation is given freely through grace, and not works (where works refers to good things). Essentially, this is fundamentally different from the idea of karma. Karma postulates that you can &quot;earn&quot; a higher status in your next life through doing good things, and if the net good outweighs the net bad, then you have positive karma and that merits you a certain reward. Christianity is different in that no matter how much good you do, you <strong>cannot</strong> earn your salvation or a place in heaven. You can <strong>only</strong> gain it through believing in Jesus - hence no matter how much good works you do, you can&#39;t get a place in heaven without believing in Jesus.</p>	0.84

Now, they are obviously both less healthy on average than a thin person who exercises regularly, and there are other reasons besides health to want to lose weight, but the idea that no obese person is healthy is absolutely bananas.

At least that's how my former liberal friends screamsplained it at me when I made tacos for my superbowl party.	I tend to find petite women more attractive. To me, they tend to be more aesthetically pleasing, and I subconsciously view smaller women as being cuter; someone I could cuddle up with or protect. If I see a man that is ""petite"" or smaller than most men, I am neither consciously not subconsciously attracted to them. There is no aesthetically pleasing response for me. There is desire to cuddle with or protect them. The sensation is holistically different. The features I find *attractive* just don't translate for me.	0.863

No matter how hard we try to call racism bad, it has been baked into the very foundation of western society. Just ignoring it would not remove it from those systems.

I am going to amend it slightly to fit the conventions of the argument, as there's no point in talking about an argument nobody is really making. The argument, in essence, is that it's impossible to be racist against white people because racism has a societal and institutional component. If a person's prejudices (which are still possible under this line of thinking) are not institutionally backed and enforced, then it is not racism. It's kind of an academic argument, one I don't think is especially well suited for politics, but it makes sense in the world of finicky definitions and hairsplitting that is academia. It's an attempt to distinguish prejudices that have some social and political power behind them from generic prejudice, so to speak. It is a valuable distinction in academia because academics who deal in these subjects are often more focused on the complexities of racism and how it manifests at a systemic level. There is theoretically a debate to be had here, but it kind of boils down to ""This framing of racism lets us define a wider range of behaviors and more easily dig into the complexity."" versus ""This framing of racism is wrong because any form of prejudice based on race is racist.""	0.848

The left tends to ignore that the minimum wage is ultimately a price floor for labor and above some point increasing the minimum wage is no longer (economic) welfare improving.

Dude what the hell are you talking about? I haven't attributed any quote to you.	<p>However, I would honestly disagree with the notion here that science <em>can’t</em> be a community. I know academia likes to pretend otherwise, however the reality is when you get a Oxford graduate card that is little more than access to a church with a membership card plan! They do like 90% the same thing: both churches and fancy scientific dinners are places of learning; both are places to catch up with friends and share gossip; both have (let’s be real here) quasi-deified leaders, such as priests or anyone who has “Dr.” in front of their name, who are perceived as only able to speak truth etc. I don’t feel like I’m being very convincing, but seriously, religion and science have a ton in common. </p>	0.838

👋	<p>There are so many reasons people may avoid meat. They&#39;re not necessarily all logical or good reasons, but so long as meat-eating isn&#39;t compulsory, it doesn&#39;t really matter. Lab grown meat may help some of those people, but I don&#39;t really understand your point. What kind of argument are you looking for? Nobody is going to claim that no vegan on earth will eat lab-grown meat, as it&#39;s impossible to prove (and possibly even wrong, as some vegans may eat it).</p>	0.877
As an apologist I appreciate your sentiment. Naturally I whole heartedly agree	No argument here. I mean, some hunters hunt just for meat or the general sport (not the trophy), but hunting for meat also means preferring larger animals (hunters are usually limited in how many animals they can harvest, and tags aren't cheap, so there's reason to be picky, but you are taking a gamble turning down a kill).  I know fishing is undergoing some reworking specifically about this. The status quo is you can only harvest X fish above Y length/weight or whatever. This is a proxy for age, which is basically a proxy for ""has this fish bred yet"" so we don't accidentally drive the whole species to extinction. Turns out, that puts massive evolutionary pressure for smaller fish sizes, and now wild fish grow smaller. The new proposals (and I think in some places, actual practice) is you can harvest X fish in range A, Y fish in range B, Z fish in range C, etc. Maybe something similar can be applied to hunting, but I'm not sure how. You can catch a fish without killing it. Good luck doing that with a deer.	0.879

Humans have been hunting animals for 2 million years. If a wolf caught and ate a deer, I wouldn’t think that the deer’s life ended prematurely, it just ended. There is no pre-determined age the deer has to reach before dying. Maybe it’s early if you look at an average, but that’s why it’s an average and not a fixed age. I take issue with your assumption that if a deer is killed than that it has died early. I don’t think there is guaranteed amount of time for any living thing.

We should be working to rehabilitate people with mental health issues, not just let them pull the plug because their mind is deceiving them into thinking life is not worth living.  Depression is different in a way because it can turn your mind against you.  Tell you that life isn&#39;t worth living, etc. but that doesn&#39;t mean that life can&#39;t go on.  And by providing that option you are letting people pick a path that is ultimately bad for them.

CMV: the Patriot Act should be expanded to include penalties for using “it’s” to mean “its”.	Someone with violent tendencies will obviously be drawn to action-packed video games with lots of gore and fighting, but what that means is that the game itself didn't cause them to be that way. At best, it - like I previously said - only pushed them from inaction to action. I think very few people disagree that video games, just like any medium, CAN influence people both positively and negatively, but the defense of video games is only as big as it is simply because it's proportunate to the criticism. That happens with every new piece of media, it's not something that only video games have gone through."	0.849
Anarcho capitalism is a fundamentally unworkable system. It would at best lead to fuedalism and at worst lead to some sort of plutocratic anarchy hellscape. We've seen the US's original government being scrapped in favor of the current one because it's failure to raise unified forces and others protections offered by tax revenue of the government. The US got libertarianism instead until the 1920s, which is a life version of Anarcho capitalism which failed because even the lite version, libertarianism, is unsustainable due to the fact that people are selfish. However, radical idealists will suspend belief and willfully overlook the fallacies to claim that anything short of mixture of ideas is truly workable.	But it's important to recognize how these identities haved form as a matter of protecting oneself and past harmful practices of prejudice. If society targets you because they simply perceive you as a member of a group, it doesn't matter your own association, you'll start to feel defined by that label and find it unescapable. And thus, people just buy into the label, but then hope to change in any way they can. It's a logical attempt at a defense, *given*, that others are using such a label upon you.	0.903
based	<p>Is appealing to different races the same as racial discrimination? </p>	0.851
100% agree	<p>Your stance assumes that only nurture, not nature, is involved in development. If any nature was involved, this would debunk the idea that individuals have no effect on their development or choices. All animals have instincts that they are born with, humans are no different. Slight differences in the way he handle things we perceive would lead us to question things in different ways. It’s hard to prove any of this, but one example would be how humans are born with empathy, if we see someone or something in pain we feel bad, and this seems more like nature to me than nurture. Some people are born without this. A person born without empathy would be great at being Hitler, while someone who is very empathetic, experiencing everything Hitler experienced would probably run a different course.</p>	0.787

Yikes	With all vaccines you can still catch if you’ve been vaccinated, it’s just less severe and your body kicks the infection much more quickly. Variants arise in unvaccinated people because they take much longer to fight the virus, giving it time to mutate in their body. Unvaccinated people also have much higher viral loads when infected, meaning that they can spread it to many more people. Most vaccinated people who catch Covid caught it from an unvaccinated person and don’t spread it to anyone (and this is true for all other vaccines that I’ve read about).

Yeah, it’s super great for children to have a mass shooter as a parent	1) Playing instruments is generally far, far less accessible and far, far more gatekept than producing. This means that more people who are just getting into music have more access to production than they do traditional instruments (and often more interest). In this sense, it does take less skill - none, even - to become a producer. You don't have to win the rat race just to get your foot in the door, at least as much. You don't need lessons, parents with a lot of money, etc. Obviously these things help and people with more resources will always be favored, even in production - but it takes less skill to get started, in the sense that you don't have to be a ""natural."" For example: many middle school band programs in the U.S. require you to pass a test to sign up to start beginning percussion, because it tends to be the most popular instrument, at least around where I grew up. You have to have some in-built understanding of rhythm and coordination to start in many cases, even though not having that absolutely does not limit your ability to be a great percussionist in meaningful way. But anyone with access to a computer (and even a smartphone, these days) can generally get their hands on a free or pirated DAW and start producing, even if it is totally unintuitive to them.	0.878

Yeah, I bet you didn’t.	Now stimulus checks don't actually do anything besides give free money. They are extremely poorly targeted and most people who have received the covid checks have not needed the money. In general you'd be better off spending more on enhanced unemployment benefits, healthcare, food, and housing. Comparatively some debt forgiveness is good because a lot of people are really deeply indebted which can weigh them down for years. I agree a huge issue with these large forgiveness plans is the doctor, lawyer, mba debt. It's kind of ridiculous when these folks complain about their 100k+ debt expecting the government to pay. However average undergraduate debt is over 30k and there are millions of people with college debt who never graduated and have no way to pay their debt.

The DSM-V disagrees with you. Which is to say facts disagree with you. Sorry that you are more interesting in continuing to be engage with your bigotry than the clinical consensus.	Ultimately, yes, it is a statistical reality that black people are more likely to have lower incomes, have less access to quality education, and more likely to be overpoliced. However, saying things like ""It's not that I have an issue with black people, I just want to go to a better school,"" is racist. It is due to **systemic racism** that black neighborhoods are less likely to have quality public schools. Using the racial demographic of a neighborhood to gauge the quality of education is implying that is it due to **black people** that schools are not as high quality...when in reality, it is due to systemic inequity.	0.875
I knew you'd be one of those "but muh DSM 5, gotcha!!" types. You probably don't even know what the DSM-5 is past what you've read in the Wikipedia intro.

Regardless, I would love to see you explain how it's any different for a man to call himself a woman versus calling himself a duck. Both are obviously factually false, and easily disprovable scientifically. If you can offer literally anything I will applaud you. Please humor me.

Losing gracefully is a skill you've let to learn I see.	My children are not allowed to stay at their cousins house and here is why: their cousins age from 14,12,10,5,2. They live in town the older boys 12-10 have random boys in and out of their house all day. Do I want to put my 8 year daughter in a position where she could be touched by one of these kids I do not know? Not going to risk that, so no sleepovers at her cousins. The boys are also known for watching porn do I want to risk them exposing that to my kids? I learned about it at a very early age 6 to be exact and it has fucked me up in all kinds of ways. I actually do not let my children stay with anyone but my parents or my husbands parents simply because I don’t really know/trust people. It takes ONE time, ONE TIME, for something to happen that could ruin the innocence of my children. If that labels me as an abuse helicopter parent so be it. I’m going to go ahead and hover alittle more and say I homeschool my children to. I don’t trust this world, it scares me, I have horrible anxiety. But the main reason I homeschool is because I worked in a school and have seen first hand how stressful and what a toll it takes on kids.  it takes me an hour to school each kid on each subject and then they can have the rest of the day to play and be a freaking kid. Let me tell you something, I have the happiest kids. They are very active and do not lack the social structure they have 23 cousins, they do extracurricular activities like horse riding lessons, dance camps, gymnastics, jujitsu. It’s my job as a mother to protect them, it’s instinctual just like most mothers in the animal kingdom. One day when my children are old enough to protect themselves yes I will let them go over to friends houses and if they want to go to school I’ll let them. But right now they are little and no one is fit enough (in my eyes) to protect them like I can."	0.822

Ok	When I was in this environment, I didn’t understand why people judged the pro life movement. Now, looking at the issue as a whole, I understand it. Many socially conservative men, particularly politicians, are judgmental, controlling, misogynistic pieces of shit, and their disagreement with abortion isn’t even about the science of fetal development - it’s about shaming women for owning their sexuality. Given the religion I grew up in, I received an overwhelming amount of this kind of judgment. I actually just escaped my extremely controlling & physically abusive father a little over a year ago. I’m now a stripper, and it makes me feel empowered that I’m using my sexuality to be financially independent, live a modest, but comfortable lifestyle, and pay for my college education.	0.874

Timely.	I'd recommend reading the Wikipedia page on affirmative action (especially in the part about the US, if that's what you're thinking about) before coming back and responding to any further posts here. While using 'different standards' (aka looking at the applicant as a whole, and not just at test scores that are always going to have some degree of bias) is one type of AA that has been implemented, there are many other ways that AA is implemented, including additional outreach to groups that have historically been at a disadvantage. There are plenty of other methods as well, but this one is the clear example of how AA isn't just 'let in kids that don't have the same test scores because their skin color is different'."	0.827

All I know is my Raiders were 4-0 in OT games this year, so I say leave it lol.	<p>Parents have responsibilities to children, correct. However, biological relation is not enough by itself to be a “parent”. Sperm donors are not legal parents. Egg donors are not legal parents. In my opinion, what constitutes a parental relationship is that person assuming the role. I think that there needs to be a way for either biological parent to opt out if they want, but only before or at birth. If they assume the parental role and claim parental rights for even an hour after birth, then there’s no backing out of it. If they do not claim their rights, then they are surrendered permanently and all legal ties are null. </p>	0.849
There are some bad takes on this thread, surprisingly.	>Do you believe the power of these words will just go away if people stop giving them power? As you've indicated in a different comment thread, while you may not be bothered by specific words you are bothered by the sentiment behind them. The words you're referring to are vehicles for disgusting sentiments and some have historically been used for subjugation. Take away those vehicles and that's one less effective avenue intolerant people have for communicating those sentiments or subjugating others. That's the goal. It won't stop intolerant people necessarily, so folks will still need to learn to resist intolerance, but that's still one less avenue for propagating intolerance.	0.876

> It's *your* side that doesn't give any sort of clear answer, no characteristics for what makes someone a "man" or a "woman."  Yea, that's the fucking point you idiot.  Society has strictly dictated for millenia that men act this way and do this and women act that way and do that. When since time began we've all just been people doing our own damn shit and all your idiotic comments about the biological argument are 1. Cringe. 2. Irrelevant to a conversation about gender. And 3. Largely wrong lmao. You fail to recognize the middle ground that exists between male and female sex because you can **only** imagine a binary of male and female.  There aren't clear characteristics for what makes a man or a woman, that's the entirety of the point. When you have single moms who are the metaphoric father with a firm hand and you have stay at home dads who take care of the kids all day, your gender norms are fucked to death and left bleeding in a ditch but you idiots **SCREAM** about how this doesn't make sense! There are men! And women! And if you're trans you're really just a man who's confused! Showing how horribly and willfully blind you are to the calm reality of people living their lives without being bound to the strict ideals of male and female concepts which itself is fluid and cultural. Women went from flower-print stay at home moms to Rosie the riveter during the war because the public perception **needed** to change for the good of the country. So women wouldn't be shamed for working and because there was a shortage of labor.  No one can give a definition of what it means to be a man or a woman because that's an individualistic thing. I can say what being a man is to me but another man would disagree, claiming it's the polar opposite concepts that make him a man, and those reasons are just as valid.  The host, and argumentative individuals like yourself, are trying to box us into a strict definition so they can argue those definitions from a logical/scientific place, they don't actually have any interest in what these people think a woman is, they just want them to define it so they can argue against them with the full spectrum of hypocrisy and contradiction. "Oh? A woman is delicate? Well 'x' was a woman who stood up for her values and took charge, I'd say that was womanly of her, and not delicate, don't you think!?" For infinity.  But no natural woman or man, etc. Can say what makes one that thing. This has been debated by those within the rigid gender form for millenia as well. Hemingway and Wilde contributed on opposing ends of what makes a man, delicacy or vigor, etc. No one can say, so it's a stupid fucking question to try to pin on them and then say "haha, you can't even define what makes you that in a fashion everyone agrees with which NO ONE has been able to do! Time to invalidate your sense of identity!"  Every single argument with trans people and trans identity is just a rehash of the arguer not recognizing their identity and trying to find logical/mathematic/scientific basis for doing so that they can then hold up and say "see? I wasn't really a bigot, it's just science." And to eeeeeveryone who is with the shit you literally just sound like old school doctors who "proved race is genetic and that there is a hierarchy of species based on these clearly identifiable traits, see you have big lips so you must be inferior." "See, you can't define a woman so you must be a man."  "See you don't have x so you aren't equal to others" is the fundamental ideological basis. You're equivalent to racists in this regard.  Get, the fuck, over it.  There isn't a logical or mathematic or scientific or whatever basis for gender because it is a mental construct created by those within the culture. Recognizing the same genders as indigenous tribes have is a pretty low fucking bar and none of you elitist academic types can bend your bricked out brains around that one and it would (really) be so goddamn funny (genuinely) if it wasn't so horrifically exhausting and depressing to be invalidated for who you are, every single day, because idiots like you can't just let shit be that you don't understand. And you set standards which we have no interest or benefit in following then condemn us for not following them. Eat shit dude.	A family with children shouldn't be eating fast food, I think we'd agree there. But the fact is many will, and you know a low income family isn't just going to throw their food in the trash to try to look for an alternative after looking at these disgusting labels.

I had to teach myself algebra out of a pamphlet to pass the Math portion.  Math has rules that need explaining, therefore, I can't teach it to myself without proper materials.	0.852
I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	<p>I guess yeah, simply including it as a class in school could probably end up making it just another lecture that kids can ignore, effectively and possibly defeating the purpose of the whole thing.

the fuck.... you are on drugs	Picking up some quick sandwiches or burgers for the family is supposed to be ‘cheap’. Faster & easier than cooking but not as expensive as dining in. That was one of the biggest selling points of take out food & counter serve restaurants (where you order at the cashier and go sit down). The idea was that you’re skipping the server. You walk up, order your own food, and find your own seat, clean up after yourself, etc. they call your number and you go grab it. Or maybe they bring it to you. Who are you tipping in this case? Why aren’t they getting paid enough to not need tips? Why is the customer eating that burden?	0.847

Since Christianity became one of the dominant religions, it’s been used as an excuse for some truly monstrous actions, including several that go directly against what’s presented as a doctrine of compassion.

In my view, the lack of transparency is a market failure of sorts and the value of making that public far outweighs the cost to the companies. I am a libertarian, but I value consumer information and support regulations to that effect - there is a way to provide information on how what’s being shown to you is being filtered/sorted without giving away the actual code.</p>	0.876

>The only side driving children to suicide is yours.  If you believe gender dysphoric people have higher rates of suicide then you should agree increasing the number of people with gender dysphoria increases suicides.   Normalization and encouragement of children questioning their sex will increase suicides.  &#x200B;  >if people spent less time telling them they're attention seeking, pervert, liars they wouldn't have so much self loathing  The self-loathing is primarily from their physical body not matching their desires; no one says anything to them, people are too afraid to be shamed, judged, and fired.   Evidence that it is more than society causing the suicide rates can be seen by comparing transgender suicide rates to Jews in the Holocaust. The Jews had literally the worst societal impact, yet they had lower suicide rates?  >Nobody is forcing pronouns on you. They're...a part of speech? Do you not know what pronouns are?  Now suddenly no one is forcing them! Be consistent please.  Also, notice how you started insulting me, that is a sign you are experiencing cognitive dissonance, just change your mind and embrace reality to be at ease.  >Also misgendering is harassment, not murder.

I don't have "pronouns in my bio" and last I checked the cops aren't swatting down my door.  There is a social capital in the real world, and since DEI centers are part of companies and schools, if you act according to what the DEI centers support you get social brownie points.

From an entirely value-neutral alien perspective, we might say that realizing that being pretty is what sells, and utilizing it to profit from other people's intellectual labor, is a ""smart"" move in a cutthroat way, but if asked, most people in society would probably intuitively agree, that we shouldn't *actively encourage* that attitude, and that maybe it's time to put a break on our biases that content creators exploit like that.	0.859

Most people are there because of the book, and it's just false advertising. There certainly has to be disclaimers during advertising the movie because that's not what i went to watch. I would say 90 percent of the time the original writer would have a better story, because he came up with the entire universe and it's characters.	0.872

Vaccinated people can still contract and spread covid. There will be a ton of uninformed people in these comments arguing that if you get vaccinated, there’s less of a chance of that. They’re wrong. There are no covid studies that have a legitimate control group, so the results say what they want them to say, “get vaccinated so we can make more money”. The numbers of covid hospitalizations are wildly misrepresented because of the financial benefit hospitals have by coding someone as a covid pt, rather than some dude that was seen in the ER for a broken arm that happened to test positive for covid. Covid deaths are also being misrepresented for the same reason… pt brought in by EMS with a gunshot wound to the head? Covid positive? Yep, you guessed it, covid death. The reality is that covid is not the same virus that it was 2 years ago. The current variant is closer to a regular cold than it was when it was shutting down people’s lung function.

In my 30s, unvaccinated. I just recovered a few days ago after roughly 3 days of actually feeling sick.   I don't intend to vaccinate, and I'm open to having my mind changed, but I see the same talking points over and over, and I still don't see the value. I suppose I'm stuck in my way of thinking that we're all personally responsible for our own health, and that it's not my responsibility to vaccinate because of your grandma. (Ironically, my 80+ y/o, emphysema-diagnosed grandma just recovered from covid)  The talking point I see the most is that it's selfish to not vaccinate because it puts others at risk, but I have an issue with that... I see no reason to believe that I'm less likely to transmit the virus if I'm vaccinated. Based on my current understanding, it spreads by airborne germs and masking/washing my hands frequently is doing *significantly* more to reduce transmission than a vaccine would accomplish. Not to mention, having recovered, I now have antibodies to eradicate any exposure I have in the future.	People with additional mobility needs.	0.683

mate that's because you're suggesting an idiotic thing in "Muhammad isn't idolised".  are you really trying to suggest me that a Jefferson or Gandhi statue is just attacked because people don't like that statue. or is it because people don't like the person whom the statue represent.  and i wasn't talking about metaphorical statues. i was talking about putting someone at a pedestal, idolising someone and to take you word at its face value, I'll have to go against the word of all four schools of Islam that covers all Muslims.   and no shit different things means different to different people. That still doesn't change the fact that Islam declares Muhammad as an ideal man. you're challenging me on my knowledge of Islam but it seems like you know nothing about it.	I think it would be very hard to argue that attempting to save the life of the mother after a fetus was found nonviable is somehow less moral than a convenience abortion, if we derive the morality of either act by weighing the lives of those involved.  In one case the life of the mother is saved and there was no potential on the other end of the scale, while in the other the mother had no established risk and the fetus still had at least the potential to be brought to term.	0.893

Most people dont spend so many hours arguing in bad faith. Find a hobby.	And if you take issue with a God whose love for you does not prioritize minimizing your suffering then... fair enough! I agree actually. But the issue is not God's omniscience - again, the Bible is chalk full of examples where God knows full well people will suffer. And I think if you want to critique religion (which I often do too) you have to be precise in your critique, as these are views people hold dear (and don't want to have challenged). The issue is not in God's  (perfect or imperfect) knowledge, but that his ""love"" for us does not seem to prioritize minimizing suffering."	0.912
I agree w/ you.   There's very few policies which make the offer "you can save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a year and it won't detract from the quality of life a single living person."

> Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns.  This is just whataboutism being used as a red herring. Nobody is talking about mass shootings here. Mass shootings have nothing to do with this discussion. Literally nothing.  >You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.  So let's be real on a few things here. First of all 2.5 million is bonkers-insane-nuts completely unsupported by facts. There are stats put out by individual cities, and from those stats, we know that the real number can't be anywhere close to that high.  But, as a fun fact, the reason why the CDC doesn't have more accurate numbers, is because it's legally forbidden from sponsoring that sort of research, As our Republican institutions and entities that receive public funding. The NRA lobbied hard for a law making it illegal for us to find out how often self-defense happens relative to other gun actions..  I think that speaks pretty clearly to what the numbers would show if we could actually do that research.  Second of all, 60,000 per year is nothing. That's 1 in 6,667.  Considering that there are 48 lotteries in this country each doing multiple drawings daily, that's roughly how many people win the lottery per year.  If that happens to you, yes, you are a statistical unicorn. That's not misleading; that's fact.   But let's not stop there, because in fact, even that number is wildly inflated by law enforcement statistics being mixed in.  Yes, one in 6,667 of us may engage in acts of self-defense, but most of the people included in that stat are not people in their own house. They are people whose jobs put them in conflict with people, like law enforcement.  That's a totally different scenario.  But don't take my word for it, do this simple search for yourself: Go to news.google.com, pick a large city with over a million people in it, and just search and that city specifically over the last year, for stories about home invasions and self-defense  How many did you find? 10? 20? That's my point exactly. That sort of scenario is super rare. It happens, but it's not going to happen to you. You aren't that lucky/unlucky.    > Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  The only one of us attempting to mislead, is you, with the red herring at the start..   > That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  It can be both. You know the famous Seattle study showed that there were roughly seven suicide attempts and four accidental shootings for every self-defense shooting in Seattle In 1998.  The conclusion from that is pretty clear, that you are a bigger risk to yourself from your own gun, then people who would do harm to you are at risk from it.  That's just facts.	<p>If you want to throw out the federalist papers ... do you have some other source for what they were thinking?</p>	0.815
Stop trying to pawn your shitty rehtoric off on "society" or what ever.  Reality isn't changing. You are not in anyway being forced or obligated to "pull down" anyone from history. If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here?

No you're not	My only issue with your second premise is that you are expunging then of the consequences of their action.

First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	So when you say someone ""undermines the value of our local schools"", it matters how they did that. Did they support a competing school in the neighboring town, draining the local school of students? Not a human rights infringement, since the school has no right to keep students their without their consent. Did he threaten to take his kids out of the school, or cease donating to them, if they didn't do X or Y? Still not a human rights infringement, since the school has no right to keep his kids or money either. But did he do something like disturbing classes by honking his car horn outside the for three hours straight each day with the intent of causing disruption? That constitutes an infringement worthy of punishment.	0.863

That What we’re really asking with a question like that is “what does god GAIN from having us around?” And that logic is flawed. It’s a very human trait to need to GAIN something from doing an action, nothing else in the universe does. So why should we assume God does. The fact is that God is inherently, by principle selfless, and that he would need to ‘gain’ something from us in order to have a reason to create us is that inaccurate. God could’ve just created us, as a kindness TO US.	0.894
If I see bigotry I will mention it. I don't care what your opinion is, this entire thread was made simply so you can say you hate trans people and make yourself feel good about it.	I do agree that animals are more intelligent than we give them credit for, but there is still a grey area whether if they are intelligent enough. Better safe than sorry.  Also perhaps it is impossible for an animal to give sexual consent, just like it is impossible for animals to have morals.  This is also just the moral point of view. The legal challenge would be almost insurmountable. Imagine if a politician tried enacting this.

Any governmental involvement in that discussion is an overreach that ought to give pause to anyone that speaks of &quot;small government&quot; and libertarian principles. Especially when there are so many other things the government can do to reduce the rate of abortion without inserting itself between women and their bodily autonomy. Things like increasing sex education, reducing barriers to safe and effective birth control, increasing social welfare programs to assist mothers that are unable to provide for their children, extending the amount of paternity/maternity leave available to new parents, supplying daycare to working mothers, etc. There are so many options that don&#39;t involve the government ignoring the fundamental human rights of women</p>	0.924

So many people claiming I don't know how supply and demand works, while simultaneously claiming the factory farming industry is responsive to daily, individual decisions by less than 4% of our population to hunt an animal...

And you also have no understanding of supply/demand and fully believe that the meat industry kills animals purely for fun, and then people happen to buy it. Because people reducing demand would have no impact whatsoever on the number of animals killed?   You literally are incapable of logical thought.

No child chose to be born. In that way, every single hurdle they face is, at heart, the parents’ fault. There are plenty of problems that bad parenting specifically creates, to boot. In the end, unless you can be 100% sure that some obstacle or problem a child of yours faces is PURELY their own fault, and not contributed to by you or the world YOU CHOSE to bring them into, you ought to help them to the best of your ability, until the day you die.

Your instincts serve you well. VAERS already has more than 22,000 death reports from the vaccines, which is needless to say far, far more deaths than every single other vaccine combined. Most vaccines are pulled from the market after just a few dozen deaths. This is absolutely unprecedented to recommend a vaccine to young people, at zero risk for serious symptoms from the virus (not a single kid who didn’t have leukemia died with coronavirus let alone of it), that is potentially fatal. Not just that, everyone by this point knows someone or many people who’ve had bad side effects. My wife’s very pro vaccine friend has had vertigo and other alarming side effects for months after her booster, another family friend went to the ER for heart issues two days after the second shot, and my 37-year-old former classmate from both high school and college died within 48 hours of her second shot. She didn’t want the vaccine but had to get it if she wanted to be involved with her kids at school; she left behind two young children.   That aside, who are you trusting exactly? Big Pharma? Dr. Fauci? All people who get a nice payday when everyone is vaccinated, even though there’s zero medical reason that anyone under 55 should need a vaccine against the sniffles. It’s all scare tactics, the emperor has no clothes. They throw this huge number at you - oh but 860,000 people have died from it!! No they haven’t. Who said that?! 860,000 people perhaps had it at the time of death? Sure, but they didn’t die from it. In fact the average person had 3-4 other underlying issues and that’s right from the CDC. About 3 million people die per year, so yes, a certain number of those people will happen to have Covid because it’s widespread. If you look at who actually just flat out died of Covid, it’s 5% of that figure. 5!! That’s as many people as die of the seasonal flu.   When people say trust the science, you know, I do. I have since the very start actually. The science says you don’t need a vaccine if something isn’t a threat to you. It says right now the vaccines don’t stop infection, don’t prevent the spread, and stop illness but may prevent more serious side effects (if the vaccine doesn’t kill your, of course). The guy who invented mRNA vaccines, incidentally, Dr. Robert Malone, is a die hard anti-vaccine mandate advocate and said that under no circumstances should mRNA vaccines be injected into people. That’s right from the guy who invented the technology. But why trust him, right?! I’m sure he didn’t risk his reputation to speak out for any particular reason.	<p>THAT WAS COLLEGE, NOT K-12</p>	0.746

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.	>I don't think most trans people claim to actually suddenly be the oppsite sex, but rather to be the opposite gender and often have a desire to be the opposite sex.	0.791
Many would say that political ideologies such as Capitalism or Communism or Humanism are just as much “religions” as Christianity or Judaism or Islam.   If we define religion as a belief system derived from outside of what science can provide us, which many do, then we aren’t experiencing a transition *away* from religion. We’re experiencing a transition to *different* religions.	<p>This attitude is frightening.</p>	0.855
I completely agree. Parenting isn't a job you graduate from when the kid is 18. Different boundaries or dynamics may have to be placed as the person ages but parents should always be a source of support. In essence it's about building a community together. I want my kids to not fear where they'll get money for food or rent or tuition. I want them to know they can always come home. I want them to have a stress free young adulthood for as long as physically possible so they get to explore and experience themselves as much as they can at the start of their adult lives. It makes for happier, healthier, well rounded and well adjusted adults. Adults who care about other people. The idea that at 18 you're suddenly expected to have everything sorted and survive on your own is a garbage, modern day farce demanded most prominently by capitalism and is not actually how rearing young humans should work. Many people, not because they're lazy or unmotivated, simply aren't ready to launch right at 18. That's normal. That should be ok. They should have a support system.	<p>Re: the problem of suffering, I think that is a substantial theological issue, but I don&#39;t think the issue is based on God being omniscient (knowing in advance we are going to suffer). Even if God was just very knowledgeable, but didn&#39;t know everything, the amount of suffering in the world that could potentially be avoided would be... substantial. Your assumption in the post is that, if God &quot;loves&quot; us, he will want to prevent all our suffering, and I don&#39;t think that is a very good understanding of Christianity.</p>	0.902
CNN, is that you? Because not a single thing I wrote is anything but a verifiable fact. The drug companies and global elites LOVE it that you’ll do their dirty work for them! It’s amazing. Not a single part of the entire Covid narrative has been true, not one, from the very start. And unless you’ve been in a coma you’ve probably realized that my side has been correct about everything, not wrong once. 1) It wasn’t a wet market, it was a lab leak. That’s now widely understood. 2) Cloth masks don’t work, they never did. The reason we were sure of that is because we can read, unlike your side. I read all of the dozens of peer reviewed research studies published from 1981 through 2020 and they studied surgical and N95 masks and still *not a single one* found any benefit against airborne respiratory viruses. That’s because even N95 masks have 0.30 micron holes and viruses are 0.13 microns. It takes just 100 virus particles for infection and millions are propelled into the air with coughs and sneezes. Even blocking 99% of them does you no good. The data confirms this - mask mandates states didn’t have any better infection rates than ones that never had a mask mandates. Masks aren’t for viruses, they’re for bacteria. 3) We said they’d mandate vaccines and create vaccine passports. They did. 4) We said there would be booster after booster. That’s exactly what happened. We called that before the first vaccine was even on the market. 5) We said antibody dependent enhancement was a risk. Studies from Israel show that’s very possible. Even the NYT acknowledged that - more boosters could lower your natural immune function, not raise it.  You might want to start taking notes and realizing we have done A LOT more research than you have. And we have the experts to back up our views, you know, since we do actually trust the science!	<p>As for the biology argument, I’m going to use the same response that always gets used because it’s perfectly valid.

The 40+ hour week dates from a time when the majority of workers lived in families with 1 breadwinner and 1 home naker. That one person earned enough to feed, clothe and house their family. This only lasted a comparatively short period. Pay didn't keep up with inflation / cost of living. Women joining the workforce, automation, robots, computers/outsourcing to cheaper countries all reduced the amount of jobs, and that brought down pay (just to be clear, I don't blame women! I blame bosses / capitalism/globalisation).  I agree with OP that for the majority of people, a 40 hour week doesn't leave much time to live and grow and learn and enjoy.	>Its seems wasteful and nonsensical	0.928

Do you follow the Kardashians on social media? You might think celebrity gossip is reductive and garbage and the people that are interested in it are basically stupid and wasting their lives... and you'd be right... but it has a strong relationship with religion and perhaps your opinion.  Whether the Torah was dictated to Moses by God in the wilderness or not, it's laws are a set of social guidelines that helped form a distinct community. It helped bring reform, order and bring social cohesion to people. People need social guidelines to conform to for a sense of equality in their tribes.  Over the decades there are many ways for those social guidelines to manifest.  * The Church until the last century * Actual Laws * Gossip, and people who Gossip. "Oh look Maggy at 42 is pregnant again. At her age.... " * Newspapers, Soaps during the 80s - 2000 * Facebook Memes, Twitter accounts, Trashy celebs are how morals are propogated and pushed on to each other these days.  Facebooks Memes aren't always supposed to be funny, they are sometimes supposed to push a political view on you. You Uncle with the weird posts is essentially just from a different social tribe as you - even though you are related! These social expectations and rules, this public lambasting of certain people are a replacement for the bible. That we all understand and conform to certain social rules.  With Politcs in America becoming ever more divisive (since and thanks to Trump) and escalating into hard left and right stances it's easy to identify how this is causing people to choose one of two tribes in the US. How it matters more than Facebook Memes, TV dramas and actual laws. So yeah politics is replacing religion in America somewhat but it's a meandering journey about social identity and more than that - trying to force people to live according to your core beliefs.	You're right lol. Again, after seeing people say that it drove me to post this, but I guess my logic was flawed because we have those different words because they are not exactly the same. Also, debating the definition of art was also kind of pointless because it is entirely subjective.

So in your case you don't live on a very well thought out or diverse farm. You specifically farm livestock and nothing else, it also sounds as though you have no access to pasture or large grasslands, otherwise your opinions are just opinion, and based on imagination.   There is no future for the meat industry.  You are suggesting that farmers would simply pay to destroy their only assets, destroying their business and choosing bankruptcy in one fell move? Instead of making a significantly more passive income from supplying to the organic fertilizer industry and local arable, fruit and etc farmers which would boom in response to the massive increase in demand.   Forgive me for calling BS, you come off as either a fantasists, delusional, or just intentionally feigning ignorance in an attempt to justify the continuation of what you have always considered the norm.  Yes I'm alright but I'm getting tired of obtuse poorly thought out opinions and having to hear them come out of what I would hope are usually intelligent people, it's extremely wearing.	<p>If you&#39;re saying that I should change my view because you alluded to some philosopher who supposedly changed their moral convictions as the result of some rational process, then you should at least give me a book and chapter.

Only the biggest lawsuits in history follow these companies get your head out of your ass.   Bet you believe that the flu took a year off too. You just keep repeating "safe and effective" and don't pay any attention to the fact that you were told you won't catch covid if you get the vaccine. Science isn't guessing what will happen it's experimenting until a result is consistent. Yes experimenting.  If you don't see a problem with medical professionals being censored and deleted off social platforms for simply offering a second opinion then you are too far gone.  No issues with not discussing the possible side effects like every other drug in history? Or the adverse reactions totalling more than all vaccines combined? Don't you think it's worth at least a discussion to make people aware of what they put in their body? Or are you okay with an outside source telling you and everyone else what to put in their body.

I don't shame people for being misoginistic or sexist since context and upbringing plays a great role. I shame them if they choose to stay that way.

We understand what you mean , we just disagree .  I've read up and understand how these ideas were formed.  I just think they are bad and make errors.  Im not using concepts I think are ill thought up and conflict with facts.  I think the way gender identity is framed as unfalsifiable makes it lower in the hierarchy of concepts that observable , testable fact.  So I use pronouns for what people are   not what they think they are.	<p>This isn’t up for debate. If you wanted to not make it so easy for me to say that I said exactly the opposite of what you claimed I said, you should have toned down your needless hyperbole, assumptions, and insistence on what I’m implying.

Being being marginalised isn't a good reason to use circular reasoning in a new defintion	Very cool studies! Definitely insightful. I'm not sure if I agree with your interpretation of this second one though, which may boil down to a difference in our definition of critical thinking. For me, critical thinking entails questioning your own beliefs, not just searching or valuing evidence. For example for someone to truly engage in critical thinking while reading the two articles, they would not only find holes in the opposite position and consider the evidence on their side as valid, they would seek to identify both the valid and invalid arguments in both. They would hold the evidence for their own viewpoint to the same level of scrutiny as the alternatives.	0.85

> Lies? Really? I’m responding to OP in a sub called change your view. Don’t insult me.  Yes. Lies. Stop it.  You are linking to a website that is totally false. It goes against all facts and common sense. It goes against what is on the UN website. Against what the US DoD says. Against what the Security Council says. Against what even wikipedia says.  And on top of it all. it outright lies about what Chapter 8 is and what resolution 1973 is. Here's plenty of evidence for that:   It's literally on the wikipedia page for regional organizations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_organization (click show at the bottom, it's in the list).  The US military considers it a regional organization in its official documents https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA445041 "allows a regional organization, such as NATO"  All of this nonsense about "regional organizations" in Chapter 8 of the UN charter is absurd. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-8 Read the chapter. It's like 10 sentences. "regional organizations" never even appear anywhere in the Chapter!  The confusion really stems from a misunderstanding of how the Security Council works. The Security Council can say they are acting under their Chapter 7 powers, https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7, to secure peace. Or, they could say they are acting under their Chapter 8 powers to delegate peaceful settlement to other organizations. NATO has made it clear that it is not interested in being part of Chapter 8 operations because its ability to respond to escalations would be more limited, if it gets involved, it's going to be through the more powerful Chapter 7.  But that's not an issue. The Security Council almost never uses Chapter 8! And what the original story said is a total lie. Resolution 1973 is a Chapter 7 resolution, not a chapter 8 resolution. https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/1973%20(2011) It's right there in black and white, bottom of page 2 "Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nation".  I think someone carelessly overheard a NATO spokesperson give an interview and got super confused. Sometimes, they will say something along the lines of "NATO isn't a Chapter 8 regional organization". That doesn't mean it's not a regional organization, because that term means nothing! It's not defined anywhere in the Charter. They're just saying, if you're going to look for a regional organization to get involved, you need to do it under Chapter 7, not 8, if you want NATO involved.  Now, there have been people arguing for 60 years that NATO should switch to getting involved via Chapter 8 not 7. To have more limited operations. But NATO doesn't want to be chained this way. Anyway, consider this: all of these resolutions could have been vetoed by Russia. If they thought NATO was acting illegally why would they allow this over and over again? It's all pretty absurd.

It's not worth my time continuing a discussion with someone unable to grasp a simple concept.  X number of animals were killed as of today to provide meat in the grocery stores. There is a deer in the woods still alive, if I go decide to kill that deer it's now dead... It wasn't dead this morning, but it is dead now that I shot it. Again, it's really not hard to follow along.   The meat in your grocery store was dead already, the animals in the woods are alive until you decide to go kill one. It really boils down to you being able to wrap your head around this concept. Given this situation, it is immoral to go out and kill another animal when you didn't need to. That's literally all I'm arguing at the end of the day - a hunter doesn't wake up and NEED to kill an animal, but they do anyway.  More death is unacceptable, I don't care if it makes you feel better about yourself. From the animal's perspective, you just killed me even though there's 1000s of pounds of meat in the grocery store down the road.	<p>When you say they’re really rare, do you mean as a percentage of pregnancy’s , or in actual totals?   62 million since roe v wade doesn’t seem rare to me.

Fairness in sports means something very specific, that the referees will not preferentially favor one side over the other. That they will be neutral in their application of the rules. There is no fairness when it comes to the competition of two teams though. One team will necessarily be more talented and more prepared than the other team. If the competition is fair, that team will win (barring any completely out of the ordinary freak occurrences). One could say that it is not fair that a school team has a talent advantage such that it can beat another school team in open competition 106 to zero. But that just happened this past week.

I completely agree.  It feels sickening to me that we are born just to have to work 9-5 for the rest of our lives, and live like that.  But at the same time, there's many things you can do. For instance you can save up, or take a loan, then move abroad for some time with that money. And perhaps you find a way to sustain yourself while you are over there, at minimal cost, at minimal effort, or at an effort that you enjoy?   I feel like life has many options, it's just that we haven't discovered them as we are. Rather we settled with our parent's or forefathers way of living, instead of finding new ways.

I will upfront say that I am skeptical of this conversation going anywhere. Your responses so far have not indicated that you are genuinely interested in attempting to see my view. I will make an attempt though.  I have already explained why this mandate is an overreach. The rationale that was used is something that is not limited to one industry and can used to force almost anything on any industry. It appears analogous to the commerce clause interpretations in regards to its far reaching nature (at least to me).  I am not saying this is the only overreaching regulation. I’m fact it’s has made me start to question multiple other regulations. This was probably the most in your face one though to where it made me stop and think while the others I never really thought about. I am very big on trying to be consistent in my views.  In no way would this be analogous to firefighters. The only way it would be analogous to fire fighters is if I was saying all government services are bad….which is not what I’m saying.

And try and give your bodies a little love too by maintaining them inside a weight range that is health wise satisfying :)	I find it annoying now, but I also feel that way about every phrase or word that comes to oversaturate the internet. Problematic was oversaturated a long time ago, like, over a decade.   A lot of words that might resonate for us now will go the way of 'problematic', even ones that are less politically charged, just because they get overdone."	0.841
Adults are always on their own.	Also, I noticed in your answer you use the example of ""black features"", and I thought I should point out that black people are not really one single race. If you're not attracted to the features of a person with native Caribbean heritage, that says nothing about whether you'd be attracted to someone with heritage from southern parts of Africa, or someone from Egypt. Black people are more genetically distinct from other races of black people than they are from white people (white people are also not a single race. The whole black/white/asian/latino construct is an old bad rule of thumb to help people know who they can be racist to, all those people are lumped into those groups for no real scientific reason.)"	0.855

So the fact that people stay together even 10 years-- regardless of marriage-- proves it&#39;s possible to find attraction beyond the physical, at least for some people. But the fact that so many people fail to have long-term physical/sexual relationships also shows that not everyone has the temperament, emotional intelligence, the right partner, etc. </p>	0.853

No, no. Show me where I said *this:*  >you're saying that it's ok to be racist and sexist   You can't, because I never did. You keep claiming I've said that this what Biden is doing isn't sexist or racist and/or that sexism/racism is ok, yet I've never said either thing.

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.	As for sidetracking, you've again got it backwards. Of course people always want women to be the point because they don't care about men's issue. That's why they always try to sidetrack men's issues to make them about women. But this is an equality issue. That men are discriminated against and women are privileged is the issue."	0.897

Trans people should just compete against each other in the special olympics. It actually makes sense to give them a division. Am I wrong? CMV	I think waiting 10 years to bring up being trans is too long to wait, because I agree that something that important to a person should be brought up earlier, waiting that long implies a series lack of trust.  At the same time, there is absolutely no reason to bring it up on the first date if someone doesn't want to, especially considering the increased risk of violence trans people face simply for existing.	0.857

Idk if this is a CMV post. More like a LPT for people into hunting	<p>With that concept out of the way, let&#39;s consider what is happening when we cancel the debt. Basically, the expenses of the education are short-circuited, meaning that the money for the debt is directly created by government activities, meaning that the end result is exactly the same, with the exception that the student now doesn&#39;t have to pay interest on their student loan, meaning they can be more productive earlier in life. This has enormous benefits for the economy because instead of paying off money that technically never existed, we now have people who can save and invest money back into industry.</p>	0.882
I would say this CMV is way too specific. It looks like you are trying to practice a bunch of rebuttals so you can pivot taking points when arguing with your liberal friends.  But I will give it the ole college try: The AR is a versatile rifle, but your view is that it “can” be an “excellent” hunting rifle.  Your criteria seems to be weight, ballistics, accuracy, and accessories.  But then you suggest that not all configurations would be ideal for hunting. Any rifle can be modded for any situation with the advent of rifle stock systems.   So comparatively, to be considered “excellent”, and not simply sufficient, an AR would have to be better than an “average” hunting rifle.  Any top brand .308 rifle off the shelf can be reasonably expected to hit 1” MOA with no additional accessories. They all weigh between 4-7 lbs loaded. And most hunting rifles will include sling hard points, bottom rails for bipod and ring mount rails for the scope. Very similar to an off the shelf AR aside from the AR having side rails in most applications.  Out of the box an average hunting rifle, with the same scope, will outperform an AR. Every time.  The AR was designed to put a few bullets on a man sized target from 150-500 yards. To which is excels at. The hunting rifle, perfected over a hundred years, is designed to take down game with one bullet out to 1000.  Your CMV could read: A .50 cal can make an excellent hunting rifle. For the same reasons.	The point isn't that there's a million sexes. The point is that there's a lot more variation than is conveyed by the phrase ""the two sexes"". Ultimately, it comes down to the question of why even categorize people into sexes? If we're talking medical reasons, then it makes far more sense to describe things in terms of the actual predictors or influencers (e.g. hormone levels) than the superficial things they're associated with (e.g. genitalia)"	0.798

Okay, so now that we're clear on the fact that you're a racist, can we get back to the point where Joe Rogan is not a threat to public health and that censoring him or punishing him, just because he has a huge range, doesn't at all help with the intellectual sediment of the population being easily convinced of things without any scientific proof?

A non-sequitor that can in no way be mistaken as a real response. Besides, strikers are dominant in the UFC.

This is such a picture perfect example of the self-righteous, patronizing attitude that is dominating "the left" aka "the mainstream" right now.  Zero nuance and thinly veiled *contempt* for "the other".  We are in such a dark place right now.  It's actually scary.	But that's talking about *mandating* it, not *normalizing* it, which is what the cmv is talking about. Normalizing it is nice because it means I feel less weird saying mine, and I have to say mine right now cause I don't pass. Mandating it isn't great (though I'm still absolutely baffled as to what pronouns you thought gay people would have), but it's not like announcing your sexual orientation or anything. Gender is a pretty big part of the way we view other people and a big part of the way we address them-- Mr. or Mrs., he or she, sir or ma'am-- it's unavoidable. I could live my whole life without ever knowing my college professor's sexual orientation but if I ever want to recommend a class with him to another student, I'd need to know his gender identity to say, ""yeah, take a class with *him*.""

You definitely caught me not checking your response though, I wish I had, it would have saved lots of redundant and useless dialogue. I should have known; the typical Reddit ‘research’ take is to directly google for data to support your conclusion, then browbeat with it with some superfluous grammar that suggests superior intelligence, then pray that no one reads it.  Or more likely, pray that if they do, they don’t understand it’s implications and limitations that you weren’t able to grasp yourself.	If you sat down and reach across the aisle to conservatives to talk about how police shouldn't be able to abuse their force and that some degree of non-partisan public accountability needs to be put in place, and show them the many instances of a police egregiously abusing white and Latino and Asian people, I think you'd find a lot of common ground hell if you really wanted to get things done, you would simply point out how every time one of these supposedly racist cops in inner cities gets away with shooting the black person, that it's a Democrat who lets them off the hook. Look at Derrick Chauven. He actually murdered two people before he was involved in the death of George Floyd. Amy Klobuchar is the person who let him off the hook both times. That's actually why she's not vice president right now. The reason that bad cops stay on the police force has nothing to do with racism but everything to do with Democrats who run these police force and the cities that the police forces are in. So instead of implicating a system which you yourself run, maybe actually focus on cleaning up that system, and at that point conservatives might join your effort."	0.816

Our views on this subject. Funny that the guy who insists on not talking about the group when it comes to minorities can't keep the discussion on ""the smallest minority"" when the time comes to discuss anything else. Maybe it's your philosophy that's self contradictory. But of course, as demonstrated, you wont actually consider that a possibility and instead find a way to blame leftist brainwashing for my noticing that contradiction. Anything to avoid owning up to your own flaws, right?"	0.855
With all due respect, I think you are deeply ignorant.  Look at your language: you consider yourself a member of the "fact based community"--i.e., your beliefs are **fact**.  It logically follows that anyone who disagrees with you is, *ipso facto*, "factually" wrong.  You and your tribe have exclusive access to the Truth and that Truth is being threatened by ... shall we call them Blasphemers?  Or is that a little too on the nose?  Accusing your ideological opponents of being children is no idle threat.  Children, after all, do not enjoy access to all the civil rights of adults.  It sounds like you are enthusiastically in favor of stripping your fellow citizens of their essential liberties.  I hope you are simply ignorant of what lies around that bend.  I recommend everyone whose blood is burning with contempt for "the other" read [this magnificent essay, "I Can Tolerate Anything Except the Outgroup" by psychiatrist Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/).  We desperately need to pull back from the brink.	<p>Why on earth would anyone voluntarily return to the same conditions, but also during a pandemic full of people actively spreading it because of a distrust of basic science? It&#39;s nonsensical to expect this. People will only go back if they are absolutely desperate (which reducing benefits will cause) or if the jobs actually consider their employees to be more than &quot;human capital&quot; and actually treat them like people. I hope that added difficulty in hiring staff will force jobs to consider this.</p>	0.867

I honestly think you are trolling me now. Good one, you actually got me.	So my reply is two-fold: I don't think math (and similar abstracts) is a ""thing"" (that can or can't exist) to begin with, and the things you can reason about when you reason about math, can be reasoned about regardless of whether you know math or not.

This 100 percent, people are so weird about penis size , if you are a obese, obnoxious, just horrible being of a man and you have a monster schlong that’s not going to make a difference. The thing that amazes me the most is how retarded people are when it comes to the anatomy of the penis, I mean if a women slept with a thousand dudes none of them are going to have 10 inch dicks, that’s not how dicks work lol they have literally debunked this stuff like millions of times over too and people still don’t learn its bizarre. All this being said I could easily imagine how a man obsessed with dick size might put off women for other reasons, I feel like it’s almost separate personality type.	ACAB is an anti Liberal stance.

Whoosh	Yes, speeding would be best controlled by this way. But that's not the only traffic violation that needs to be monitored. In fact, in my opinion, the law enforcement should move away from trying to catch people who drive 5mph faster than the speed limit in good driving conditions and try to catch actually dangerous driving, in particular dangerous lane changing and overtaking.	0.79
>Male circumcision is absolutely nothing like female genital mutilation  Yes it is.	Being into features like breasts and genitals could also count, because these features are strongly associated with sex and wanting to do sexual things with women (unlike preferring clear skin, which is not a sexual thing at all and there's a lot of evidence it's built into most people's brains).

You are trying to make it come across like what I've said is confusing when you know fully well you are the one trying to confuse and dilute the conversation.

Like are you really going to try to discredit me by saying key terms you think will help label me as a deranged person, when the topic you bring up is a literal thing being implemented in real life. Are you going to pretend like the world economy isn't on the brink of collapse because of the pieces of shit in global power who failed to respond an international pandemic with a sense of duty, and instead chose to find ways to profit off of it at the sake of millions of deaths? Are you really just going to accept tyranny and oppression as okay staples in society, without looking deeper into the issues because you are so afraid of being ostracized for accepting what is on the news is fake? Are you really going to try to claim that people shouldn't be skeptical and speak out about a coalition of conglomerates, that have histories of seeking profits by using unethical sweat shops and slave and child labor for cheaper production costs of their products, trying to control the decision making process of every country in the world?   If the answers to those questions are yes, then I want you to know I truly think you are a pathetic person who brings no value to society, and you should shut your fucking mouth when others are trying to have grown up conversations about crime and corruption.

The problem with these numbers is they actually don't include graduates who are unemployed upon graduation. They only account for the number of people who are employed. I've looked into this before. So the wage gap is actually much smaller. Also, you forgot to account for university costs and housing costs too.   &#x200B;  The other problem is that your college graduate salary includes people who attended postgraduate education but you didn't account for the extra tuition cost and opportunity cost. Also you need to factor in interest at 6% per year. There's a lot of gross assumptions you made here.	I don't have to you experience it when I have scientific studies and research to my disposal.

The whole point of the term is for Americans, Jews, and Muslims to distinguish the male circumcision/genital mutilation they do from the female circumcision/genital mutilation that Africans do. You're trying to say that they are similar/equal by using the same term to describe both. Your view isn't about the best term to describe things, but a debate about religion and politics. From the perspective of atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, South Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc., it's all genital mutilation. Also, the next layer to this global culture war is trans surgery, which is often described as genital mutilation by conservative Americans, Jews, and Muslims who practice male circumcision/mutilation.  The interesting thing to the debate is that genital circumcision/mutilation is largely an African concept. The countries in the northern parts practice male genital mutilation (which are often described as Muslim and Jewish countries in the US). And countries in southern parts practice female genital mutilation (and they are often Christian/Muslim countries). The US is the exception. Because of the masturbation beliefs of the founder of Kellogg's, circumcision spread around the US.	Yup. That's the current style.

First of all, the OP doesn't give ANY examples of ANY of the claims he is making. So not sure how anyone would be able to argue this and get a delta. The mods should actually remove his post or ask him to specify what he is talking about instead of making vague and general claims like he is doing.  &#x200B;  OP, just remember, you called him right wing but did not provide proof. If you are doing that simply because the MSM is telling you that he is right wing, then you already lose your own argument here.   &#x200B;  I am not a Joe Rogan fan, I just hate MSM and will always go on duckduckgo or bing and do research on the things MSM claims, which quite often reveals that MSM is lying about things they say. You can also google it, but google will always try and link you to the MSM websites, it is often quite difficult to get info that is not from CNN, Fox News, WaPo etc on google.  &#x200B;  As for his podcast, MSM is trying to cancel him because he had actual medical professionals on his show talking about MRNA vaccines etc.. The medical professionals from MSM was also on his show, that medical professional admitted that they lied about Joe Rogan on CNN. Then a day later, he went on CNN and said that he was afraid that Joe would climb over the table and attack him.... That's the type of misinformation they are spreading about Joe. There is a video from CNN where they literally manipulated a video of Joe Rogan to make him appear more green and sick than he actually was.   [https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30](https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30)  &#x200B;  Joe has never once claimed his podcast should be used for medical advice, but the media is smearing him for it. He made a video of when he had covid and said that he used Ivermectin, the media LIED and smeared him and said that he used horse medicine, despite Ivermectin being FDA approved for use in humans years ago already. This is called pushing a narrative, which is what MSM does, and they literally lied about ivermectin because they want to push that narrative.   &#x200B;  Now, months later, pharmaceutical companies are saying that in the trials, ivermectin seems to be effective against multiple corona strains, but you don't see the MSM reporting on this because that would go against their narrative.   https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japans-kowa-says-ivermectin-effective-against-omicron-phase-iii-trial-2022-01-31/  Even before this, there was a few studies that showed that ivermectin had decent effectiveness in treating covid symptoms, but the media refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to admit that they lied.  &#x200B;  Then there is the one where he had Jordan Peterson on. The MSM has always hated JP and if you watch the podcast, and then watch how the MSM reported on it, you will clearly see that the MSM is lying about it. Even if you don't like Joe, you can see that MSM is lying  &#x200B;  Now OP, my question to you is, are you going to actually provide proper reasons for the things you are saying so that people can dispute it, or will you leave your post as vague as possible in an attempt not to provide any deltas?

Lmao. You're a hoot pal.	<p>However, people talking on the internet is a small portion of the views held by the wider society. By and large, what mainstream media puts out still drives a lot of conversations. After all, these are meant to be experts expressing opinions/informing the public, and how they’re couched tends to influence the conversation people have about the topic (I think it was Tom Nicholas on YouTube that talked about media bias, I can’t look up the video right now but I can find it in a few hours if you’re interested). Even cults and extremist groups have their central publications, and that informs their viewers/readers on how to think about things. People who don’t ‘trust’ the media still end up sharing things that the media puts out, even if it’s to rag on it. The media is a platform that is both controllable and has the resources to be fully informed and able to critically analyse every topic that comes up (because… it’s their job imo). The discourse held on such platforms <em>should</em> be held to higher standards of nuance and critical examinations, because they not only have the resources but the reach to influence plenty of people. </p>	0.824

Absolutely agree. Every type of GM is a violation of human rights.	The argument I'd make against NIT compared to UBI is that it makes things more complicated. If your employment status changes or you aren't guaranteed a stable income (say your job works on tips or commissions), you may be over or underpaid/taxed and that money eventually goes where it belongs when you file. With UBI, you guarantee a stable income regardless of status and tax forms can factor it in without changing anything beyond the rates and thresholds on existing tax forms.

Imagine an angry Karen escalating a situation because she believes no one should own a gun, it is easier to avoid that concealed carry.

Mad money.	The best case interpretation is that the government assumes that there is a contract for providing public good to you, a contract that doesn't have a way for you to opt out of (there's technically exit clauses but they still don't let you off the hook for the things they forced onto you in the first place), and if you do not follow the rules of the contract it'll imprison you for failure to pay the taxes (after a few other steps that look like increased fines, payment injunctions, etc etc. In the US at least failure to pay taxes directly isn't a crime, but going out of your way to make _sure_ you don't pay your taxes is tax evasion and a felony) and if you refuse to follow along with the imprisonment they will violently enforce it.	0.883

Evolution doesn&#39;t care about chromosomes, evolution only cares if your genitals work. So from an evolutionary perspective, your biological sex is about your genitals, not your chromosomes. And the fact remains that there are only two gamete types, sperm and egg. Every human that has ever existed produces one of these two, with the exception of some intersex people, who may produce both. But understand that producing both does not constitute evidence that sex is not binary. Even intersex people are limited to sperm and egg. There is no third gamete, there is no third sex.</p>	0.879

Also, yes, reducing taxes gives the stock market a 'sugar high' but its important to remember that a stock price has little real bearing on a company's actual performance, or the overall economic health of the country its a projection of investor confidence in a company's future performance (think uber or lyft, these companies have not turned a profit, or even come close since they started, Uber has been around since 2009, but people invest anyway because they *believe* they will someday).	0.815

Get a life dude lol	Ideally, the money saved by offshoring doesn’t just disappear into the pockets of billionaires (although in practice it happens all too much), it gets reinvested by the company to create new, better things, and that money is often spent by the company in the local markets, boosting the economy there.  And, again ideally, some of the savings can be spent retraining the workers in fields where they do have a competitive advantage over foreign economies and can be even more productive than their old jobs.  This is the joy of free trade - the money saved by moving production oversees isn’t lost to the home market, it is freed to be spent on more productive things.	0.877
There is a large body of evidence that points to broken family units in the African American community. If I provide said evidence would you even accept it? Do me a favor right now at random look up a black celebrity or any kind of influential black person on Wikipedia I would bet money their father was not in the picture. I would argue that children without fathers is a systemic issue in the African American community that is way easier to prove than systemic racism the latter is so hard t define and quantify while the former is simply a matter of correcting the right data in the right way.

Your arguments are bad faith. Vaccination mandates are for the public health and safety.

Such a thought could only have come from an American (Americans are so judgmental) If someone sins, they deserve the punishment that they receive, right? No second chances!	My point was people have different understandings of the tax policy; What punishment each action entails. Also want and inability can overlap. If a person cannot afford taxes, they aren't aren't going to necessarily want to pay them. That doesn't take away from the legal issues, but just for reference, they can.

Duty, Responsibility, Defend, Protect, Serve.  Those are all words that come to mind when I think of what it means to love your country and patriotism.

This means wearing a mask and getting vaccinated!  Here is another thought. Picture an invading military attacking your country. What are the goals of this invading force? Perhaps to harm as many as possible, overwhelm the countries hospitals, and to kill as many as possible. People that help this invading force would be guilty of aiding & abetting, basically reason.  Not getting vaccinated is helping that invading covid force do more harm to the country.  In the US there are now over 900,000 deaths.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed multiple times. Seems to me that the invading force has done quite a bit of harm with the help of those that are anti vax and anti mask!

I think it should be perfectly acceptable and legal to use any level of force or violence in the furtherance of any ideology, religion, social or political position.  Let's see how that shakes out.	Now regarding the crime gene therapy it depends on how widespread it is. If you have something like 99% of the population has the gene therapy and they commit 1000 times less crime than the 1% that does not. Then why on earth would you not keep the 1% away from your neighborhood. It sucks for the 1% that are not actually violent. This is where nuances like ""are they not taking the gene therapy out of some anti-vax stance or is it because they are somehow incompatible with it?"" come into play. If it's due to some anti-vax stance you tell them to take the vax or go live somewhere else. If it's because they can't take it now it's a little bit more complicated."	0.805

Lmao calm down	It’s all about the economics of restaurants. When a person comes in, sits down, and orders food, that order is sent back to the kitchen and placed in a queue of orders, which the cooks will work through roughly in the order received. For each of those orders, a server is going to receive tips, which they are receiving in the place of minimum wage. However, when a takeout order comes in, the kitchen still needs to devote time to making the order but no one receives anything in tips for doing so. You already mention in one of your edits that this causes longer wait times for in-house orders and thus smaller tips on those orders, but it also requires the kitchen to spend valuable time on orders that aren’t going to go towards paying the employees.	0.854

My view is if you say yes in any state that is a green light. Condom or no. If you commit a crime while drunk you can’t claim you didn’t know what you were doing in court. “I was drunk so didn’t know the implications of drunk driving”. Why should that be acceptable here. Sober you chose to get drunk in that situation and so knew the risks involved. If you are aware of what is around you and can communicate that that is enough even if you are drunk off your ass. The only case this doesn’t apply is if the person is so far gone they can’t register what is around them. So long as they are awake and able to interact intentionally with their environment that counts as consent in my book.   Take for example if a man and woman are both drunk. Did the man rape the woman? Did the woman rape the man? Did they rape each other? After all if you rape someone while drunk it is still rape. The answer is it is just two drunk horny people. Pass them a rubber and leave the room.	The biggest thing your argument is missing is that for decades and centuries, gay people have already *tried* it. And it sucked. Many gay people, now and in even less accepting times, have had fake relationships to hide their identities, or have forced themselves to date folks of a gender to which they're not attracted. And it's a miserable way to live. Imagine if you were told you could never find real love, but had to spend your life with someone who you could never feel that way about? You'd be deeply unhappy. It's not a recipe for a healthy marriage, and it's not a recipe for a healthy home life for your kids. Furthermore, being closeted has a direct negative impact on both you and other gay people. People who believe you're straight may be much more willing to say homophobic things around you, and you can't respond without risking outing yourself. And because people believe gay people are rare and different, homophobia is more acceptable in general, and everyone suffers for that.	0.829
This is so cult like you should get a Scientology application.	Your argument falls apart at no.3. Women are not required to have children. They are not obligated to have children.

There is no requirement or obligation to engage in that aspect of life, and there is no drawback from refraining, only potential benefit in engaging.

>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.	1. A near-universal feature among animal species, for example, is that the males *advertise* their capabilities to females. Males are generally the ones with the flashy colors, the fancy ornaments, the beautiful songs. Females of a species tend to look drab and dull, because their aesthetics do not matter - it is the male that needs to look pretty enough to attract mates. This is because in biology, males *advertise* and females *choose* the highest value male available. In human societies, we see a complete reversal - is it not women that spend more time applying makeup and carefully removing blemishes and coordinating their clothing and obsessing over their figures? This directly contradicts what the model suggests.	0.869

One reading of this is that you, as a man (and a part of wider society), will basically be supporting the offspring of other men. The more sex these men have and the more women they impregnate, the larger the proportion of your money that will go to funding the extension of their genetic lineage .</p>	0.861
If you gonna show and support hate publicly, then you deserve whatever comes after.	No. I'm the type of person that desires to understand the words I use. If you want to provide a different alternative definition, I welcome it. But I can't simply ""cater"" to someone, because doing so most likely harms another. In this case, myself. It pains me to do something I don't understand. And I dislike the ""culture"" that would have me pressuring others to do the same. That to me it would be harm toward others. So I'm basically asking why people aren't recognizing the harm upon me to make me do something I'm uncomfortable in doing.	0.898
Attacking a group, any group, because they believe differently than you is wrong. Full stop. Saying your violence is justified because you think the right things, are support the right ideas or look the right way doesn't change that you are simply making an excuse to attack people who you think don't deserve to live their life as they see fit. How any of you can sit here and say you absolutely feel justified in attacking someone who has done you no harm is sick and disgusting. You are no better than those you claim are evil; you are literally doing the thing you say they are doing. See h isn't violence. Ideas are not violence. Action is violence, and if you attack someone because of who they are or what they think, it is you, not the one who you deplore, that are to blame.	<p>I think you missed that point.</p>	0.838

There&#39;s a huge difference in the life stage of someone in their 50s- already settled in their career, may have grown children, no longer wanting to take care or babies, and someone in their 20s - still renting, just started their career, want to go out and have fun, want to start a family in a few years. Being in different stages of life can be equally detrimental to a relationship as having different goals about your futures.</p>	0.803

The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don’t hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.

I mean that's what almost happened in 2021.   Russian trolls on Facebook spreading misinformation about how the election was stolen. Trump being so self-absorbed and an ego-maniac played right into Putin's hands. Culminated to retarded Trump supporters invading their own capitol, chanting "hang Mike Pence".  What unfolded in 2021 showed the world how fragile the US really is. It was a national embarrassment.

I won't get into semantics about what you view your character as. I personally would think your character is more than just an argument on reddit but if that's what you want to water it down to by all means. For me an ad hominem would be more akin to "you like chocolate ice cream therefore your opinion is invalid". Citing a separate argument you made to question your motives is not ad hominem, but i'll drop it regardless.   I apologize for attacking your unrelated argument/character in another thread.   However I don't think it's that wrong to question whether you're arguing honestly when in another thread you're making the claim humans can't rape animals. Reddit is full of trolls, I don't want to waste my time with one. If you're not one, great, my mistake. Any further replies should be under my other comment as to not get cluttered.	<p>but what it does indicate is at least a less forthright misogyny than is often portrayed, and certainly not a misogyny more powerful than that of many men who would not consider themselves incels.   </p>	0.799
I've been arguing this since Richard Spencer was sucker-punched in the head live on television on inauguration day 2017, while calmly speaking with a reporter.  People were all 'hell yeah!' at the time, too.  No one wants to listen, or have even the slightest bit of imagination about how normalizing it could come back to bite you.	Because hormones are the major differentiator between male and female bodies, replacing those hormones distinctly changes your biological sex. This is important to note because it's a factor in my sexuality. I'm really only attracted to trans women once estrogen starts to make it's changes. I'm the gender based paradigm, this is just ""attracted to women with preferences for a certain amount of female expression"" but with a sex based paradigm that you're proposing it's an attraction based on sexual characteristics and expressions changing, therefore based on being a different sex.	0.882
>You are quit literally arguing that my argument is invalid  I never said any argument is *invalid* because of another one you made. Quote me saying that.

I was simply concerned we weren't going to have a serious discussion as im sure you can understand most people saying stuff like that on the internet are not doing it for serious discussion.	<p>You can be open-minded about licking people that have covid, and listen to an argument about it.

this is baby’s first change my view	These seem to be the standards of attractiveness held for men from my perspective. I get you can always tweak and add to this list, but it seems like these are the main ones. Not only should we be in shape like women, but we need to be tall and financially stable. Men usually don’t have a height or bank requirement. Men are held to a higher standard in the dating realm as well, if you see things from my perception."	0.848
Most of the time kkk and neonazis just like to talk hot air, they rarely act (physically/violently) on their beliefs. I actually applaud them and appreciate that they tell me they hate me, we draw the line in the sand and call it a day.   Liberals on the other hand will swear up and down that they are my allies but when I turn around they plunge the dagger in my back. The squad and others were hanging out and having a field day (there is plenty of Google photo evidence to this) with Louis Farrakhan (known and video evidence anti Semite) and Linda sarsour who also promulgated hate towards Israel and by extension Jews.   As a Jew I'm more afraid of liberals and Democrats then I am the kkk or neonazis  End if the day kkk and neonazis pose a minimal threat while liberals are the wolf in sheep's clothing waiting for the opportunity to strike.	Now I am aware this doesn't directly answer your question but it does answer it. If men did whatever they wanted, they would likely lose or eliminate options in attracting women. Women like men who work and provide and pursue them. They don't like men who do not work or provide or do not pursue them. The only feasible way to stop men from pursuing women is to make pursuing women a less successful strategy then pursuing women. That would mean that women would have to overwhelmingly pursue men that did not pursue them and ignore men who did pursue. Even that would not solve the issue bc men would then need to solely attract women via either looks or status or power or money so they would still be forced to be successful in a meaningful way or be ignored. Not pursuing is only a viable strategy if you are being pursued constantly and even then it is beneficial to pursue bc it increases your options. So the answer to your problem is not for men to stop pursuing but for WOMEN to pursue more and be less picky about partners then men are now. Since they risk pregnancy that will not happen. So then we must think about what women are willing to pursue and that tends to be relationships which are more beneficial to women than to men. However that then leads us right back to men pursuing sex and women pursuing relationships/commitment/security. In short we won't change bc there is no motivation to change and the opposite sex changing is the only motivation to change. This is blatantly obvious since the changes in modernity only happened due to female hormonal birth control and modern convenience changed womens motivations and that changed men. Perhaps male non hormonal birth control or artificial wombs or changing the laws around marriage could have a similar effect but short of changing the desires and needs of the women, men will not change."	0.906

My grandma was terminally ill and was of clear mind until the very last days. She spent her last year bedridden and unable to move but completely clear minded.

I've had this conversation recently and I fully agree with you. People here are trying to argue that power is a broad term, but I say it isn't, because you are particularly referring to the power they have to permanently ruin lives on a whim. The power to send someone to prison is something society takes too lightly.   Others argue that you can counter them with money (equally powerful lawyers) just proves the point. The majority of people doesn't have the kind of money you would need to very technically argue your case. The fact that you have to navigate the law with money just shows that even if justice is blind, it is effected by the smell of money.   Judges do not serve justice, they serve their own whims when they decide someone needs to serve a harsh sentence if they're having a bad day. I am deeply disturbed by this fact.  The solution I came up with is to have multiple judges independently decide if a sentence is just. People will argue that it will be expensive and cumbersome. I argue that if you were in a position where you wanted a fair outcome, you would want the best possible practice.  I have zero faith in the justice system as it currently stands.

Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis).

Crawl back to your echo chamber, pathetic little worm.	<p>The point that we shouldn&#39;t judge because we have been indoctrinated into our own culture&#39;s morality is based on the fact that we tend to be critical of other cultures morality without first examining out own and that we tend to be critical of other cultures without taking the time to understand them first.</p>	0.845
Why dont you read though this and let me know if you have any problems with the big words.      https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/pdfs/mm7104e2-h.pdf	I mean, it may not be the most technically accurate term, but if I'm accusing someone of being a Nazi and their defenders pipe up with ""actually, they're a Neo-Nazi,"" I think I'd be justified in accusing them of arguing semantics."	0.88
Have you ever looked into it outside a classroom or Jewish approved documentary? Ya know, a different POV. Watch Europa: The Last Battle if you don’t want to be an ignorant clown.	I found this comment browsing your profile (hence why I'm not upvoting; it'd be ""inorganic"" and I've heard *the algorithm* hates that or something), but I'm already well aware of how they sacrifice both public safety *and* personal freedom for the sake of conforming with whoever screams the loudest about hypocritically moralizing wedge issues.

This is all kinds of massive dumb	But if we can satisfy their desire, why not? That's kind of the problem. Sure, it's not the biggest hurdle, but what's the argument for putting *any* hurdle? Generally speaking, in the U.S. we don't think you should have to move to be enfranchised.	0.828
>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat. So way to win an argument by not even playing by the rules of this sub. Are you proud??	<p>Nazism is a very specific ideology, and it feels like you’re trying to water down the meaning of it in order to score political points. There’s nothing wrong with pointing out the atrocities committed by the US government, but the United States is not run by a fascist single-party authoritarian government that wishes to exterminate a particular race of people. No amount of “well but technically they shielded some Nazis from prosecution!” can change that. You could say they were sometimes uncomfortably sympathetic to or enabling of Nazis, but that’s not the same as being a Nazi.</p>	0.878
Not trying to be that guy, but I think your viewpoint is the common viewpoint rather than the devils advocate.   The only thing I would add is I think it’s totally fine if their salary is cut in half and each of them get half the money if they want separate bank accounts.	Lol ok, so now we're getting into it. The reason that you're so resistant to the idea is that you just legitimately don't know anything about Hitler.	0.846
That's not how rational discourse works, that's not how debate works, and that's not how CMV works.   If you make an argument in your OP, it is up for debate. When someone comes along and disagrees with that point in your argument that you can no longer counter, you don't get to say "no no no, I just mentioned that, it isn't actually what I want to talk about."  That is a bad faith argument and you are no longer able to be debated against when you refuse to concede even an INCH of ground from your original topic against someone who makes a rational argument against your initial topic.   You brought up the mandate protests. That makes them a topic that is on the table for conversation. Then, when you ran out of arguments about that point, you just said "no no no, I don't wish to discuss mandate protests any more."   If you want to change the conversation that is allowed to be debated in this topic, then that is a VIEW CHANGE. otherwise, you're just making bad faith arguments that any time you hit a wall against you can then just change the topic of conversation again to steer it away from a point you brought into the debate to begin with.	You don't seem to understand the difference between saying an argument is wrong because of motive and dismissing an argument because of motive. Let's say someone in full on Nazi regalia wanted to argue that Hitler was good. You can pretty safely conclude that this Nazi in front of you isn't going to come at this discussion with an open mind, so you dismiss their argument out of hand from the start. That's not a fallacy, maybe Hitler really is good. But if you're going to hear this argument it's going to have to come from someone already not a Nazi.	0.814
Let's face it: if you only award salary based on how much work you can do, aptitude, etc. you'd get prorated down to 10 cents an hour, bud.	<p>Picking this Churchill thing as if that’s the sole focus of discussion in the UK is also just a bad faith argument, why not mention Windrush? Why not mention the Ghurkas? Why not mention the disproportionate number of BAME deaths from COVID? Do they not fit into your worldview? </p>	0.861

I’m saying this is a very very specific situation, and you specifically don’t want an actual person with an extraordinarily unique disability to get paid, even though that person has a degree and works. I think that’s a dickish position, or at the very least, wrong. I personally am happy for them that they made it work, not mad that one of them is getting too much money.	<p>I would use exercise  as the example that disproves your point. There are many studies showing that Exercise can be AS GOOD OR BETTER than anti-depressant drugs. Exercise is literally a form of suffering, we tax our bodies beyond what is comfortable, and we grow stronger physically and also mentally. If we don&#39;t move our bodies and stress them enough, our minds will create more stress and suffering. This is a part of the human condition.</p>	0.853
Omg shut up.

Not here to change your view, i agree, its disgusting.	<p>I&#39;m certainly not saying that tens of thousands of deaths per year isn&#39;t a problem, but the solution to that problem should not infringe on people&#39;s rights. How would you feel if owning a car was continually made more and more difficult each year, just because a few jackasses stole a car and mowed down a crowd of people? Why should you be punished for their actions? And the funny thing is, measures of control almost always end up affecting the responsible people and do nothing to stop the people who want to commit crime.</p>	0.843
https://www.thethings.com/bully-adele-weight-loss-100-pounds-stress/	<p>So a world so divided by polity is somehow acting simultaneously as a cult?

Tell me your a cowboys fan without telling me your a cowboys fan lol	<p>Racism ought to be only specifically trying to oppress people because of their race. Not anything that happens to disproportionately cause people of a race any unpleasantness. Capitalism isn&#39;t racism. Preferring tradition over modernity isn&#39;t racism.

Meh, I'm happy I got 'cut", but I understand the sentiment.	The Clinton administration took Al Qaida very seriously after the embassy bombings and the USS Cole.  The Bush administration ignored the warnings from the Clinton people coming in and didn't resource the task forces tracking Al Qaida (Similar to the Trump administration ignoring the Pandemic playbook the Obama administration put together).  This has been widely known in foreign policy circles for decades, but is now starting to get some mainline press coverage as well.  Doing a quick google search, I can even find some pres articles about it as far back as 2004, so it's not like it was completely ignored.	0.88
[Oral circumcision ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26407411/)	What am I supposed to think of those people? Up until the vaccine, I wouldn't feel safe sharing the same room with them, because for all I know, they could infect me with a deadly disease _they don't believe is real_. That's not an exaggeration, by the way. My father had a good friend who was pretty conservative, and they stopped talking during the pandemic because this friend _would not wear a mask or practice social distancing_. Am I supposed to somehow unlearn this, and pretend it didn't happen?	0.857
Why would you think id find value in a CNN article when the two news orgs on the list I gave you are known for being not bias and are a gold standard for reporting?  Hence the primary reason in listing them in the first place.    Beyond that, its an article about how a few people feel.    Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....  There's a lot to bitch about, but diversity in the inner circle does not appear to be valid?  https://www.facebook.com/POTUS/photos/a-cabinet-that-looks-like-america/171170408292829/  1	I think it's reasonable to have a difference of opinion and a reasoned discussion on where life as a human begins, you don't.

Thank you.  Learn from your loss.  Be better.	Another assumption is that by virtue of being a nonhuman technologically advanced intelligence they must have a planet based civilization. Hence the need to travel from their home planet in some distant solar system to ours. But any technologically advanced civilization that lives into deep technological time is far more likely to be a space based civilization. This is technological feasible for us at present. Though the engineering requirements would be rather extreme. And once some segment of the human population becomes completely space based expansion throughout this galaxy can happen shockingly fast, given the nature of exponential growth.	0.802

It's good, LGBT should be banned!	<p>The fact of the matter is, we can&#39;t even conclude such a thing from two identical twin human beings. Because science does not allow for a quality comparison. Pain is not very well understood, scientifically. And you are trying to state beliefs based on science, but you don&#39;t have the background and expertise of the field experts that conduct the research you&#39;re citing, and yet you still feel qualified to go leaps and bounds past what those experts can confidently state.

i mean i don't think you really want us to change your view.. you just want to give your opinion traction and an audience.. i'm all in with you.. good job writing this post and good job doing what you are doing. islam is indeed one of the truly oppressive forces to gay rights...   i'd say the most oppressive forces are as follows...   1. death threats from conservatives(this is mostly Islam)   2. Christian conservatives(maybe not as hostile generally but very oppressive   3. laws that don't protect us around the world(many laws of oppression still exist)   .. after that i think it gets a bit more confusing as to where the source is.. but there sure are a lot of assholes out there.	<p>If you would like to appeal, review our appeals process <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modstandards#wiki_appeal_process"">here</a>, then <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fchangemyview&amp;subject=Rule%202%20Appeal%20FreeHumanity15&amp;message=FreeHumanity15%20would%20like%20to%20appeal%20the%20removal%20of%20%5Bhis/her%20post%5D(https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mvbr5s/-/gvbkxjl/)%20because..."">message the moderators by clicking this link</a> within one week of this notice being posted.

100% of people who have come into contact with DHMO have died as a result of it's reaction with the body. How can you ignore that?	<p>In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect <strong>the minority of the opulent</strong> <em>against the majority</em>. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability. Various have been the propositions; but my opinion is, the longer they continue in office, the better will these views be answered.</p>	0.845
!delta  While I am usually against “correlation must mean causation”, the fact that 100% of human beings who come into contact with it die.. that metric is making me reconsider my position.

Good post mate 😁✌🏻 You aren’t Islamaophobic, you are simply stating the reality of life for countless LGBT living in constant fear under the theocracy that helps govern almost all of the countries you listed. You will of course get non stop “whataboutism” from over emotional hacks, but that being said it doesn’t change the facts. Also, the hypocrisy of these defenders is often times astounding as they will decry China’s treatment of the Uyghurs who are placed in “re-education” camps to curb what they view are extremist beliefs which can (and has) lead to terrorism.. all the while supporting or at least defending throwing gays off buildings and/or stoning them. I agree with neither of those for the record since it has to be said in todays cringe world. There are Muslims like Maajid Nawaz who I respect a great deal as he and many others are attempting to reform Islam and its more extreme beliefs and practices. Also, for the idiots who say “[insert other religion here] used to do XYZ” - yes and they have already undergone their reforms in the past to the point they’ve reached today. Ffs even the Catholic Church, which has had some of the strongest anti-LGBT beliefs, their leader Pope Francis has holds more conciliatory views on LGBT as opposed to the past.  Oh and prior to him they weren’t throwing gays off buildings so there’s that as well.	Doesn't it? The law says:	0.768

No	As another note, I'd be interested in how you're defining religion.  What is 'religion'?

Lucky you; never change. Alcohol is literally poison.

Another would have the contrary one, and they wouldn&#39;t care about others or society. Rape brings them pleasure and they find what brings them pleasure moral, simple. Then, following your position, what actions should you take? To let them rape since you acknowledge they are right and free to follow their preference. If you don&#39;t, then your actions are no longer of a subjectivist&#39;s. You dictate your morals objective. Yet, you insist on saying it&#39;s subjective.

It's true. I can't even keep track of the number of times I've said "permanent and life changing" instead of "invasive and medically unnecessary". Naturally, the only choice is to just gaslight people by pretending you said the right thing the whole time.	<p>Product is legalized </p>	0.718
You are focusing on something I have already clarified, many times, and are both acting Hostile and accusing me of acting in bad faith. Clarification is not gaslighting, and by conflating the two you are degrading actual examples of actual gaslighting, and convincing others that it's a term that can be used to just shut down discussion. You really should consider learning what gaslighting actually is.	<p>The evidence does certainly suggest that gender identity is <em>congruent with biological sex</em> for a significant majority of people. <em>Transgender</em> people are rare exceptions to that who we simply don&#39;t understand very well scientifically, and while their needs must be considered , this also should be done in a way that does not interfere with the rights of <em>cis</em> people.

True, I agree with your opinion, particularly as fundamentalist Islam carries so much weight in the countries you’ve highlighted, in addition to quite a few others, such as Brunei. I remember when the sultan of Brunei proposed a law to stone homosexuals to death when it introduced a new set of regulations that were based on sharia law. However, he backtracked after global boycotts of Bruneian businesses and protests outside of embassies, showing that perhaps political pressure can work in certain circumstances. However, homosexuals are still incredibly oppressed in Brunei, and I have to agree that fundamentalist Islam is the greatest oppressor of the LGBT community.	We don't even have 100% accurate neurological markers for identifying someone's sexual orientation or if they're left or right handed, yet those are accepted socially as innate traits that we trust people to express. So even though we have somewhat accurate neurological markers for gender identity, that still shouldn't be used to deny people's identity. Both because we can't be sure they're 100% accurate and also because other atypical neurological developments don't require the same burden of proof in our society."	0.845

guiness and stella.  inb4 "you tried X? why didn't you try Y?"	You can't feel like a man or a woman - you just are one. It is just a basic fact - biology. You could however feel disconnected in regards to what gender role you are being assigned based on your biology - you just then simply not care about those and live authentically - dress and act however you please, you aren't a new category though.	0.803
Okay Islamophobe. lmao	I have no problem with dicks if am prepared to see one. I did question women around me and most were not ok with being in all women section and seeing a dick. But like you said, we can use then different facility. But also at this rate having all men and women section is useless too.  </p>	0.865
Good for you. The op just posts anti Islamic articles and has zero interest in having their view change.  How many millions of people suffered before same sex marriage was recognized?	Arguably an ideologically unified society would run smoother, if you can even find such a place because disagreement is everywhere, but why genetics? Why would homogeneity of genomes lead to a more cohesive society? The only thing I know for sure genetic homogeneity causes is birth defects and genetic disorders. Granted that's a tad extreme but I really don't see what genes has to do with it.	0.887
> ... and accusing me of acting in bad faith... clarification is not gaslighting...  Lying about never having said something when it's quite obvious that you did would easily both be gaslighting and acting in bad faith.	<p>And asides from that, do you hold this same line of reasoning towards dogs, hamster, rabbits, birds or literally any other pet other than cats? Do you believe that all pets should be allowed to roam wherever they want and come and go as they please? And if your answer is no, then why not?</p>	0.812
Lol holy fucking shit. Are you literally comparing trans peoples panic attacks to the suffering of LGBT in Muslim nations? You seriously think this is comparable in any capacity? That’s incredibly stupid.   It’s a good thing that almost all nations don’t use the teachings of the Catholic Church to make their laws then isn’t it?	The utility of the concept of ""sex"" has to do with, well, sex; it's [used in biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex) to describe the *reproductive capabilities* of an organism. It's also really easy conceptually; you get four categories (male, female, hermaphroditic, and none) based on whether you produce exclusively male, exclusively female, or both male and female gametes; or no gametes whatsoever).	0.83
Clarification =/= lying my guy. I may have phrased it poorly but that doesn't mean I'm acting in bad faith or gaslighting. First off, It's literally impossible for me to gaslight in this situation because there is a history of what I've said. Secondly, saying someone is lying when they misspeak is disingenuous and toxic, and am *actual example of gaslighting.* How could you possibly know my intent better than me?	3) you may be underestimating the number of people who either don't drink coffee for the taste, or simply don't notice a difference. I like good coffee. I have a local roaster that I'll order from to get really good beans, and when I'm at home I'll rock a French press or use my little espresso machine. When I'm working at the office, though, i drink folgers. It tastes like a muddy napkin, but I'm under no illusion that I'm drinking the stuff for its refined notes of dumpster juice and flopsweat. I'm drinking it because i have an unhealthy sleep cycle and caffeine is what gets me through the day. At that point, it doesn't matter if it's folgers, chock full o nuts, or whatever that crazy expensive stuff is that they harvest from monkey poop. I just want it to get me through that next meeting that could've been an email.	0.735
I wouldn’t bother trying to reason with this troll, you’ll be called a homophobe and a fascist for not taking trans people having a fit as seriously as being stoned to death.	Yes, if the hypothesis about brain structures is true (there's limited evidence, but it isn't universally accepted), it would technically be part of the sex. However, this is not how sex is now understood, so we'd either have to change the common definition of sex or just call it ""gender identity"". I mean, in the end the brain is part of biology, but we tend to separate mental things from physical things. We don't say being German is a biological thing, but if you call yourself German it's also because your neurons are arranged in a certain way, isn't it? The only difference is national identity can change through life, while gender identity seems to be stable."	0.849
What a ridiculous thing to say. You’re claiming that some transsexual having a fit is comparable to a public execution? That’s simply a despicable thing to say, and I don’t care what childish names you call me. This is why wokeism needs to be stamped out, I can’t take you people seriously anymore.	I don't quite get what you're saying in your first paragraph. Could you explain further? It's not that a man is born in a woman's body, and it's not people thinking they're biologically a woman when they're not. It's that eventually they might realize that their gender doesn't match their sex. You can't really willingly change your gender, just like you can't willingly change your sexual orientation. Their body is biologically male, but if their gender is female they can transition to present themselves aligned with their gender rather than their sex."	0.828
Well what a dumb fucking point to make then. Of course more people are affected, Christian nations have a higher population than Muslims and a higher gay population because they aren’t executing them.   What an irrelevant and dumb fucking idea to even attempt to bring up as valuable.	<p>If not letting a man who even just claims to identify as a woman in gives that man grounds to sue the shelter for discriminating his rights as a trans woman, then yes, they would either have to declare war on the state (which i hope they do) or have to let literally EVERY man in who claims to identify as a woman.</p>	0.882
>I wouldn’t bother trying to reason with this troll, you’ll be called a homophobe and a fascist for not taking trans people having a fit as seriously as being stoned to death.  Please, you suddenly show up in LGBT subs and start mocking people. You said that trans people should have to undergo constant psychiatric evaluation.   You vomit when people talk about trans things.  You literally spent hours complaining that i stalk you and yet you show up here calling me a troll.	<p>What we know about history is that no vaccine that has ever been studied has elicited a side effect that didn’t appear within a 2 month timespan.

Yes, that was about transracialism. Praise be we have stalkers like you to remind us of this important point.	That's fine, but I didn't. I knew what Lovecraft meant, but I saw it as 'Oh man, it'd be messed up if fish demons started trying to pass as humans' rather than 'Oh man, things would go to shit if we allowed black people and white people to intermingle.' Or rather, I acknowledged the existence of that part of it, and then rejected that I will take away from the story.	0.872
It will shut people up around you, you might think I'm being glib with that answer, but it's a real consideration. You are probably right, you probably aren't in any appreciable danger, but it shuts people up and it won't hurt you.	<p>“but I don’t really fit into the stereotypes of s girl so I don’t think I’m fully a girl” and that’s sexist and wrong because it is enforcing gender sterotypes.</p>	0.929
>Yes, that was about transracialism. Praise be we have stalkers like you to remind us of this important point.  Nope it wasn't why do you keep lying?	first of all, i mean this just undermined what you wrote above it completely, so i mean whatever fine, that's fine, yes i agree it does require some amount of recognition of others.  my original point in that giant post was that because society is in bitter disagreement about how one attains a gender identity, whether by being born a certain gender or by individual choice, that there isn't really a single way gender is defined.  so to say ""trans women are women"" wouldn't strictly be true, because it is a contested statement; half of society says they are, half of society says they are not.  gender being a social construct works both ways.	0.926
I’m not lying about anything, I’m calling out your abhorrent statements that you seem to churn out every day.

Actually, I have no desire to change your opinion. You're so far off the reservation that any sort of changing of minds wouldn't be worth the effort. You started by saying that maybe just a little bit "jaded", welp that's the understatement of the century. You're full on a fkn nut job and frankly no one should take you seriously. Your unearned sense of moral superiority not withstanding, perhaps you should get a little therapy.	<p>Transgender women tend to have brain structures that resemble cisgender women, rather than cisgender men. Two sexually dimorphic (differing between men and women) areas of the brain are often compared between men and women. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalus (BSTc) and sexually dimorphic nucleus of transgender women are more similar to those of cisgender woman than to those of cisgender men, suggesting that the general brain structure of these women is in keeping with their gender identity.</p>	0.863

Alas, we live in the era of Poe's Law so I can't tell.	If this is the case for working from home, is it that hard to see it also being the case for hiring women? The reasons being the same reasons for the lower wages in the first place. Bosses/Managers might be convinced that hiring a woman wouldn't be as productive of a similarly-qualified man, or even think that sort of work is a ""man's job"" that women shouldn't even be doing. They'd know that they could pay them less, just as they know that they could pay someone working from home less. But, just as demanding in-office labor, they demand a man fill the job."	0.849
I never forget how old I am myself but every once in a while I remember that I'm consuming content on Reddit from teenagers half my age.	>The trans movement also says that anyone who identifies as a woman has to be accepted as a woman, even if everyone sees them as a man and they've never experienced sexism.

honestly, this is borderline racist	A cat doesn’t care about the suffering of the animal it eats. Cats are known to toy with their food before killing it, something humans consider cruel. There is no forcing of any morality, cats simply do not care about factory farming or the suffering of their food. To pretend like they do is you trying to place human morality on a cat. You can show a cat videos of animal cruelty that happens in factory farming on YouTube all you want, the cat will never care. Cats eat the organs, skin and everything else of their kills. To a cat, ground up fish guts are no different than mouse guts. To insist this is gross or immoral is not just a fundamental misunderstanding of cats as creatures, but is a very western and human centric idea all together."	0.833
Yes. Anyone with half a brain can see that things have gotten better in spite of race baiting horseshit like this.	<p>As for why you have no validity on this topic is because you have not experienced the results or outcomes of your view. You may suppose a hypothesis here but to argue against any rebuttal posed against you, you have no background on this matter to argue back. If I tell you, you are wrong and this harms children you have no experience or data to disprove me where as I can for certain tell you that when my 18 year old son is doing nothing but dropping f bombs every other word it gets old. It sounds cool to him, because like you, he’s young and it makes him feel empowered but in the end everyone around him gets tired of it.

Agreed. Hump it and dump it. Fatherlesness increases your chane of becoming a felon by 46% and lowers your chance of graduating by 39%	<p>I (assigned male at birth) certainly don’t feel like a woman in any way, but I also would never say that I identify as male. To me, “maleness” means being aggressive, liking sports, etc. —traits that are socially constructed. Thus, it’s hard for me to imagine how someone can identify as the opposite sex without discussing socially constructed roles.</p>	0.871
Bullshit. You’re trying to drive a wedge between people with different colored skin. You’re exaggerating what is wrong to keep people from coming together.

You're not looking at the same graph as me if you think you can narrow anything down to 1000 years based on that graph.      You either don't know how to read graphs or you're being disingenuous to push a narrative if you try to make conclusions on 1000 year time frames from that graph.

So I was right, it's a bit of both.	<p>Good parents do the best with the information that they have.
