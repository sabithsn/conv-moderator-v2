If you buy the houses that city folks are buying you won't have city folks duhhhhhhh	As an exemple, I'd say my mother is the kind of person who pushed you through your struggles ,, as in - she doesn't allow you to give up or take a break or anything because that's """"weak,"""" and she screams and insults you if you do because that's her way of motivating people, with anger fuel you see ?	0.878
If you buy the houses that city folks are buying you won't have city folks duhhhhhhh	She feels so close to being organic/human compared to Hayward or Woo but she just feels more like belonged in tv world/Hex the way she acts then when she enters the Hex it honestly feels like nothing changed aside from her feeling a bit forced. She like many of the others outside of the hex  never have even a few moments where they're just acting normal hell even one moment where the Hex causes mass panic and she just turns off the jokes would give her more depth since you could say maybe the jokes are her awkward way of connecting(though you'd have to cut out or change Woo since he's sort of the same)."	0.874

That's honestly why you'll find a lot of sensible people hating on the uber rich. They aren't even making money working anymore, it's literally their money making money... appreciating assets, paying to have people lobby for tax rules that benefit them, campaigns to squash unions..... the point it's snowballing and has been since the mid to late 80s. These people have gotten enough money to be effectively be more powerful than our elected officials and they serve no one but themselves. To make it worst, they've brainwashed half the population into believing that if the rich get taxed somehow joe-smo in Alabama making $40k a year is going to get hit.... you do the math and joe-smo is paying 22% of in gross income per year while the mighty Bezos is paying like 1% of his. Don't take my word for it.... Google some rich people and see how much they pay vs how much they make.	0.847

We’ve all been in this pandemic for over a year now as a result of people deciding that they’re willing to accept the individual risk involved in breaking the rules, without thinking about how it affects things overall. The government continuing to draw out lockdowns and mask mandates as a result of this could easily be compared to a class being held in from recess until everyone finishes their work. Some people can’t help that they’re struggling to do the work, so to speak, but others just aren’t doing it because they’re too busy joking around.	0.845

And no, you don’t owe anyone anything and never will. But some people will be too fragile with rejection, so they need to grow a backbone. Once again, it’s not your responsibility to help them to.

Everything starts as ‘nothing’ from a state of just existing. We then define Good or Evil, by the affects of their actions if they are conscious.

For Example: If a medication as beneficial, then you could say ‘good’, but it is actually helpful, because it fixes an infliction. The word ‘good’ is used in a moral statement, where as when talking about thing it is good as a beneficial ways, instead of a moral way.</p>	0.854

People will just say you are a Karen and don't know how to drive if you criticize them for speeding.	Black Lives Matter is a slogan created because they feel like a black person dies and it just doesn't matter.  They believe, with years of experience, that society feels that black people don't matter, and they're there to say they do.  When a BLM protester says Black Lives Matter, they're obviously not saying ""Only Black Lives Matter"" or ""Other Lives Don't"".  Those have been pretty obvious Conservative reframing because 'Black Lives Matter Too' is universally agreed upon by all but open White Supremacists."	0.817

People will just say you are a Karen and don't know how to drive if you criticize them for speeding.	I won't comment on those who participated in slavery, Nazism, or anything of the sort.  I'll just say that they lived in a completely different context, and they had motivations that most people today would be completely unable to understand. Southern segregationists believed black emancipation would lead to whites being targeted for violent revenge, and that Northern intervention was an unjustified violation of their rights. Nazi supporters resented Jews for their implication in the Bolshevik revolution, financial abuses, and other things that modern people would consider perfectly fine, like the promotion of homosexuality and pornography.	0.813

Maybe if what happens to people who support Nazis in Germany happened to those who still support racism in America, we would be able to make an effort at ridding our country of our dark past.

They do protect in certain kind of accidents but the numbers are low even in countries that have lots of cycling and they deter a LOT of cyclists of even using bikes so after two decades of trial and error, most countries are de facto no-helmet required. Here it is age related, kids have to wear them, adults can decide but legally.. it is a law you should wear them. Insurance isn&#39;t void if you are not wearing them since they are de facto not required and not all cyclist even knows they should be wearing one. Also helmets make car drivers act more aggressively, this is researched and for ex passing distances halve when cars pass a cyclist with a helmet. The consequences are seen as less, so the risk of hurting cyclists do not resonate the same way. Cycle helmet is one of those special cases where something that is marginally creating actual safety creates even more apparent safety and weird psychological behavior, to a point where it is better we don&#39;t mandate their use.</p>	0.8

I haven’t seen abuse this severe since your dad beat the fuck out of your mom	<li>The problem is we’re not talking about something as abstract as religion.

Refusing to yield to faster traffic is more dangerous than speeding.  There is nothing more infuriating than being in the middle of a multi-hour road trip and having someone in the left lane who will not move over to let you by, despite going under the speed limit.  What makes the most sense is that you must yield to overtaking traffic if you are in any lane except the right lane (i.e. passing lanes).  For some reason, some people are either unaware that there are other cars on the road or they feel entitled to dictate the flow of traffic. Slow traffic not moving out of the passing lanes is what causes traffic jams and accidents due to many people passing on the right.  Slow driving in passing lanes is oblivious at best, usually inconsiderate, and dangerous at worst. Let the speeders do their thing in passing lanes, and let highway patrol do their jobs.	https://www.livescience.com/9578-common-ancestor-blue-eyes.html	0.765

Bond market* the fed did swaps with bonds not stocks	<p>You can&#39;t just set aside politics. Politics and economics are just two sides of the same coin. You&#39;re right when you say automation should eliminate drudgery. However, the main, big, problem is that automation science and ingenuity is aimed at trivializing labor altogether and empowering the rich. Automation is being used to empower managers and wealthy shareholders, whereas it&#39;s entirely possible automation could be used to empower workers and even make upper management more irrelevant.</p>	0.866
Bond market* the fed did swaps with bonds not stocks	Yes, like most people. Everybody wants more money. Whatever position you are in. Keeping some costs down free's it up for other things such as the execs pay. But the reason they can lower that pay is because the demand for that work and *generally* the lower the skill required the higher the demand.If suddenly there was a huge shortage of cashier level employee's, they'd have to comete more against other employers for those empoyees.	0.862
Bond market* the fed did swaps with bonds not stocks	<p>Like I said, you&#39;re the Dunning-Kruger effect personified.

Is that happening often enough?— no coz not enough women are believed, not enough are being done about it in a corporate level let  alone within the legal sphere. Then the next question is the criminal procedure flaws—too long, too costly therefore rich people win. These rapists who walk free are probably rich too. So? Still need to be tough on these guys right? But how……… being tougher on rapists will not get these powerful, rich rapists into jail. So what next?</p>	0.858
Bond market* the fed did swaps with bonds not stocks	Employee owned cooperatives are making more money as a result of inflation and because it's a co-op the owners make more as a result.

Thank you for your life story!	<p>It reminds me of when they went on about Adam Lanza having Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. I mean, he did absolutely awful things, but by immediately saying that he had such and such a condition, immediately people latch onto that. Speaking as someone who is neurodivergent,  it is annoying. It&#39;s universal in the world of mental illness, unfortunately. We stigmatize constantly. It&#39;s just that those with paedophillic disorder are scorned even more so, and it&#39;s even worse than stigmatizing other conditions because kids are at risk.</p>	0.838

Wow, TIL	Posts like this also ignore the fact that brands like Gucci and LV are popular because they hold their value. Unlike a Supreme tshirt, you buy a LV/Gucci bag and keep it in good condition, and you can sell it for at least 50% of what you paid if not more. The LV canvas and Gucci leather tend to be incredibly durable. When I used to buy Coach, the handles would be cracking within 6 months of every day use. Been carrying my current LV for nearly two years now, and other than some wrinkling on the strap, it still looks brand new. You can buy vintage LV and Gucci pieces decades old that are still in killer condition."	0.761

Gotta start with small demands, and grow them overtime. 😎	<p>The reason Rowling is a particular sticking point is because progressivism is very popular with millenials and a lot of millenials grew up reading Harry Potter and hold it dearly.

Now that some poor, deliberately uneducated, country folks are realizing that their communities wealth has been systematically stripped away by international tax avoiding companies they're starting to doubt their worldview.

Soon enough they'll realize that they have more in common with BIPOC/LGBTQ Americans, who've seen Lord knows how many of the next Rosa Parks, MLKs, or Malcolm Xs get lost to the prison industrial complex/addiction/disability/state sponsored murder.

How it should work is you get lets say 10 sick days at the begining of the year. You can use it for when you or your kid is sick. You can also use it for mental health days as well. Say you don't get sick or you didn't use all the sick time. Well, you get paid out at the end of the year. That way people aren't calling off just to call off. & we are giving more sick time so that people don't come to work sick and getting other employees and clients sick.	0.775

I’m sure some parents are just controlling, but I bet a lot of them are just trying to keep their kids safe. I don’t think it’s the right move for the examples you gave, but maybe that gives a little insight.	0.863
You’re missing the point. The colonizers are unequivocally solely held as evil despite even the native tribes conquering others whereas everyone universally holds slavery as wrong.	Right, but it eliminated late fees and enabled them to defer payments, which caused monetary losses and even bankruptcy for some landlords. So it definitely wasn’t a “pro-landlord” policy. If you have data on other policies I’m happy to look at them.	0.777

What people DO say is that certain aspects of modern technology have come with certain negatives. Which is true. In response, they’ll often get a “I suppose you want to go back to the stone age?? People had it way worse back then!!”. Which is a fallacy of relative privation. People having it worse back in the day does not invalidate the fact that some modern technologies have spawned certain negatives:	0.733

It won’t give them the emotional intimacy. It may be able to fake it, but at some point most men will want to have a family and that isn’t going to be fulfilled by tech anytime soon.	0.817
Yep, you’ve still got nothing.  Troll.	Real men don't have mental problems, women have mental problems. Real men show up to work every day, that's what real men do, they don't claim to be sick because their anxiety is so bad they've shut down. Not allowed.	0.787

There’s a huge different between used and new cars, I was a finance manager at Mercedes for a few years, and left because of dickheads like u/sibre2001 who is the exact type of customer I’m talking about. 20 something year old who things he’s something in life. I  got out of it and work as an aircraft mechanic, manage the booking at a family car lot and do occasional consulting at a real estate broker on my wife’s side of the family.	So that means that they're often putting themselves into abusive situations simply to satisfy an issue with intimacy which isn't healthy.  The sex itself? Good fun, but also often makes babies that end up without fathers again.  Overall a negative.  If mom is doing it all with intent and has a stable plan for her kids as a single mom then it's all doable these days, just some obvious issues with it in the long run.  If she's got plans to be single but still have the dad in the picture so they grow up with a father even better.	0.842

I just feel like if the parents engaged their kids instead of sitting on their phones. And also considered their surroundings then it wouldn&#39;t be an issue. But people poop put kids and then expect them to be self sustaining. It&#39;s just ridiculous.</p>	0.838
I bet you're an unmarried man. Men generally start complaining about this in their 30s and 40s unless they have wives who take on the entire mental burden of planning their social/vacation lives (a task which men rarely appreciate, nor thank their wives for). So my unasked for advice which you will never take is that you must start doing the social planning for yourself. Throw parties, ask people out to plays and movies, ask people to accompany you for dinner and coffee. Planning social time, you would soon see, is real work. Yet if you neglect it, as surely as your body turns to shit from not exercising, your spirit turns to shit from not socializing. My lived in 2 cents.	Where a professional could take care of her, my family would have been spared a LOT of PTSD and depression during our (the kids) formative years and my parents would have a healthier relationship. It seriously almost broke my family. So I agree with you, and don’t understand why people would give you so much hate for saying so. The only reason I could think of why they would react to a post like that would be because they have never actually gone through something like that themselves. Having to watch your nana disintegrate over time is seriously damaging to the human spirit."	0.851

Violating regulation is just as illegal as violating law and violating either can be used as grounds for men with guns to kick down your door.</p>	0.802

Your talking about conservatives, and I’m assuming your including me in there since you replied, taking responsibility??? Are you delusional? Why would anyone take responsibility for shootings and crime they didn’t commit. Just because Johnny decided to go crazy and shoot people doesn’t mean you now have the right to prevent me from acquiring a firearm. Your focusing on the wrong thing buddy. Guns aren’t the problem. A criminal with the intent to commit murder with a gun will find a way to buy a gun. American society will always include guns and that isn’t the problem. You just can’t accept the fact that criminals are the problem and then you take the easy route and point at the tool used in the crime. Smh"	0.795

My fiance has had  quite a few more partners as I did. But I looked past that knowing she is wonderful no matter what. I dont love her because of how many people she slept with, and back when I dated girls my first question wasnt „how many guys have you slept with“. Its just that if someone has to sleep with so many partners, then the probability of her being a match for me is getting lower. Not only because Of how I think about this, but also because theres usually a reason for someone to do do that. Either is it daddy issues, or lack of self esteem, maybe she just likes lots of sex with different guys, maybe she thinks its not a big deal. There is however a reason and all reasons I can think of contradict my opinion on what the future mother of my kids should look like.	0.796
weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don’t contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups’ beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I’ve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there’s a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It’s also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say “fine” when asked how he’s doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I’ve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of “gender” or why it’s a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you’ve said about sex is true - that doesn’t mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"

weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don’t contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups’ beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I’ve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there’s a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It’s also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say “fine” when asked how he’s doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I’ve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of “gender” or why it’s a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you’ve said about sex is true - that doesn’t mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"	<p>I never said I was pro toxicity, I&#39;m pro free speech. That protects your right to speech whether you say the nicest, meanest, or most &quot;controversial&quot; of things. The OP mentioned that its the other person&#39;s fault if you get offended but that&#39;s total BS. Words are just words (with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions"">limits</a> of course). If you let words get to you, then its your fault.</p>	0.826

People can just experience it, whether it’s a chemical imbalance or genetic or whatever.  It’s dangerous to tell people they have no reason to be depressed because it trivialises their suffering and can trigger them into self harm.</p>	0.861

Because normalizing belief in something false is bad. The trans identity is not one that is valid.	Your morals don't align with other people's. This might be a shocker. Some people might care less about hiring a racist than they care about hiring a whore. You'd whine when your sister lost her job due to her part-timing on OnlyFans because it ""ISN'T ILLEGAL"" and applaud while someone loses their job over being a racist on the side despite it not being illegal.	0.901
Because normalizing belief in something false is bad. The trans identity is not one that is valid.	instagram if anything makes ppl more insecure, even attractive people.  girls tend to compare themselves to others on the site.  body image issues are worse bc of social media, if you actually want to talk about the issues with insta.  and nobody is sleeping with the thirsty guys in their ig comments - it’s not competition, it’s just lust.  guys at work aren’t losing out to guys online bc women don’t just date the first guy to compliment them - that’s not how relationships work.  and if women being confident in their bodies prevents you from getting laid, you shouldn’t be getting laid in the first place.  this isn’t a real problem that actually exists.  people still have sex, just like they always have."	0.894
Because normalizing belief in something false is bad. The trans identity is not one that is valid.	I won't sugar coat this but you are right, *some* females suck, and it has nothing do with the other party being a male. As harsh as they can be to men, they are much more cruel to other females. As a female, it makes it difficult to be genuine friends with them. They are the ones that suck other females into a world of false pretenses and mixed signals where the only value is gratifying their ego and being a completely replaceable shoulder to cry on. That is why I personally appreciate male friendships so much. But I won't ever apologize for trusting a man like my brother and not wanting to fuck them, and I am not a bad person for that.	0.892
Because normalizing belief in something false is bad. The trans identity is not one that is valid.	But yeah, calm down.

I literally never said that trans people transitioning hurts me or that it require more than minimal effort to respect their pronouns. You keep saying that in every comment as if I somehow denied that. So for the millionth time, I choose not to use pronouns that trans people claim to be theirs because I do not believe those are the correct pronouns for reasons previously mentioned. By decision to not use the pronouns is not based on fear or laziness, but on respect for the truth of which the identity that trans people claim is not.	<p>Also, it&#39;s only short term. Eventually the rich people won&#39;t have as much for you to tax. A better solution to give the government more money for Congress to burn would be to boost the economy by lowering taxes. The long and short is that that will cause more money to change hands, which the government will take pieces of for taxes.</p>	0.871

You make classes like taxes, investing, check account balancing core classes that you must take and must pass in order to progress into another grade like reading and math fundamentals.  I'm 100% behind shit like that.  While we live in this capitalist cesspool of horseshit, if we don't educate the populace, they will be the nancies of the system and get taken advantage of.  Shit, if I understood what I do now about investing and the market 20 years ago, I would be a fucking multi-millionaire right now.  The system we live in doesn't want that.  They don't want the children of plumbers and electricians and carpenters to become savvy investors, they want us to keep laboring like our parents do to keep the elites  rich and keep the rest of us poor as fuck.  The whole American dream is a bullshit concept to keep people working for shit they will never achieve because they don't have the education to do it.	0.853

If you taxed Billionaires at 100%... you'd have a few months of what they want to spend. Basic math says the money will come from somewhere else... and that somewhere else: everyone with higher inflation and the costs of living going up (thus making $15/hour not enough... time to start with $25/hour... or should we just jump to $1m per hour so everyone is a millionaire that needs to pay more?)"	0.85

On the subject of spanking, I'm glad my parents used spanking as a corrective tool on me. It wasn't ever done out of anger and was always a metered punishment to make sure I understood the severity of my actions.

I rarely take 97 million photos of myself, because I don't really give a shit. The naraccisst I dated ripped my life and soul apart.

I literally have no idea who that is	It honestly made me feel sick to see that- I've already come to the conclusion that if my partner and I have kids. 100% they are not getting tech. They are not getting mummy or daddy's phone to play with. They are not being pacified by an electronic device. 🙄 When it becomes more necessary (like a tween getting their first cellphone because they're going out on their own and taking public transit and stuff and they need to be safe) fine. But before that? No. I literally cannot stand it."	0.824
I literally have no idea who that is	<p>The flip side is that less kids don&#39;t mean they actually raise them.
