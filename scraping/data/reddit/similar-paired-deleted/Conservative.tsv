The administration never changed hands because it was a fraud! Stop the steal!!!	<p>unfortunately for you pal, you&#39;re out of touch, and we know what is coming, and you won&#39;t know of it. we shall let you continue your deluded life for the time being, but a surprise is on the horizon. there is none to blame other than themselves now after all. i personally believe we all will continue to enjoy the scramble and panic of the DNC. you do not act in panic when you&#39;re confident in position. feel free to think we&#39;re mad at trivial shit. pretty sure we&#39;re all laughing at all the blunders in a short 52 days, as its just the beginning. nobody to blame, the gaffes and clearly being out of touch with average americans is already catching, 52 days for this much discontent among average americans in both parties. enjoy your delusion pal, you&#39;re completely out of touch and know nothing of our party and voters and personally id encourage everyone else to just be tight lipped and manipulate you, so you&#39;re more out of touch and you spread complacency and a false security of the DNCs position in power. it will not happen again, you can be sure of that. id look elsewhere, as you&#39;re blinded by your fragile ego, your subconscious is giving you a false sense of confidence as protection.</p>	0.828

I don't even think the person in question knows the answer to that.	<p>I hope Trump doesn’t run in 2024 because he’s still the greatest driver of democrat voter turnout that ever existed.  Plus he’s too old to run again. The trump era was fun but it’s over now.  Time to get behind someone like DeSantis who has a better shot</p>	0.801
I don't even think the person in question knows the answer to that.	<p>Even Trump (who i do not like at all at this point) is a much better candidate for 2024. Trump has a connection with white working class voters that someone like Cruz can never tap into. The strongest candidate is DeSantis. If 2024 is the no fuck up zone, then getting him nominated should be the goal.</p>	0.797
I don't even think the person in question knows the answer to that.	Not to mention, Trump got trounced because of minority voters.  If he got the same percentage of minority voters as did Bush (or suburban voters as did Bush) he remains President.  It wasn't big liberal cities that changed from 2016.  It was suburban middle class voters who turned on him.  Hell, if he got the same amount go suburban voters as Romney did, he remains president… His performance in the suburbs barely equaled McCain in 2008, and the walking corpse of Joe Biden is not nearly as charismatic as was a young Obama.	0.797
I don't even think the person in question knows the answer to that.	<p>Realistically all you would get at best is probably President Pelosi (who even if the election is proven fraudulent has a more valid claim to the Presidency than Biden or Harris). There’s no mechanism by which to make Trump president again, even with 100% irrefutable proof that he won.</p>	0.794
I don't even think the person in question knows the answer to that.	<p>I also don&#39;t think you can call the Biden coalition a populist movement. The average is better educated and richer than the average Trump voter. Plus populist movements like the Trump movement, at least in their rhetoric, do not ally themselves with big businesses. I&#39;d categorize the current movement within the Democratic party as a reactionary anti-populist movement. While Trumpism is pretty clearly an anti-establishment populist movement.</p>	0.79

You need a minimum of one per person per day, and likely several per person per day. So a minimal months supply for the US would be 330M * 30 = 9.9B. And you need to produce at least that many every month just to keep up. This doesn't account for healthcare workers changing masks with each patient, etc.	0.784

Good fuck’em	<p>You seem to be under the impression that the reasons for the implementation of authoritarian government all have the same motivation but it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. It&#39;s not as if genocide, media control, oppressive government, etc all just showed up once Marx put pen to paper, and labelling it all as &quot;left wing&quot; as if all evil is automatically left wing is just disengenuous and historically ignorant. It stinks of YouTube political commentary, which is oftentimes just laymen ranting.</p>	0.796

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4.

Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry.

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December.

The rights does it too, you actually do that on a daily basis.	Also, and I know I'm ranting at this point, I am tired of the argument that gen eds make you well rounded. They don't. You study for what you need to to get a decent grade and you move on and dump the info out. Unless you cared about literature, philosophy, creative writing, whatever, you weren't going to truly steep yourself in that path. I also don't need a professor to tell me how to read Meditations, or On Liberty, you can just do that yourself. The folks saying ""well you can talk to the teacher and the students about the subject and get new perspectives."" Yeah, I can also do that online for free on any forum that relates to that subject. Now if people wanna go STEM, I understand that. Access to labs and equipment is nice and having instructors who really understand how to use them/can instruct you on how to is nice, but even then there are plenty of YouTube videos out there. Honestly YouTube instructors helped me out more in EE than my professors did at times.	0.875
The rights does it too, you actually do that on a daily basis.	I do believe most teachers want their students to learn and will be happy to teach those that seek knowledge, but I also believe that most teachers don't understand this themselves.

Then you have the ones who do understand it but don't see it as worth their time to teach those who have no interest in trying - they'd rather pass them off to next year's teacher.	0.873
The rights does it too, you actually do that on a daily basis.	Trades should be talked about more in high school as well.

""Make sure you've got good grades for college."" Etc. In AR we have scholarships for university but I also haven't seen much for trades. There are local colleges that have trade certificates which is nice, but I don't know if they have many scholarship opportunities associates with them.	0.869

Lol and it looks exactly like you’d expect	<p>Once again, &quot;just Google&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t even know what to say lol&quot; are not answers or arguments or explanations. You are just claiming the US healthcare is terrible with no evidence whatsoever. The US absolutely isn&#39;t LAST lmfao. If they&#39;re last in maybe some specific thing I can believe that, but at least have an idea of what you&#39;re even claiming. Are you talking about OECD countries? Then in some areas we are last yes. But we are also the lowest cancer mortality rate in that list, and one of the best at preventative procedures, visits, and vaccination. We have a big obesity problem in this country which causes us to be lower on many things such as life expectancy too. So our healthcare is not terrible by any stretch, although it&#39;s not as efficient and isn&#39;t as easily accessible. Ignoring all that though, our healthcare system still has undeniably created most of the medical advancements in the past many decades which even allow countries to improve their healthcare to this point. That&#39;s just a fact. Where do you think all the new medicines and treatments come from? The US pulls more than its weight in drug/treatment research costs, and if other countries would share that burden then we&#39;d all be better off in the long term</p>	0.775

How is Biden going home on the weekend worse than Trump's 100+ trips to Mar-a-Lago and other resorts he owns where visitor logs are not maintained? Which one sounds more corrupt?	All in all interesting information. VERY different from what the US has been claiming about the vaccine, but does generally support the idea of the vaccine being a deterrent (except for hospitalization cases). Since there has def not been adequate amount of testing for long term side effects (can't speed up time, yet the fda somehow did for covid *cough cough political approval cough*) I still don't see this as being necessary for everyone to get, especially younger people. It's a solid idea for the older at risk population and only if they want it. The percent increases in benefits are pretty small considering vaccines are supposed to give you near 100% inoculation.	0.76

She is just smart and won on Jeopardy playing by the same rules as every other male, female, trans, etc.   It is one thing when a trans person uses their biological advantage to gain an "achievement" they otherwise don't deserve due to biology.

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.

The biggest threat to the red wave in my opinion is big tech and the continuation of the election was stolen narrative without hard evidence.  Truth is hard to find and recognize.  We&#39;re in a super-polarized political environment, like I&#39;ve never seen before.  The left is abandoning anything resembling liberal or American values, and the right is reacting.  Hell I don&#39;t know if the election was stolen or not... There is enough statistical anomaly to be very concerning, and also a history of cheating in some of these heavily Democrat areas.

Fuck DeSantis. He fucks up Florida and distracts his brain dead base by attacking trans people and fearmongering about 'CRT'.	<p>I do however think Covid is a terrible disease and I have actually had 12 people I know die from it in Vietnam (aged 35 to 70, all living rather unhealthy life styles as is the norm there).  7 of those 12 were fully vaxed, then another 2 I know died directly from the vaccine.  The vaccines are currently delaying for a few months the next (and thanks to vaccines stronger) wave while adding a whole bunch more problems to the mix.

But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.831

He views Trump as utterly chaotic and self-aggrandizing, seeking the presidency to merely boost his own legacy and ego.</p>	0.844
If you believe that I got some ocean front property in Arizona to sell you friend.	I really think that inflation isn't just a negative side effect of left-wing politics, it's a feature. They love illegal immigration and they love unbridled government spending because it decreases the value of labor, and makes more people dependent on hand outs to survive. This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don't know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we're too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.	0.843
If you believe that I got some ocean front property in Arizona to sell you friend.	<p>I was a leftist until the draconian response to COVID led me to realize just how much I value individual freedom, and how ineffective our government is. DeSantis is very near close to a hero for me for the way he conducted himself during this madness. I realize I do not represent this sub, or most of the American Right, but I do think that I represent the swing-voter, the voter who actually chooses the next President. And I have to say that I would be infinitely more likely to vote for DeSantis over Trump</p>	0.84

If this fucking idiot runs again you might as well hand the white house over to the Democrats right now	The one and only claim I have made, is that: you are in err when you say ""The election was clearly not fraudulent"".

If this fucking idiot runs again you might as well hand the white house over to the Democrats right now	<p>If you want people to accept your authority in a democratic election, it needs to be shown that the ballots are legitimate. Unfortunately, this can&#39;t be done due to <strong>widespread</strong> shirking of election laws meant to prevent fraud.</p>	0.829
If this fucking idiot runs again you might as well hand the white house over to the Democrats right now	You don't send a mail in ballot to just any random address because the person could've easily moved. Now you got a ballot floating around out there that anyone can just fill out. Of all the baseless claims y'all makes this is the most bizarre to me. Databases containing addresses go off of what's on your ID. Do you know how often those are updated? Also, why is it a bad thing to suggest if someone wants to vote, they should simply request a ballot? Like is it that difficult?	0.824

If this fucking idiot runs again you might as well hand the white house over to the Democrats right now	Mail ballots should only be available on very restricted grounds - early or absentee votes should cover the vast majority of people who can't vote on election day itself., and mail ballots are vulnerable to fraud. All received mail ballots should be verified well in advance of election day and those verified ballots stored together, but separately from other ballots.	0.814
Major reform	<p>I do love my country and what it used to stand for. I fought for this country and for what it used to stand for. Now I&#39;m looking around and I see people like you who are so presumptuous. Not all conservatives are &quot;Trumpers.&quot; I voted for him because I saw what Biden and Obama did when they were in charge and I compared that to what Trump did the last 4 years. Trump accomplished more and did a better job. We don&#39;t need to be &quot;deprogrammed.&quot; The left needs to pick a fight with a mirror.

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud.

I don’t see anything wrong with voting through the mail , and yes Facebook is sketchy but I don’t remember that having anything to do with Democrats. Facebook sponsored the first Republican primary debate if I recall correctly.	<p>the left wants to segregate people</p>	0.749

Because he didn't?	<p>First off, nobody is comparing. The point is that they’re both bad. Second off, BOTH died and tried to make use of slave labor. I’d hate to break it to you, but the Soviets had some very particular racial views on the Jews, Chechens, etc. Lastly, you need to ask yourself why you need to attempt some massive smartest guy in the room defense for communism?

Because he didn't?	<p>His another stance is that Russia and Germany are the biggest enemies of Poland, or, rather, that Poland has no friends, just enemies (not meaning that everybody is enemy, but that nobody is friend).

Of course our lefty governor used Codiv19 as an excuse to shut down all new CPL licenses for over a year.

Back before  January 2017 where Islamic terrorists were still a thing, EVERY single post about terror attacks was nothing but [removed] and then the post locked.	<p>The number one reason to get EVERYONE vaccinated is stopping mutation and stopping this from becoming a seasonal thing like that flu. That&#39;s the entire point. You getting infected because you&#39;re not vaccinated creates a chance that you cause the disease to mutate into something that is resistant to the vaccine. That&#39;s what we want to stop. Best way to do that is to stop giving Covid chances to mutate. And best way to remove those chances is vaccinating everyone we can as quickly as possible.</p>	0.855

I am fully on board with enforcing it in the case of something like a polio or small pox outbreak, but requiring everyone to get, say, a bubonic plague vaccine when we have no instances of it in over a hundred years is really ridiculous.

Part of the benefit of moving business to china is having relatively unregulated uses of chemicals and practices that the EPA disavows here. Cracking down on them and treating them like he wants the US to treat itself could potentially help both pollution concerns as well as keeping more jobs here in the US. Not that the US cant be better, but i feel like the majority of future progress we need is both technological and monetarily limited for the time being without stacking onto the national debt.  The biggest thing biden could do IMO is put a strong emphasis on nuclear power. This could potentially shift a good amount of our energy production emissions to something much cleaner, faster.  The rollout of traditional green energy solutions feels incredibly slow, even in states like Michigan where we supposedly plan to replace all of our remaining coal with renewable energy.</p>	0.745

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	<p>Apparently this dude is suing the city or somebody for like ten million dollars and the results of the trial are potentially important to his case.

TBH my 2nd thought (1st was ""wow, what a moron, that's blatant overreach, and are you trying to start a civil war you'll lose?"") was that man, this could be a boost to small employers.

Looks like it might have been taken down.	<p>I was a leftist until the draconian response to COVID led me to realize just how much I value individual freedom, and how ineffective our government is. DeSantis is very near close to a hero for me for the way he conducted himself during this madness. I realize I do not represent this sub, or most of the American Right, but I do think that I represent the swing-voter, the voter who actually chooses the next President. And I have to say that I would be infinitely more likely to vote for DeSantis over Trump</p>	0.873
Looks like it might have been taken down.	<p>Democrats get the same criticism for supporting progressive policy to get elected, and once they are, they always fall back on neoliberalism.

You are the one who thinks you can stop nuclear bombs with your small dick compensations. Not me.	<p>Now she’s on mandatory 14 day quarantine. She took a PCR test on Wednesday and it came back negative, thankfully, but it was a little early so she has to get retested on Tuesday to be completely sure she’s truly negative. What terrible timing to get exposed, after a year of dodging it. Hopefully the second test comes back negative as well so she can then immediately get the second shot, giving her the 90% immunity it’s supposed to have instead of the ~30% after just the first shot. She has multiple underlying conditions that would make Covid extremely dangerous for her. I’ve been terrified for her this entire past year, since she’s an essential worker so has been in the thick of it since the beginning. I have issues with anxiety and a panic disorder so it really hasn’t helped things mentally for me heh, I don’t think I could survive if anything were to happen to her, we’ve been married for 25 years.

The polio vaccine gives you a weakened or inactive strain of polio which allows your body to build immunities, whereas the COVID vaccine rewrites your mRNA to fight the virus. The polio vaccine has been around for 70 years after years of development.

Damn don't I love logical fallacies as my upvoted memes	This data was collected from about 26% of Israel’s entire population. Patients were matched according to age, socioeconomic status, health status, and time of infection/vaccination. Tens of thousands of participants showed natural immunity to be about 13 times stronger in preventing reinfection when only looking at the period since vaccines rolled out. When looking all the way back to the beginning of the pandemic, natural immunity was still 6 times stronger over that entire time than the vaccine is just in the last several months. So someone who got covid in March 2020 is still more protected than a similar individual who just got fully vaccinated in the last couple months.	0.722

I'm confused, is it a good thing then that without gun control the USA has the highest rate of gun related homicide per capita of all developed countries and the second highest total of gun deaths overall?  Is this what the second amendment was all about? Or is this a side effect of not having a so called 'police state' because I would argue less gun related deaths is a good thing right?	A vaccine puts something in your system, teaches your immune system to fight it, and is gone within 6-8 weeks.

Germans are taught it a hell of a lot more in depth that Americans, they actually understand it not just gloss over it and call anything they don't like nazi.	Not every candidate needs to be the most conservative man/woman in the world. But get people in there who are willing to fight the issues we care about. Not just someone who says ""I won't raise your taxes and I'm a good person"". That's great and all, but we need people that are willing to fight the culture war.

I'd also like to point out that the democrats only started to support gay rights when they realized it was politically advantageous to do so. In the 90s and early 00s, they didn't like homosexuals either. And now they want to act like they've always been champions for their rights. Like how they chanted BLM, then voted in the guy who signed the 1993 crime bill who's VP was a DA. LMAO Also all these companies want to pretend they support gays when not a single one supported them before gay marriage went through and it was popular to do so. And international companies still don't have their rainbow logo in Saudi Arabia. Wonder why that is? So brave. But I'm getting off track.	0.858

After all, even if they ban gay marriage, what would that change? He’ll live with his partner regardless, and it won’t change how he lives his life. Besides, the government getting involved in marriage was the worst thing to happen to the institution of marriage since King Henry.

That tax bill contributed massively to the greatest transfer of wealth from the poor 99% to the top 1% in history that&#39;s been happening over the last few decades.</p>	0.821
Lol that’s not impeachable	<p>In theory, it&#39;s a great way to incentivize workers to raise the value of the company and/or stay for x number of years.  Stock options are typically worth zero dollars on the day they are issued, it&#39;s an option to buy company stock in the future at today&#39;s price.  Usually vested after x number of years at the company.  I make about the same in stock options as salary and I&#39;m not rich by any means.  Taxing this would also fuck over a lot of middle class people if not done carefully</p>	0.82

At this point, what was the filibuster is gone and an objection is in its place, to call it anything else would be a disservice. </p>	0.81

And then I tried to post it and it said, "that link has already been submitted."  Quite a system they've got over there.	I get the annoyance about this but from a medical standpoint this isn't a surprise.  We have seasonal flu shots, it only makes sense that the COVID Vaccine was going to become somewhat seasonal with these viruses having the tendency to mutate/T-Cell immunity having a ""shelf-life"".  I'll likely get the booster shot on a yearly basis (I'm in the medical field so it'll probably get mandated for me sooner rather than later anyway) and I'll encourage my family to do that same.  I've got small kids and will likely hesitate to give them the vaccine if it is ever approved for their age range (2 and 4) simply because they are at such low risk from severe illness from it in the first place and I'll like to see how it effects the younguns that do get it for a couple years before I give it to my kids.	0.82
And then I tried to post it and it said, "that link has already been submitted."  Quite a system they've got over there.	<p>Source on the vaccine helps with mutations like Omicron? Seems like both the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally as likely to survive that variant. You can point to a few deaths, sure, but you can also point to flu death numbers as well and we never treated the flu like this. So shut down the country for a mild flu? You’re insane. Let me guess, you’d welcome treating the common flu like we currently treat COVID, right?</p>	0.817
And then I tried to post it and it said, "that link has already been submitted."  Quite a system they've got over there.	<p>That being said, politicians can get lost if they think there’s going to be a new normal, where we have this dystopian Covid drama for much longer. Health experts already are saying this virus is going to become endemic like the flu, and nobody bats an eye about the flu even though iirc the flu is deadlier. We all just accept it as part of life and proceed about life as normal- instead of causing so much economic damage over a virus that you can just get vaccinated against.</p>	0.814
And then I tried to post it and it said, "that link has already been submitted."  Quite a system they've got over there.	One, the virus mutates because there is what's known as ""Leak By"". This is why there is a new Flu vaccine developed every year. The Flu vaccine does not ""kill"" the Flu virus, so it mutates. This is the same for the COVID  virus. If there was no Leak By, then the vaccine would kill the virus in a couple ""jabs"", and that would be it.	0.813
And then I tried to post it and it said, "that link has already been submitted."  Quite a system they've got over there.	<p>I tend to agree with the people who say it&#39;s going to be a new seasonal thing like the flu.  The genie is out of the bottle, and it&#39;s not going back.</p>	0.795

Nah.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.896
Nah.	<p>But since the vaccines don&#39;t prevent infection and simply reduce the severity of symptoms, there&#39;s likely been swaths of infected vaccinated people who aren&#39;t being noticed because they don&#39;t have a reason to get tested. They don&#39;t have symptoms to test for. So even if they&#39;re positive and contribute to spreading covid as much as an unvaccinated person, they haven&#39;t had any reason to believe they were sick. </p>	0.895

Even if the current covid vaccines were ""relatively ineffective"" (they're very effective) and provided limited protection from covid, the virus would have less chance to multiply and mutate into a strain that's resistant against the broad antibodies and have less opportunity to move on to a new host. Being unvaccinated provides none of these benefits, which means more opportunity for mutations. We are far closer to a mutation that completely bypasses our natural immune systems than we are to the 3 or 4 or 10 mutations needed to nullify the vaccine antibodies to the point where they provide no protection at all.	0.902

You guys still like this guy?	<p>Let&#39;s face it though, you are just another one of those bots over there in 3rd World Land who&#39;s tasked by Russia &amp; China to push this drivel.  I hate to admit it but they had many citizens (the weaker ones) afraid and willing to swallow these socialist/totalitarian policies.  But not anymore; the awakening has begun and in the end it has FAILED ..... as it was doomed to do so.  Go back and tell your masters that you failed.

You guys still like this guy?	There is no way the Taliban stood up against the U.S. for two decades without foreign assistance. They should be smoldering craters by this point - it simply could not happen. Our intelligence community either a) didn't know, b) knew but couldn't win the shadow war, or c) knew but willingly chose to do nothing for other reasons. None of those reasons are good or acceptable. With the CIA preaching diversity uber alles now, I can only imagine what their priorities must be.	0.859

What people fail to understand is that many of the ""rules"" that are in place are oversimplifications because stupid people cant follow directions. For example: CDC states clearly ""stay 6 feet apart and if you cant, then wear a mask."" Government hears that and says, ""well, people are too stupid to know what 6 feet is, lets just make a mask mandatory, they cant mess that up..."" And, if im being completely honest, theyre not wrong.... the average American is as dumb as an elevator that carries inanimate objects. BUT, government's oversimplification and extra precautions shouldn't be baked into our full understanding of Covid or applied liberally to all groups....Like I said before, asymptomatic and younger kids spread the virus at very very low levels, so should we be applying blanket covid policies to them? No. Heck, most of them are sequestered in dorms, or with other college kids where the severity of actually getting Covid is nill. THATS where im coming from.	0.848

All those damn liberals and their *checks notes* confederate flags?	<p>You are experiencing the Dunning-Kruger effect here, you do not have the relevant skill set to know enough to know your opinion is uninformed. You still haven’t retracted your initial false statement that the variants are being caused by mutation inside vaccinated people; that might happen eventually but the big variants going around now have not been caused by that and are still more dangerous than getting the vaccine. You also haven’t provided an alternative solution even once here, so on top of being ignorant you are not even being helpful.</p>	0.898
All those damn liberals and their *checks notes* confederate flags?	<p>But since the vaccines don&#39;t prevent infection and simply reduce the severity of symptoms, there&#39;s likely been swaths of infected vaccinated people who aren&#39;t being noticed because they don&#39;t have a reason to get tested. They don&#39;t have symptoms to test for. So even if they&#39;re positive and contribute to spreading covid as much as an unvaccinated person, they haven&#39;t had any reason to believe they were sick. </p>	0.895

Chances of catching it? In that regard the vaccine isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s still helpful. Calling a vaccine ineffective because it doesn&#39;t 100% reduce death rates is simply fucking stupid.</p>	0.893
Plus they can’t afford to play Golf.	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.883
Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.

he deserves to have his license revoked and his wages garnished to pay the victims and their families. he deserves zero prison time unless you expect him to do something like that again.	Children that do not have cancer, or some other immuno-compromising condition have NO place getting this vaccine.  It will help in almost NO way to give it to young healthy kids.  99.999% of children who get COVID-19 have no symptoms, or extremely mild symptoms.  My kids had COVID-19 and you'd never have known it.  Runny noses and slightly less energy for 18 hours for them.  That was it.  There is GREATER RISK giving them this vaccine than there is any benefit.	0.869
he deserves to have his license revoked and his wages garnished to pay the victims and their families. he deserves zero prison time unless you expect him to do something like that again.	<p>The vast majority of people I talk to (like 90%+) have no strong feelings about vaccine mandates (public or private) despite the fact there is no significant externality that exists. They cannot explain how an unvaccinated person poses a significant risk to a vaccinated person yet they are totally ok with vaccine mandates. Logical contradictions are all over the place and most people don&#39;t notice or care, I find it really hard to describe the average person in that case as &quot;reasonable&quot;. They are brainwashed sheep.</p>	0.867

he deserves to have his license revoked and his wages garnished to pay the victims and their families. he deserves zero prison time unless you expect him to do something like that again.	All in all interesting information. VERY different from what the US has been claiming about the vaccine, but does generally support the idea of the vaccine being a deterrent (except for hospitalization cases). Since there has def not been adequate amount of testing for long term side effects (can't speed up time, yet the fda somehow did for covid *cough cough political approval cough*) I still don't see this as being necessary for everyone to get, especially younger people. It's a solid idea for the older at risk population and only if they want it. The percent increases in benefits are pretty small considering vaccines are supposed to give you near 100% inoculation.	0.866
he deserves to have his license revoked and his wages garnished to pay the victims and their families. he deserves zero prison time unless you expect him to do something like that again.	This is a really shitty reason not to get it, and if anything, people like you not getting it is just going to help the movement towards vaccine mandates. If 90% of the US was vaccinated, there would be little if any calls for vaccine mandates because enough of the public is vaccinated for Covid to be a much smaller public concern.	0.866

To be fair, most of them aren't actual people	<p>Definitely didn&#39;t expect a European to say that, but yeah when you look at case fatality rate and deaths per 100k population the US is definitely doing better than plenty of other countries across the pond like the UK and Belgium. US is the 3rd largest country so the most total deaths isn&#39;t a surprise when it&#39;s an open secret that China lied about it&#39;s numbers. India is up there but there are regions with extreme poverty and severe lack of testing and many think their cases are underreported. I think the Netherlands numbers are currently better than the US, but that few ICU beds is just asking to be Italy. With how much EU citizens are taxed for healthcare I would hope the government increases ICU beds soon 🙁</p>	0.79
To be fair, most of them aren't actual people	<p>And that is despite US, UK and France having far, far superior ICU facilities.

How do you think we are a free nation? Do you understand history?

How do you think we are a free nation? Do you understand history? Wake up!!	<p>I absolutely agree with this. And maybe it makes me part of the problem, but admittedly it does make me very happy to see both Gwen Berry and Megan Rapinoe fail. I support their right to say whatever they want, no matter how childish and ignorant, but along with that comes my right to delight in the failures of anyone who seeks to harm this great country.</p>	0.835

Did you read the article? It’s about preparing to remove non essential personnel if there is an invasion.	Even though you don't support the seat belt laws, you still choose to wear it.  It costs next to nothing to mitigate that risk.  In my view anyway, same with the vaccine for those without natural immunity.  You're safer with the vax than not even if the risk is small.  There's a miniscule risk to the vaccine itself and it seems to be greatest for young men, but still very, very small from what I can gather.  For anyone over a certain age, if you do the math, they're basically always better off vax'ed if not naturally immune, just like we're better off wearing seatbelts.	0.822
Did you read the article? It’s about preparing to remove non essential personnel if there is an invasion.	Cutting school funding was like cutting Medicare. Except they were able to touch it because all the people they fucked over were too young to vote. And unlike medicare it actually helps the country build technology. Medicare is a funding black hole for people that don't contribute much to society anymore.	0.818
Did you read the article? It’s about preparing to remove non essential personnel if there is an invasion.	As a 'burnout' type if someone would have actually looked st my high school a lot of the issues could be fixed right away (I went to one of the biggest schools in the country. A lot of our 'burnouts' arent failures, they dont get any attention to help them. If you fell behind you were fucked) but they dont even see anything wrong there.	0.814

wait til you hear about how much money bush and Cheney made from iraq	Because, it seems to me, that this sort of crap is exactly why polarization in America is as bad as it is. When they say they want to ""own the libs"", it's people like you they're thinking of, precisely because of behaviour like that. It doesn't help anybody. In fact, it actively makes things worse. People tend to double down on their positions when they're challenged by assholes, *and that's not what we want*.	0.866
wait til you hear about how much money bush and Cheney made from iraq	<p>What makes this so shameful is that you were inciting riots with left-wing propaganda using an extreme racial bias. You deserved to be slammed for the lives you cost.</p>	0.866
wait til you hear about how much money bush and Cheney made from iraq	<p>To answer your question though.... yes, the BLM “protests” were objectively worse. And achieved nothing. Besides hurting a bunch of innocent Americans. And you would need to be seriously brainwashed to think otherwise.</p>	0.861
wait til you hear about how much money bush and Cheney made from iraq	Why do we vote for, or do, such “stupid” things? Original Sin. For Christians, it’s the rebellion against God in the Garden of Eden. For the woke, it’s pollution and slavery, crimes that happened centuries ago yet were so bad they irradiate the present. Nations are inherently racist; individuals, even the ones that want to be good, are guilty of “unconscious bias”. Woke has a Calvinist pessimism about our Total Depravity. You can’t escape the sin, the best you can do is confess it to the community.	0.858
Why would you want family and non-essential personnel in an embassy in an invaded country?	It doesn't make them good or pleasant people,  but it has to be noted that military measures that stay within modern SOP simply can't eradicate them. It is perhaps to the Coalition's credit that they never entertained changing procedures to be less humane and more effective, but we are seeing play out in real life the conundrum posed by George Martin in the character of Tywin Lannister: his immense cruelty in doing anything to win can actually lead to more humane outcomes than can be delivered by softer hearted characters.	0.827

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it.

This isn’t an interesting post at all, first off. Also, you can’t have it both ways. You can’t complain that the cdc restrictions are too extreme and then turn around and make fun of them when they lessen their restrictions. Hate that double standard.	There are a fuck ton of stories of vaccine being stored in shitty places (these have to be -80 I believe and if they go above they quickly start to spoil). Plenty of stories of freezers failing and trying to scramble to get them out before they go bad. Trump promised extra doses to states but then found out he didn't have any left so states were left cold. The dude lost (literally nobody knows where they went) 20 million doses.	0.847
This isn’t an interesting post at all, first off. Also, you can’t have it both ways. You can’t complain that the cdc restrictions are too extreme and then turn around and make fun of them when they lessen their restrictions. Hate that double standard.	<p>There are a fuck ton of stories of vaccine being stored in shitty places (these have to be -80 I believe and if they go above they quickly start to spoil).

Of course our lefty governor used Codiv19 as an excuse to shut down all new CPL licenses for over a year. I called the local cop shop about it and I asked the person on the line why isn&#39;t this a 2A violation and she said &quot;Why don&#39;t you ask the governor?&quot; (she sounded pissed off). I have my CPL now but had to wait a long time to get it and pay a lot of money and jump through a bunch of hoops.  I felt my rights were pretty damned infringed.</p>	0.819

Hate that double standard.	<p>At GE in Erie, PA, a worker was high on drugs when he drove a large piece of equipment into another stationary piece of equipment, costing over $75k in damage and injuring two other employees.  Instead of being angry that this guy put other workers at risk, the union blocked GE from having the employee drug tested or fired.  When management tried to move this loser to a different job within the company that would not involve him driving any machinery, the union fought back by grinding production to a standstill.  These are the games they play.  To protect a drug-riddled loser who puts their very lives at risk.  Then, after weeks of production at nearly a standstill, GE needs to meet deadlines, so the union starts production again...by forcing the company to pay triple overtime in order to meet the deadline.  Are you getting the picture yet?  This is just one example of many that I can think of off the top of my head.  It&#39;s no wonder companies move production to countries where people are actually grateful to have a job and actually do the fucking work.</p>	0.811

All of the doctors I saw on major media outlets when asked responded with either "we don't know" or "the data doesn't suggest that". Thats how scientist approach any subject. In fact, stating any of these points, or even their counter point as 100% certainty is irresponsible and without nuance. It is rare that anything is ever 100%	<p>Get vaccinated maybe die.

Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way.

““It doesn’t matter who is in the Oval Office, whether it’s President Trump, President Biden or some other Republican or Democrat. Either one of them would have been greeted by the higher prices we saw this year," De Haan said, reiterating the current price surge is a direct result of the pandemic upending supply and demand.”  This has been annoying me for so long. I get high gas prices are annoying, but this simply isn’t the fault of any President. Not a good thing, but also something apolitical, and it’s a bad look on conservatives that we’re so up in arms about it.

In capitalism, a company / entity has the capability to pretty much do whatever it feels so long as it doesn’t violate local / state / federal statutes. So long as it does not commit material damage to those it employs, it can more or less do whatever the fuck it wants. You and I have no control over that except by buying or boycotting their goods. They are not required to act in your interest or serve you in any capacity that they do not want, and if they decide to move their business elsewhere at the cost of local businesses, they are 10000% within their right to do in a free market economy.

Luckily republicans are never hypocrites... humans are humans, not saying she is right to do so but dont use a single person and imply a lot of people are the same.	<p>In the twenty-first century thus far, something strange has been happening. Reaganite Republicans have continued cutting taxes to “unleash” “entrepreneurship,” but the rich people thus favored keep turning into Democrats. Loudoun County, Virginia, now the richest U.S. county, was until recently a rock-solid Republican place. George W. Bush won it by 16 points in 2000. But Barack Obama took an 8-point victory in 2008, Hillary Clinton won it by 17 in 2016, and Joe Biden won it by 24 in 2020—a 40-point shift in two decades. In the weeks leading up to December’s finance reports on the pair of Georgia Senate runoffs, the Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, each raised more money than both of the Republican candidates. There are still vestiges of the old dispensation: One of the Republican candidates, Kelly Loeffler, wife of the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, had donated $23 million of her own money. But in general Democrats now enter the political arena as the party of wealth.</p>	0.859

Most major corporations use similar calculators for salary determinations when relocating folks. It’s nothing new. You say $70k is good for a family of four where you live. That is awesome. We can probably reduce your wages there. However, in most major metropolitan areas, that $70k is not a living wage for a family of four.

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>LoL....

But when you have thousands if not tens of thousands of people crossing across from the border during a pandemic, I am very scrupulous on the situation just adding people when there is an issue at had (not so much at the moment in regards to COVID -- COVID cases are very high but as evolution kind of does its thing to viruses, their evolutionary trajectory tends towards higher transmissibility but dampened infectious effects on the hosts it infects -- I'm the only one in my house who didn't get it and I'm out a lot working 2 jobs, I got vaccinated and have a robust daily vitamin regiment while I have a health complication making me at risk) but this has been going on when COVID was doing a damaging number on people (infected and killed two family members of mine, one old (grandpa) one young (29 y/o cousin).	0.87

One of President Trump&#39;s bragging points was that the vaccine was a available fast because of him and we have him to thank for it. Cool. But many conservatives including myself, don&#39;t trust getting the vaccine (I already had Covid so I don&#39;t want the vaccine). Are conservatives not trusting President Trump when it comes to the vaccine? I saw Ivanka get the vaccine on her IG and the comment section was full of disappointed conservatives. Me personally, I think it&#39;s great that it&#39;s available, but I think things like vaccine passports are too much. What are your thoughts?</p>	0.838

You know what else has that prodrome? Literally every other respiratory prodome. We have upper respiratory virus panels available at every hospital. Take a guess how often they get used? Almost never because knowing what virus it is doesn't change the treatment, which is mostly supportive. Those panels are most helpful in determining if there is a upper respiratory infection, which they also have an absolute terrible time doing. So in essence, short of being on a ventilator with ground glass lungs, you cant really know that you even had covid. Sure, theres a tremendous spike in cases of severe respiratory failure due to covid, that we know. However determining if this specific patient has covid or not is a lot more vague, because as I said, issues with testing and all. Even if we say that 95% of people sick had covid, there's 5% that didnt (which is probably underestimating how many didn't). So as a result, we are left guessing. Yes heard immunity kicks in at ~70 percent, but we're not there yet. There's a lot of evidence showing that antibodies fade quickly to covid for whatever reason. Being sick with it gives better protection than the vaccines, but both have their challenges.	0.836

This shit takes generations to fix, but we&#39;re a quick fix society, and if we&#39;re not doing &quot;something&quot; actively,  we feel bad, so some take that as self-evident truth that our system is still racist.	0.784

Good, I was worried you didn't have evidence to back up such serious claims.

Good, I was worried you didn't have evidence to back up such serious claims.	Scientific research is really hard to value because ideally, you avoid ever having to know how much you lost. So for example with the invention of antibiotics we can’t know how many lives were saved so we can’t begin to assign a value to it. So really, science should be one of those areas where we don’t expect to turn a profit and monetary “losses” should be weighed in different terms than, say, a manufacturing business.</p>	0.867

They are doubting it current and even in Miami.	<p>All in all interesting information. VERY different from what the US has been claiming about the vaccine, but does generally support the idea of the vaccine being a deterrent (except for hospitalization cases). Since there has def not been adequate amount of testing for long term side effects (can&#39;t speed up time, yet the fda somehow did for covid <em>cough cough political approval cough</em>) I still don&#39;t see this as being necessary for everyone to get, especially younger people. It&#39;s a solid idea for the older at risk population and only if they want it. The percent increases in benefits are pretty small considering vaccines are supposed to give you near 100% inoculation. </p>	0.861
They are doubting it current and even in Miami.	<p>In the hundreds of millions of doses administered since it came out, what evidence is there that we shouldn’t take the vaccine. Remember, any adverse side effects are already know. Something random appears years later not already found would be the first of its kind for a vaccine.</p>	0.86
They are doubting it current and even in Miami.	<p>I didn’t say you can’t spread the virus asymptotically. But there’s a lot of debate right now over how likely vaccinated people even are to spread it IF they get covid in the first place. If viral load drops off quicker and your body clears the virus bc the vaccine kicks in, you’re contagious for a shorter amount of time and you’re not as likely to infect other people. </p>	0.859

This is a big part of why violent crime is exploding. No officer wants to be the next guy that politicians and the MSM are calling to be charged with murder cause they see someone acting suspiciously, the suspect pulls a knife, and the cop shot them. Additionally, it has completely drowned out any conversation about reform efforts that are actually needed, such as increased training/education, or meaningfully eliminating behavior like cops looking the other way for cops+friends of cops who are caught in low level offenses.</p>	0.852

CDC records for the past two years show in excess of 200K deaths due to Covid or presumed Covid.

So again, if you are indeed concerned with 2nd hand smoke, then why wouldn’t you be concerned about Covid? </p>	0.828
I actually would like to see her in a two piece, I bet she has a huge bush because she thinks genitalia hair grooming is mysogonist, probably.	A few things about that. The mortality in those over 80 is close to 90% (although probably old numbers). So ignore those people. The rest of the us populace is fine right? Well 70+ % are overweight or obese, which is an extremely compounding risk factor for a number of reasons. So ignore those people right? Add all of the other chronic conditions that exist in the us and you're left with a small percent of the population that actually doesn't have risk factors for covid. And guess what? **it's a virus that we have (had) a vaccine for. ** It's miraculous that we could have developed it so quickly, but that's what happens when there's money to be made (capitalism) and the whole human populace is facing the same challenge.	0.828

I prefer to be healthy in my "great free state". Getting into a car accident that isn't your fault and results in hundreds of thousands of medical bills doesn't scream "FREE" to me.

Liberalism is so infectious because you can rally behind ""pride parades"", but you can't promote Christian ""humility parades"", as that would be contradictory.	0.868

I am arguing that you would never have to hear of some high School track girl losing because someone else decided to change gender. Then that girl loses a scholarship. That would never be a scenario. Rather conservatives are insisting that you can’t change sex. Which is not something you’re going to get agreement from anyone left of center. This further ruins the conservative chances of winning a single vote of anyone who is transsexual and those who support this group. Wouldn’t it make more sense to support an argument that doesn’t make conservatives look ignorant?	0.844

The average person literally does not give a shit about this anymore. They either got the vaccine, and moved on with their lives, or don’t want to get it because they understand the risks and are okay with them. Last year I’d go into a store without a mask and some people would bat an eye, but not anymore. After I got the vaccine I’ve basically lived my life as if this never happened, and quite frankly before getting the vaccine I wasn’t worried about this for more than a few weeks. Nobody in my family took any precautions, aside from just sanitizing things like shopping carts before handling them, and my parents are not only old, but also both have bad immune systems, and even they didn’t give a damn about this.</p>	0.798

It's against the law to date horses.	The following nights their response to the protests felt like overcompensating for the night of the riot.

Now we've waited so long to actually get the vaccines in people that it's mutated (Delta variant). And they provide protection, but definitely not as much? So we start this whole cycle over. Once you get to a critical mass of virus out there, it keeps mutating and you're left with a nightmare of randomized versions. This is basically why the flu (influenza, a long distant child of the Spanish / Kansas influenza) exists and the **quadrivalent** vaccine that gets administered has a 20% protectiveness in younger populations. Even though you get 4 strains that they are estimating to be popular that year, there's plenty of others.	0.858

Polite? The party of trump is jacked to the max with negative rhetoric. What are you on about?	<p>I do think the matter of comorbity is being glossed over by most organisations: of the family members of mine who were diagnosed with covid, a vast majority of them were fine and had mild flu-like symptoms, and two with obvious comorbidities (tuberculosis and some manner of cardiac disease)  died very quickly after contracting it. It seems to me that the virus fast-tracks existing conditions which would have a strong chance of killing the person within a matter of years anyway. Most healthy people would probably be completely fine.</p>	0.848
Polite? The party of trump is jacked to the max with negative rhetoric. What are you on about?	<p>Now let me address you second argument. Yes, doctors and nurses have been tackling covid-19 for over a year now with a vaccine and have gotten by. They didn’t have a choice. Whether for better or worse, they were forced to treat patients  infected with a deadly virus, risking bringing it home with them or spreading it to others in public (becuase PPE’s are not 100% perfect). Now that they have the option to take the vaccine, they have the opportunity to continue delivering patient care in a manner that is SAFER for themselves, their family, other non-covid-19 patients they also see in the hospital. Not taking the vaccine presents an inherent risk to spreading the virus to other people that might not be able to get fully vaccinated or cannot reap the benefits of the vaccine (immunocompromised, cofactors with lung health, age). So with doctors and nurses who are refusing to get the vaccine, not only are they refuting the very science they spent years studying, but they are now also putting others at risk. That is a direct conflict with their responsibilities as health care providers. If you can avoid putting other people at risk but you choose not to for personal reasons, goodbye. Go find another hospital to work at.</p>	0.82
She would be a lot more attractive with a brown paper bag over her head... and a picture of a smiling Willem Dafoe taped to it.	<p>To me, the issue is more that I don’t want any government forcing anything inside my body.  I happen to be in favor of this vaccine and it’s effectiveness, but that’s a choice I made between me and my doctor.  The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it’s wild that that’s somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.853
She would be a lot more attractive with a brown paper bag over her head... and a picture of a smiling Willem Dafoe taped to it.	<p>COVID numbers are definitely effecting treatment outcomes of even non COVID conditions at the moment. I would definitely suggest to anyone to look at the vaccine which reduces mortality significantly and can help unclog the system. Everyone thinks they will be fine without it until they are not, and it is almost entirely the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised who end up taking up beds in critical care. Ask a physician to address any concerns if you have them.</p>	0.851

She would be a lot more attractive with a brown paper bag over her head... and a picture of a smiling Willem Dafoe taped to it.	<p>The number one reason to get EVERYONE vaccinated is stopping mutation and stopping this from becoming a seasonal thing like that flu. That&#39;s the entire point. You getting infected because you&#39;re not vaccinated creates a chance that you cause the disease to mutate into something that is resistant to the vaccine. That&#39;s what we want to stop. Best way to do that is to stop giving Covid chances to mutate. And best way to remove those chances is vaccinating everyone we can as quickly as possible.</p>	0.833
She would be a lot more attractive with a brown paper bag over her head... and a picture of a smiling Willem Dafoe taped to it.	<p>Either way we are discussing MANDATING a COVID vaccine for a virus, which has no cure.

The alternative is to let people go to the doctor for consensual treatment when they’re sick, let people who wish to get vaxxed get it, don’t bash people for getting vaxxed or not getting vaxxed, and respecting other individuals freewill for medical treatment.</p>	0.832

And to be honest... if you are going to pick a businessman for public office, I don’t think he’s a bad choice. He literally transformed Disney into what it is today.

r/politics is basically r/democrat, bunch of libs.	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.844

I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	“....it’s okay because it’s Biden doing it and not Trump!”	0.848

If you support freedom of speech and the 2A, and oppose illegal immigration,  you won&#39;t have a home in the Democrat party. It&#39;s crazy how much has changed in so little time. In 2008, the elected president and VP were openly opposed to gay marriage. Before they even left office, holding that position made you a far right extremist. Democrats have dragged the Overton window so far to the left that overlap has become incredibly scarce. Would you really want the most conservative Democrat over the most liberal Republican, knowing that you&#39;ll still get at worst 50% of what you want from the Republican and at best about 10% of what you want from the Democrat? Even the RINOS are still holding the line on a lot, bad as they may be in too many situations. If they were replaced by Democrats, then the fake &quot;voting rights&quot; nonsense would have been rammed through the Senate months ago. I&#39;m not saying you should blindly vote for one party, but as it stands right now, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find a truly electable Democrat and not just someone you would prefer because the Republican happens to be a piece of shit.</p>	0.788

The old translation which was taught for well over a thousand years was &quot;miscarriage&quot; not &quot;premature birth&quot;. That translation came about in the mid 1800s as best I&#39;ve been able find. Which would indicate that if a miscarriage is caused, but no further harm comes to the mother, then a fine, according to the husband, shall be imposed by a judge. If, however, the woman dies as a result of the miscarriage, then the man shall be put to death. This is interesting because the Syrian, Hittite, and Babylonian code in the area all had nearly the exact same passage, but required a fetus for a fetus. Those codes existed before the Mosaic Code was written, so a lack of that clarification seems fairly important. </p>	0.844

We can&#39;t have this happen again. All the new procedures that were put in place we&#39;re to address a once in a lifetime pandemic and in no way should be &quot;the new normal&quot; going forward.

You cant make it up, but fully understandable.	<p>Also the excess death number that I&#39;m using is the answer to this problem of miscategorising deaths. This number is the number that died in covid years vs the number that died in other years, if we were just misscategorising and the pandemic was really killing no one then this number would be 0%, but it&#39;s actually 50%. Unfortunately this number also includes deaths from longer wait times at hospitals etc.</p>	0.829

Countdown to ban hammer. 3...2...1...	I&#39;m a Colorado native who was priced out last year. I hate what Californians and other liberal transplants have done to my home state. Denver democrats were never this radically left, they were fairly moderate all things considered. The new breed of democrats are batshit insane and hate guns, farming, o&amp;g, mining, and ranching. The Governor is trying to turn Colorado into a new Silicon Valley; he is encouraging tech companies to relocate all over the state. And ever since WFH became popular last year, that&#39;s already happening. Tons of liberal yuppies have been moving in rural areas bringing their west coast tech salaries and pricing out the natives who have grown up in these communities. Anyway my point being is that the rural areas of Colorado used to be a lot more republican when I was growing up.</p>	0.856

Radical in the streets colonized in the sheets	<p>If you are not overweight, never had asthma, any cardiac illness and <em>willing to bet that long term effects of Covid are not going to happen to you</em> then I can see how the vanishingly small risk of this vaccine could turn you off. </p>	0.876
Radical in the streets colonized in the sheets	But since the vaccines don't prevent infection and simply reduce the severity of symptoms, there's likely been swaths of infected vaccinated people who aren't being noticed because they don't have a reason to get tested. They don't have symptoms to test for. So even if they're positive and contribute to spreading covid as much as an unvaccinated person, they haven't had any reason to believe they were sick.	0.871
Radical in the streets colonized in the sheets	<p>No. Some adverse events might be caused by vaccination and others might be coincidental and not related to vaccination. Just because an adverse event happened after a person received a vaccine does not mean the vaccine caused the adverse event.</p>	0.87
Radical in the streets colonized in the sheets	As for 2. No one is suggesting that you intentionally become infected with or without that vaccine so that point is moot. The question is whether or not people with covid-19 antibodies should risk taking the vaccine even if the risk are minimal when they likely already have superior protection to those taking the vaccine alone.	0.867

Wow. The southern strategy wasn’t about appealing to racists. It was about appealing to the religious right. It just so happens a lot of them are ALSO racists.	<p>The idea that you&#39;d get the world&#39;s nations to collectively govern themselves is stupid because it ignores that the exact sort of nations that would govern themselves are the same ones that don&#39;t need such an authority, and the ones that do need such an authority are the exact same ones that not only have no business being a part of that authority, but won&#39;t fucking listen to it. China and the USSR both demonstrated that, but Germany between WWI and WWII demonstrated that as well. Japan as well, ironically.</p>	0.841
Wow. The southern strategy wasn’t about appealing to racists. It was about appealing to the religious right. It just so happens a lot of them are ALSO racists.	<p>We needed Japanese leaderdhip to see and experience a clear cut demonstration of what they faced unless they surrendered.  Neither city was pre-bombed for just that reason.  The proportionality for civilian deaths attempts were moronically insufficient. And not one cited a relative that fought or died in that war or especially not the Pacific theater.</p>	0.833
Wow. The southern strategy wasn’t about appealing to racists. It was about appealing to the religious right. It just so happens a lot of them are ALSO racists.	<p>It needs to be.  Outside of Germany and Japan we have never successfully rebuilt a country into a stable society and the only reason we pulled it off then was because the Germans and Japanese already had a culture that accepted and worked with it.</p>	0.831

I, of course, am not a fascist, but my opinion about myself is irrelevant to Antifa.  Fascists have every right to speech, publishing their ideas, and peacefully assembling to protest as I do.  ***I do not support Nazis and Communists, but the price of freedom is that they must have it too.  Antifa denies these rights to their enemies, and by disagreeing you too become their enemy.***  Think of the slogan ""punch a Nazi.""  Who counts as a Nazi?  When did it become ok to punch people?	0.82

What I don’t understand is why the hell Germany declared war on the US first. Certainly they would have known that the public would have been out for blood from the Japanese more than them cause they had only gone after ships supplying Britain which wasn’t as big a deal as Pearl Harbor, RIP to all the merchant marines who died in the battle of the Atlantic they are often forgotten. But I don’t know how Rosevelt would have gone about Germany first when they hadn’t attacked our forces. Certainly if we were going full steam against Japan that would have actually helped the Germans in the short term as lend lease would have been hindering our pacific efforts and we would send less supplies to the UK and USSR unless they joined us in the South Pacific and the Russians invaded Manchuria (fun fact the Russians had a non aggression pact with Japan from 41-45 which they broke after Germany surrendered, meaning that they were totally cool being semi friendly with the 2 axis powers who bordered them)	0.817
