See what I mean? You don't even consider what I have to say, You aren't engaging with any points, you're just attacking me. I'm trying my best to have an actual conversation with you and you refuse.	I think *I* wouldn't be offended. I'd think they ask to make trans people (or nonbinary etc) feel more comfortable and accepted.	0.699
>Vaccine mandates are not "backed by science"  You still have not admitted this was the most retarded thing to say, which was the only reason I ever bothered to try to educate you. You asking retarded questions to try to start new arguments is a fucking \*chef's kiss\* michelin star plate of stupid.  >BuT WhAt If YoU oPpoSe KiLiing HaWaaiiinns  Do you fucking read what you type before posting?	<p>According to <a href=""https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/19/the-two-state-solution-mirage/"">this</a> poll, fewer than 2 in 10 Arabs would ever accept Israel&#39;s right to exist as a nation with a Jewish majority. You&#39;re making an assumption that the Palestinians would accept a two-state solution in good faith. But consider that when Israel allowed Gaza to have its own democratic elections, the government that was elected by popular vote was Hamas, a literal terrorist government that used the increased autonomy that Israel provided to Gaza to ramp up terrorist attacks on Israel, which directly led to Israel blockading the Gaza strip as a result.</p>	0.681
And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition. You clearly aren’t willing to do that because you realize it would make you look fucking stupid. Not sure we have anything left to discuss here.	Yes, Palestine exists and has existed for a long time, that is an asinine comment. Your nation state argument is irrelevant to the civil rights of those living in Palestine.	0.769
Preach	Israel exists on stolen land. They are inherently the aggressor in this conflict."	0.657
It’s pretty easy to understand. Everyone has grasped it.  But you do you bro. You wanna get fucked? You go get fucked. Or whatever you want to call it.	When we say the Palestinians want to reclaim their homeland, we're talking about people who have actually been forced out of their homes by an occupying force."	0.717

The only reason I do that is because it's fucking true. And people have only been assholes on here. Cry about it.	>Its not a strawman.	0.736
I had 3 likes on both of my comments until you happened to mention it. Other people grasped the premise. But you have continually shown to be obtuse throughout the entire comment thread on your post.   This is a subreddit for people able to change their mind and engage in debate, not rant on a soapbox.	>Do you believe 'the people living there' have the right to deny people moving in and buying land next to them?	0.614
I'm not. Just make an effort, jfc.	OK.	0.61
Except you've provided fuck all to prove this "truth" you've done nothing but assert and flame out and block people who disagree	Part of the definition of Genocide is that the goal is to destroy a group or nation. If we're going to say that Hamas never called for Genocide when they called for the literal destruction of Israel, we definitely can't say that Israel calls for Genocide when they've tried to have peace multiple times. They may have done other terrible things, true - but genocide is going too far.	0.656
It's not a reasonable conclusion and you should also, kindly, go away.	3) Similar to above but less concrete - for the moment at least, a significant number of people are just thinking about life differently. Choosing to stay home and earn less as a single income household because of the freedom or flexibility. Or in other instances, choosing to hold off for just a couple months before reentering the workforce, to finally take that vacation, cross country trip, or visit the family members they haven’t seen in over a year.	0.613
Plenty of people, myself included, have, and you just ignore, wilfully misinterpret, insult, and block us.	> If the woman wants an abortion she gets one, if she wants the baby she has it. The man has absolutely zero say for any of this.	0.686
Nope.	Also, that’s not completely the way the market works, you can’t just charge more and customers will always pay it.  Higher prices can mean lower totals sales, so sometimes taking lower profit margin makes more sense.  If stores could just raise prices whenever they want, why not just double them and make a ton?"	0.693
Lmao Reddit karma = sound argument. I've heard it all.	I have never directly seen any individual being blamed for ""sexualizing"" as in being aroused by or remarking upon the sexual desirability of another individual.	0.563
Why the hell are you on this sub if you're going to be a dick to those trying to change your view?	<p>Really? You think -phobia as in arachnophobia is a more commonly used suffix than as in homophobia and transphobia?</p>	0.824
Yes I have. Read my fucking post.	I haven’t said anything about omicron. I just mentioned that the flu is also here. So nobody knows if it’s COVID, flu or just a cold. They all share the same symptoms and since severity varies from person to person, they’re hard to tell apart."	0.759
Just because you say no it doesn't make it true. If you want it to be true, address my points.	<p>then I have to face the fact that COVID has therefore killed at least 4.5 million people since January 22, 2020.</p>	0.654
You claim to have heard it all, but fail to address their arguments. Interesting	>then I have to face the fact that COVID has therefore killed at least 4.5 million people since January 22, 2020.	0.624
That person could've read my comment. But she didn't.	If omicron is less deadly, then it is good if it is more infectious - as being infected with this mild variant, can provide additional protection against other strains. We don't know if it is more deadly, but current evidence does not suggests that it is. Therefore using it as an example of bad things occurring, is a big logical leap on your part.	0.713
I did. It's nothing but your personal opinions on a topic that a hell of a lot of people entirely disagree with. And you ignore every criticism they provide.	Edit. I realize I’m arguing with someone else through you lol sorry"	0.554
Again, I'm not going to engage with bad faith arguments. Maybe I should rewrite this because apparently fucking no one understands.	And that's without getting into the issue of how overwhelmed hospitals are with covid patients right now, 99.2% of which are unvaccinated. People taking up all the hospital beds with covid cases is literally killing people *right now*"	0.713
I've already said why.	Or the fact that Covid has been shown to cause brain damage, which could explain your posting https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00926-1"	0.611
You could've addressed people's criticism. But you didn't.	It's also fearmongering to say that just because it may be more infectious (with no proven fatalities), that it is just as bad. You said: *It's also because we know the virus mutates faster when it can spread to the population faster leaving the things like the omicron variant*	0.737
Nope, I've adressed plenty.	If we want to look at the data I'm sure I could hook you up with an article that disproves your point since you yourself said this is what the news media outlets are reporting on. Likely they are oversimplifying or exaggerating the data, but that's a conversation for later down that path.	0.692
No, you just asserted you were correct.	> Research early in the pandemic suggested that the rate of asymptomatic infections could be as high as 81%. But a meta-analysis published last month1, which included 13 studies involving 21,708 people, calculated the rate of asymptomatic presentation to be 17%. Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3	0.631
Completely disagree. I'm insulting because people have been insulting towards me. An eye for an eye. Learn to live with it or go cry about it.	> Research early in the pandemic suggested that the rate of asymptomatic infections could be as high as 81%.

I did.	<p>then I have to face the fact that COVID has therefore killed at least 4.5 million people since January 22, 2020.</p>	0.62
Plenty of strawman arguments, maybe.	I’m not downplaying omicron. Ive already seen the spike in cases down here but luckily, everybody i know that’s gotten omicron is sick, but no ER. So that’s good."	0.528
No, you ignore 90% of it and strawman the rest.	<p>While the new Omicron variant appears milder than previous variants and it is likely it will not overburden hospitals (precisely because ~ 80% of Canadians recognize their responsibility regarding public health...), it is important to be preemptive in containing the virus so that we don&#39;t find ourselves in a situation where hospitals are overrun. </p>	0.68
Nope.	> As for the flu, I don't see your point. It was a pandemic that became endemic thanks to vaccines.	0.775
Nope.	When it comes down to it, what makes women wrong for considering their partner's finances? It's a reasonable way to screen dates, more reasonable than how hot someone is. Why is it women that should expect less when men could expect more?"	0.582
Not at all.	NOTE: ""evidence"" is not ""repeating the claim, then posting a completely unrelated article""."	0.628
Once again, asserting it does not make it a true statement.	I haven’t said anything about omicron. I just mentioned that the flu is also here. So nobody knows if it’s COVID, flu or just a cold. They all share the same symptoms and since severity varies from person to person, they’re hard to tell apart."	0.888
Again, I've supported my arguments and made counters. If you want me to go into more detail. DM me in a respectful way or go to hell. But I'm not engaging with bad faith actors.	Then just go? Act appropriately and you'll be fine.	0.537
Oh enlightened one. I've just learned another noble truth of which I had no prior knowledge. Criticism is not the same as insults. Who would've known? Truly you are blessed with knowledge.	It's sad you have such poor reading comprehension.	0.644
No, you haven't. Your "supporting arguments" are just more assertions of yours. I haven't seen you actually counter a single comment anyone left, only tiny fragments and strawman takes of their stance. You've repeatedly refused to actually elaborate on the entirety of your post, and accused people of gaslighting for calling out your flimsy arguments. If you have details to provide, provide them here. There's no reason to go to dms except to either break sub rules or to save face when no details are sent.	<p>This piling-on can be a problem and disproportionate, but it does not make cultural appropriation a nonsense concept nor does it make it not a problem sometimes. It just can go overboard and people should work to have more balance and nuance.</p>	0.665
Again, I have. Plenty of times. If you don't want DMs then go ahead and engage with me respectfully here. But I'm not engaging if you're going to be bad faith.	Real people submit papers to this journal. You can go read them, they are technically ""scholarly works"" produced by PhDs.	0.591
Yes only you. Enlightened one. Are graced with this divine knowledge.	I think people are confusing the newness of the technology used to create the vaccine and the  vaccine itself. The vaccine is still effectively a bit of the virus injected to ""teach"" the immune system how to respond to the virus."	0.803
That's no an excuse. Grow up	<p>Hey this is pretty interested. Idk if I morally agree with it but yeah I suppose if Abortions are freely available for a reasonable fee and a woman chooses not to get one despite a man&#39;s uninterest in supporting the child then maybe they should be able to &quot;opt out&quot; . Idk, not sure.</p>	0.77
I'm not in bad faith. I want details you have repeatedly refused to provide. Strange how directly stating what you've done is disrespectful. Perhaps it's because you consider those very things bad, and can't stand the thought of you doing them? Who's to say. Just provide details and stop trying to make excuses.	<p>Yes, it was, in the earlier 20 thcenturys the perception that Eastern Europeans are a &quot;swarthy&quot; race distinct from the pure white Anglo-Saxons, was widespread.</p>	0.636
Grow up yourself	A right is completely made up. I have a right to free speech because the US decided I should have that right. Otherwise, I don't have that right.	0.576
How about you engage respectfully?	<p>But that is not a “gotcha” in the consideration of abortion. It is a separate question about financial obligations once a child is born and how willing society as a whole is to take on the burdens of biological parents of both genders who don’t want to financially support their children.</p>	0.714
I am. I have repeatedly asked for details you continually refuse to provide. How are statements of what you've done disrespectful?	Your perceived rights do not supercede the rights of someone else; that someone else being a fetus that will most likely become a baby. It IS the same as murder."	0.697
Oh another enlightened one. Please teach me, a plebian, a rat of these noble truths. I'm always ready to learn oh enlightened ones.	People do want to associate with their own culture, though not necessarily exclusively.  And that isn't wrong.  But there is no reason why a say, a black kid raised in norway by white parents wouldn't be just as norwegian as a white kid with the same upbringing.	0.709
How about not having such a combattive tone?	<p>Parents have responsibilities to children, correct. However, biological relation is not enough by itself to be a “parent”. Sperm donors are not legal parents. Egg donors are not legal parents. In my opinion, what constitutes a parental relationship is that person assuming the role. I think that there needs to be a way for either biological parent to opt out if they want, but only before or at birth. If they assume the parental role and claim parental rights for even an hour after birth, then there’s no backing out of it. If they do not claim their rights, then they are surrendered permanently and all legal ties are null. </p>	0.684
Oh of course of course. I'm not enlightened as you. That is why.	video of random people fighting in the street is very different than video of your employees that you've tasked with enforcing the law riding around shooting nonlethals at random people for fun without warning or provocation (being out after curfew is not provocation for this sort of violence).	0.514
You first.	<p>Your right, breaking a window has nothing to do with police brutality. So why break the window? Also, it was more than just “breaking windows”. I work in private security, I have seen CCTV from inside some of these businesses. Many got destroyed. Both big retail and small family owned businesses. Saw a pharmacy get completely demolished, medications and personal information stolen. There was power tools being used to gain entry to safes and fireworks being set off inside other locations. Let’s not downplay it. Some business owners lost everything, while they were already closed due to the pandemic. </p>	0.582
This is very grown up behaviour.	Any criteria that would say the US as a 'controlled press' would also say that free press just doesn't exists anywhere. Which is absurd. Besides, u/consideryourself16  is saying the US has the most free speech protections, not that it means some absurdly strict definition of press freedom."	0.615
You seem to be mistaking directness for being combattative. Will you provide details or not?	Also in this current time, this is an extremely volatile topic. Vaccine vs Non vaccine - I don’t see anyone from either side being able to CMV on much about anything.	0.705
Nice job editing your comment	That doesn't mean you're getting paid for more hours.	0.651
Stop being combattive. Tell me what you want details of in the first place.	Vegetables? Same thing	0.589
I wouldn't trust your judgment on that. I bet you're a bored 13 year old who has too much time on their hands.	Crime is a much bigger problem in America than Australia, and I think the non-redistributive nature of wealth in America is a large reason for that. It might feel like you're getting no benefits from working your ass off, but you're actually much safer when everyone in your city has access to childcare and healthcare than when people are left on their own (especially in America where people can be bankrupted by a trip to the hospital). When people are financially, economically, and socially secure, crime dramatically goes down.	0.611
I already did. You just ignored it. Go back and read it again if you want.	<p>The simple fact of the matter is that if the man consented to the possibility that the woman would get pregnant when he had sex, and therefore should be on the hook for child support in that event, then the woman also consented to the possibility she would get pregnant when <em>she</em> had sex, and therefore should be prohibited from receiving an abortion.</p>	0.689
Oh my, too afraid to give them out?	I myself believe that cultural appropriation wouldn't be an issue if only the people doing so were as accepting of the people whose culture they're appropriating."	0.653
Yes yes. Ofc. Bored 13 year old. Totally.	<p>after decades of black empowerment has led to more acceptance of black hair styles, what happens? white people just get to do them without any of the associated cultural baggage. </p>	0.711
Would you rather me call you a sad and pathetic adult? Regardless I think it's clear you have issues to work on. It may be a good idea to address your anger issues before it gets you into trouble.	It seems to me that your whole argument falls apart if you compare two people who are actually equally qualified."	0.632
You came to the wrong website to criticize women about anything, good for you for taking the heat lol	For example, Black Panther takes place in a fantasy location where all the people are black. No problem whatsoever. Lord of the Rings takes place in a fantasy *region* (of a much larger world) where no real-world minorities live. No problem whatsoever.	0.649
Go paste it. I believe in you. Prove you're not saving face.	Discrimantion against hair has less to do about race and more to do about what society sees as norm."	0.719

But you are struggling with reading comprehension. Expecting someone to take off their pants so you can fuck them, is not as bad as asking them to pay. You are comparing apples to grenades.	>I'll like to point out that cultural appropriation is also a big double standard, while white Americans are punished for wearing dreadlocks, no one is criticising European anime lovers for using Asian culture elements.

Dude, your question is in bad faith.

Literaply every respnse youve made has failed to take that into consideration.  Meanwhile you accuse me of putting words in someones mouth while you are at the same time taking words out.

Hell, police officers download and share CCTV recording of their best raids with each other because of how &quot;cool&quot; it looks; that&#39;s as close to a real-world manifestation of the glorification of violence in the media as you can get: you are presented with a video recording of doing unjustifiably violent acts to people, and your response isn&#39;t &quot;oh God, how shameful, I hope no one ever sees this&quot; but &quot;Cool!

It's such a small % that actually get offended, and in most of these cases, the one offended isn't even part of the "appropriated group"; but rather, acting on their behalf.

Delta, OP?	<p>There has to be a one state solution because both sides are fighting over the same land. Your concern that one state would end up being an Arab majority is... questionable. I don&#39;t have an objection to the idea of a Jewish state in theory (other than maybe a general objection to ethnostates...), but the land that is now called Israel was populated by mostly non-Jews historically. There were Jews living there, but they were a minority. So then how could there be a democratic Jewish state on land predominately populated by non-Jews? <em>In practice</em>? There wouldn&#39;t be. Unless for some reason the predominately-Muslim population of Palestine would agree to that, but why would they agree to that? That is why Israel has the law of return for Jews but denies this right to Palestinians even if they lived there within their lifetimes and are still alive today. That is why Israel continues to build settlements in the West Bank. You can say that you disagree with it but yet it is still happening. Saying you disagree with it and that you wish the 67 borders had worked is not a serious engagement with the reality of the situation. I know that the two state solution is the default international position but that is changing. I also don&#39;t care what the &#39;default&#39; is. That isn&#39;t an argument. And I never said the two-state solution was controversial. Clearly it isn&#39;t, hence OP.</p>	0.694

can't convince a sheep	<p>In the first half of the 19th century, no foreigners were allowed to purchase land in Palestine. This was official Ottoman policy until 1856 and in practice until 1867. When it came to the national aspirations of the Zionist movement, the Ottoman Empire opposed the idea of Jewish self-rule in Palestine, fearing it might lose control of Palestine after recently having lost other territories to various European powers. It also took issue with the Jews, as many came from Russia, which sought the empire&#39;s demise.</p>	0.737
uh you mean women bud not "birthing people"	If something is disrespectful, like you're wearing an Indian headdress or a chest full of war medals without earning that position, then that's the bad sort of appropriation. You aren't embracing and respecting the culture, you're riding roughshod over it."	0.561
I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	I fail to see how the claim of Palestinian ownership of Israel is any more valid.

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	A lot of people who do drugs are actually self-medicating because of a chemical imbalance.

What a load of propaganda.   ‘Israel is the only democracy…. Bla bla bla….’  Total garbage. Not very democratic when the entire population living under israeli control from birth until death have zero ability to control the israeli government.   As for Arab/ israelis (Palestinian/ israelis) - there are over three dozen laws that provide special rights for jews, the vast majority of poor areas are the non jewish areas due Tony equal funding and jew on Palestinian crime is almost never properly investigated or prosecuted.   ‘80% of israel is jewish’ ….. that would be be due to the ethnic cleansing of non jewish Palestinians from their land in 1948 and the refusal to let them return.   The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‘Jews escaping bla bla bla……’ this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‘jews as victims’ justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.    Sorry you chose to ignore the manner in which israel gained and maintains its land and jewish majority, while ignoring the occupation, but that doesn’t make these issues go away.

I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	<p>I’m tired of wasting time on your circular logic and baseless arguments that you change because your only intent is to discredit Palestinian history and their ties to the land that was stolen from them. </p>	0.64

I think your reading comprehension is to blame here but nonetheless: Google this discussion and you’ll find countless more studies. HMU when you’re done reading those if this one wasn’t clear or sufficient for you.	You’ve shown statistics on breeds in shelters, vs the breeds people want to own. We’re still going back and forth on whether or not a dog is deserving of love just because of its breed. Just because a dog is bred to be a “blood sport” dog, does this mean it is deserving of the harsh stigma? And is this dog not deserving of a good home? A 2009 Study from the journal of forensic science, shows that aggression from any dog of any breed is affected by the owner, regardless of breed. Just because bully breeds have been formerly used as fighters, doesn’t mean they can’t show change and growth. Most of the pitbulls I’ve met are friendly, as dog fighting has been much less prominent in the past several years (yes I know it still happens) most pitbulls in shelters these days have never even seen “blood sport” violence and wouldn’t exhibit it. Yes after working in California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Michigan, etc etc… most of the pitbulls I’ve met have been nicer than any other dog, and the ones that weren’t “nice” were just shy NOT aggressive.

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‘debate’ (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I’m going to guess that you’re in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you’re willing to let me know your state, I’m happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I’m critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.

Only Yanks could make someone like that out to be a hero.	The best example of when this goes wrong that I can give is of Calvin and Hobbes.

People spend large amounts of time performing a sedentary activity largely by themselves. Even those games which are multiplayer and have player interaction do really have social elements; I don&#39;t talk to the opposing players in Fortnite. Beyond the health risks of sitting around for hours a day doing nothing, there are a host of mental problems. Players aren&#39;t going outside and seeing any nature (associated with good mental health), forming and reinforcing important social bonds with friends and family (associated with good mental health), or engaging in activities the person finds personally meaningful and fulfilling, such as career goals and community programs. If video games didn&#39;t distract these people, their boredom would drive them to do these things. Because they don&#39;t do these things, the person is at an increased risk of depression, which may cause them to turn to drug abuse or to even commit suicide after they spiral from their depression and lack of meaningful living. This, along with the loss of health from the unhealthy lifestyle of sitting around all day, makes playing video games responsible for more deaths. If video games didn&#39;t exist, there would be less physical and mental health complications, thus saving lives.</p>	0.69

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was “you’re old and should die” and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he’s going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of “richest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone”	<p>Rather it should not be socially condoned or encouraged, the idea that it is a good job to have is fundamentally flawed and rooted in misinformation.</p>	0.648

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.

The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	<p>…identity is fundamentally so much more than just personality.</p>	0.597

> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	Those other traits to me seem to be what people default to at a baseline probably based off of experience and observation more than anything else.	0.618

>The oldest attested -phobia compound of these kinds in any language is hydrophobia, attested in the Latin works of [Celsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus). It referred to the rabies symptom where rabid people/animals become dehydrated, but unwilling or unable to drink liquids.   That sounds like exactly what I said. The medical use is the original. Last time I checked, rabies is a medical condition.    >We're talking etymology, where there's no such thing as original meaning. We can trace terms back to the boundary of written language, beyond which linguists develop hypothetical proto-languages as models of the sort of next stage back that might have existed but was never written. That gives us the oldest knowable meaning of the term, at least. Here, it's the Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to run".  Nice straw man. It's crazy the lengths you will go to to avoid admitting the definition of a word that can be found to be some variation of "irrational fear", in any dictionary.

What is the derived root?   Because I think you just made that up.   [A quick Google tells us](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/%E1%B8%B1ers-) that the PIE root for "run" is "ḱers-" while the [root of "phobia" is from the Greek word "phóbos"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=-phobia), meaning “fear”.

I think something to recognize is that almost anyone can call themselves nonbinary.

The simple fact is that when kids go to school, they do so for many hours at a time and the job of the stay-at-home-mom is much simpler. Obviously that isn't true during a pandemic when distance learning challenges every parent. But I remember being in high school especially from 8 in the morning to 10 at night sometimes. What exactly would a stay at home mother would be doing then? I had very little supervision growing up, in fact. My mother fed me and made sure I had the money to be clothed and that there was always electricity and shelter. A typical suburban middle class upbringing. But as soon as I learned to drive at 15 years old, I was a lot more independent. The last time my mother helped me with schoolwork, I was 9 and was learning my multiplication tables. She never helped me with a single assignment since then. I did every single reading assigned to me in junior high school, elementary school, and high school. I was responsible for my own schoolwork. If my mom had been a stay at home mom, pray tell what was she doing all the hours I was busy taking care of my own homework and going to school?	0.642

Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options.

Lighten up Francis.	<p>So I don&#39;t care how much it hurts your fee-fees, the fact remains that the historical injustices of the past carry forward to the present. It&#39;s effects are pervasive throughout our whole society, and we all benefit or suffer from it in some way. To this is what the term is truly referring - the unwillingness of white people to confront this reality.

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	Necrophilia does not stop anyone from dying with dignity.

The same as those who fought tooth and nail to end it? Is this really news to you?	<p>The most important tradeoff between them is the assumption of risk. Under socialism, the workers are on the hook if a company doesn&#39;t perform well, but if it does perform, everyone benefits because they all jointly own the company. <em>In theory</em>, capitalism on the other hand allows a separate group of people to assume all the risk for the opportunity at the largest gain, and <em>in theory</em> the workers take on less risk in exchange for a reliable paycheck and no ownership in the company. The problem with capitalism today is that it has efficiently figured out how to lobby the govt over time to shift more and more of the risk onto the workers, while still keeping all of the profits for the shareholders. After all, that&#39;s their goal right? Minimize losses and maximize gains, nothing else matters. So where we are today, the workers already get all of the downsides of socialism with none of the profits, while the owners see all of the upsides of capitalism and none of the risks. In other words, we currently have socialism for the rich. (Obviously there are people out there running legitimate companies, assuming their risk, paying workers consistently and fairly, <strong>and those people are putting themselves at a disadvantage because of it</strong>. Larger corporations are dominating the game because they are wiling to shift all risk onto the workers, and this strategy will always win for the same reason that slavery is always more profitable than paying your workers).</p>	0.658

>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having racial biases can and do exist but making it illegal to make laws that discriminate did end systematic racism. Now a system showing racial bias can exist but that is a separate concept even if that concept is called systematic racism. The CRT use of systematic racism simply reflects that there is a correlation of race and outcome. The reasons for this are not part of the CRT evaluation bc CRT assumes it's bc of racism and not factors such as individual choice. Point is it is illegal for any system to discriminate racially so the system is actively against racism. Society also completely demonizes anyone who judges people based on race so society itself is actively against racism. What system with any power is actively FOR racism as in encouraging people to discriminate based on race? Literally the only systems pushing for racism is the democrats, the CRT praxis supporters, and the neo Nazis/white supremacists.   >The system is like a vehicle. Ask yourself who's driving it. Historically its the white male elite.  So all white males are intrinsically racist and think exactly alike? Or do you mean that minorities are so different to white males that they cannot compete in the same meritocracy? Either way that's a really racist statement.   >And it is still based on merit, although I don't think we are living in this ideal meritocracy you think we do, it's just merit that would've been passed up on because they have a black name.  You literally are more likely to get into college, get promoted, or get hired with a black name. Being white is literally detrimental to your career in today's society. A white person would need to score 150 points higher on the SATs than a non Asian minority and Asians would need to score 200+ higher. This discrimination you state just doesn't exist in reality, it's a false narrative based on outcomes not on actions.   >Affirmative action notwithstanding because I agree with that policy and see the merit in it.  Sure but it's still racist policy regardless if you see the merit in it.   >From the right it happens that its a kind of fearmongering to white nationalists that's been going on a while.  I wasn't aware the 1300 white nationalists in the states (the prison gangs can't vote) was such a big lobby. As far as fearnongering goes, when policy literally discriminates against white people is it fear mongering or just calling out unconstitutional racial discrimination?  >Charles Darwin was no genius, neither was Einstein. They were specialized in their field and at the right place at the right time. Their work benefited greatly from names you've never heard of.   They literally had 150+ IQs. To claim they weren't genius level intellects is complete idiocy. That's literally the dumbest statement I've ever heard. Everyone's work benefitted from other people and that in no way invalidates genius. I'm really struggling to justify even responding to someone idiotic enough to think this bc it shows your complete ignorance to not only basic complexity but also the complete lack of understanding the difference in ability. Oh yea anyone could come up with relativity or evolution it's no big deal. E=mc2 is a simple equation if you don't understand the gravity of what it actually means. Pun intended.   >The only problem with that sentiment is that we've built our systems in a way that makes each person a cost to their environment. It doesn't have to be that way.  You have established you know nothing about systems so your opinion is useless.   >Also, right libertarianism is just the hunger games, and the IO games we have today.  The hunger games had an authoritarian government that killed dissenters so no that's facism or authoritarian left bc they redistributed wealth...mainly to capital city bc that's what the authoritarian redistribution system traditionally does.   >And without physical violence or professional gatekeeping at play, people would be invested in maintaining that central structure because it's based on finding and distributing knowledge everyone can use to make their lives better, rather than an imaginary fear of the other that demands you give up your rights for your own good.  Dumbest statement ever. I'm a libertarian. I'm for individual rights even if they counteract the will of the majority. So your whole system required that humankind be reasonable, rational, selfless, and put the benefit of others over themselves to work? That's your system? That's retarded. That has never worked and will never work bc that is not humanity. What kind of privileged upbringing did you have to think that is in any way not complete idiocy? Your whole system requires perfect people or else it fails so it will fail and then the people will authorize force to save it from failure which is exactly what happens in every attempt at socialism. You can't redesign humanity, you have to redesign a system to work with the reality of humanity aka humans are greedy so base a system on that aka capitalism.    I'd love to continue this but you want to preach not have your mind changed. That's fine but the more I hear the more idiotic and clueless you sound. Half the stuff you say is in direct opposition to the other half. It's completely obvious you have zero real world experience and read a few socialist books and think you understand the world and all it's problems when literally you just succumbed to propaganda. I hate resorting to name calling but the level of both ignorance, hubris, and confirmation bias in your rational is mind blowing. I like libertarianism but I am aware of it's flaws. I am not ignorant enough to think it is perfect, I simply think that the cost benefit analysis for it is better than other systems. You, on the other hand, think your system is flawless even though your system requires human perfection to be realized. I can only hope that you can scrape together enough sanity to understand the gravity of that analysis. Quite frankly you are also a racist and an advocate of systematic racism but in complete denial of that fact. Sorry but not sorry.	<p>Necrophilia does not stop anyone from dying with dignity.

I used a simple historical example since you were having such a hard time wrapping your brain around the concept of racism, that I was doing my best to draw it out in crayon for you. There's plenty of modern examples, like for instance the legacy of segregation, which is tied to long-standing poverty and crime in predominantly black neighborhoods and cities. Unless you believe that black people are inherently more criminally minded than white people, then it's pretty obvious that this is a result of segregation, followed by continual efforts to undermine desegregation efforts like desegregation bussing and prevent mobility and investment in inner city communities. That is still being felt today and undoing that legacy matters if we want to live in a country where justice gets served and there aren't barriers for some people based on the color of their skin.

As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.

> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion?

I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different	Situations like this are rare because parents opt to home school their kids tend to be more invested in their child's education.	0.606

You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	Racism knows no bounds and racism certainly wasn't invented by a white guy.

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids.

I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.

I have maxed DL, and to reveal my bias here I was an Olympic style lifter all through HS. I found that sensation of your body tearing apart at the when doing most any max, but nothing quite compared to the bottom of a clean during a tournament winning C&J.  For HS Football, the coaches loved the traditional power lifting lifts (BS, Bench, DL) and they always seemed static, slow twitch and boring to me.  With the olympic style coach, we would do straight leg DLs, or Romanian DLs, where the idea was to actually improve your overall lifting ability by adding flexibility to the strength.  I do see what you’re saying overall though, but maybe this was a poor choice of CMV for me because my view is mostly unchanged.  Yes, I get that a heavy DL is a pure expression of the ability to move the most possible weight, how ever short the eventual distance.  But that still just seems boring overall to me.

The entire reason that Iraq shifted from <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Saddam_rumsfeld.jpg"">international ally</a> to enemy is because Saddam invaded Kuwait, turning the stable Iraqi dictatorship that served as a good <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/world/us-secretly-gave-aid-to-iraq-early-in-its-war-against-iran.html"">foil for Iran</a> (who we really don&#39;t like) into a force of destabilization in the region.

This is exhausting! You are asking a first year college philosophy question. And it's an ancient apologetics arguement. By (supposedly) clever wordplay, setting up  logically opposite parameters, you attempt to make your strawman God-concept impossible.  It's the equivilent of asking if God can make a rock so heavy that He can't lift it.   The scenario is so sophmoric and naive, it's the type of a question that needs more than an answer.

I would actually like to add that even the free will argument is invalid. Suppose humans do have "free will" and that's why god doesn't intervene to stop things like genocide. First of all, that's still a shitty argument. Why not just program humans to not want to commit genocide? But more importantly, God clearly has no problem taking away free will from humans, or, creating ones that don't have any.   Think about people with mental illnesses, people who have brain injury, psychopaths etc. They all lack free will. Many of them were born that way or have had things happen to them that were completely out of their control. So God has no problem taking away free will from people when it's a tragic incident happening to them, but, when he would actually need to intervene with something like genocide or rape or murder, his followers conveniently claim that he can't, because then he would be removing free will.   Fact is, there is no way to apply the word "good" to God, because our definition of good doesn't include viruses, diseases, cancer and natural disasters.   The only thing a religious person can say is that we will find out when we die, which again, how convenient and also, how pathetic. Imagine believing your entire life that suffering is okay on earth because once you die you'll find out why it happened.	<p>Now that&#39;s direct harassment, and I&#39;ve also mentioned a way to &quot;bad faith&quot; harass people  - I think &quot;concern trolling&quot; might be a term to use there. But there&#39;s also the issue that you&#39;ve created a space where people are going to mock the verified relentlessly, and this brings up the nature of humans. If you know there&#39;s a whole city where your name and pictures are regularly memed on - where people say the most outlandish and hateful things about you, would you be curious as to what exactly was being said? I think a lot of people would. So your proposal is essentially &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot;, but we don&#39;t work that way. So while direct harassment may be reduced, hate and mockery won&#39;t be. </p>	0.616

To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.  An "all powerful" God would have the power to keep people from unnecessary suffering, and yet millions of children still die per year needlessly, and Earth itself is on a massive decline that God isn't helping with in any way. Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	<p>In society, the most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group.

I’m not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it “the problem of evil”, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world.

If you believe these things there will be no changing your view.	<p>Religions are different ways people in the past have tried to take the path of understanding and solace, and sometimes enlightenment.

It's very clear that there is a culture of rape.  Similar to what I wrote in that other response, we normalize rapist behavior (that is, behavior that isn't rape but if not addressed and singled out as bad, can lead to rape).  We bend over backwards to excuse rapists, and rely on almost a ""boys will be boys"" mindset if it's male rapists, (or outright say it's just not possible if it's a female rapist).  The thing is, if it's true that men are simply naturally inclined to rape, *then men shouldn't be allowed outside without supervision*, and if they aren't naturally inclined to rape, *then we should be focusing on what social factors create such a gender disparity in rape*.  When we look at burglaries, they are most often tied to economics.  That is, the more income inequality that exists, the more economic uncertainty a community faces, the more likely people are to turn to burglary.  To be frank, the people who say that ""watch your drink"" and ""use a buddy system"" are victim blaming are the same kinds of people who want to eliminate economic inequality, to get at the core issues of burglaries.	0.748

Porn is very much like social media (and crack) in that it has a strongly addictive effect. It creates certain neuronal pathways that craft a sort of dependence on porn to receive a &quot;high&quot;. When this happens at a large enough scale, you&#39;ll have enough people effected that the general culture around sex will change to something warped and unnatural.

Ok	-People point at one sin, while not accepting the sin that they committed. If one party is sinful, both parties are sinful. Most churches don’t like democratic policies due to tax purposes.

Sweetheart, if you didn't learn better as a child, there is no hope.	> the Catholic Church in medieval Europe, as well as the Reformed Churches, regarded the charging of interest **at any rate as sinful** (as well as charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a bureau de change).\[6\] Religious prohibitions on usury are predicated upon the belief that charging interest on a loan is a sin.	0.556

Reading through this thread, you come across as one of those smug weirdos. It seems to me you have an idea of who you’re arguing against in your head and projecting a lot of that into the comments instead of reading them at face value. You come across as unnecessarily accusatory.	A better argument would be to list the specific advancements that are attributed to space exploration and compare that to the money we've spent. THEN make a value determination like ""it just isn't worth it"". STILL probably won't convince most people, but it's a more plausible path.	0.649

There are some bad takes on this thread, surprisingly.	But you weren't the only person who jumped to the conclusion that I must have been making that gatekeeping argument and smacking him down for being too ignorant to have an opinion. That just couldn't be further from the truth as far as how I feel, nor do I feel like that's at all a fair reading of my response. I also already addressed this misperception because even though hundreds or thousands of people liked my post and clearly got the gist of it being mere questions from a few different perspectives, some open ended and some a little more leading or challenging just to feel OP out--but in know way was I making an argument myself at that point. I think for a small minority of people in this sub, my method here was outrageous or something, because there were a handful of angry responses that got deleted.	0.504

That Bills/KC game was amazing. Two evenly matched teams giving their all with spectacular plays on both sides. The winner came down to a coin flip. They should be able to answer the TD with the next kickoff in OT, and back and forth til one doesn’t make it. I could have watched that for hours.

It’s sad you think that’s what this is all about.	If you want to contrast that with, for example, heaven with angels, you have to now assume the existence of souls, heaven, and angels.

You only care about the rules that negatively affect you.	<p>The old system where studios selected acts for prominence had problems, it was undemocratic and arguably led to conformity of its own.

Take 2	As I said, I didn't want to digress into an explanation of how capitalism operates as it can get rather complex and long, and I think it's quite tangential to our discussion. My objective with the example was to show you a simple situation that clearly refuted your premise that one is paid based on the value they create. Hopefully now that you understand the purpose, and that it's not an analogy, you see the flaw with your premise, and we can continue with the rest of our discussion.	0.722

> It's *your* side that doesn't give any sort of clear answer, no characteristics for what makes someone a "man" or a "woman."  Yea, that's the fucking point you idiot.  Society has strictly dictated for millenia that men act this way and do this and women act that way and do that. When since time began we've all just been people doing our own damn shit and all your idiotic comments about the biological argument are 1. Cringe. 2. Irrelevant to a conversation about gender. And 3. Largely wrong lmao. You fail to recognize the middle ground that exists between male and female sex because you can **only** imagine a binary of male and female.  There aren't clear characteristics for what makes a man or a woman, that's the entirety of the point. When you have single moms who are the metaphoric father with a firm hand and you have stay at home dads who take care of the kids all day, your gender norms are fucked to death and left bleeding in a ditch but you idiots **SCREAM** about how this doesn't make sense! There are men! And women! And if you're trans you're really just a man who's confused! Showing how horribly and willfully blind you are to the calm reality of people living their lives without being bound to the strict ideals of male and female concepts which itself is fluid and cultural. Women went from flower-print stay at home moms to Rosie the riveter during the war because the public perception **needed** to change for the good of the country. So women wouldn't be shamed for working and because there was a shortage of labor.  No one can give a definition of what it means to be a man or a woman because that's an individualistic thing. I can say what being a man is to me but another man would disagree, claiming it's the polar opposite concepts that make him a man, and those reasons are just as valid.  The host, and argumentative individuals like yourself, are trying to box us into a strict definition so they can argue those definitions from a logical/scientific place, they don't actually have any interest in what these people think a woman is, they just want them to define it so they can argue against them with the full spectrum of hypocrisy and contradiction. "Oh? A woman is delicate? Well 'x' was a woman who stood up for her values and took charge, I'd say that was womanly of her, and not delicate, don't you think!?" For infinity.  But no natural woman or man, etc. Can say what makes one that thing. This has been debated by those within the rigid gender form for millenia as well. Hemingway and Wilde contributed on opposing ends of what makes a man, delicacy or vigor, etc. No one can say, so it's a stupid fucking question to try to pin on them and then say "haha, you can't even define what makes you that in a fashion everyone agrees with which NO ONE has been able to do! Time to invalidate your sense of identity!"  Every single argument with trans people and trans identity is just a rehash of the arguer not recognizing their identity and trying to find logical/mathematic/scientific basis for doing so that they can then hold up and say "see? I wasn't really a bigot, it's just science." And to eeeeeveryone who is with the shit you literally just sound like old school doctors who "proved race is genetic and that there is a hierarchy of species based on these clearly identifiable traits, see you have big lips so you must be inferior." "See, you can't define a woman so you must be a man."  "See you don't have x so you aren't equal to others" is the fundamental ideological basis. You're equivalent to racists in this regard.  Get, the fuck, over it.  There isn't a logical or mathematic or scientific or whatever basis for gender because it is a mental construct created by those within the culture. Recognizing the same genders as indigenous tribes have is a pretty low fucking bar and none of you elitist academic types can bend your bricked out brains around that one and it would (really) be so goddamn funny (genuinely) if it wasn't so horrifically exhausting and depressing to be invalidated for who you are, every single day, because idiots like you can't just let shit be that you don't understand. And you set standards which we have no interest or benefit in following then condemn us for not following them. Eat shit dude.

I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	<p>I think that just neglecting the idea of gender based sports and simply having athletic classes based on performance would probably be more equitable, fun and most importantly fair.</p>	0.568

>The only side driving children to suicide is yours.

Evidence that it is more than society causing the suicide rates can be seen by comparing transgender suicide rates to Jews in the Holocaust. The Jews had literally the worst societal impact, yet they had lower suicide rates?  >Nobody is forcing pronouns on you. They're...a part of speech? Do you not know what pronouns are?

Vaccinated people can still contract and spread covid. There will be a ton of uninformed people in these comments arguing that if you get vaccinated, there’s less of a chance of that. They’re wrong. There are no covid studies that have a legitimate control group, so the results say what they want them to say, “get vaccinated so we can make more money”. The numbers of covid hospitalizations are wildly misrepresented because of the financial benefit hospitals have by coding someone as a covid pt, rather than some dude that was seen in the ER for a broken arm that happened to test positive for covid. Covid deaths are also being misrepresented for the same reason… pt brought in by EMS with a gunshot wound to the head? Covid positive? Yep, you guessed it, covid death. The reality is that covid is not the same virus that it was 2 years ago. The current variant is closer to a regular cold than it was when it was shutting down people’s lung function.

I suppose I'm stuck in my way of thinking that we're all personally responsible for our own health, and that it's not my responsibility to vaccinate because of your grandma. (Ironically, my 80+ y/o, emphysema-diagnosed grandma just recovered from covid)  The talking point I see the most is that it's selfish to not vaccinate because it puts others at risk, but I have an issue with that... I see no reason to believe that I'm less likely to transmit the virus if I'm vaccinated. Based on my current understanding, it spreads by airborne germs and masking/washing my hands frequently is doing *significantly* more to reduce transmission than a vaccine would accomplish.

Most people dont spend so many hours arguing in bad faith. Find a hobby.	Reading the Bible, it does not appear that God is primarily interested in preventing people (believers or otherwise) from suffering. Look at Abraham, asked to sacrifice Isaac. Look at Job, made to suffer to demonstrate to Satan that good men are pious to God for reasons other then their own wellbeing. Look at Jesus, who died on the cross. Look at the martyrs, who are exalted as early saints of the Church, because they suffered and died for their beliefs. If God's love was merely about preventing suffering, then the God of the bible does not ""love"" you in that way.	0.787

> Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns.  This is just whataboutism being used as a red herring. Nobody is talking about mass shootings here. Mass shootings have nothing to do with this discussion. Literally nothing.  >You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.  So let's be real on a few things here. First of all 2.5 million is bonkers-insane-nuts completely unsupported by facts. There are stats put out by individual cities, and from those stats, we know that the real number can't be anywhere close to that high.  But, as a fun fact, the reason why the CDC doesn't have more accurate numbers, is because it's legally forbidden from sponsoring that sort of research, As our Republican institutions and entities that receive public funding. The NRA lobbied hard for a law making it illegal for us to find out how often self-defense happens relative to other gun actions..  I think that speaks pretty clearly to what the numbers would show if we could actually do that research.  Second of all, 60,000 per year is nothing. That's 1 in 6,667.  Considering that there are 48 lotteries in this country each doing multiple drawings daily, that's roughly how many people win the lottery per year.  If that happens to you, yes, you are a statistical unicorn. That's not misleading; that's fact.   But let's not stop there, because in fact, even that number is wildly inflated by law enforcement statistics being mixed in.  Yes, one in 6,667 of us may engage in acts of self-defense, but most of the people included in that stat are not people in their own house. They are people whose jobs put them in conflict with people, like law enforcement.  That's a totally different scenario.  But don't take my word for it, do this simple search for yourself: Go to news.google.com, pick a large city with over a million people in it, and just search and that city specifically over the last year, for stories about home invasions and self-defense  How many did you find? 10? 20? That's my point exactly. That sort of scenario is super rare. It happens, but it's not going to happen to you. You aren't that lucky/unlucky.    > Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  The only one of us attempting to mislead, is you, with the red herring at the start..   > That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  It can be both. You know the famous Seattle study showed that there were roughly seven suicide attempts and four accidental shootings for every self-defense shooting in Seattle In 1998.  The conclusion from that is pretty clear, that you are a bigger risk to yourself from your own gun, then people who would do harm to you are at risk from it.  That's just facts.

First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	- School shootings?

It is a subjective state yes, but as are all mental illnesses. So suicide points to a mental illness when it prevents you being able to live the way you choose. Imagine that suicidal thoughts are so frequent you no longer spent time thinking about how you want to live. That is clearly a barrier to being able to live the way you want. You&#39;re unable to muster up the creativity to see a life worth living. In order for suicide not to be indicitave of mental illness, you would need to choose to end your life even though it is completely possible for you to see reasons for living, even though you actively want to live. Here really illuminates the examples of euthanasia, there is an element of euthanasia where the person would prefer to live healthily, but realises their illness is terminal, if the illness was not terminal there would be reasons for living. </p>	0.634

The one you want to use is a ""*all loving, all powerful, all knowing entity*"" which is often used in theology.

The inconvenience comes from the fact that our government does not provide resources for underprivileged citizens who do not have access to their ID (i.e. those who live paycheck-to-paycheck via hourly wages). For example if my ID was destroyed, my employer does not allow me to take paid time-off to replace it. Our government clearly understands that ID is important  but does not provide any accommodation to obtain one.

Your instincts serve you well. VAERS already has more than 22,000 death reports from the vaccines, which is needless to say far, far more deaths than every single other vaccine combined. Most vaccines are pulled from the market after just a few dozen deaths. This is absolutely unprecedented to recommend a vaccine to young people, at zero risk for serious symptoms from the virus (not a single kid who didn’t have leukemia died with coronavirus let alone of it), that is potentially fatal. Not just that, everyone by this point knows someone or many people who’ve had bad side effects. My wife’s very pro vaccine friend has had vertigo and other alarming side effects for months after her booster, another family friend went to the ER for heart issues two days after the second shot, and my 37-year-old former classmate from both high school and college died within 48 hours of her second shot. She didn’t want the vaccine but had to get it if she wanted to be involved with her kids at school; she left behind two young children.   That aside, who are you trusting exactly? Big Pharma? Dr. Fauci? All people who get a nice payday when everyone is vaccinated, even though there’s zero medical reason that anyone under 55 should need a vaccine against the sniffles. It’s all scare tactics, the emperor has no clothes. They throw this huge number at you - oh but 860,000 people have died from it!! No they haven’t. Who said that?! 860,000 people perhaps had it at the time of death? Sure, but they didn’t die from it. In fact the average person had 3-4 other underlying issues and that’s right from the CDC. About 3 million people die per year, so yes, a certain number of those people will happen to have Covid because it’s widespread. If you look at who actually just flat out died of Covid, it’s 5% of that figure. 5!! That’s as many people as die of the seasonal flu.   When people say trust the science, you know, I do. I have since the very start actually. The science says you don’t need a vaccine if something isn’t a threat to you. It says right now the vaccines don’t stop infection, don’t prevent the spread, and stop illness but may prevent more serious side effects (if the vaccine doesn’t kill your, of course). The guy who invented mRNA vaccines, incidentally, Dr. Robert Malone, is a die hard anti-vaccine mandate advocate and said that under no circumstances should mRNA vaccines be injected into people. That’s right from the guy who invented the technology. But why trust him, right?! I’m sure he didn’t risk his reputation to speak out for any particular reason.

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.	<p>&quot;Most people have either XY or XX chromosomes&quot; is a statement about the nature of sex. </p>	0.742
Many would say that political ideologies such as Capitalism or Communism or Humanism are just as much “religions” as Christianity or Judaism or Islam.

We’re experiencing a transition to *different* religions.	Far more dangerous things happens when we restrict voting for no good reasons."	0.707
I completely agree. Parenting isn't a job you graduate from when the kid is 18. Different boundaries or dynamics may have to be placed as the person ages but parents should always be a source of support. In essence it's about building a community together. I want my kids to not fear where they'll get money for food or rent or tuition. I want them to know they can always come home. I want them to have a stress free young adulthood for as long as physically possible so they get to explore and experience themselves as much as they can at the start of their adult lives. It makes for happier, healthier, well rounded and well adjusted adults. Adults who care about other people. The idea that at 18 you're suddenly expected to have everything sorted and survive on your own is a garbage, modern day farce demanded most prominently by capitalism and is not actually how rearing young humans should work. Many people, not because they're lazy or unmotivated, simply aren't ready to launch right at 18. That's normal. That should be ok. They should have a support system.	The idea that god doesn't exist, is a conclusion that would require proving a negative. And more than that would require the ability to observe the universe objectively. Since we can not observe the world Objectively or prove a negative the ability for science TO EVER PROVE God is not real is an impossible task and thus has no basis for belief using science as a justification."	0.694

And unless you’ve been in a coma you’ve probably realized that my side has been correct about everything, not wrong once. 1) It wasn’t a wet market, it was a lab leak. That’s now widely understood. 2) Cloth masks don’t work, they never did. The reason we were sure of that is because we can read, unlike your side. I read all of the dozens of peer reviewed research studies published from 1981 through 2020 and they studied surgical and N95 masks and still *not a single one* found any benefit against airborne respiratory viruses. That’s because even N95 masks have 0.30 micron holes and viruses are 0.13 microns. It takes just 100 virus particles for infection and millions are propelled into the air with coughs and sneezes. Even blocking 99% of them does you no good. The data confirms this - mask mandates states didn’t have any better infection rates than ones that never had a mask mandates. Masks aren’t for viruses, they’re for bacteria. 3) We said they’d mandate vaccines and create vaccine passports. They did. 4) We said there would be booster after booster. That’s exactly what happened. We called that before the first vaccine was even on the market. 5) We said antibody dependent enhancement was a risk. Studies from Israel show that’s very possible. Even the NYT acknowledged that - more boosters could lower your natural immune function, not raise it.  You might want to start taking notes and realizing we have done A LOT more research than you have. And we have the experts to back up our views, you know, since we do actually trust the science!	There's some evidence that the brains of men and women have slightly different structures, and those structures don't always correspond with their external sex. That may be what makes you identify as a man or a woman. It's also not hard to imagine someone's brain being in a middle point between both structures, thus being non-binary. Anyways, the exact reason isn't that important, if someone say's ""I'm a woman"" we should assume she's saying the truth.	0.61

The 40+ hour week dates from a time when the majority of workers lived in families with 1 breadwinner and 1 home naker. That one person earned enough to feed, clothe and house their family. This only lasted a comparatively short period. Pay didn't keep up with inflation / cost of living. Women joining the workforce, automation, robots, computers/outsourcing to cheaper countries all reduced the amount of jobs, and that brought down pay (just to be clear, I don't blame women!

Do you follow the Kardashians on social media? You might think celebrity gossip is reductive and garbage and the people that are interested in it are basically stupid and wasting their lives... and you'd be right... but it has a strong relationship with religion and perhaps your opinion.  Whether the Torah was dictated to Moses by God in the wilderness or not, it's laws are a set of social guidelines that helped form a distinct community. It helped bring reform, order and bring social cohesion to people. People need social guidelines to conform to for a sense of equality in their tribes.  Over the decades there are many ways for those social guidelines to manifest.  * The Church until the last century * Actual Laws * Gossip, and people who Gossip. "Oh look Maggy at 42 is pregnant again. At her age.... " * Newspapers, Soaps during the 80s - 2000 * Facebook Memes, Twitter accounts, Trashy celebs are how morals are propogated and pushed on to each other these days.  Facebooks Memes aren't always supposed to be funny, they are sometimes supposed to push a political view on you. You Uncle with the weird posts is essentially just from a different social tribe as you - even though you are related! These social expectations and rules, this public lambasting of certain people are a replacement for the bible. That we all understand and conform to certain social rules.  With Politcs in America becoming ever more divisive (since and thanks to Trump) and escalating into hard left and right stances it's easy to identify how this is causing people to choose one of two tribes in the US. How it matters more than Facebook Memes, TV dramas and actual laws. So yeah politics is replacing religion in America somewhat but it's a meandering journey about social identity and more than that - trying to force people to live according to your core beliefs.	<p>Art is something that holds individual  as long as the viewer is: a human, not a psychopath...</p>	0.624

So in your case you don't live on a very well thought out or diverse farm. You specifically farm livestock and nothing else, it also sounds as though you have no access to pasture or large grasslands, otherwise your opinions are just opinion, and based on imagination.   There is no future for the meat industry.  You are suggesting that farmers would simply pay to destroy their only assets, destroying their business and choosing bankruptcy in one fell move? Instead of making a significantly more passive income from supplying to the organic fertilizer industry and local arable, fruit and etc farmers which would boom in response to the massive increase in demand.   Forgive me for calling BS, you come off as either a fantasists, delusional, or just intentionally feigning ignorance in an attempt to justify the continuation of what you have always considered the norm.  Yes I'm alright but I'm getting tired of obtuse poorly thought out opinions and having to hear them come out of what I would hope are usually intelligent people, it's extremely wearing.	Also, that is next problem of ""objectively"" critism. You have to study for that, and that means it's some ""artificial rules"" who somebody created. But I usually do not see that. For example, I love movie ""mother!"" from Darren Aronofsky. One professional from my country gave this movie 0%. My friend who studied art said it's horrible movie with horrible camera.

Are you that far in your hole that you don't know that hospital s classify a death as a covid death regardless of the main reason,as long as they are positive when they die?  Lol you are really telling me that the government and big pharma have no reason to lie. I bet you think they want all of their customers to be as healthy as can be too. Only the biggest lawsuits in history follow these companies get your head out of your ass.   Bet you believe that the flu took a year off too. You just keep repeating "safe and effective" and don't pay any attention to the fact that you were told you won't catch covid if you get the vaccine. Science isn't guessing what will happen it's experimenting until a result is consistent. Yes experimenting.  If you don't see a problem with medical professionals being censored and deleted off social platforms for simply offering a second opinion then you are too far gone.  No issues with not discussing the possible side effects like every other drug in history? Or the adverse reactions totalling more than all vaccines combined? Don't you think it's worth at least a discussion to make people aware of what they put in their body? Or are you okay with an outside source telling you and everyone else what to put in their body.   Herd immunity? You really still believe that? Every country that has hit the initial targets for herd immunity is no better than 2 years ago. I hope you realize how wrong you are someday because I know I will never change the minds of people like you   Oh the seat belt argument that's a classic.. I can take my seat belt off whenever I want to no matter the safety to others. That's the same as putting an unknown needle into myself that I can never undo?  They were never intended to stop transmission altogether? I recall hearing from the leader of the free world as well as the cdc and fda that they will stop transmission and you won't get the virus. We're just okay with leaders blatantly lying to us with no consequences now? Don't ask me for a source educate yourself if you have the memory of a goldfish. Maybe start with who funds and designs what doctor's learn.	Since an individual's risk of catching COVID is far higher than 1 in 1000 and will presumably remain so until we achieve herd immunity, the vaccine remains by far the safer option even under all of those assumptions.	0.72

> Lies? Really? I’m responding to OP in a sub called change your view. Don’t insult me.  Yes. Lies. Stop it.  You are linking to a website that is totally false. It goes against all facts and common sense. It goes against what is on the UN website. Against what the US DoD says. Against what the Security Council says. Against what even wikipedia says.  And on top of it all. it outright lies about what Chapter 8 is and what resolution 1973 is. Here's plenty of evidence for that:   It's literally on the wikipedia page for regional organizations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_organization (click show at the bottom, it's in the list).  The US military considers it a regional organization in its official documents https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA445041 "allows a regional organization, such as NATO"  All of this nonsense about "regional organizations" in Chapter 8 of the UN charter is absurd. https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-8 Read the chapter. It's like 10 sentences. "regional organizations" never even appear anywhere in the Chapter!  The confusion really stems from a misunderstanding of how the Security Council works. The Security Council can say they are acting under their Chapter 7 powers, https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7, to secure peace. Or, they could say they are acting under their Chapter 8 powers to delegate peaceful settlement to other organizations. NATO has made it clear that it is not interested in being part of Chapter 8 operations because its ability to respond to escalations would be more limited, if it gets involved, it's going to be through the more powerful Chapter 7.  But that's not an issue. The Security Council almost never uses Chapter 8! And what the original story said is a total lie. Resolution 1973 is a Chapter 7 resolution, not a chapter 8 resolution. https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/1973%20(2011) It's right there in black and white, bottom of page 2 "Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nation".  I think someone carelessly overheard a NATO spokesperson give an interview and got super confused. Sometimes, they will say something along the lines of "NATO isn't a Chapter 8 regional organization". That doesn't mean it's not a regional organization, because that term means nothing! It's not defined anywhere in the Charter. They're just saying, if you're going to look for a regional organization to get involved, you need to do it under Chapter 7, not 8, if you want NATO involved.  Now, there have been people arguing for 60 years that NATO should switch to getting involved via Chapter 8 not 7. To have more limited operations. But NATO doesn't want to be chained this way. Anyway, consider this: all of these resolutions could have been vetoed by Russia. If they thought NATO was acting illegally why would they allow this over and over again? It's all pretty absurd.	> Simply put, give the logical proof of why solomonoff is right.	0.519

We the people are free	""adult human female"" sounds like a logically sound definition on a surface level, but what does it actually mean? is someone a woman if they have XX chromosomes? that can't be the case, because a number of women are born with XY chromosomes (https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/swyer-syndrome/). is someone a woman if they have a vagina? it can't be that either, since a number of men are born with female genitalia (https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/persistent-mullerian-duct-syndrome/)	0.614
> It is happening, man  Solid rebuttal.  I'd argue you have your head in the sand because you're unable to comprehend a very simple series of events. It's not worth my time continuing a discussion with someone unable to grasp a simple concept.  X number of animals were killed as of today to provide meat in the grocery stores. There is a deer in the woods still alive, if I go decide to kill that deer it's now dead... It wasn't dead this morning, but it is dead now that I shot it. Again, it's really not hard to follow along.   The meat in your grocery store was dead already, the animals in the woods are alive until you decide to go kill one. It really boils down to you being able to wrap your head around this concept. Given this situation, it is immoral to go out and kill another animal when you didn't need to. That's literally all I'm arguing at the end of the day - a hunter doesn't wake up and NEED to kill an animal, but they do anyway.  More death is unacceptable, I don't care if it makes you feel better about yourself. From the animal's perspective, you just killed me even though there's 1000s of pounds of meat in the grocery store down the road.	<p>Jan 4 2021 99.5% of active cases were mild or asymptomatic.</p>	0.55

I completely agree.  It feels sickening to me that we are born just to have to work 9-5 for the rest of our lives, and live like that.  But at the same time, there's many things you can do. For instance you can save up, or take a loan, then move abroad for some time with that money. And perhaps you find a way to sustain yourself while you are over there, at minimal cost, at minimal effort, or at an effort that you enjoy?   I feel like life has many options, it's just that we haven't discovered them as we are. Rather we settled with our parent's or forefathers way of living, instead of finding new ways.   Im not sure thought, the idea of working 9-5 for the rest of my life seems really awful, when i could just live on an island somewhere tropical for the rest of my life.	- ""Female"" - anyone who identifies as a woman/girl/female and her respective anatomy.	0.584
I will upfront say that I am skeptical of this conversation going anywhere. Your responses so far have not indicated that you are genuinely interested in attempting to see my view. I will make an attempt though.  I have already explained why this mandate is an overreach. The rationale that was used is something that is not limited to one industry and can used to force almost anything on any industry. It appears analogous to the commerce clause interpretations in regards to its far reaching nature (at least to me).  I am not saying this is the only overreaching regulation. I’m fact it’s has made me start to question multiple other regulations. This was probably the most in your face one though to where it made me stop and think while the others I never really thought about. I am very big on trying to be consistent in my views.  In no way would this be analogous to firefighters. The only way it would be analogous to fire fighters is if I was saying all government services are bad….which is not what I’m saying.

Literally this.	Football meanwhile offers so many variations it's not funny.

I totally understand your point of view and I stand by it. Accepting people and not body shaming them is different than idealizing an unhealthy way of living. In fact, in my opinion, being obese or overweight causes a lot more trouble (medically speaking) than weighing less. Yes, EDs are serious, don't get me wrong, but obesity is serious.  Exactly like most things in life... extremes aren't good, always aim for the middle. I'm sorry for the models that have to go through all the pain and tears of feeling not beautiful enough! We're all beautiful in our ways! Love yourselves! And try and give your bodies a little love too by maintaining them inside a weight range that is health wise satisfying :)	The internet hasn’t made it worse it just increases the same things that have always been happening.	0.493
Adults are always on their own.	Take Obama. he had a white mom. but that doesn’t make him white. he was the first black president. if you’re somewhere between black and white, and it isn’t visibly white, it makes you black, and this is applicable to any non-white race mixed with white. yeah, those people are mixed, but they’re perceived as black(i’m specifically using black because it’s the most prominent example). we call people “lightskins” not “dark whites” regardless of the fact that their skin tone is neither black nor white. it’s because it’s perceived as a lighter shade of black, not a darker shade of white.	0.689

You keep claiming I've said that this what Biden is doing isn't sexist or racist and/or that sexism/racism is ok, yet I've never said either thing.   I can't tell if you're trolling me, confusing me with someone else who did say these things, misunderstanding what I have said, or something else. Regardless, I'm finished with this conversation.  Have a good one!	The reason I say that is that the scientific methodology has explained countless phenomenon consistently, and all of them have been natural consistently. Based on the track record alone, my money is on it being some natural phenomenon. I feel like if God did make the universe, there would be evidence found that he had done so. Unfortunately, all the ""evidence"" that people use to prove him is riddled with fallacies and bad argument that can easily be disproved.

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.	I don't think that most women actually give a shit about a man's height, but insecurity is ugly on anyone.

There's some evidence that the brains of men and women have slightly different structures, and those structures don't always correspond with their external sex. That may be what makes you identify as a man or a woman. It's also not hard to imagine someone's brain being in a middle point between both structures, thus being non-binary. Anyways, the exact reason isn't that important, if someone say's ""I'm a woman"" we should assume she's saying the truth.	0.68

Idk if this is a CMV post. More like a LPT for people into hunting	<p>With that concept out of the way, let&#39;s consider what is happening when we cancel the debt. Basically, the expenses of the education are short-circuited, meaning that the money for the debt is directly created by government activities, meaning that the end result is exactly the same, with the exception that the student now doesn&#39;t have to pay interest on their student loan, meaning they can be more productive earlier in life. This has enormous benefits for the economy because instead of paying off money that technically never existed, we now have people who can save and invest money back into industry.</p>	0.834
I would say this CMV is way too specific. It looks like you are trying to practice a bunch of rebuttals so you can pivot taking points when arguing with your liberal friends.  But I will give it the ole college try: The AR is a versatile rifle, but your view is that it “can” be an “excellent” hunting rifle.  Your criteria seems to be weight, ballistics, accuracy, and accessories.  But then you suggest that not all configurations would be ideal for hunting. Any rifle can be modded for any situation with the advent of rifle stock systems.   So comparatively, to be considered “excellent”, and not simply sufficient, an AR would have to be better than an “average” hunting rifle.  Any top brand .308 rifle off the shelf can be reasonably expected to hit 1” MOA with no additional accessories. They all weigh between 4-7 lbs loaded. And most hunting rifles will include sling hard points, bottom rails for bipod and ring mount rails for the scope. Very similar to an off the shelf AR aside from the AR having side rails in most applications.  Out of the box an average hunting rifle, with the same scope, will outperform an AR. Every time.  The AR was designed to put a few bullets on a man sized target from 150-500 yards. To which is excels at. The hunting rifle, perfected over a hundred years, is designed to take down game with one bullet out to 1000.  Your CMV could read: A .50 cal can make an excellent hunting rifle. For the same reasons.	If you remove the clitoral hood there would be less folds for bacteria and smegma to hide. It the same logic. Women have more folds and create smegma as well."	0.604

People don't necessarily know what is right about their gender identity until something feels wrong. Of the trans people I know they all say they first knew they were trans because there was something about themselves they didn't feel comfortable with. As a cisgender person, oftentimes you never even think about your gender identity because it already matches your biology and expression. But once it's questioned and makes you uncomfortable that's when it comes into play. The difference with trans people is that the questioning is coming from themselves rather than an outside perspective.	0.724

With all due respect, I think you are deeply ignorant.  Look at your language: you consider yourself a member of the "fact based community"--i.e., your beliefs are **fact**.  It logically follows that anyone who disagrees with you is, *ipso facto*, "factually" wrong.  You and your tribe have exclusive access to the Truth and that Truth is being threatened by ... shall we call them Blasphemers?  Or is that a little too on the nose?  Accusing your ideological opponents of being children is no idle threat.  Children, after all, do not enjoy access to all the civil rights of adults.  It sounds like you are enthusiastically in favor of stripping your fellow citizens of their essential liberties.  I hope you are simply ignorant of what lies around that bend.

>Male circumcision is absolutely nothing like female genital mutilation  Yes it is.	<p>The fact that genitals are surgically molded I to something that does not have the same function of genitals makes it purely cosmetic. Not to be rude, but a gender reasigned vagina is not a real vagina and does not serve the same function. The fatigue and complications of the surgery makes it a greater risk to the physical health of the patient than it would be than just leaving it alone. Similarly to boob jobs and other cosmetic surgeries. I don&#39;t think it should be controversial to admit this. A gender reasigned vagina is a penis that has been reshaped to resemble the form of a real vagina, like how a silicone implant is ment to resemble a real large breast.  It is this resemblance that grants the patient comfort. </p>	0.567

Are you going to pretend like the world economy isn't on the brink of collapse because of the pieces of shit in global power who failed to respond an international pandemic with a sense of duty, and instead chose to find ways to profit off of it at the sake of millions of deaths? Are you really just going to accept tyranny and oppression as okay staples in society, without looking deeper into the issues because you are so afraid of being ostracized for accepting what is on the news is fake? Are you really going to try to claim that people shouldn't be skeptical and speak out about a coalition of conglomerates, that have histories of seeking profits by using unethical sweat shops and slave and child labor for cheaper production costs of their products, trying to control the decision making process of every country in the world?

The problem with these numbers is they actually don't include graduates who are unemployed upon graduation. They only account for the number of people who are employed. I've looked into this before. So the wage gap is actually much smaller. Also, you forgot to account for university costs and housing costs too.   &#x200B;  The other problem is that your college graduate salary includes people who attended postgraduate education but you didn't account for the extra tuition cost and opportunity cost. Also you need to factor in interest at 6% per year. There's a lot of gross assumptions you made here.	Vagina Size Matters	0.649
Dude, I'm talking about a book that was written then the name "The Great Reset"  You are the one trying your hardest to connect it to conspiracy theories.

A person chooses to date someone because they'll get the benefits of dating somebody rich. But they get to choose whom they date, so for instance, they can choose to date someone that's rich and that they find attractive and that they find charming and that actually cares about them as a person and that treats them well, or any mix of those or other qualities they might want. So it's just that ""wealthy"" becomes another requisite for them to date someone, not that they're actually dating someone for money.	0.639

The whole point of the term is for Americans, Jews, and Muslims to distinguish the male circumcision/genital mutilation they do from the female circumcision/genital mutilation that Africans do. You're trying to say that they are similar/equal by using the same term to describe both. Your view isn't about the best term to describe things, but a debate about religion and politics. From the perspective of atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, South Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc., it's all genital mutilation. Also, the next layer to this global culture war is trans surgery, which is often described as genital mutilation by conservative Americans, Jews, and Muslims who practice male circumcision/mutilation.  The interesting thing to the debate is that genital circumcision/mutilation is largely an African concept. The countries in the northern parts practice male genital mutilation (which are often described as Muslim and Jewish countries in the US). And countries in southern parts practice female genital mutilation (and they are often Christian/Muslim countries). The US is the exception. Because of the masturbation beliefs of the founder of Kellogg's, circumcision spread around the US.	Yes, there are risks.  there are always risks in everything at all times.

First of all, the OP doesn't give ANY examples of ANY of the claims he is making. So not sure how anyone would be able to argue this and get a delta. The mods should actually remove his post or ask him to specify what he is talking about instead of making vague and general claims like he is doing.  &#x200B;  OP, just remember, you called him right wing but did not provide proof. If you are doing that simply because the MSM is telling you that he is right wing, then you already lose your own argument here.   &#x200B;  I am not a Joe Rogan fan, I just hate MSM and will always go on duckduckgo or bing and do research on the things MSM claims, which quite often reveals that MSM is lying about things they say. You can also google it, but google will always try and link you to the MSM websites, it is often quite difficult to get info that is not from CNN, Fox News, WaPo etc on google.  &#x200B;  As for his podcast, MSM is trying to cancel him because he had actual medical professionals on his show talking about MRNA vaccines etc.. The medical professionals from MSM was also on his show, that medical professional admitted that they lied about Joe Rogan on CNN. Then a day later, he went on CNN and said that he was afraid that Joe would climb over the table and attack him.... That's the type of misinformation they are spreading about Joe. There is a video from CNN where they literally manipulated a video of Joe Rogan to make him appear more green and sick than he actually was.   [https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30](https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30)  &#x200B;  Joe has never once claimed his podcast should be used for medical advice, but the media is smearing him for it. He made a video of when he had covid and said that he used Ivermectin, the media LIED and smeared him and said that he used horse medicine, despite Ivermectin being FDA approved for use in humans years ago already. This is called pushing a narrative, which is what MSM does, and they literally lied about ivermectin because they want to push that narrative.   &#x200B;  Now, months later, pharmaceutical companies are saying that in the trials, ivermectin seems to be effective against multiple corona strains, but you don't see the MSM reporting on this because that would go against their narrative.   https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japans-kowa-says-ivermectin-effective-against-omicron-phase-iii-trial-2022-01-31/  Even before this, there was a few studies that showed that ivermectin had decent effectiveness in treating covid symptoms, but the media refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to admit that they lied.  &#x200B;  Then there is the one where he had Jordan Peterson on. The MSM has always hated JP and if you watch the podcast, and then watch how the MSM reported on it, you will clearly see that the MSM is lying about it. Even if you don't like Joe, you can see that MSM is lying  &#x200B;  Now OP, my question to you is, are you going to actually provide proper reasons for the things you are saying so that people can dispute it, or will you leave your post as vague as possible in an attempt not to provide any deltas?	<p>The employer has to look at the big picture, which is their capacity to offer services to their clients.

A person of color who is able-bodied, highly educated, does not have medical struggles, lives in an urban setting with easy access to all the modern commodities, and is an executive at a large company is certainly more privileged than a straight white male living in a trailer in some random backwoods part of Appalachia with little to no education, is hooked on drugs, has loads of red flags concerning his health, never left his county since birth, and can&#39;t seem to get any source of income in spite of the former not being white and latter being Caucasian.</p>	0.667

I’m fully vaccinated. I’ll get my flu shot and whatever boosters I need every year.  But you sound like you’re in a cult. Your argument has a cult vibe. If you think of it in that frame, you might be able to change your own mind.	Organs should not always be harvested. At least have a minimum quality control or check as there is such an issue as [donor-derived infections/disease](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/8/12-0277_article). It may be uncommon, but your proposed ""harvest all (?) organs"" would substantially increase the odds.

Duty, Responsibility, Defend, Protect, Serve.  Those are all words that come to mind when I think of what it means to love your country and patriotism.  I also believe a country is more than just a piece of dirt, the country is the people.  To me if you love your country you are suppose to do your part to prevent harm. This means wearing a mask and getting vaccinated!  Here is another thought. Picture an invading military attacking your country. What are the goals of this invading force? Perhaps to harm as many as possible, overwhelm the countries hospitals, and to kill as many as possible. People that help this invading force would be guilty of aiding & abetting, basically reason.  Not getting vaccinated is helping that invading covid force do more harm to the country.  In the US there are now over 900,000 deaths.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed multiple times. Seems to me that the invading force has done quite a bit of harm with the help of those that are anti vax and anti mask!

Student loan debt basically makes a degree holder's income similar to ""working class"" salaries.

Enough to cover that presumed ""8%"" that's imputed as tip income to servers.  OTOH, if their operation is reasonably efficient, the servers don't spend a lot of time on me, either, and less are working, so those that are should be doing alright based on volume, provided the establishment's takeout business has made up for the drop in people that will put up with dining under the tent."	0.614

Haha I like you.	<p>I think the thing that makes it difficult for cis individuals to understand these concepts is because we’ve grown up with this notion of biological sex/gender as being binary, so we want to keep putting things like biological sex, gender identity and gender expression into boxes that we can easily understand— this is called schema, which is a method our brains use to organize and categorize new information. It’s a natural process and it’s <strong>much</strong> easier for us to “assimilate” (aka “fit new information into categories that already exist in our brains”) than it is to “accommodate” (aka “create new categories that better fit the new information”). </p>	0.627
That's non sequitur. I'm not talking about music reviews or opinion. I'm talking about white nationalists espousing debunked "race science" to push white supremacist policies. But yes, any media program should vet its guests to make sure they're not absolute cranks who spread racist bullshit.   And yes, I am saying we shouldn't let white supremacists speak in public to spread their message. You seem to be running head first into the [paradox of tolerance.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) One of the ways around it is to simply not tolerate bigotry. Again, I recommend doing the reading here. Why are you so adamant that they be able to share their hate?   Frankly, your second paragraph didn't even make grammatical sense. But yes, as stated above I do want to censor bigots. I do support "science facts" as you put it. I'd love for you to provide an example of "experiential designs" that were rapidly disproven. Do you mean phlebotomy and the other "race science" fields? Because yeah, we threw those out when they were disproven.   And no, not everything had scientific consensus* (you can't spell) but everything we've discussed today does. The only people disagreeing are bigots. You've thoroughly shown us here where you stand on this.	<p>Whilst we are animals we&#39;re also very unique. You&#39;d be stunned if you saw in the wild any animal of any kind cooking, wearing clothes, or using complex language to communicate ideas. The &quot;we are animals&quot; comparison only goes so far. Another thing different we do is complex morality, and so we can ask, if it is the case that animals can and do suffer and we know that most modern factory farming causes great animal suffering, is it moral to raise animals in such a way and then slaughter them by the billions purely for taste pleasure? Honestly, the numbers are staggering of just how many animals are killed every day. I don&#39;t think you can make an &quot;it&#39;s only natural&quot; argument in this massively artificial farming structure that&#39;s in place.</p>	0.687

My view is if you say yes in any state that is a green light. Condom or no. If you commit a crime while drunk you can’t claim you didn’t know what you were doing in court. “I was drunk so didn’t know the implications of drunk driving”. Why should that be acceptable here. Sober you chose to get drunk in that situation and so knew the risks involved. If you are aware of what is around you and can communicate that that is enough even if you are drunk off your ass. The only case this doesn’t apply is if the person is so far gone they can’t register what is around them. So long as they are awake and able to interact intentionally with their environment that counts as consent in my book.   Take for example if a man and woman are both drunk. Did the man rape the woman? Did the woman rape the man? Did they rape each other? After all if you rape someone while drunk it is still rape. The answer is it is just two drunk horny people. Pass them a rubber and leave the room.	<p>I can agree that not being attracted to an elderly people isn&#39;t necessarily bigoted... but if someone appeared to you to be, say, 35 and turned out to inexplicably be 65, and you ended the relationship, that might be.</p>	0.587

I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.	There are biological differences between men and women, nature plays a role."	0.587
Sorry I wasn’t talking to you, I was talking to the sane and logical/reasonable humans here. Not the recreationally offended braindead minority.	I do wonder, too, how much actual biological differences play vs the different environments each gender is raised in. Women aren’t encouraged from a young age to be physically strong (often quite the opposite), whereas men are. That sort of thing can have a huge impact later on the willingness of the body to build muscle and be flexible, as well as the more mental side of speed and reflexes.	0.712

It seems you really are approaching compelling a certain worldview. You think the range of views under your framework is wide and acceptable, but that is probably only because you don't possess a worldview outside of that	the reason there's an emphasis on believing rape victims is to avoid doing what has happened historically: victim blaming. it used to be a lot more common to ask questions like ""what was she wearing?"" ""was she drunk?"" and so on. questions that place blame on the victim, when the only person at fault is the person assaulting or raping people."	0.712

Attacking a group, any group, because they believe differently than you is wrong. Full stop.

How any of you can sit here and say you absolutely feel justified in attacking someone who has done you no harm is sick and disgusting. You are no better than those you claim are evil; you are literally doing the thing you say they are doing. See h isn't violence. Ideas are not violence. Action is violence, and if you attack someone because of who they are or what they think, it is you, not the one who you deplore, that are to blame.	<p>Purely emotional, eh?

The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5.

Citing a separate argument you made to question your motives is not ad hominem, but i'll drop it regardless.   I apologize for attacking your unrelated argument/character in another thread.

this is baby’s first change my view	it is my impression that in general a woman's physical appearance plays a larger role in her desirability than it does for men. and that a mans social status plays a larger role in his desirability than it does for women. maybe that's sexist but I don't think that's purely a product of patriarchy.	0.725
Most of the time kkk and neonazis just like to talk hot air, they rarely act (physically/violently) on their beliefs. I actually applaud them and appreciate that they tell me they hate me, we draw the line in the sand and call it a day.   Liberals on the other hand will swear up and down that they are my allies but when I turn around they plunge the dagger in my back. The squad and others were hanging out and having a field day (there is plenty of Google photo evidence to this) with Louis Farrakhan (known and video evidence anti Semite) and Linda sarsour who also promulgated hate towards Israel and by extension Jews.

My grandma was terminally ill and was of clear mind until the very last days. She spent her last year bedridden and unable to move but completely clear minded.

I think this case was an ideal situation for euthanasia because there is no treatment no remedies for what she has gone through. It was a slow and painful journey for her and all of my family.

I've had this conversation recently and I fully agree with you. People here are trying to argue that power is a broad term, but I say it isn't, because you are particularly referring to the power they have to permanently ruin lives on a whim. The power to send someone to prison is something society takes too lightly.   Others argue that you can counter them with money (equally powerful lawyers) just proves the point. The majority of people doesn't have the kind of money you would need to very technically argue your case. The fact that you have to navigate the law with money just shows that even if justice is blind, it is effected by the smell of money.   Judges do not serve justice, they serve their own whims when they decide someone needs to serve a harsh sentence if they're having a bad day. I am deeply disturbed by this fact.  The solution I came up with is to have multiple judges independently decide if a sentence is just. People will argue that it will be expensive and cumbersome. I argue that if you were in a position where you wanted a fair outcome, you would want the best possible practice.  I have zero faith in the justice system as it currently stands.	<p>Now remove the shame. You can swipe your credit card at a brothel. How many horny people are gonna run up a huge debt that way?

It’s just another reason for people to remain divided under the guise of freedom and choice.   Because there is no actual choice. Not in any society.

Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.

Do me a favor. Pull up google maps and tell me where Ukraine is located relative to Russia. Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?

I also thought that the Nazis weren't really thinking about racial superiority in terms of skin colour, but that their ideas mainly came from people like HP Blavatsky who wrote about ""blood line"" superiority. For example, the ""Aryan race"" the Nazis knew were initially from India and they used the Hindu sun symbol (reversed) for the Swastika. The Blavatsky writings are all nonsense (in my opinion anyway), but she mainly talks about ""ascended masters"" from Tibet and the East. I always thought the reason the Nazis were against the Jews specifically was because they thought the Jews weren't loyal to any country, made up a significant number of the first Communists and we're thought to control international banking. Not saying the Nazis were correct, but it seemed to stem from those incorrect ideas at least initially rather than just racial superiority. I'm not an expert so I'm sure people know more than me, but just the idea that they hated people because of race alone seems a bit simplistic or lacking in nuance.

I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.

That's not how rational discourse works, that's not how debate works, and that's not how CMV works.   If you make an argument in your OP, it is up for debate. When someone comes along and disagrees with that point in your argument that you can no longer counter, you don't get to say "no no no, I just mentioned that, it isn't actually what I want to talk about."  That is a bad faith argument and you are no longer able to be debated against when you refuse to concede even an INCH of ground from your original topic against someone who makes a rational argument against your initial topic.   You brought up the mandate protests. That makes them a topic that is on the table for conversation. Then, when you ran out of arguments about that point, you just said "no no no, I don't wish to discuss mandate protests any more."   If you want to change the conversation that is allowed to be debated in this topic, then that is a VIEW CHANGE. otherwise, you're just making bad faith arguments that any time you hit a wall against you can then just change the topic of conversation again to steer it away from a point you brought into the debate to begin with.

Nazism <em>is</em> an evil ideology.  Nazism is <em>actually</em> totalitarian.  When you call someone or something Nazi, you&#39;re drawing an explicit comparison to the nationalistic, oppressive, racist German regime that committed multiple genocides across Europe in WWII.  But the Nazis didn&#39;t start out murdering 11 million people including 6 million Jews.  No, for years, they had to be induced to do those things.  There&#39;s a popular image of Hitler as this kind of singular monster, the most evil person who ever lived, who murdered millions upon millions of his own people because he deemed them inferior, but that&#39;s not right.  Hitler didn&#39;t murder millions upon millions of people.  HIS FOLLOWERS DID.  And his followers were not singular monsters, the most evil people who ever lived.

Not here to change your view, i agree, its disgusting.	The final thing I'm going to bring up is the difference in reasonable precautions vs expected outcomes.  Should we view locking doors as a reasonable precaution to take in general, and view the potential consequences of not locking doors as a reasonable outcome of not doing it?  Last week I didn't lock my car doors and someone went in and stole a few things I had in there.  Me not locking my door almost required an intentional effort on my part (first leaving my keys in the house when grabbing groceries, and then being annoyed enough that my remote lock wasn't working that I decided to just leave it unlocked, when I could have easily gone the 100 feet to lock the doors manually) and the result was....the two things of any value that I left in the car were stolen.  I wasn't hurt, my car wasn't hurt, I had to put some paperwork back in the glove compartment and now replace a title and a range finder.  I also live in a big city where *someone* entering your car if it's unlocked is a reasonable outcome to expect.  Contrast this with ""watch your drink"" and ""use a buddy system.""  Should those be reasonable things to do?  Let go of ""in the real world"" arguments and really ask if that *should* be necessary.  Should you expect that someone will intentionally put drugs in your drink?  I think the answer to that is ""fuck no.""  Is a reasonable consequence for not watching your drink perfectly being raped?  Again, fuck no.  Should you expect that someone will intentionally get you someplace to rape you if you don't have a buddy or lose track of them?  Again, fuck no.  We have far worse consequences for something that is far less reasonable to be expected to do, a far higher bar for behavior.	0.654

Good post mate 😁✌🏻 You aren’t Islamaophobic, you are simply stating the reality of life for countless LGBT living in constant fear under the theocracy that helps govern almost all of the countries you listed. You will of course get non stop “whataboutism” from over emotional hacks, but that being said it doesn’t change the facts. Also, the hypocrisy of these defenders is often times astounding as they will decry China’s treatment of the Uyghurs who are placed in “re-education” camps to curb what they view are extremist beliefs which can (and has) lead to terrorism.. all the while supporting or at least defending throwing gays off buildings and/or stoning them. I agree with neither of those for the record since it has to be said in todays cringe world. There are Muslims like Maajid Nawaz who I respect a great deal as he and many others are attempting to reform Islam and its more extreme beliefs and practices. Also, for the idiots who say “[insert other religion here] used to do XYZ” - yes and they have already undergone their reforms in the past to the point they’ve reached today. Ffs even the Catholic Church, which has had some of the strongest anti-LGBT beliefs, their leader Pope Francis has holds more conciliatory views on LGBT as opposed to the past.  Oh and prior to him they weren’t throwing gays off buildings so there’s that as well.	I don't know MN laws either but that's the case in Wisconsin as far as I'm aware."	0.59

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimto  r/confidentlyincorrect	Anyway if you discount religious ethics for some reason, there's still the impact on yourself to consider.  Eating animals doesn't seem to do anything to people - vegetarians are about as good/bad as other people in their daily lives.  But people who commit bestiality appear at least anecdotally to have higher rates of committing violence against women and rape.  And that observation is quite plausible as getting used to having sex without consent would be very easy to generalize from one partner to the next.  We don't have perfect statistics yet, but given the alarming trend, clearly it is immoral to commit bestiality until such time as we get good enough statistics to confirm or rule out that link."	0.734

It's true. I can't even keep track of the number of times I've said "permanent and life changing" instead of "invasive and medically unnecessary". Naturally, the only choice is to just gaslight people by pretending you said the right thing the whole time.	Yes. And? Permits are important.	0.583
You are focusing on something I have already clarified, many times, and are both acting Hostile and accusing me of acting in bad faith. Clarification is not gaslighting, and by conflating the two you are degrading actual examples of actual gaslighting, and convincing others that it's a term that can be used to just shut down discussion. You really should consider learning what gaslighting actually is.	The fact their are 'cis and trans' people is a debate in itself. Some don't believe that's actually a valid perspective or classification of individuals"	0.704
True, I agree with your opinion, particularly as fundamentalist Islam carries so much weight in the countries you’ve highlighted, in addition to quite a few others, such as Brunei. I remember when the sultan of Brunei proposed a law to stone homosexuals to death when it introduced a new set of regulations that were based on sharia law. However, he backtracked after global boycotts of Bruneian businesses and protests outside of embassies, showing that perhaps political pressure can work in certain circumstances. However, homosexuals are still incredibly oppressed in Brunei, and I have to agree that fundamentalist Islam is the greatest oppressor of the LGBT community.	>Because gender identity is so rooted in how a person self-identifies, there is no way for us to know that unless they tell us	0.563

Lol holy fucking shit. Are you literally comparing trans peoples panic attacks to the suffering of LGBT in Muslim nations? You seriously think this is comparable in any capacity? That’s incredibly stupid.   It’s a good thing that almost all nations don’t use the teachings of the Catholic Church to make their laws then isn’t it?	I'm only arguing that no specific physical characteristic can be considered absolutely necessary for being considered of a specific gender/sex. As far as I know, they all have exceptions. Even chromosomes, being born with a vagina etc.	0.733
Clarification =/= lying my guy. I may have phrased it poorly but that doesn't mean I'm acting in bad faith or gaslighting. First off, It's literally impossible for me to gaslight in this situation because there is a history of what I've said. Secondly, saying someone is lying when they misspeak is disingenuous and toxic, and am *actual example of gaslighting.* How could you possibly know my intent better than me?	Yeah I'm not saying we put weed dispensers in every office building, I'm just saying that adding a depressant (and not even really adding since it's already pretty widely used) to the mix isn't going to stop people from also using coffee or from being productive generally.  If anything, it could help improve productivity in people whose anxiety and stress makes it difficult to be as productive as they can."	0.512
I wouldn’t bother trying to reason with this troll, you’ll be called a homophobe and a fascist for not taking trans people having a fit as seriously as being stoned to death.	it seems to me that you are conflating sex and gender and treating them as the same category, and this is where 99% of conversations about this topic end up falling apart. sex is biology. gender is a social category. gender is changeable and has been changeable throughout the entirety of human history"	0.719
What a ridiculous thing to say. You’re claiming that some transsexual having a fit is comparable to a public execution? That’s simply a despicable thing to say, and I don’t care what childish names you call me. This is why wokeism needs to be stamped out, I can’t take you people seriously anymore.	Since in primates sex is determined by hormones and chromosome paring there is a correlation between expression of sex and gender.	0.7
Well what a dumb fucking point to make then. Of course more people are affected, Christian nations have a higher population than Muslims and a higher gay population because they aren’t executing them.   What an irrelevant and dumb fucking idea to even attempt to bring up as valuable.	my point is that it's impossible to reach an objective, categorical definition of ""woman"" without becoming equally as subjective and arbitrary as: ""i'm a woman because i feel like one""	0.67
>I wouldn’t bother trying to reason with this troll, you’ll be called a homophobe and a fascist for not taking trans people having a fit as seriously as being stoned to death.

You vomit when people talk about trans things.  You literally spent hours complaining that i stalk you and yet you show up here calling me a troll.	By the way, I wanted to ask you if you’ve heard anything about a smallpox outbreak anywhere? I’m asking because I saw that the US ordered 113 million dollars worth of a drug called TPOXX, which I’m sure you are aware is a treatment for small pox. Curious to me that they would buy drugs to treat a disease that was officially eradicated in 1980. I mean there are only two known spores in existence safely locked up in a lab in Russia and the other in Georgia at the CDC.

your experience isn't universal. tragic, I know.	And yet, they exist.	0.557
Yes, that was about transracialism. Praise be we have stalkers like you to remind us of this important point.	<p>Secondly: We never had a thing that &quot;really&quot; did that. Men and women or gender in general is something we created and inflated to an absurd degree. There is no inherent reason to have the kind of seperation of the genders as we do in our society. You can argue for having distinctions between groups of people that can reproduce with each other, as reproduction is important to many and those things are therefore useful, but our current idea of gender goes far beyond that. The biological argument goes only as far as the compatibility of reproductive organs go, there is nothing in there that prescribes names, clothing, societal roles etc. Those are all things that we have put atop these concepts and none of them are really grounded on anything other than societal construction.  </p>	0.643
It will shut people up around you, you might think I'm being glib with that answer, but it's a real consideration. You are probably right, you probably aren't in any appreciable danger, but it shuts people up and it won't hurt you.	Gender is just...complicated. There's our own internal sense of our gender--I'm cisgender, and I have an inner feeling of ""yes, I'm female, I'm a woman."" There's also how others see us--when people refer to me as ""she"" or ""her,"" that doesn't feel wrong or uncomfortable. Some of the societal expectations of women bother me a LOT, and I've resisted against them.	0.78
>Yes, that was about transracialism. Praise be we have stalkers like you to remind us of this important point.  Nope it wasn't why do you keep lying?	<p>Okay, I guess this is the core of your argument. The long and short of it is that transgender identity is based on self-identification and you are being transphobic if you disagree with someone&#39;s self-identification. You <em>can</em> argue it, of course, and you can argue that trans people should &quot;try to pass as their chosen gender&quot; or &quot;conform to the gender role of their chosen gender&quot; etc, but those are separate discussions from outright arguing against their core self-identification.

So we should address people with the pronouns they identify with apart from you? Got it. Not like you’re trying to push some agenda at all.	Drag queens are typically biological men who impersonate women as a form of gender expression, but they still identify as being a man in their daily life. This is the norm, but it’s not true for all drag queens. Some drag queens are trans women who identify as a woman, some are trans men who identify as a man but still express themselves via drag, some identify as non-binary/fluid and express themselves as a woman in drag, but fluctuate outside of drag.	0.713

I don’t care, that’s not your decision to make. Stop infringing on people’s rights and you might just make some friends in France. You’re just as bigoted as all those fundamentalist Christians you rage about.	<p>Your self-description of your attitude about how others speak of mental illness really struck me in how <strong>unsympathetic</strong> it was to the suffering of others.  What you described is in effect your <strong>arguing yourself out of being sympathetic</strong>; you are manufacturing and rehearsing to yourself in your head reasons why other people aren&#39;t deserving of your empathy and compassion because of how they express themselves around their mental health.  And if you do that, this is where it winds up: having less and less patience with one&#39;s friends and loved ones, being more and more irritated with their struggles, being more and more exasperated and fed up with them.  Go down this path and you&#39;ll start to <em>automatically</em> deride and dismiss their problems as invalid, unreal, trivial, and just all-round unworthy of respect.</p>	0.549
Actually, I have no desire to change your opinion. You're so far off the reservation that any sort of changing of minds wouldn't be worth the effort. You started by saying that maybe just a little bit "jaded", welp that's the understatement of the century. You're full on a fkn nut job and frankly no one should take you seriously. Your unearned sense of moral superiority not withstanding, perhaps you should get a little therapy.	<p>But! Sex based characteristics have a bimodal distribution with significant overlap. Which means men and women (if we’re simplifying humans down to two genders) have traits that are on average different, but aren’t radically different between individuals. For example, the average man is taller than the average woman, but knowing someone’s height can’t tell you their gender. Even knowing someone was tall, broad shouldered, and attracted to women, you can’t know that person’s gender. They’re more likely to be a man, but plenty of women fit that description. </p>	0.71

Whether or not it's your job description, it's still your moral duty to try to be a part of the solution, especially as a male in a position of power in the workplace.

I never forget how old I am myself but every once in a while I remember that I'm consuming content on Reddit from teenagers half my age.	first of all, i mean this just undermined what you wrote above it completely, so i mean whatever fine, that's fine, yes i agree it does require some amount of recognition of others.  my original point in that giant post was that because society is in bitter disagreement about how one attains a gender identity, whether by being born a certain gender or by individual choice, that there isn't really a single way gender is defined.  so to say ""trans women are women"" wouldn't strictly be true, because it is a contested statement; half of society says they are, half of society says they are not.  gender being a social construct works both ways.	0.821
honestly, this is borderline racist	<li><p>I don&#39;t see &quot;animal&quot; as a grouping that has any sort of significance from a moral standpoint.

Agreed. Hump it and dump it. Fatherlesness increases your chane of becoming a felon by 46% and lowers your chance of graduating by 39%	I understand at this point in my life - is that gender identity is divorced from biology.
