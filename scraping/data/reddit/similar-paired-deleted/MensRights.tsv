Seriously? Do the moderators even look at the subs when they mindlessly ban people from other subs just for existing on them? It’s so easy to tell that none of the popular posts (or ones that stay up for longer than a few seconds) aren’t incel beliefs. It’s literally just acknowledging that men have problems. What a fucking joke.	The way to break coercion is to have options that nullify the threat. In the example given above, learning to cook your own favourite food or finding another source removes any power from the threat.	0.769

It's almost like they have zero ability to reason and have childlike mentalities......	No, I think the reason why a lot of women (but also plenty of men who are completely oblivious) can't even emphasize - not *support* but just *emphasize* - with men issues is because they're taught from such a young age that women are victims and individuals to be protected and men are perpetrators. As a society, we tell boys they should *never* hit girls, not even in retaliation, but we never tell girls not to hit boys, we talk about rape and DV in schools in a gendered way, we *teach* girls to fear for their lives when they're walking alone even though boys are much more likely to be agressed, etc.	0.906
It's almost like they have zero ability to reason and have childlike mentalities......	But no one defends Men when they're hated, ***especially*** Women. So all this hyper-sensitivity surrounding the hatred of women just confirms to me that Women are a special class of Humans above Men. No one objects when men are called predatory,oppressive and worthless in Media&Academia. [Innocent Boys are made to ""apologize"" to Girls in schools for what Jack The Ripper did](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-25/apology-for-handling-of-sexual-assault-topic-at-assembly/13275492), this is our Status as Men in this Society.	0.892
It's almost like they have zero ability to reason and have childlike mentalities......	<p>Calling out sexual harassment, not speaking over women in the workplace because they are more timid, not letting boys fight and teaching them aggression solves problems, talking about their victimization like Terry Cruz, teaching their daughter that they deserve greatness, and protecting those that need protection.</p>	0.881
It's almost like they have zero ability to reason and have childlike mentalities......	<p>You can indeed fault them, for things like writing the VAWA and Duluth model, which combined literally require police to arrest male DV victims of females.

Well two weeks later she tells me that she “thinks” that she’s pregnant. Then I ask her , did you take the birth control. She answers “No”. Never been so pissed it off in my life.

I am sorry that is literal the dumbest thing I have ever heard, but that’s your perspective.  Here is my perspective.  My dad, me, my eldest son and my grandson.  All cut. All no issue.  My second son. Uncut until he needed emergency surgery to free up everything down there.  It’s a tiny issue.  Ill continue recommending it to any new father, just because of the risk that it poses and the issues i know it has caused.  I am sorry your penis broke or is shorter.  Sue the doctor.  My dick is fine.  And I see no harm or foul in performing hygienic surgery.	In fact, I was called a danger to my child, because everyone who self harms is apparently capable of infanticide.... I endured 10 torturous weeks of separation from my daughter, fearing our bond would be lost and she wouldn't remember me, before I was able to reestablish contact through family court proceedings. I had to deny a plethora of outrageous accusations that painted me as a horrible, perverted, intimidating monster while poor mother sobbed in front of the Sheriff that she had to protect her child.	0.93

My husbands ex was so jealous he was married and moved on with his life, she told us she was going to make his life miserable and oh she did. The first year and a half of our marriage we had to face this seiko in court. Even though everything she said was a lie, and she even admitted to me it was all a lie but that she wanted my husband to suffer, watching how the court treated men vs women was like this huge wake up call for me. I actually couldn’t believe it. For one of the things she accused him of they had to collect his DNA. We were so excited actually because once she submitted hers it would prove that she was lieing. She never did, wasn’t forced to, but in the meantime my husbands personal DNA is stored for 7 years even though we called her bluff and she literally dropped all her threats against him, and she was never forced to give her DNA to prove she’s a liar. But his biological data now belongs to a court for 7 years, is not immediately destroyed, and she can choose to reopen the case whenever she wants. So so many other nuances with the court stuff I learned about that were literally so backwards and sexist. It truly converted me because I couldn’t believe that the legal system allows women to wrangle men I’m spite the way that it does.</p>	0.922

Ex got mad b/c she couldn’t sling her bullshit and yelled at my attorney lol.  I instantly looked at her attorney, and could literally see the panic wash over her face as it hit her, “oh shit, my client is crazy.”  A couple of weeks after that, she assaulted our oldest child during her week of custody (I had already moved out).  He’s &gt; 6’ tall and defended himself as he should, and she got pretty banged up.  Police came out, and I now have 100% custody of him!  I wouldn’t doubt if I have 100% custody of our other child within the next 12 months, and that would be great by me.  Lol…the thought of her paying me child support is mouth watering after all of this.</p>	0.91

Think of more creative ways to ask questions- when you interview yourself, you come off incoherent and insincere. Why? Because you’re an unreliable source who has no motive to fact check yourself. </p>	0.895
I feel like you dont know what a simp is and that you have a hostility towards the word "feel" because you are a loser who would take issue with someone saying "I feel".	<p>You can say I’m overthinking (I’m really not, I’m being very clear here), you can call me an SJW (yeah, go the SJW route and name-call people who disagree with you), and you can saying “it’s the world sucks anyway” — this does not justify anything you said nor does this counter what I said.</p>	0.894

You are choosing to disagree with every piece of evidence and make your own opinion, and again that’s fine, but i don’t know why your getting mad at em here. I don’t agree with everything isn’t eh case either.</p>	0.894
Well, it's stats about nonreciprocally violent relationships, not of all violent relationships. You cherry picked a stat.  I just read that in your article :  "1.5 million women and 835 000 men are physically assaulted or raped by intimate partners in the United States annually."	<p>Edit #2: Many people who identify as incels also identify as MRAs. They don’t want anything to do with a woman in charge, talking to one, seeing one, and they want everything sexist to happen to them. Many people have put on the news that along with these incels who have killed women, they were also identified as an MRA, which already leaves a bad impression on the people who were thinking about advocating, unfortunately. Just how I hate feminists that say kill all men, I hate Incels. Some women feel more comfortable talking to feminists about women’s issues, even during the KAM thing ( not me, lmao ), because they still felt like the women was on their side. So, when they begin to see the unfairness for men’s rights and want to advocate for them as well and many men are shoving the woman away, it does make them feel unwanted in the movement.</p>	0.916

It&#39;s a minority group doing the abuse, but either feminists need to rebrand those and cast them out for what they are, or change their own identity.</p>	0.914

I even had one female colleague who believed if a girl is misbehaving (e.g., truanting from school or smoking cigarettes) then it is because the father figure in her life is sexually abusing her. Furthermore, this is what she would write up in the analysis of her Section 17 Assessments for such cases; thereby accusing the girls father/step-father of being a child molester without any evidence whatsoever. </p>	0.914

Kill yourself.	Second therapist I saw was at 18 in the military because the military rejected me having a Hernia surgery, that therapist was a dick who barely listened to what I said, I would tell him I feel shitty because I can't train, I can't work and it ruined my basic will to live, and he'll respond ""maybe you should work out sometimes, go on long runs""	0.92

Kill yourself.	They just had me locked up in a mental institution and when I came back after spring break some kid in my class even said he hated me in the middle of class because at that point my atheism was completely in question and with me vigorously trying to defend myself from these attacks coming at me from all angles and the school didn&#39;t even care. I tried to report it. I went to the school therapist and outside therapists before I even became suicidal idal and novody cared. They all just tried to convert me to christianity and hated me for rejecting it.</p>	0.895
