But I can't help myself. And I can't open up to anyone cause there's nothing anyone else can do to help. The only thing that'll come of me getting my issues off my chest will be sharing pain and sadness to the person who listens. And if I talk to some therapist or psychiatrist about this shit then they'll probably either label me with a thousand conditions and issues, or tell me I'm overreacting and I need to suck it up. And both would make my matters so much worse. So I just gotta try my hardest to keep it to myself. Someday it'll be better tho."	0.827

[Maybe the answer can be found at postmandeliveries.]	9. Be aware of the very bad feeling that tells you things like ""my life will not be the same anymore"" or ""it doesn't worth it"", especially in the first few weeks. These are lies your brain will produce to convince you into smoking again. Also be prepared for very low ability to concentrate (focus) on anything first few weeks and you'll be easy to piss off. It will get better with time. Also when you quit smoking, you'll start coughing, like you were ill. It lasts few weeks and it's because your lungs are getting cleaned. First week you may feel dizzy. Thats normal.	0.819
[Maybe the answer can be found at postmandeliveries.]	<p>For example, my previous job I could tell weeks in advance when our inventory would be short and what inventory that would be specifically. I would try and try and try to fill the inventory but due to limitations it was often not possible. I‚Äôd spend weeks dreading the day. Then the day would come and the customer would be more than happy with an alternative option or what they needed would become available. I wouldn‚Äôt have the negative experience of the problem but I‚Äôd have carried the stress of that experience for weeks. It‚Äôs a destructive cycle. It would make me feel helpless because I am very proactive but feeling like my proactive habits were ultimately in vein would drain me.</p>	0.817

Got a bunch of emails from college coaches!	<p>Anyway he drops the acid in a club and it hits him really hard. He goes the toilet to pull himself together. When we asked him about this experience once he sobered up, he said he sat down on the toilet and heard a noise. He looked down and saw his intestines and stomach falling out. These toilets were not the best and poorly lit with a lot of neon like colours and deep red walls. He said in the moment he was just losing his mind and the sight of his intestines coming out and dropping into the toilet so he starts grabbing them and trying to push them back in. When he was telling the story it took me a minute to realise that obviously his intestines did not all of a sudden fall out and that he was basically just grabbing shit and trying to put it back because he was out of his mind.</p>	0.787

But having known them, we talked to the neighbours who confirmed the property had been abandoned since 2008, when he died. She had died earlier and he reported her haunting him to his neighbours. After he died, he seemed to appear at random around the property, gardening (we find our garden gets watered sometimes without anyone touching it) or smoking. She still paces, and sometimes will grab me if I am in a sad mood. She was a mental health nurse. Her clipboard is still nailed to our wall and we still use it to hold things.

k	For me it helped to figure out what exactly about syringes triggers me. I work in a veterinary clinic and deal with syringes on the daily so I know that it's not the object itself, it just happens when I know the needle is pointed at me. I recently got my first vaccine and it helped to do that on my own. My partner just came with me to make sure that I don't run away in case of a panic attack but organising the trip there, the queues, the questions from the staff all by myself helped me to see it more as a big task instead of focusing on the needle. When it came to getting poked I still was shaking, crying and hyperventilating a bit but not nearly as bad as it used to be, thus I didn't tense up as bad and it didn't hurt as bad as my brain was telling me it would. Still nowhere near of overcoming the entire fear but taking big steps forward."	0.791

This is true, but many trans women are shorter than many cis women. If height is the real issue, then why are we talking about gender at all? Not to mention that hormone levels in trans women are tightly controlled, which is not the case for cis women. This means that many cis athletes actually have *higher* testosterone levels than their trans counterparts. As it stands, the current regulations are working, and rather than seeing trans women dominate (as some would have you believe), we actually see trans women winning less often than their cis counterparts, even when adjusted for population size.  In the end, this is an issue that has been basically solved already, and is mostly just being used as a culture war issue to win seats for politicians.  One more side note: "a transgender" is not really the preferred wording. It comes across a little dehumanizing, like saying "a black" to refer to a black person. Transgender is an adjective, so it doesn't really work as a noun like that. I am not "a transgender", I am a transgender woman (or a trans woman, or even just a woman).	Except Chili Mac.

Your mum	Jeff Bezos made jobs, yes. They are mostly bad job, those ""claims"" have been substantiated over and over. He could make things better for his employees, pay them more, better benefits, better conditions, more employees to share the load, but it would cost him more money, so he doesn't. It is more affordable for him to run anti-union campaigns and just churn through employees, use them until they break then hire new ones, than make things better for those he already has. They didn't ask for that job, they *needed* a job and he controlled the only one available to them. You can afford to make those other arrangements, someone making $10 at 38 hours so they don't get insurance can't. Their livelihoods are held hostage by the man who controls their jobs, because he pays them the bare minimum to keep them in their place: more than other place, less than they need to get out. That is exploitation.	0.85

blatant disrespect	I was 13 and I attempted suicide by pills. That experience has completely changed my outlook. Only a couple hours after I had taken the pills I was dazed and people have told me my eyes were glazed over and it seemed I wasn't all there which I wasn't. I don't remember anything from the first 3 days, I started becoming more conscious after 3 days in the Icu and they decided to let me go. I went to a mental hospital, my first signs that I wasn't okay was when we were in the lobby waiting for a nurse and I started hearing a family talk about killing a girls brother. I was appalled and I instantly told my aunt. She of course didn't believe me, it continued until the other family left. I then couldn't walk, I had to use a wheelchair for about 2 weeks and regain my strength while the effects of my overdose wore off. I saw writing on the walls, I heard voices in my head, I had voices that would follow me all day and night and I couldn't shut them out. Then I overdosed again in the mental hospital, the doctor prescribed me pills way too early and it worsened my hallucinations. I had to go back to the Icu for a week and I was put on 1/1 (24/7 surveillance with a nurse) I didn't eat or drink, I refused pills. I was extremely paranoid and my eyes would deceive me into thinking that everybody was out to kill me. So here comes the part where I ""die"" everyday multiple times I would here banging on the door and men outside saying taht they were going to kill me. They would break down the door and then proceed to torture me, I felt everything and Then I would get shot in the head. That happened so many times a day and it never got any less scary. Even though it was just hallucinations, at the time I thought everything was completely real. All the nurses would see though would be me screaming and crying, I would hallucinate that they were trying to hurt me so they would physically restrain me and I often imagined them poisoning me. Also everytime I was ""shot"" I would fall straight on my face like I was actually shot, I remember not being able to move, it felt like I was actually dead. I saw so many colors at once, memories flashing by. I felt and heard everything at once, I would chase the colors and I felt like I was flying in clouds. And then everything would slowly turn black and red, I would hear evil laughter and I would come to a red door, Once it opened, I felt the worst pain in my entire life. I was literally in hell with demons laughing and watching me. They would tease me and hurt me. I had serotonin syndrome if y'all wanted to know. So many other things happened I could make an entire series on it, I was literally living inside my head with no idea that none of it was real. I was told multiple times my aunt had said but I don't remember any of it."	0.846

Well, I would certainly agree with you that the real problem is ***NOT*** trans women (or trans *people* for that matter). Side note: that's a great point for me to emphasize in future discussions, so thank you for that!   But rather, I think the root problem‚Äîin this discussion anyways‚Äîis, "laws that erode the category of 'female'". In my view that's the problem that needs to be solved.  And I think it will never get solved if liberal / progressive-minded groups continue their approach of censoring, bullying, and / or threatening anyone who disagrees with them. We as a society need to be able to communicate openly with one another and try to resolve our differences. There is no "us" or "them", except in our minds. We're all human, and we're all in this together. Every single person is right about some things, and wrong about other things.

Potential pitfall: she will see you interested in another and start giving you some attention. Just enough to keep you on the hook (""wait.  Is she into me?!?! Why else would she [insert flirt tactic]"") but remind yourself that she doesn't want you, but she doesn't want you to NOT want her. It's an ego thing.	0.855

What I've been reading/hearing about recently is that the whole "conversation therapy" name is really abused here. Of course it sounds horrible because we associate it with therapy that tried to force gay people into not being gay etc. But apparently the issue here is that this ban extends to the idea that a therapist would question or simply not automatically accept or agree with a kid who claims they're trans. So for example if a little girl comes out as trans after 4 other girlfriends in school did the same (apparently this is a thing) and her reasoning is that she has "masculine" interests or some nonsense, a therapist can't talk to her through that and about that, ask questions, etc before assigning her to hormone blockers or treatments, let alone reach the conclusion that the issue is something else and work with her on it. Therapists are apparently supposed to non questioningly validate the opinion of their patient	As I'm from the UK we have free healthcare for all and private (paid) healthcare if you're rich and don't want to wait in line. I don't understand the American system for such a developed country except that it can only be driven by corporate greed.  It seems almost barbaric from my point of view.  We pay for it in taxes of course but that cost is spread.	0.806

Capitalism is also a failure by pretty much any measure you could think of, other than the number of billionaires. Hundreds of millions of people are starving and living in poverty as a fundamental requirement of capitalism, although they might not live in the same part of the world as you.</p>	0.817

Main Stream Media pushing the narrative of their owners.	I'm a believer in Jesus but I adore the Jewish doctrine. Shame so many Christians don't read the old testament.

And apparently I don't ""look obviously LGBT"" (or so I've been told quite a bit, oddly enough especially while at work.. at my job *in a gay bar*). People tend to assume I'm straight..

Doing alright	* You are right too it has not always been that way but I feel very destabilized when I read all over that there is no acceptance. There is not ONLY bad people in the world some of us are pretty much ok and if I get the fact that we need to re-educate many I would appreciate other type of dialogs than fights. I agree with the statement not with the way I witness the fight being done. Although I agree that I might be ignorant.	0.85
Doing alright	The World would likely be in utter chaos or peaceful af. I'm not very decisive and I usually put others feelings before my own and I've been told I'm one of the kindest, nicest people they know. But I know nothing of politics, kind of a pushover and just don't care about some situations despite how nice I am usually.	0.849
Doing alright	This is called the 'just world' fallacy, where you think good things only happen to good people, and bad things only happen to bad people. This completely ignores stuff like bullying. This logic also means that if someone is unhappy, it's okay to mock them for it, because they must deserve it. Reality, however, disagrees. Here are some examples:	0.847

My parents kind of brushed it off when I told them. They brushed off a lot about my life, tbh, and basically emotionally ignored me or belittled me anytime I cried or showed an sort of emotion other than happiness.	0.878

Bye snowflake.	<p>A good friend of mine was attacked by her machete-wielding husband. He cut her arm down to the bone, and was coming back for another strike at her head when she pulled her pistol and shot him once in the chest, killing him. He was literally winding for for the killing blow against her, while she was holding their daughter. And you&#39;re telling me it would have been morally superior if she had just let him kill her and perhaps the 4 year old daughter too? He never knew she had a gun. He had been acting more and more unstable for months, so she bought a pistol and got her license to carry it. He attacked her because she served him divorce papers. He just reached into the corner, grabbed the machete and swung in about a second. He was going to kill her for trying to divorce him and get away from him. But you&#39;re telling me she&#39;s in the wrong because she used a gun?</p>	0.855

Bye snowflake.	<p>I was at a restaurant when a college kid came in hysterically crying asking for help ‚Äúsaying he killed someone‚Äù.

Im very left wing, but i think some of the pronoun stuff is a bit ridiculous. Fair enough calling someone whos transgendered by their preferred gender pronouns, but it doesnt need to be such a prominent subject that you have to ask everyone their pronouns when you first meet them, or that its on every form you have to fill in, and if you arent transgender, and even if youre gender neutral, you should understand that when other people have to refer to you when talking to others, they are just going to use whatever seems obvious. The amount of over labelling is just stupid. Pronouns are just words that have no power over you other than what you give to them	That's better."	0.832

The point is that gender and sex meaning different things is not an objective fact. It is a definition created by a small group of sexologists that has gained *some* support and common use, but I would be willing to bet that the majority of English speakers (going beyond the Reddit/Twitter bubble) think of gender and sex as being the same thing. So linguistically, your definition certainly can count as an alternative definition, but the word has certainly not undergone a full shift in definition.  And there was no "discovery" that gender and sex are different things. A few sexologists just up and decided that from now on gender meant gender identity, and sex meant biological sex.

Im transgender	PS: There's no such thing as ""a perfect girl"" as you said you were looking for. There's no such thing as a ""perfect"" anyone. Are you perfect? Fuck no. So don't expect some chick you meet in the produce aisle or on Tinder to be perfect either. Just go thru a few (or a bunch) of relationships first and see what matches with your personality and how yours matches with theirs. Perfection literally doesn't exist so don't set the bar at some impossible/imaginary/unobtainable level. That's just setting yourself up for disappointment. There's ""pretty damn good"" and it just goes down from there. But there's no ""perfect"". Because humanity isn't perfect by nature.

Im transgender	Oh, I wondered when we'd get to the 'it has health benefits' stage. I'm afraid it doesn't, outside of where medically necessary of course.

Now the possibility does exist that with the live-action *being* successful, that, that will cause Nick(or Viacom really) to take another look at the series and possibly greenlight a third series, but for Paramount Plus(their streaming service).	0.743

What is the difference? They're all connected! I'll call a plumber right now!	China invades Taiwan, America defends Taiwan. China is taking heavy losses, so they invade a nearby japanese island so they have a foward base closer to Taiwan. Which brings Japan into the war (which doesn&#39;t bother China that much since Japan was already sending data and supplies to US troops. Also Japan has a defense agreement with the US anyway).	0.743

What is the difference? They're all connected! I'll call a plumber right now!	<p>Plenty of people gained from this.The question is how they pulled it off? A very small team (likely killed after the fact) of CIA agents and spies convince the leaders of al qaeda to attack the US. They told the military to stand down and not engage a rouge commercial liner headed to one of the biggest cities in the country. Hire some new maintenance crew that are actually CIA agents to paint some thermite paint on the structural supports over the course of a few months, surround with normal paint.  Add a fake smoke detector on the thermite painted bits with a remote det charge in it. Sit back and wait for the show! The explosives were delayed to sell the steel beams melting. Once you get it going straight down its going to keep going straight so only a few floors would have to be done.</p>	0.722

Coraline	Fast forward 2020 (shit year), soc med announced that ""new"" Nips Fruit & Nuts and I remember seeing it at the store and saying ""that ain't new, I used to buy this a lot before."".

Coraline	Now that the vaccine is out, that number has reduced by another 95%, and growing. The number of people that can't get the vaccine is ridiculously small and the number of people capable of going out into public can't have vaccine the is zero.

Coraline	And that *stupid* age discrimination law was a good idea in principle.  Back then, people weren't really expected to live much past 70 anyway (that was life expectancy), so that meant people could retire and enjoy the last 5-10 years through SS and their own income.  Nobody wanted to work past that age anyway.  But now, life expectancy is just under 80 years old, with a lot of people living much longer.  That discrimination law needs to change, but considering the age of congress (very old) and the grip the AARP has on Congress' balls, along with Social Security being political suicide...I don't know how you can repeal that law."	0.813

My pc	I might get some backlash for saying that the incident had traumatized me a little at the time (high school, immature me), and drove me further into social isolation and being fearful of admitting my feelings for anyone, but it's the truth. When I found out that she hadn't even been the impetus for that rejection, it was a complete revelation. I mean, I was already married at that point, having eventually overcome the self-esteem issued that held me back in the past with women, but it did assuage some of the guilt I'd been carrying for over a decade because I seriously thought I had traumatized this poor woman when, in fact, it was just her nosy friend getting into something that was none of her business."	0.857
