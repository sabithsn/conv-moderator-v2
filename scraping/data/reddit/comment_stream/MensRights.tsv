1ib5l9eh	>Yes, I'm aware. The distinction I'm trying to get at here is that mostof them genuinely believe that what they're doing is good, right andmorally upstanding. Malice, I think, implies a revenge motive, and whilethere's some of that going on, I don't think most of society believesor supports it.  The problem here i believe is that you are trying to separate the feminist who make doctrine and the feminist who simply support them. While the latter might not be acting in malice, the former most certainly is acting in malice.  Then the question becomes if we can excuse these feminist who just give their support for not doing due diligence in researching what they support. I believe we should hold people accountable for this, if someone is spouting falsehoods then i don't see any reason why not to hold them accountable for doing so.  >As I've said before I think one of the problems we have is that there isa group of people out there who will, for example, make excuses forpeople being injured, sexually assaulted and killed, and still considerthemselves to be the nice party.  That is one of the problems, but a much bigger one is that feminism has been preaching these idea's for decades. There simply is no way to address any of this without holding feminism accountable for these transgressions. But that is impossible as long as feminism is wildly supported by people as it is something that gets drilled into kids from a young age in school.  >You could argue that there's no practical difference in outcome betweenmalice and the sort of hideously misguided attempts at charitability wesee from hardliners, and I might agree, but the psychology is completelydifferent. Screaming at hardline feminists that they're beingdeliberately evil will not work very well because it's not true. Thatmight seem like a fine hair to split, and it is, but it's important.  Every hard line feminist is being deliberately evil, the problem is that they personally do not perceive it as being evil. Evil is never done for the sake of being evil, it is done because the perpetrator of this evil doesn't perceive their acts as 'evil'. But this doesn't excuse their evil behavior nor does it make their deeds any less evil.	1640864128.0	hqjag6q	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqj91fz	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqjag6q/
a0xsse2g	Something called the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) needs to be discussed here. Read the link; it explains things better than I could.  In essence, modern feminism has moved the Overton window to the point where huge latitude is given to people making overtly prejudiced statements or proposing prejudiced policies if that person claims to be doing so on behalf of a cause traditionally considered progressive. Meanwhile, people objecting to that overt prejudice are treated as if they had done something morally reprehensible.  (I'd hazard the opinion that *most* of the claims of feminists, if we accept that Reddit feminism probably has a lot of outliers in it, are still fairly uncontroversial.)  I don't think feminism in general has managed to do this through a deliberate effort of will; I think it's happened fairly organically on the basis that for a long time most of the claims of feminists were fairly reasonable and most people wanted to support the progressive agenda, which was completely reasonable for much of the mid-to-late twentieth century. As such, moving the window one way has been easy.  Moving it back is likely to be much more difficult. I find myself deeply uncomfortable with the idea of pushing *away* from what people claim are progressive, anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-bigot policies. My own politics is generally slightly left of centre, much as I dislike the oversimplification of the left-right axis of political thought. As such I'm willing to engage this argument only with the greatest care and in a constant state of self-examination.  The reason I reach the conclusions I do is that much of what modern identity politics is proposing - and hardline feminism in particular - is quite simply not an anti-prejudice policy. It's not progressive, left-of-centre politics. It's regressive and right-wing, perhaps far right, bordering on fascism, even as it dabbles in the power politics of the Marxian class struggle.  In short we need an argument to move the Overton window back to somewhere sensible, to the point where it's unacceptable to propose bigoted policies, and acceptable to criticise those policies. I think the most powerful argument is simply to point out that some of the policies proposed by hardline feminism are not progressive, not left of centre, and not representative of any sort of justice, social or otherwise.	1640864312.0	hqjap7x	t3_rrvmgn	t3_rrvmgn	/r/MensRights/comments/rrvmgn/what_are_mras_complaining_about_that_is_though/hqjap7x/

I have to admit that I'm not particularly proud to be a guy that sucks dick. And my love for men, if I'm honest with myself, it comes from a place of weakness. It comes from a need of paternal love and protection that I never felt from my own father. I'm guessing that you won't be surprised to hear that, even as a child, I was put in a position to threaten him with violence, in order to shield my mother and sister and that I developed a fondness for dad types. And he has never been emotional or loving, even with my mother. When he talks to my niece and he uses diminutive and "cute" words, it's so odd and out of character. You know, I never even thought about the concept of fatherly love or believed that I was ever deserving of such a thing, until I saw a friend show unconditional and boundless love and pride for his own son. By contrast, none of my own achievements were ever recognized or praised. I finished high-school with the highest marks in all the school and in 9th grade I got a perfect score, which was difficult and a big thing for me. His response? That I did it for myself and he started ranting about what he's done in military school, like a billion years ago. Sorry, I went on another trip down memory lane.

Nobody should be surprised that someone else defends themselves with similar actions when attacked.   The best way to avoid being attacked is to avoid attacking.   If you attack first, the response from the one you attacked is not also an attack. It is defense.  You hit me. I hit you. Don't hit me, I won't hit you.  Basic schoolyard stuff. Boys grow up with that. Girls don't. Girls get taught "Boys can't hit girls." That isn't equality.  Boys don't want to hit girls. But they also don't want to get hit.

a0xsse2g	I think we functionally agree on most of this stuff. The only thing I'd query is:  >the former most certainly is acting in malice.  This is a semantic argument. In my view, and in common definitions of malice, there must be a deliberate intent to do harm. If someone does not believe what they're doing is harmful then that person cannot be accused of malice, and since we can't prove someone else's beliefs, we can't conclusively accuse any feminist of being malicious. We can try to make them understand that they're doing harm, but if they continue to genuinely believe otherwise, they are not, formally, being malicious.  Foolish, misguided, uninformed, ignorant, obstinate, bigoted, impolite, fascistic, lacking in self-reflection, even delusional, but not malicious.  The reason I stick on this point is that it makes a significant difference to the appropriate response. Someone who's being malicious knows what they're doing is harmful and doesn't care. Someone who genuinely believes (however wrongly) that what they're doing is not harmful is going to react very differently to having their views questioned, so this is an important hair to split.	1640867079.0	hqjem33	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqjag6q	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqjem33/

46a6opwn	Gender based discrimination has to stop and the reality of abuse and its causes addressed. No law should ever be enacted which contains a gender reference: this will force laws to address the underlying issues rather than simply obscure the most visible gendered expressions.  It's concerning that the abused can become abusers as that suggests a cross-generational transference that can not be stopped unless actively tackled. We might see the Father as the abuser, when he could have been the abused as a son, so it makes no sense to punish abusers who have already been punished themselves.  I have been careful not to use the term "violence" as that is more a gendered expression when men characteristically respond with physical aggression compared with women who characteristically respond with psychological aggression: abuse should be the umbrella term used to cover equivalent means of aggression used by both.  I believe the role of Police is just as imbalanced as only looking at violence: their sole activity as assistance for the prosecution and focus on law breaking is not balanced by any other services for the defense or focusing on the actual situation (which is usually complex and not simply believing one party over another) and helping defend people. Social services need to play a much more immediate and larger role in any conflict to ensure everyone is protected, not simply women and those who can lie convincingly. There should be far more facilities available for vulnerable people to be cared for whilst issues are properly investigated and longer term resolutions applied.  I think it is appalling that Police took an accused word at face value instead of properly investigating gun licenses, etc to establish truth about circumstances. You would think society understood people can distort the truth to protect themselves, by now.  I think it would be a mistake to go after women more: instead we need to revise laws to ensure no gender obtains an advantage over another, because gender is not mentioned. By the same token, society needs to ensure that gendered facilities are replaced with individual facilities that naturally cater for diversity: it's going to take far more effort, but I think what we are seeing now is the result of addressing issues superficially and with a gendered bias (ie less effort initially but far greater effort in the longer term).	1640867194.0	hqjes2p	t3_rryzhe	t3_rryzhe	/r/MensRights/comments/rryzhe/what_about_him/hqjes2p/

47rp0gko	The problem with that comparison is that FGM is a wide range of mutilations that can be as severe as removing parts of the genitalia or as light as pinpricking it. FGM can be much worse or nowhere as bad as male circumcision depending on the type, but the public has an extremely common misconception that FGM is only one practice and it is always the most severe one, along with the misconception that male circumcision is harmless and only cuts off a 'useless piece of skin'.  *Every* female type is considered a violation of human rights regardless of severity according to the UN and most countries around the world made it illegal. Most of us are only wondering why it's considered no big deal to mutilate one and a violation of human rights to mutilate another.	1640867427.0	hqjf4sw	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqjb95x	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqjf4sw/

bbb2t4qb	“It’s more hygienic” is totally debunked, and was incredibly stupid to begin with. That’s like shaving your kids head bc it’s healthy for their scalp - it’s not total BS, but you are totally missing the point. Foreskin is functional and has nerves who’s only job is to send pleasure signals, similar to a clitoris but much more spread out. Having sex is a different experience, for both partners, and circumcision changes that before you even know what it is.  Sure, cultural norms change how we view these things, but they are cutting off part of your genitals permanently and without consent, that’s the same. If your friend cannot separate the normalization of circumcision in society enough to see that they are as similar as they could practically be, there is no point in discussing it further. Without factoring in that normalization I see nothing that could possibly support a gendered stance on this - we are talking about CHILDREN here.   Maybe remind her that the “men” she is overlooking were all actually newborn babies.	1640867801.0	hqjfpja	t3_rrwamo	t3_rrwamo	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqjfpja/

I’m a feminist, I read about this stuff all the time. r/MensRights is literally the only place where I’ve come across this notion.  I’m a 39 yr old man. Not in my entire life, before this sub, has anyone ever said men cannot be raped. And I’m not a protected delicate flower; my mother’s work had her encountering male rape victims of all ages that I’ve always been aware of.  Nor has any locker room or social circle ever pretended or implied that men cannot be raped. I just don’t understand where this is coming from, every time I see these words it’s a man complaining that “people” said it to him.  Our society does a bad job of believing people who are victims of sexual assault; that’s a fact. And even more so for men. The patriarchy and its justice system is harsh on men, believing we should be able to protect ourselves and we should face harsh consequences for our actions. The same patriarchal justice system infantilizes women as victims who must be protected and given 2nd chances.  It’s unfair, it fucks over men, and everyone here is in denial about WHY it’s unfair.	1640868009.0	hqjg0wk	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqh9jin	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqjg0wk/

c6dnp	But censoring a sub you disagree with is so far down on the totem pole of things that are important to men's rights. My making moves and acquiring successes in the areas and issues that *are* important to MRAs, there is a cultural shift that will occur. This same cultural shift will further alienate misandrist spaces such as FDS, which will be considered (rightfully so) by even more of the general populous than already thinks so. By focusing on what matters, we make progress in other areas, too.   You can argue that there is no proof for such a contention, but it feels as though arguing to the contrary would be done out of bad faith. There is ample evidence that censorship insulates and radicalized communities.

a0xsse2g	The question you're asking here is one that I find myself addressing when men's rights people get shouty and start generalising about feminists, which I try hard not to do. I tend to use the term "hardline feminists" to differentiate people who hold the most extreme views, which may include making excuses for sexual assault, violence and murder of men. Those people do exist.  I don't think most people who describe themselves as feminists believe that, but increasingly, people who describe themselves as feminists are risking both being associated with those extreme views, which is (or should be) embarrassing, but also lending them support by association, which is desperately ill-advised.  As such I wouldn't recommend anyone self-describe with the word "feminist." Like a lot of political catchall terms, at best, it'll lead to a semantic argument over what the word means; it's almost become meaningless now. You might as well just state your views on the subject at hand.	1640868150.0	hqjg8rr	t3_rrr9df	t3_rrr9df	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqjg8rr/

46a6opwn	If feminism is truly about equality, then dating should start as a relationship means to continue and that is nominally with both parties equally participating in a venture both can afford.  However, I think dating is an anachronism from a time when it was not possible to get to know someone reasonably well before meeting in person. Now we have telepresence, I think people should spend more time with video chats getting to know the other persons views and perspectives before going to the next step of meeting in person.  Dating has become a way of determining "physical compatibility", which I think is a horrible idea as it suggests we only want partners who are exactly compatible with our own current notions of sex without any possibility of accommodation and we expect them to be perfect from the get go. Men and women are already basically compatible: the rest is learned and adjusted or abandoned. We can far better determine another's sexual expectations by simply talking about them if the initial telepresence is promising. That's when you give people an opportunity to consider whether they can accept those conditions or expectations or can see themselves adapting to them.  Trial and error seems to be a very inefficient, humiliating and discouraging process after millennia of doing basically the same thing.	1640869221.0	hqjhyy6	t3_rry3pp	t3_rry3pp	/r/MensRights/comments/rry3pp/what_is_your_opinion_on_who_should_pay_for_the/hqjhyy6/

3hix3gw0	>Women use weapons more often than men do in DV, but not enough to fully counterbalance the fact that men's greater upper body strength more often results in serious injuries or death.  IIRC the greatest predictor of a woman getting injured was whether she was violent herself/initiating. That is, violence in retaliation, and escalation of conflict result in women getting more injured.  There is also this little bit of context : in the 70s, women and men died equally of DV. Then, services for female victims appeared and increased, and with them, the number of male deaths declined sharply kwhile female deaths barely changed. The researcher attributed that to "battered wife syndrome" : women feeling so trapped that murder seems the only way out, decreasing in occurrence as help became available, then, like only feminists are capable of, in a feat of acro atic thinking, they concluded that men must work differently, since ressources for women didn't help men feel less trapped and only seeing murder as a way out.  So, I would take all the data regarding prevalence of spousal murder with a grain of salt, as there might be a huge factor at play here. After all, there is a difference between battering someone and killing someone. The motivation is not exactly the same, and while escalation can lead to accidents, I would suspect that accidents are more likely to happen when wielding a weapon than your fists, so I wouldn't bet on too huge a percentage of spousal murders being due to escalation of violence going out of hand. Likely something close to the ratio "murder by women" /"murder by men".	1640869886.0	hqjj3bl	t3_rrvmgn	t1_hqj481n	/r/MensRights/comments/rrvmgn/what_are_mras_complaining_about_that_is_though/hqjj3bl/

I am so heartened to see your post, whether the link is broken or not. I have seen too many men say that they are hurting to ignore their pain.   What a nice and welcoming community with the most civil discussions I have seen in what feels like ages. If anyone has ideas about what things would be most helpful in getting support for better treatment of men, I'd be happy to try. I don't want to hijack the discussion either.	1640870139.0	hqjjiom	t3_rrylk9	t3_rrylk9	/r/MensRights/comments/rrylk9/male_privilege_i_am_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqjjiom/

I have, nothing can force them to disagree in the slightest.  > I do think that people in general are more likely to support others they don't agree with if they share at least some opinions in common  What do men and feminism have in common? Feminism opposes men in every way possible.   > We should not tolerate the crazier extremes either, and they do exist.  Many who are claimed to be part of the MRM are not, but this is what happens when feminism controls the narrative. And there is no organization or structure to the MRM. It's a loose affiliation of mostly men who communicate on a few forums. But I take it you would rather the MRM not waste time protesting the sexism men face and work more on enforcing some manner of purity test on MRAs.	1640870348.0	hqjjvs9	t3_rqzzai	t1_hqivvax	/r/MensRights/comments/rqzzai/not_all_men_vs_not_all_feminists_how_would_you/hqjjvs9/

26hxithd	You are assuming that women being the majority of victims is a contradiction to women being a majority of the perpetrators.  This is not true. Women can be a majority of the victims and perpetrators.   What people want to be absolutely blind to is women on women violence. You assume all violence against women is committed by men. Once you remove that assumption and realize that women are abused by men PLUS women, it becomes easier to see.  Second, despite what the media says, men are physically stronger than women. When DV escalates in a male/female relationship, and both partners become physically violent the woman is far more likely to receive significant injuries.	1640871740.0	hqjmeap	t3_rrvmgn	t1_hqj6mrq	/r/MensRights/comments/rrvmgn/what_are_mras_complaining_about_that_is_though/hqjmeap/

1ib5l9eh	>This is a semantic argument. In my view, and in common definitions of    malice, there must be a deliberate intent to do harm. If someone does    not believe what they're doing is harmful then that person cannot be    accused of malice, and since we can't prove someone else's beliefs, we    can't conclusively accuse any feminist of being malicious.  To me this screams of an 'opt out' to me, when you hold strictly to a definition like this then nothing can be malicious, as you can never prove anyone's beliefs.  >The reason I stick on this point is that it makes a significant    difference to the appropriate response. Someone who's being malicious knows what they're doing is harmful and doesn't care.   If i understand you correctly, you're claiming that they are stupid? I mean, how can someone 'not understand' that gendering something like rape isn't harmful to men? Or limiting male shelters, how can anyone who doesn't have brain damage not understand that this would harm men?   The whole feminist religion is based on gendering everything and all of their dogma shits on men when and wherever they possibly can.   I'm sorry, but if someone wants to claim ignorance then they should be ignorant on the subject. Anyone with half a brain should be able to understand that things like the Duluth model are harmful to men, but, feminism is still championing it. The same goes for reproductive rights for men, only someone with severe brain damage would have trouble understanding that this is harmful to men, yet feminism is still protesting these rights.  So take your pick, are these people so incredibly stupid that we should take them into protection and institutionalize the lot of them, or are we going to acknowledge that these people *know perfectly well that what they are doing is hurting men, but that they simply just do not care.*   These people know perfectly well that what they are doing is hurting men, but they don't care about any of that because in their mind it just isn't evil. Don't tell me you've never heard the excuse 'but women have been oppressed for centuries' or some dumb equivalent that is supposed to excuse current hardships of men. They know, they don't care, they are acting malicious.	1640873084.0	hqjp0hh	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqjem33	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqjp0hh/

There is no religious reason to do it. There is no god that would demand you slice a piece of your child off and more so in religions where the person mutilating has to do a certain act as part of a "tradition" (look it up. It's effing rank and wrong). There is no medical reason why. There is no reason why a new born should be cup up to suit the parent or the parents "tradition" and yes I say cut up rather than any medical name because that's what they're doing.

3nrxdp	> Wow. You're just openly saying the women being hit were asking for it and it's their fault eh?  So you think a man is in the wrong for defending himself, how unexpected.  It's been my personal experience that women just don't stop being violent.  > This is some messed up stuff  I agree.  It seems you would be in agreement with feminist written Duluth model.  * Duluth is predicated on the "patriarchal terrorism" paradigm of partner violence. That is, men beat their female partners in order to assert masculine dominance within their relationships. Their motives are to conform to patriarchal norms and to reify a the patriarchal social/political/cultural order of male dominance and female subordination within the home.  * Under this faulty model, women cannot, as a conceptual matter, perpetrate partner abuse. If they hit their male partners, it was in self defense. If they hit first, or are the only partner who hits, they are doing it within the context of "violent resistance" against presumed emotional or psychological abuse on his part.   You probably also think that arresting a male DV victim of a female even if he did not defend himself is the right thing to do.	1640875410.0	hqjtvnz	t3_rrvmgn	t1_hqj99eg	/r/MensRights/comments/rrvmgn/what_are_mras_complaining_about_that_is_though/hqjtvnz/

If you think men were created by a god and you think god is an all-knowing and all-good being, then why would you ever believe that god created men with a penis that needs to be mutilated after the fact. boys should already be perfect as they are. It's so inconsistent and yet, religion still seems to be one of the strongest reasons why people still think male mutilation is acceptable, if not simply because people are scared to confront others over their religious beliefs.	1640876312.0	hqjvumi	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqjbs65	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqjvumi/

86f1jsgs	Unless I misunderstood, she is arguing that women should take priority because they are most affected.   And I can see the logic - 2 million girls and 13 million boys are circumcised every year.   Of the two million girls, they can suffer very detrimental effects, by a percentage I would say that women have worse outcomes for their health and sexuality.   However, I would also say that 2 million girls is 11 million less than what is happening to the men, and by sheer numbers alone I would guess that the quantity of death, disability, and disfigurement is higher for men, considering that 1000 men are meant to have died in south Africa alone from ritual circumcision, and that 2000 men have lossed their penis since 1995.  https://en.mercopress.com/2021/12/20/23-south-african-teenagers-killed-in-initiation-rite-this-year  The other arguments as to why we should start here, on home terf, is that we are going to have the biggest impact. We can fix these issues much more easily than sending funds and missionaries over seas.  It's great saying we should fix the whole world, but you should start with your own country because it's a lot more practical.  Would you say that stabbings shouldn't be looked into until all murders are solved? Or is it the case that only a certain number of officers can be enrolled on each case and it would be over-encumbering and impractical to do that.   Would this person recommend sending police officers from one country to investigate murders in another country, because murder is the worst crime you can commit and so it should be prioritized? Or do they see the impracticality of that, the lack of benefit vs cost, and the waste that would be involved?	1640876805.0	hqjwyac	t3_rrwamo	t3_rrwamo	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqjwyac/

3nrxdp	rape copypasta from u|duhhhh  ----------  For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced penetration of the victim in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. (Really. Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)  She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the "victims" didn't.** A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was. **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely "unwanted contact"**  You see she has been saying this for decades and was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics. E.g.  Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (June 1993) Page: 206  >>> Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**  Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf  She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There was a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.  Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the "rape" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for "made to penetrate" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.  As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm  > **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**  and  > **The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.**  vs  > **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**  and  > Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators **For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators.** In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%),** sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),  So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of "made to penetrators" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.  But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/). Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females. **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs "only" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group "nearly all the men were raped by other men" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...  And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.  2010 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf  2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf  2015 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf  Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known  data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.  And non CDC study...  A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.  The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/  Another non CDC study...  a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.  And another non CDC study...  National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”  Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers  when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).  If my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.  https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/  Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one. But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at "rapists", rather than "men".  And it isn't just the US.  Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms  So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.  Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.  https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape  Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...  > Women’s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn’t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims’ fight for justice.  https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities  **Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.** Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this. Around 10 of them cited here.  http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528  So women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future. That should matter if the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men	1640877120.0	hqjxo1c	t3_rrrvhl	t3_rrrvhl	/r/MensRights/comments/rrrvhl/sex_for_women/hqjxo1c/
1kjigxbi	Most women seem to be under this mindset that it's perfectly acceptable to vilify/hate men and maintain an irrational fear of men, simply because men are, on average, physically stronger than women. This can extend to making excuses when women attack/harm men or react with vitriol, hostility and fear when men innocently approach them. This is also ignoring the fact that women can and do, in fact, harm men in countless ways, including influencing men to harm other men(both inside and outside the law), or that not every man is able to overpower every woman(or that women exclusively legitimize, judge and pick men over their physical strength).	1640877204.0	hqjxut7	t3_rrvmgn	t3_rrvmgn	/r/MensRights/comments/rrvmgn/what_are_mras_complaining_about_that_is_though/hqjxut7/

Men’s group have been less successful but have had some wins in the battle for men’s equality.  Many states now have more fair child custody laws due to the efforts of mens groups.   A men’s group won a court case proving that exempting women  from selective service is discriminatory and unconstitutional   Congress considered this decision but decided to continue to exempt women knowing their decision was unconstitutional and discriminatory.   This shows just how much pressure there is to advantage women over men and what an uphill battle men’s groups have in goal to reach legal equality for men.	1640877946.0	hqjzkj5	t3_rs0oka	t3_rs0oka	/r/MensRights/comments/rs0oka/systemic_and_legal_changes/hqjzkj5/

It’s typically Dutch.   If I meet some other guy at a function and we decide to get a beer, who pays?  Take gender dynamics out of the equation and the assumption is typically that people pay their own way when they go out with others.  When it comes to male-female relationships, the overall expectation is that men pay.   Women may not always state this, but it’s almost always what they expect.	1640880655.0	hqk649c	t3_rry3pp	t3_rry3pp	/r/MensRights/comments/rry3pp/what_is_your_opinion_on_who_should_pay_for_the/hqk649c/

a0xsse2g	>when you hold strictly to a definition like this then nothing can be malicious, as you can never prove anyone's beliefs.  Formally, yes. I guess people could self-describe as malicious, and we would have no reason to disbelieve them. Informally we might agree that someone was being malicious, much as we'd be forced to accept we could not formally prove it. All of this is word games, though. What we're really discussing is whether these people understand the harm they're doing. My position is that most of them probably believe *in general* that they're doing good; some of them seem to accept that there are some downsides but that the people affected are acceptable battle casualties, but I think most of them believe it wholeheartedly.   I can offer no evidence for that other than that the reactions we see often look very much like what psychologists call an amygdala response, or amygdala hijack, an activation of the fight-or-flight response. This most often happens with religious people when their beliefs are questioned and it's visible as a very sudden, very extreme move to massive, unrestrained fear, anger, even violence. I'm sure you'll have seen really hardline feminists suffer this sort of thing. For that and other reasons, my strong suspicion is that it's using some of the same psychology as religion, which is why they often come off as zealots, fundamentalists, sectarians or radicals. This is why they ban people from their subreddits; they can't handle the physiological response they experience when they're  disagreed with.  &#x200B;  >If i understand you correctly, you're claiming that they are stupid? I mean, how can someone 'not understand' that gendering something like rape isn't harmful to men? Or limiting male shelters, how can anyone who doesn't have brain damage not understand that this would harm men?  This is a very important question.  Even without the religion connection I make above, large numbers of people can be gulled into believing even the most appalling things if those things are introduced in the right way. I'm about to invoke Godwin's law, here, but bear in mind that huge numbers of German citizens, the vast majority of whom were neither stupid nor mentally ill, at least broadly supported Nazism and the isolation of German Jews. And let's not flatter ourselves; most likely, if you or I had grown up in the Weimar Republic, we would too.  Now you'll say that's not a valid equivalence and I'll agree with you but it does demonstrate that human psychology is capable of accommodating almost anything under the right circumstances.  So, stupid? Possibly. Modern feminists do not exist in the vacuum of dissenting opinion that allowed Nazism to rise to power, although they sometimes seem as if they want to. In reality they're widely argued-with. I do think, that under these circumstances, you would have to be pretty stupid to become one of the real hardliners; at least completely ignorant of crucial aspects of statistics, history and psychology. I don't think most people who identify as feminists are stupid, no. Many people, especially women, will reflexively describe themselves as feminists with very little knowledge of the problems the movement has. They're ill-informed, maybe.  What's crucial here is that generalising about these people is a bad idea because we do not want to alienate moderates. We need them on side.	1640881010.0	hqk6zvu	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqjp0hh	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqk6zvu/

b4xzm	Had many arguments about this with my wife who is a doctor. We had a son last year, thus the reason for the arguments. she was just didnt believe in any of these "issues" that occur with circumcision. Eventually I just put my foot down on the issue and forced our son to stay intact. Luckily my state requires both parents (if married) to agree to circumcision. Made sure my wishes were know at the hospital. no hospital wants to get involved in that dispute, so if they know one opposes it, they will just leave it alone. It was ridiculous how many times we got asked about it though. My response was always something like "no, I do not consent to the mutilation of my son". Mainly to show them how "crazy" I am about it so they will just stay out of it.  My wife just spouted off the same nonsense like  "less STDs and cleaner", but all that is crazy in a first world.

I mean, my 1600 patients i’ve had(all of them at least once, several many times), would probably say I contribute to society. Saying i’m a dentist is far from the insult you think. And i shit on mountaineering? Who cares? Why is that relevant? What’s your deal? Going through someones entire reddit history to make irrelevant assumptions? You think me having a little innocent fun with mountaineering is relevant to your women hating? I haven’t even looked at your history. But i’ll follow your lead and give it a go. So at first glance, the fact that you have no friends pops out. Otherwise there’s a bunch of transphobia, saying black people are racists(you have a weird obsession with black people being racist). And of course caring a lot about who killed the most people, and a lot of fortnight. So what you got from my history is that i’m a dentist who rock climbs and have opinions you disagree with. Big burn. What i got from yours is that you’re a gamer loner who’s transphobic and cares a lot about mass murder. While hating women and have reddit being your life. You sound like a school shooter in the making. Good idea you got going through peoples history. Told me a-lot about you. Try to not kill too many people, incel. Now go away.	1640883143.0	hqkcg2b	t3_rpqbuq	t1_hqk12ed	/r/MensRights/comments/rpqbuq/another_men_can_walk_freely_at_night_comment_full/hqkcg2b/

6q85ceq0	😁   Good to see you continuing the quest.  I wrote a post for the feminism page stating that it isn’t good to be a feminist, in the same way it isn’t good to be a sophist.  A philosopher creates knowledge, loves it, but is not of it. A sophist is of knowledge, they hold and repeat it, but are more like machines than conscious beings.  Unsurprisingly the post was blocked and so was I from the sub.  After writing for a while trying to figure out what would be an appropriate way to describe oneself relative to feminism, I changed the perspective to be about me relative to masculism.  I wouldn’t call myself a masculist, but I’d call myself a masculism worker.  I haven’t read through this post and the comments yet, but I’m about to.  🙏	1640883607.0	hqkdnlx	t3_rrr9df	t3_rrr9df	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqkdnlx/

I have never once seen or heard anyone call breasts that, except one time and that was a very straight almost certainly pedophile trying to defend his Asian fetish.  Besides that a lot of my friends online and real are gay men and women, and a.couple are trans including my own cousin.    Now I think most gay people are *sexually* repulsed by the opposite gender just like straight people are by the same gender.  Like I'd be disgusted by a man if I tried to have sex or make out with them.  And I've heard plenty a gay man say the same about women.

cx05s	No, it’s not that at all.  I just think there are far more important things for men to worry about right now.  1) inequality in family courts 2) inequality in regular courts 3) lack of mental health support 4) suicide rates 5) the rise of incels that make the rest of us look like …. Incels. 6) codified discriminatory laws( eg the draft in the states)  My ex used to beat my sons.  Social workers told me it was acceptable because it wasn’t regular.  Still have the letter.  Don’t really care about the circumcision thing. My first was cut, no issues. My second was uncut.  Penis issues until late teenager and now some difficulty, that required a doctors visit to repair.  Just tired of seeing a new circumcision thread every other day by tired people spewing vitriol, like the guy that came unglued on me the last time I spoke on this.  More important shit that covers off more people for a better bang for the buck.  And stop comparing it to fgm.  Stupidest comparison ever.  I was t snipped to deny sexual enjoyment.

axu24	That makes me especially surprised then.  When I was 17 I was encouraged not to use protection with the girl I lost my virginity with. I did anyway. The one time I did not, resulted in pregnancy. The mother of my child raised our daughter on the other side of the country in poisoned her her entire life to my daughter has horrible been till issues. She has been married four times and moved to as many states and even out of the country. My daughter now has a child and became pregnant at 14.  I’m a 35-year-old grandfather, I have been said back in life by trying to father a child with emotional issues all around the country, I have been setback deeply for the child support I have been paying since I was in high school.  I’m a child of divorce and I’ve seen what it does to my father and the unfair alimony laws.  Not only am I abundantly aware that men’s rights stretches so far beyond issues like male circumcision, but it makes me twice as angry.  There are much bigger issues, but there are also children who lose their penises to circumcision.  We also live in a society where how wide a man spreads his legs on a subway or bus has a common term. Why remain silent about male general mutilation? It’s not at all a small issue.	1640884750.0	hqkgobb	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqkfyno	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqkgobb/

gn9g7ooc	Exactly. This is why I am involved in filing Title IX complaints. Title IX develops in small steps based on cases and I seek to get more male voices in that space.  Did you know the rights offered by schools aren't actually rights unless they are mirrored by 34 CFR 106 or some other law? I had my "rights" violated by a school but OCR dismissed it because the school isn't required to offer those rights. They were meaningless and at the whim of the school.  OCR under the current director has intent to dismiss mens cases. They had a senior attorney and *team* working on a case of mine which included real damages. OCR dismissed my case after a year and a half of review. They didn't even cite a single piece of law as informing their dismissal.	1640884934.0	hqkh62b	t3_rs0oka	t3_rs0oka	/r/MensRights/comments/rs0oka/systemic_and_legal_changes/hqkh62b/
59jvn	[Yes](https://www.usa.gov/selective-service), [it's true](https://www.sss.gov/faq/). [It's BS](https://www.sss.gov/register/women/) and currently being [called into question](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/07/1003270634/supreme-court-turns-away-challenge-to-the-rule-that-only-men-register-for-the-dr) with growing support to either include all genders or eliminate the draft. It's doubtful the draft will be eliminated so the more likely solution is to follow the current trend of eliminating gender criteria for military services and add women to the draft registration when they turn 18.  But it is also a minor issue that is pretty much on the back burner while other issues like infrastructure, climate change, voting rights, and abortion access are fought over.	1640885274.0	hqki2xn	t3_rrx59a	t3_rrx59a	/r/MensRights/comments/rrx59a/is_this_true/hqki2xn/
cx05s	That was quite a wall of text.  I’ll make it simple.  As men, we have limited support, resources and funding.  We have many things that impact far more people then the very very vocal minority of anti circumcision folks. (Not arguing morality, frankly don’t care)  We need to keep our attention and focus our support, resources and money into the the things that don’t make us look like lunatics with red cotton balls on our crotch in the streets.  We are not women. We are men.  We start with the big shit, and then we can work on the small shit.  I get that there are people with circumcision issues, but the vast majority of us have had no issues.  I would assume that getting equality for men and women with children in mind is a far more important thing to tackle, unless you think men really don’t need to  participate in their kids life.   Finally, the anti circumcision movement amongst us is just filled with unreasonable people.  I am sorry, my kids don’t need to see your bleeding cotton ball testicles.  Same as they don’t need to see the equivalent shot from women.	1640885310.0	hqki6fb	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqkgobb	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqki6fb/

50fejop9	As MBV-09-C said, it is because EW is a troll.  And it is also because, in this specific comment, they are completely mischaracterizing what everyone else here is upset about and being wrong.  "Defending obvious criminals and downplaying their crimes is disgusting."  No, it is NOT disgusting to defend criminals. We don't think that and neither should anyone.  Every single person accused of a crime is entitled to a defense. Every single person accused of a crime is entitled to the basic empathy of people at least attempting to see it from their point of view and giving them at least some benefit of the doubt.  Maxwell received a defense- that part was not a problem. She is now convicted.   What is a problem is mischaracterization of acknowledged crimes that have already been tried simply because the gender of the perpetrator does not match the preferences and stereotypes of the observer. A woman convicted of sex crimes should be labeled a pedophile and pervert by her own nature. She should be labeled a rapist by her own actions. She should not be labeled a woman "in a relationship" with a pervert but rather a pervert herself.  Here is an example of an article that only wants to talk about her relationship:  [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10354213/Those-know-Ghislaine-Maxwell-best-reveal-true-nature-twisted-relationship.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10354213/Those-know-Ghislaine-Maxwell-best-reveal-true-nature-twisted-relationship.html)	1640885669.0	hqkj4zm	t3_rrwpon	t1_hqjd65k	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwpon/be_wary_of_those_downplaying_the_crimes_of/hqkj4zm/

1ib5l9eh	>My position is that most of them probably believe in general    that they're doing good; some of them seem to accept that there are    some downsides but that the people affected are acceptable battle    casualties, but I think most of them believe it wholeheartedly.  I disagree, they believe that what they are doing is a good thing for women. I do not believe that there is any way to frame 'acceptable battle casualties' in any other way then malicious. That they don't view it as such isn't an excuse, if anything, it makes it worse, it makes them conditioned to be sociopaths.   >I can offer no evidence for that other than that the reactions we see    often look very much like what psychologists call an amygdala response,    or amygdala hijack, an activation of the fight-or-flight response.  Yes, i agree. The problem is that this is a learned behavior, learned by feminist dogma. So, how is this not malicious?   >This ... with.  How can you not view this as malicious? They have made a religion out of this, it is nothing but striking fear into women because of some boogyman and then they feed on the outrage.   >I'm ... too.  I did my best not to invoke Godwin's law, but now it is here... I understand really well that these German citizen's weren't mentally ill, but, that doesn't mean that their support for the third Reich can be waved away as not meaningful.   The thing is though, women have never been as bad off as the German people of the 1930's. One of the biggest reasons that Hitler came to power was because he promised the Germans a way to regain their past glory. After the first world war the Germans were forced to pay massive restitution's. They even had to pay for the bullets that the French fired at them, they were economically broken.   Women have never been treated badly as a gender. Yes, there have been lots and lots of gender roles throughout history and civilization, but these gender roles have always gone both ways. There hasn't been a time in western history were women were worse off. That doesn't mean that it was all roses or that there weren't bad things. It means that if you put all gender roles of any given time period next to each other, the man would have always had a worse plight.  What im trying to say is that these women didn't have a reason to found feminism other then being entitled. Feminism really is nothing but a really clever way of weaponizing the instinct of men wanting to protect women.   >So, stupid? Possibly. Modern feminists do not exist in the vacuum of    dissenting opinion that allowed Nazism to rise to power, although they    sometimes seem as if they want to.  Very debatable, with the ban hammer solving everything it really doesn't seem like dissent is possible.  > I do...maybe.  That is like saying that racist should be excused from their racism because they don't know any better.   Being ill informed really isn't an excuse in the 21st century. Everyone runs around with the knowledge of the world in their pockets. If you're going to have a strong opinion on something then the least thing you can do is to read up on it a bit.   >What's crucial here is that generalising about these people is a bad    idea because we do not want to alienate moderates. We need them on side.  Anyone who has drank the koolaid isn't a moderate. Once they believe in the holy patriarchy the gig is over.   I believe it is perfectly fine to call someone out on their beliefs.

30ymvhrd	I used to work I higher education and sadly, this is very typical of most title ix cases I’ve heard of.    When most people hear the term rape, or sexual assault, they think of forced sex, but from what I’ve seen in most title ix cases, the complainant consented at the time and did not feel any assault was committed at the time.  The event only comes to be viewed as an assault retrospectively.    I’ve seen cases where the woman never filed a complaint, but a feminist administrator filed a complaint on behalf of that person or the student body.  Often face saving and embarrassment as in this story comes into play.   The woman later regrets the encounter because it was over heard, because her friends don’t approve of the guy, etc. and of course mental health issues can play a part as well.     Often the woman says she only had sex because she was drunk, didn’t feel she could say no, etc.   Often  at this point she’s not trying to get the guy in trouble, she’s just trying to save face, but of course once she says this her woke friends tell her she was raped. Feminist title ix officers get involved and pressure the woman to file title ix charges.    Of course once this happens the deck is stacked against the accused male .   Due process rights such as a right to a lawyer, a right of discovery and guilt beyond a reasonable doubt don’t exist when it comes to most college tribunals.

Secondly, I’m not saying being a dentist is bad. We need dentists in society. I’m saying being mildly racist (saying blackface isn’t bad in any form) is how you aren’t helpful.   Now, my profile.   I play a lot of fortnite? Nah. I have one maybe 2 posts on it because I play a few games maybe once a week.   I have no friends? I actually have a really good friend circle at the moment. Recently became quite popular which I’m not gonna complain about.   Transphobia? No. I’m not transphobic. I fully support it. Hell, if you go far enough back there’s a photo of me at pride with a trans flag on my cheek.  Nice try, but try harder.   Racist towards black people? Again, no. I’m not racist. A lot of my family and friends are black and I go to BLM protests. But again, try harder.   Woman hating. Give me ONE example where I’ve shit on women. Just one. I’ve never commented or posted anything of the sort. Unlike on your old account, where you made a post sexualising women.   > care a lot about who killed the most people Im presuming in this you’re referring to when I argued against the guy saying the guy who killed only women is worse than the guy who killed double that amount. Whoever killed more is worse.   Reddit’s my whole life? Not really. You reply to my comments quicker than I reply to yours.   School shooter in the making? Sure I am. Where you got that idea from hmm? As someone joining the navy I don’t see how I’m a school shooter.   Lastly, you called me an incel. An incel with a girlfriend. Didn’t earlier you admitted I’m not an incel? Make your mind up, incel. Because as you keep reminding me, this is an incel sub you’re on.   Grow up. All of what you said is wrong, while what I said about you is pretty accurate.	1640885873.0	hqkjons	t3_rpqbuq	t1_hqkcg2b	/r/MensRights/comments/rpqbuq/another_men_can_walk_freely_at_night_comment_full/hqkjons/

Sounds like a fight for feminists to champion, because equality would mean making this better for everyone! What's that?

644qdtdj	Caroline norton was not a feminist, she was explicitly against the idea that the genders are equal and distanced herself from the feminist movement of her time.  What happened to her was, her husband accused her of adultery and took her to court. It wasn’t proven and they were separated but not divorced. Because of the law of the time, after she was separated she couldn’t see her children. After some time, her youngest son died from an injury in his father's custody. That was what prompted her to petition MPs by using her influence as a socialite to change custody laws. That was the extant of her activism. You should be able to read about this at length and find other references in the Wikipedia article about her.	1640886876.0	hqkmc97	t3_pg754p	t3_pg754p	/r/MensRights/comments/pg754p/a_misconception_that_needs_to_be_cleared_up/hqkmc97/

The writing is on the wall with this, literally 60 percent of college students are girls now.

6q85ceq0	You talk a lot. Definitely a coffee shop philosopher 😏  You do have power though. It may not be much, but you influence the people around you.  Think on this:  Feminism could be a good thing.   Like in physics, a force acting in one direction will give an object momentum in that direction, so is true in the world of ideas.   Feminism has acted unilaterally in the direction of empowering females, for good or bad. Civilisation must be brought into balance by a force acting for males.  The simplest solution is: masculism.  Perhaps the names will change in time. Perhaps they will annihilate. Perhaps they will persist as sources of nourishment and bodies which we feed, into eternity.	1640889171.0	hqksegs	t3_rrr9df	t1_hqihnir	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqksegs/

One thing I'd really like to see is insurance companies suing universities over these settlement payouts, because if universities are deliberately flouting the law and then using insurance to pay for settlements, the insurance companies could have a good case for insurance fraud.

f153moet	Mgm is the engine that powers fgm. Only a small proportion of females who are affected by fgm undergo the severest forms of fgm.  The vast majority undergo procedures such as a ritual billable  'nick', or removal of the clitoral hood.  Even stretching of the labia is included in the definition. There are 4 major types of female genital mutilation (with subtypes) ranging from the least severe - a clitoral 'nick' for a drop of blood to the most severe - removal of labia, partial or total clitoral removal (of the visible part of the clitoris- the bulk of the clitoris is within the body; and is not removed in even the severest form of FGM) & sewing up of the vagina... Forced male cutting, of the type practised in USA, in terms of tissues removed and damaged, is equivalent to the third most severe, in terms of nerve damage it is the second most severe.	1640889535.0	hqktd6u	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqk9a3j	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqktd6u/

In this conversation, he goes over his experiences, of witnessing the Feminists go wilfully too far, and tells of his departure and repositioning in the MRM.  Feminism isn't about equality. It makes no sense to say that it is.  It is by females, for females. And it should remain that way, and it should instantiate itself in perpetuity.  In order for there to be balance, there must be another force acting on civilisation, in the opposite 'direction' to Feminism.  Masculism is the answer.  Etymologically, the notions are coherent. Individually and in concert.  Even if we, this generation, put in place strong foundations for equality, health & happiness for all, regardless of sex... we will die and future generations will likely erode what we build.  We don't need strong foundations.  We need PERFECT foundations.  Perhaps Feminism and Masculism are the wrong words for what the boys and girls of humanity's future needs.  But for now, they will do.  Let us feed those trees, so that future generations can bask in their shade, feed them, and take nourishment from them.	1640890129.0	hqkuxb0	t3_rrr9df	t1_hqibvax	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqkuxb0/

6q85ceq0	See my above comments. We're along similar lines.   I will add here that our lexicon is littered with inconsistencies. Incoherences that make effective communication an impossibility.  Fascism comes from the word 'fasces', which means 'to bundle together'.   Science is a movement of fascism.  It is sorting things, and people.  There is nothing in the etymology of fascism that implies "seizing the means of productions". Nor is there anything about it being a far-right wing thing, or anything else included in common definitions.  Etymology, the logic of truth, is a powerful thing.  Masculism and Feminism could be great and good. They could exist for all the humans to come after us.	1640890668.0	hqkwc53	t3_rrr9df	t1_hqi8hiw	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqkwc53/

3v85ocq3	I’ve always hated that statement. The vast majority of humans in the world know that rape is wrong. The thing with criminals is this….they don’t care. I use to hold lectures in colleges about women protecting themselves when they leave bars, so that line annoyed me so much.  We know bad men exists. That’s a fact. We don’t have any ability to reasonably know who is going to attack you. The best option we have is to apply broken windows and routine activities theory to help you protect yourself. Which is simply this, make yourself look like a hard target. It’s not about trying to identify who a potential perpetrator is, we just assume one already exist. The predator is looking for an easy target, so we focus on changing the surroundings and the the potential victim to decrease the overall likelihood of a crime happening.   Walk with friends, be aware of your surroundings, don’t stand out, carry pepper spray, guard your drinks. Is it fair for women to have to do that. No but frankly it’s oddly more useful to provide simply ways to get people to protect themselves then to tell people hey doing bad things is bad. Unless a cop is standing on the corner where you are at, your safety is pretty much left up to you. And this applied to men as well. You’re not likely to be raped but you have just a significant likelihood of being robbed and assaulted coming home from a bar as well.

P.S stop saying I’m mildly racist for not saying 6 year olds are racist for dressing up at halloween. My skincolor is what you paint yourself at when you’re blackfacing. It doesn’t make sense to say i’m racist for saying that, because i’d be racist against myself. Dumbass. And i sent you my post about blackfacing in PM. Read it, and then talk.

To counter the strength of men, women need greater intelligence to keep par.  But women become preoccupied with being pregnant, and then being mothers.  Men do become fathers, of course.

It is also very hard to convince people to look at it because it's not pretty and it is much harder to convince people that they were wrong or that they are using the same logic that got us into this mess.

As a matter of course, most rational people will also dismiss the garbage coming out of FDS as well. The internet is not real life, and the interactions that happen in online spaces like this are not representative of real life.   My main concern isn't to appear friendly to the opposite sex. It is to avoid the slippery slope. I am against censorship in all of its forms. Forcing radicals to hide their opinions doesn't make those opinions vanish. At least while they are vocal about them, I know who to avoid.   I have been an MRA for over a decade. I am no concern troll.

Outside of saying that "maybe she's a victim", you seem well thought out, well read, and well centered.  About this topic. 100% agree about the hardline feminists being effectively right wingers. Margaret Atwood places a chunk of feminism in the far right, too. She thought they will bring about the regressive policies with the ultraconservatives. Also, much of radical feminism is in line with far right hate speech (especially about trans people).	1640895130.0	hql7ur2	t3_rrvmgn	t1_hqjap7x	/r/MensRights/comments/rrvmgn/what_are_mras_complaining_about_that_is_though/hql7ur2/

I recall hearing in Mass a couple of times that Jesus accepted followers whether they were circumcised or not but we also have a Holy Day of obligation coming up Saturday because it is the anniversary of Jesus' own circumcision.  Seems like the policy is you don't have to do it but they don't discourage it.	1640895150.0	hql7wim	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqku0k4	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hql7wim/

I wish my job would have allowed me to just be able to tell people who fit the general demographic of a perpetrator and say don’t be a criminal and have that stick.  I’m not saying don’t educate people in right and wrong, that an assumption I feel should not have to be stated. But I seriously doubt telling an adult with normal commutative faculties that rape is wrong and they shouldn’t do it when they have that inclination will be persuaded not to offend.    I feel target hardening too often gets the reputation as being victim blaming and I wish it would not.

I think this is mostly unrelated to #1.    3.  I think people all over the world face all sorts of problems, most of which are not gender specific but get turned into gender politics.  I believe nobody should be discriminated against because of their race or sex and we should help all victims regardless of sex. We often see the UN, Red Cross and other organizations helping the female victims and sometimes children while ignoring male victims.     I recently saw a Ted Talk by Cassie Jaye.

It is believed this results from social norms that define sexual assault as being perpetrated by men, and rape myths that say boys should always want sex or could not be overpowered by a woman.        Female offenders are also less likely than men to be arrested and convicted. And, if they are convicted, they typically receive shorter sentences than male offenders.	1640896717.0	hqlbvgg	t3_rsbk43	t3_rsbk43	/r/MensRights/comments/rsbk43/experts_explain_what_the_ghislaine_maxwell_case/hqlbvgg/

A big one for many MRAs has been the bias in child custody and to their credit MRAs have made some productive progress in this direction.      I don’t consider myself a MRA or any kind of activist for that matter, but I am concerned about many of the same issue.  I think it’s terrible how education focuses on girls and is hostile to boys.   I think make victims of domestic violence shouldn’t be denied the same help female victims receive.

gatel	The feminist movement has re-written the history of itself and how it fit into society in it's earliest days (plus a lot of other history).  Since the feminist movement is sponsored by the elites it means "acceptable" history uses the fake version.  For example did you know most women opposed women's right to vote?  Or that men were more in favour of it than women were?  This history was re-written to become "women fought (against horrid men) for their rights".  More or less the reverse was true.

8e2o7	Everyone bears the responsibility of protecting themselves, unfortunately, we don't have a magic switch to get rid of all psychopaths and violent people. The people that murder, rape, and commit other violent acts are not ignorant to the fact that it's wrong, no media campaign is going to stop someone who is determined to break the law from doing it. That's why they're criminals, crime is breaking the law, we already have extremely harsh penalties for rape that people are well aware of, and they do it anyways. Shitty people are always going to exist, the best thing we can do is teach women how to not become a victim, and teach them to protect themselves.  Men are the majority victims of public sphere violence, but there's no campaign to end violence against men, only when it happens to women do we have campaigns to end violence against women.  They want it both ways, they want to be equal to men, without losing the special protections they've enjoyed because they were considered the weaker sex. You can bet even the staunchest feminist on a sinking titanic would be jumping at the chance to get in the lifeboat with the other women and children while the men stay behind to drown.   It's bullshit, either you're equal or you're not, you don't get to pick and choose the best parts of equality and still maintain all the privileges you got before. I don't see any campaigns to have women sign up for the draft, I don't see any campaigns to get women to be plumbers, they only want the good shit.	1640897015.0	hqlcmgh	t3_rs8x81	t1_hql8rnk	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqlcmgh/

30ymvhrd	History has shown that most feminists don’t want feminism to be about equality.  In fact feminists such as Christina Hoff-Sommers who advocate equality are labeled anti-feminist by most feminists.  Leading feminist organizations have lobbied for and won scores of policies advantaging females.  Advantaging one sex over the other is of course the opposite of gender equality.   People who support gender equality shouldn’t label themselves as feminists given they are opposing views.    Fortunately, most people now see feminism isn’t about equality.   Polls show more and more people support gender equality but fewer are feminist which makes sense.	1640897427.0	hqldogs	t3_rrr9df	t3_rrr9df	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqldogs/

4uj85tsl	Be red-pill aware and build yourself up first. Then try vetting seriously and never forget the important lessons that these spaces have taught you. You know, take it from an old lady like myself that your childhood dreams may not come true in the form that you wanted them, but that does not mean that you cannot grieve, accept life on its terms, understand women and then try to find a stable relationship fully aware of the pitfalls. It is hard, I know my son, but I want you to take hope not foolishly or for the wrong romantic reasons but because of the work that you do on yourself, your achievements and the life you build. A woman is only at most a compliment to your life, albeit an important one if she is the right kind (notice that I did not say the one). So look for your mate, work hard and smart, save for your retirement, be vigilant and vet properly, and enjoy your life to the fullest. As you slowly transition away from the anger induced by the redpill and learn to accept reality on its terms, your life will drastically improve and you will attract the type of woman who appreciates you for who you are. Vet properly, do not forget Rich Cooper's advice and book (Unplugged Alpha, I believe it is called.) I tell my son this all the time and have to protect him as his mom, but it is eventually up to him. Watch out for yourself and build a strong network of friends around whom you can be vulnerable and do not let a woman take advantage of your vulnerability too early. All the best.	1640897786.0	hqlelp0	t3_rrnz6v	t1_hqlcfj8	/r/MensRights/comments/rrnz6v/an_interesting_observation/hqlelp0/

b79qtxrm	Women saw it as a threat because MGTOW, despite their trappings of renouncing woman-kind, were always talking about them. MGTOW warns men that women can often be manipulative. MGTOW inures men to some of the tricks unsavoury women use to manipulate them - that's evidence enough for the empty allegation of "misogyny." The bar *is low, after all*.     Sometimes, on occasion, the talk in those spaces would lead to criticism of female behaviour. Sometimes, some men with axes to grind, usually at the fringe of the movement, would say something objectionable... and that was the cue for everyone and their uncle would grab that, quote it and say: "Behold, all that is MGTOW."     There are some pernicious elements to MGTOW. There are veins of misogyny, but these ridiculous blanket bans and censorship are completely out of touch.	1640898293.0	hqlfvqs	t3_rsa4gx	t1_hql90cl	/r/MensRights/comments/rsa4gx/the_reddits_rmgtow_ban_and_what_it_could_mean_for/hqlfvqs/

cq97j1d8	This leaves out an incredibly large part of IPDV. All the studies conducted unbiasedly and with equal controls and variables for each genders supports the data that women do in fact tend to use very severe partner violence at least at the same frequency of men or greater. It also supported that with out noticable injury women make up the vast majority of physical abusers. The former didn't include slapping, hitting, and other physical striking that doesn't typically cause marked injury. It also supported evidence that women are 6x more likely to use a weapon. In looking at data of which gender kills their partner more, it's almost as even as it can get, there is disproportionately representative data on women though as they are reported by conviction instead of incident reporting. As we know women are also 6x less likely to even be convicted of an identical crime. Psychological and emotional abuse has been conditioned for them to use as casual social interactions, and that is no exaggeration. Mainstream media engages in it daily and endorses it. It's funded and reinforced. It has been so ingrained in society that even recognizing that it's abuse to men has become unthinkable. Where we are starting to move forward is society and women alike and men as well can consistently understand that those same behaviors and ideas are abusive to women. So knowing that and being able to expose the hypocrisy and undue some of the conditioning and be able to hold some form of compassion and emotional space for men would benefit greatly. We've yet to even acknowledge in legislation that men can be raped, or that women can be the rapist. A case has never been prosecuted as such in the history of the United States. In 2020 UK had it's first successful conviction. This isn't a secular idea, this is global. We are finally seeing in the US that a small number of prosecutors have chased those convictions, to which it's always dropped down to a much much lesser conviction bc the supreme court would first have to rule that a woman can rape and we need to define rape in a broader legal term than just unwanted penetration and carnal knowledge of a woman. The definition had changed enough to allow attempts at this, but it isn't enough. We see data that abuse to children is also overwhelmingly women, and sexual abuse as well. To this point this is still something society has opposed even recognizing. We have a very long way to go. Men are being abused at much higher rates than women and the studies are finally being conducted that prove those claims.	1640898381.0	hqlg3um	t3_rritzd	t3_rritzd	/r/MensRights/comments/rritzd/the_difficulty_of_recognizing_domestic_violence/hqlg3um/

Women are permitted to run for any political office they want.    3.  Political representation is about electing a politician who represents your views.  It’s not about whether a politician is the same sex or not.     4.  The feminist lobby is much, much stronger than MRA influence.    5.   We don’t pass laws advantaging men, we pass laws advantaging women, dozens of them.   Recently Congress made the decision to continue discriminating against men in selective service.

a0xsse2g	I've said things very much like that myself. "Did you lock your car when you arrived here?"  The wider question about rape is a lot more complicated than is often imagined. Most reports of rape do not involve someone being kidnapped off the street at knifepoint and held down. Under those circumstances, identifying the attacker via a rape kit and DNA evidence will secure a conviction because there is no reasonable claim that the encounter was consensual.  Most reports of rape are nothing like that. Many of them involve sex that someone thought was consensual, and someone else thought wasn't. So, to respond to the point about "the ones that rape simply don't care about morals," the reality is that they do care about morals and would hate to be thought of as a rapist; it's just that what they were doing seemed OK.  Obviously, *obviously*, that's nothing like good enough, but that's why a lot of these cases are basically impossible to prosecute (the fact that a lot of women withdraw their complaints under the burden of disclosure is another very large reason).  Whether most hardline feminists know any of this is another matter. I'm sure everyone reading this is as horrified by it as I am, but if there's to be any solution it has to come from an acceptance of these facts, rather than from a claim that somehow something must be done without any specific suggestion as to *what* must be done.	1640900106.0	hqlkhki	t3_rs8x81	t3_rs8x81	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqlkhki/

ch81q55l	More men are homeless than women everywhere in the world; I believe in the US, 75% of the homeless population is male. This is a result of the various social safety nets most women have. First, there are many homeless shelters who will only accept women, yet there are no 'male only' homeless shelters. Next, there are many programs and charities which focus solely on female homelessness. Furthermore, society in general will help a woman in risk of homelessness over a man in risk of homelessness. People will donate to a woman, they will open up their homes to a woman; none of that will be done for a man. I myself have helped several female friends who were broke and almost homeless. Had I been in the same position, absolutely no one would've helped me because I'm a man.	1640900288.0	hqlky9k	t3_rscqcm	t3_rscqcm	/r/MensRights/comments/rscqcm/95_of_japans_homeless_is_male/hqlky9k/

Mostly the guy will report meeting a girl, going back to his place, and having sex. The girl will report meeting the guy, going back to his place, and being raped.  That might be true or untrue but it's almost impossible to prove either way, and the key realisation is that you can carry as much pepper spray as you like and it isn't going to help you.	1640900637.0	hqllub4	t3_rs8x81	t1_hql0w2g	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqllub4/

It’s so easy to tell that none of the popular posts (or ones that stay up for longer than a few seconds) aren’t incel beliefs. It’s literally just acknowledging that men have problems.

a0xsse2g	What /u/The_big_A666 is saying is valid. Making a blanket claim that all women (let alone all feminists) operate solely on feelings rather than logic is a generalisation that is not true.  Yes, I have seen people who self-described as feminist behave in that way, and I felt they were a terrible example of women, and a terrible example to other women, but I would never generalise that out to *all women*. That's directly misogynistic and it does not help anyone.	1640900835.0	hqlmccp	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqlhkln	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqlmccp/

i36af5fg	I had a legal case against my crazy ex-wife and I've experienced every possible shitty thing.  It's been going on since years due to serious neglect and endangerment of the children (they'd be dead without me).  All of these things I've been told by officials, judges and people at court:  * If she marries a violent refugee after one month of knowing him and sitting beside him when he threatens to beat the children then she is a victim because she couldn't know that he would also be capable of beating her to a pulp at some point * We do not know how he was able to convince her to marry him so quickly (every excuse is made to not admit that she is unstable) * If I would officially report that she abused me when we were married then I'd get charged because I let the children witness me being abused (I was seriously told this) * If I would have called the police when she abused me I would have gotten arrested because police would never side with a man * If I'd show the video records I made of her abusing me and how out of nothing she turns bat-shit-crazy then I'd get charged because I wasn't allowed to have a camera running when she attacked me * When I reported that she neglected for years the children with proof from teachers and school directors (when we had shared custody) then they asked her if it is true, which she obviously denied. It was noted that I made this up * When I proved that she lies with nearly EVERY statement then the judge dismissed my proof. "she can't believe my employment records" and rather took the anectode of her how she was victim of a husband who refused to work and didn't help with the kids * My report of her neglecting the children is against her kind nature (according to the court psychologist who spoke with her for 2 hours and ignored every single proof I had of her unstable nature) * The court psychologist replied to me that it doesn't matter if the mother lies or not, it won't change the glowing report of how she is the best possible mother (and that I am just after money) * The judge attacked me angrily because I dared to report that I have to pay 100% of medical and school invoices, while having 100% of responsibility. Out of over 20 teacher parent meetings the mother attended 0. The mother was never asked to assist paying the bills. * It was noted that the mother is fully capable of handling school and medical matters, even if I had tons of proof that this wasn't the case and that she never even once did * When I begged child protection services to get involved because I needed someone neutral to be involved in the case and to confirm what I've been reporting with schools, they told me that they would help and that they will get in touch shortly before the court appointment.   Three days earlier they told me that they were wrong and that they are not allowed to get involved in ongoing court cases unless asked by the judge. * The judged started shouting at me at court how I dared trying to get CPS involved in the court case * I was requested to pay afternoon care for a jobless mother so the kids would also do homework at her place when I proofed that the mother in the middle of summer had no idea that her daughter failed class and had to repeat the school year. * I was blamed in not involving the mother enough in school matters. The women is fucking never responible for her own actions. Even if months earlier I brought tons of proof how the mother never ever cooperates or cares about school. The judge said that I "used my children" to get my point across for court and that I should have made a learning plan with the mother.    * Because these fucked up people believe that a narcisstic mother who not even once asked the kids their final exam results or helped them learn would suddenly care. * She doesn't even stand up in the morning or prepare lunch. I have photos how the kids went to school with fully moudly lunch boxes after spending some days with her (she never empties the lunch I prepared) * Nothing a woman ever does has any consequence * I was requested to pay an expensive course so she could learn to have more responsibility with the kids (instead of sending her to therapy and diagnose her personality disorder which could have helped the children) * She still ends up being painted being a woman who only has her children in mind * I had to attend and pay for myself a course where I had to make up her positive sides because I dared to report all the shit she's been doing. A mother who would skip cooking meals and let the kids hungry. She is a fucking bat-shit-crazy narcisst who fucking added her cheating sugar daddy to our daughter's phone so he can chat with her. * She was praised for having a more positive opinion about me. Because I fucking do and pay EVERYTHING for the kids while she goes 6 times a year on 3 week vacations with her sugar daddy. * It was dismissed as unimportant when I showed them proof how I have the kids 70% of the time when it was supposed to be equal. * The mother in the last lesson of fucking parenting course I paid her decided that she doesn't want shared custody any more. She went home, told the kids that they won't be spending as much time with her, sold their toys and clothes and moved to a different city. * Even if she only had the kids a few days during the summer, she dissapeared during one night. The kids locked themselves out of the appartment while searching for her and had to wait for her until 1 am on the building floor. * This had zero consequences for her even if the kids made an official statement for court that this happened * Now during the final court case the judge decided that every second week I HAVE to fucking drive the kids to their mom and pick them up. For no fucking reason at all except me being a man.   I know many divorced women and no one has to drive the kids to the father. * The mother has to pay zero alimony.  I could go on and write a full book about the shit I've experienced.  I fucking hate this fucked up piece of shit world.	1640901066.0	hqlmxk8	t3_rrwpon	t1_hqked7j	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwpon/be_wary_of_those_downplaying_the_crimes_of/hqlmxk8/

e11aibxy	>I don’t think it means much for men’s rights, it’s more that it’s indicative of prevailing biases men’s rights has to face.  This exactly. We know there is social media bias in favor of women but the banning of such a sub isn't really relevant to men's rights.  MGTOW, redpillers and blackpillers don't have (and shouldn't have) anything to do with men's rights.

47rp0gko	You can preach that crime is wrong all you want, and so can I, and we can both think that other people will come and save us if criminals come and start something, but the reality is, when you're walking down the block by yourself and you see someone running at you screaming that they're going to kill you, maybe they're unarmed, maybe they have a weapon, maybe they're on drugs, none of that matters too much, the fact is, if you're in a situation like that, and *all* you have are words and hopes, you're going to die.   It would be nice to live in a world without evil, it would also be nice to live in a world where police were capable of stopping crime as soon as it sprouted up, or in one where saying "swiper no swiping" worked, but we don't. Man or woman, you need to learn how to protect yourself or you will die one day, and it will not matter who was at fault or how you didn't deserve it to happen, because death is permanent.	1640901515.0	hqlo2rm	t3_rs8x81	t1_hql4uoj	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqlo2rm/

Because you can’t just tell evil people to stop being evil and my father, despite having a misogynistic view on women never once told me that forcing a woman is good.   Not once had the conversation with any male, saying that rape is ok.  Have I seen people who have said these things? Yes! Not irl, but in videos. And the comments were 99% insulting towards that guy.   I agree that women/men shouldn’t have to protect themselves. But that’s not the world we live in.

k5qcy8	It is not medically necessary so the decision goes to the patient themself later in life.   From the Canadian Paediatrics Society’s review of the medical literature:  [“It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) And UTIs can easily be treated with antibiotics.  ["The foreskin can become inflamed or infected (posthitis), often in association with the glans (balanoposthitis) in 1% to 4% of uncircumcised boys."](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) This is not common and can easily be treated with antibiotics if it happens.  [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) And condoms must be used regardless. And HIV is not even relevant to a newborn.  [“Decreased penile cancer risk: [Number needed to circumcise] = 900 – 322,000”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision).  ["An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision."](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)  These stats are terrible, it's disingenuous for these to be called legitimate health benefits. And more importantly, all of these items have a different treatment or prevention method that is both more effective and less invasive.  This does not present medical necessity to intervene on someone else's body. Not by a long shot.

cc3iqycu	My big point I make is that the male foreskin is removed to “help prevent HIV/ AIDS transmission along with other STDs”. The clitoral hood is foreskin, why is it not removed? Are women incapable of passing STDs to others? No? So why are we only removing boys foreskin?  You can also bring up the amount of times parents weren’t even asked if they wanted the boys foreskin removed, they just did it. I don’t know it for certain, but that may be in violation of medical ethics and potentially the law since you did something that major without so much as asking.	1640902704.0	hqlr15y	t3_rrwamo	t3_rrwamo	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqlr15y/
z1ts9dt	I'm going to be real with you Chief, a small cut that is done for cleanliness and appearance isn't really on the same level of what many Eastern countries put women under - with them being whole ass adults.  This comes across as men trying to bandwagon onto an argument about.... abortion... using our dicks and would make any woman reading this immediately lose and support they had for men's rights.   It should not be mandatory, but thing is, it isn't - it was a choice your parents made. Circling back to "my body, my choice", the current narrative is that a woman has full rights to do whatever she wants to her baby while still inside of her with some wanting that to extend right up until birth... so the topic of circumcision won't be one we're going to win on until pro-choice arguments die down.  Off topic though, as a gay man, circumcised looks so much fucking better so please don't shame yourself, most sexual partners prefer it and there are benefits to it unlike something along the lines of female circumcision which is done solely as a punishment to prevent them from sexual pleasure.	1640902728.0	hqlr39e	t3_rrwamo	t3_rrwamo	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqlr39e/

Crime and criminals exist and it’s prudent to take measures to protect ourselves such as locking doors, avoiding bad neighborhoods, keeping high theft items hidden or locked away, etc.   This isn’t unique to crime.  We need to take steps to avoid auto accidents, disease and other risks.     It comes as no surprise to me however that feminists think they should magically be exempt from self responsibility.	1640902839.0	hqlrd4h	t3_rs8x81	t3_rs8x81	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqlrd4h/

b79qtxrm	Broad question. Whatever, I'll bite: Child custody laws. Specifically those in the U.S., but also ones in my home country. Set the bar higher for women to get custody, stop presuming absent fathers are emotionally distant tyrants (and might just be at work all day supporting the family!), and stop locking men into alimony/child support slavery that financially cripples them.  There are numerous examples of what I'm referring to, and a cursory search of Canadian papers with keywords like "suicidal estranged father" and "deadbeat dad" will be all that is required to give you the adequate context.  But wait, I'll be generous: Start [here](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/07/01/deadbeat_dad_flees_to_philippines_leaving_four_kids_without_support.html). A vengeful shrew of an ex-wife bound and determined to get the lion's share of the ex-hubby's money to support ...who? Her kids? Most of whom are grown up and capable of supporting themselves? Herself? Sitting on a million-dollar mansion that she could easily flip and sell, or rent out in one of Canada's hottest most expensive seller-friendly markets, with a career in education she can very easily return to, in Ontario's remunerative (read: *overpaid*)  public sector, but chooses not to, so she can play the victim for the media?   Yeah, that's definitely a part of the chip on my shoulder.  Now the second part - good question by the way - I have no idea. How do you take laws that govern things that are subject to so much variation and lay down a set of concrete, yet adaptable principles that will create fair, equitable arrangements between divorced couples and parents?   There are plenty of rich men who ought to be paying their fair share out there. And there are plenty of guys stuck eating ravioli in a basement bachelor apartment because their ex-wife hired a better lawyer.   Let's go with this - make the system fairer. Make the system blind to gender. If someone is in need, provide that need. Courts should stop impoverishing men because their laws are based on precedence from the goddamn fifties.	1640903469.0	hqlsxfx	t3_rsazg7	t1_hqlp7z3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsazg7/question_for_guys_in_this_subreddit/hqlsxfx/

br1ua	1) Men are actually more likely to be the victims of violent crimes. Check the stats.   2) Women don't *have to* do anything. They feel they need to because women, by their nature, feel more anxious and insecure. They feel (and more strongly respond to) more negative emotion. This is biological and has been known for decades. You can search for studies on receptivity to negative emotion by gender and see for yourself. Combine this with hysteria and echo chambers online and they have gotten to the point of insanity with this.

Of course im not saying that women can only become victims and cannot assault anyone. But statics show that female aggression does not lead to phsical violence often. And about the racist comments saying poc are violent because of their race is of course racist, skin color do not make you more or less violent. It's the environment that raised you with ideas that there is good and bad violence which influences (generally) men to be more phsically violent. If we teach men ways to deal with their aggression then the ways to vet men through segration will decrease.	1640904000.0	hqlu9al	t3_qiwi93	t1_hoiw7b6	/r/MensRights/comments/qiwi93/feminism_has_always_been_bad/hqlu9al/

The term "incel" hurled around by feminists and people that want to shame certain men? The blackpillers are them, the rest is just false accusations and mislabeling of political opponents by feminists.  \> That said, if men are being censored for speech that would be allowed for other groups, that seems like a Men's Rights issue to me...  &#x200B;  The solution is to push for banning the radical feminists, not bring back dysfunctional groups that weren't doing anything productive for men's rights causes.  MGTOW, redpillers and blackpillers push a lot of ideas that have been harmful to the men's rights movement, such as the idea that equality isn't possible in "nature" and so it is pointless to fight for men's rights.

b71y0	Much like a dog acts on instinct, rapists generally aren't going "You know, I'm going to make a conscious decision to rape today".  There is a mental issue going on there, and they generally aren't in control of their impulses, same as any violent criminal.  Exceptions of course being psychopaths that calculate and carry out rape/violent crime with premeditation, but most of these crimes don't fall into that category.  You're attempting to infer blame where it isn't being placed.  Nobody is saying the victim is guilty of the crime against them.  We're saying the victim of any crime can do things to lessen the chances of BEING a victim in the first place, and failing that, making life as hard as possible for their assailant.  No different than someone leaving their windows down and their doors unlocked saying "How could this happen" when all their shit is stolen out of their car.  Well, duh, you made yourself a very tempting target.  Don't do that.  Yes, you're still a victim, but as much of your own stupidity as the criminal themselves.  Yes, of course we should be able to live in a world where we don't have to lock our doors, but we don't.  Welcome to reality.  And are not women equal to men?  That was the entire point of feminism.  Feminists want all the equality that is convenient for them but none of the responsibility.  Doesn't work like that (or shouldn't, in a functional society).  Either we're equal, or we are not.  If we're equal, then no woman gets to claim victimhood solely on being "less strong" than a man.  If it's artificial equality due to that, then yes, that's exactly the point men are making when they criticize feminism.  Women do not get to both claim to be the weaker sex, but also claim equality to a man when it's convenient for them.  Pick a side.	1640905580.0	hqly5r4	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqlvd3j	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqly5r4/

In this case, assuming the brigading users came from say, the incel sub, they would look for the closest thing to the incel sub. I'd imagine wanting isolation from women/traditional dating would be the closest thing they could find to hating women. I guess the questions for us would really be which sub is the next exodus going to be to, and how far down the list are we going to be before we have to worry about the problem not being fixed.	1640906155.0	hqlzjsn	t3_rsa4gx	t1_hqlr40u	/r/MensRights/comments/rsa4gx/the_reddits_rmgtow_ban_and_what_it_could_mean_for/hqlzjsn/

My sons will be raised with my values, and won't rape people.  My daughter will be taught that rape is always the rapists fault.  **BUT she will also be taught what high risk situation are and how to avoid those situations.**  Like getting drunk or stoned at a frat party and staying behind after her girlfriends all go home.   Yes, she should be able to stay - safely - at that party. But, statistically, a high number of campus sexual assault cases involve what? Drugs, alchol and parties.   **Risk assessment and risk management is not rape apology.**  But, feminists are dumb.	1640906946.0	hqm1h14	t3_rs8x81	t3_rs8x81	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqm1h14/

103mpe	His point makes no sense.  The “teach people not to rape” is valid. Consent, what sexual consent truly is, was NEVER taught to me. I ignorantly was too forward with women when I was younger.  Only after educating myself and learning about the experiences women have did I understand what consent truly means.  To my knowledge, young people are still not taught about consent. So yes, as a society, we should educate everyone about consent. This benefits men and women both.  As a society, we can teach people not to violate other AND educate people on how to be vigilante and to care for themselves. It doesn’t have to be one or the other, his post presents it as either/or.	1640907083.0	hqm1sxa	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqlvfcn	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqm1sxa/

So, we really need to keep women at home - where they are safe.

8e2o7	Yep, I think it depends on whether you are looking at the world as it is, or as it should be. Should women be able to go wherever they want, dressed however they want, and not be attacked or sexually assaulted? Absolutely, 100%, no human being should have to worry about their physical or sexual safety. Unfortunately we live in a world where bad people exist, and the existence of those bad people means that we do have to worry about our safety and be as smart and prepared as possible.   The most laughable thing they say is that men can somehow walk anywhere they want at anytime of the day without worry, and that's just not true. Men are the majority of public sphere violence, and many men are not capable of fighting off an attacker, even ones that are, if the attacker has a knife or other weapon and you have nothing, the odds are not in your favor. It just goes to show that we still view women as deserving of special protection that men don't get, and in a world without feminism, I'd agree with that sentiment, but in a world where we are holding to the philosophy that we are all the same, none of us are entitled to special protection.	1640907415.0	hqm2ly3	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqm1h14	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqm2ly3/
dx8p5wfi	That 97% includes all forms of "sexual grief" women "endure".  And it includes: being asked out by a low value man or "bad dates" including cold chicken, over-cooked pasta or him lingering for a kiss at her stoop.  Feminists don't realise it, but they are doing everything in their power to water down the severity of what happens when some is raped by conflating all kinds of other things with it including various types of sexual assault (that are bad but not rape) all the way down to "that guys makes me feel uncomfortable".  Feminists love to conflate things because they believe it's necessary to make something as bad as rape seem worse and more common than it actually is, which ironically turns to be a huge disservice to actual rape victims.  Same thing with dismissing the damage that false accusations do. Of course, they revel in a falsely accused man because they are sick, angry sexist people. But, it also harms victims.  People wouldn't say *"Gee... is she just making this all up because of that disagreement they had?"*  if false accusers were as rare as they purport them to be.	1640907438.0	hqm2nzl	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqlh6df	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqm2nzl/

They’ve made it very dangerous to show a woman in a negative light, so men have to play the heels.

cx05s	The problem was as much as the MGTOW movement is a pretty solid movement, like many others, it had its share of really shitty and vocal people.  The Mods must of been using adderall to keep up with the reported posts, because some of them could just absolutely be fucked.  Some guy claiming he deserved a wife.  No that’s not how it works.    So there was lots of ammo to say MGTOW was a bad place filled with bad people which led to this shit.  It was “wrong think” according to Reddit, and a few very vocal folks(trolls and otherwise) ensured it was removed.  Hopefully the fine people here at mensrights will be able to keep our vocal, less elegantly spoken members from burning this one down too.  Men need their spaces too.	1640908494.0	hqm58mc	t3_rsa4gx	t3_rsa4gx	/r/MensRights/comments/rsa4gx/the_reddits_rmgtow_ban_and_what_it_could_mean_for/hqm58mc/

About the wage gap, men and women are not equally productive for companies for 3 reasons:  1) maternity leave  2) retirement age  3) extra hour worked.  And yet, nobody on the media has the common sense to talk about this.

c6dnp	So let me get this straight. I am pro:  - Closing the unfair sentencing gap between men and women for identical crimes. - Default equal custody of children through the court system. - Closing the education gap between boys and girls, from grade school a d up into college level. - Alimony reform, abolishing legal slavery of men. - Overturning the Duluth Model, which unfairly assumes the man is the aggressor in any domestic violence situation.   And these are just the examples listed in the post you're responding to. And apparently, I'm a troll because I don't post in r/MensRights enough and am anti-censorship.   That's fucking wild.	1640908671.0	hqm5o77	t3_rsfong	t1_hqm4zcf	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqm5o77/
47rp0gko	I don't see it as a slippery slope because given isolation to everything else, I don't believe the MRA subs or the MGTOW subs would've ended up going from "let's help men" or "let's go our own way" to "women are evil/sub-human". I believe that if they were to going to do that, given the amount of depressing and/or aggravating accounts told by the people here, it probably would've happened long before now, and yet the sub instead stays grounded in giving men's issues awareness and looks down on demonizing women.  For a mirrored perspective, I would compare to FDS and the feminism subs. It *has* admittedly been a while since I've looked at them, but the last time I checked, the FDS sub was pretty blatant in embracing toxicity against men, that they believe men are useless or worse, harmful unless they provide something to a woman, and yet, despite the fact that the feminist subs don't really have anything stopping them on a fundamental level from agreeing with FDS, since they usually believe in a patriarchy theory that claims a group of men were in some way responsible for women's problems, the feminist subs tended to focus a lot more on what they perceived as women's issues rather than calling men as a whole sub-human and demonizing them.  I do think the thing stopping us from falling down a slippery slope is that each sub's users have a pretty unified understanding of what they believe in, and things that might serve as a catalyst to push the subs further down the slope are policed to uphold the morality. We do that by downvoting, the feminists would rather do that by censure and deletion, but ultimately I think both work for the respective groups. I think where the incel and fds subs fell was that the only policing they wanted to do was based on making sure the other gender had no say at all, and for mgtow in particular I think it ended up with some of the Zerg rush from the sub bans ending up weaseling their way into mod positions. FDS hasn't been banned yet, and I'm not sure if they ever will be, although they've more than earned it based on the context of other bans, I believe if it did, we might see an influx of ex-FDS users swarming feminist subs even if those subs would have condemned them.  I hope that explains my thoughts well enough.	1640908715.0	hqm5rze	t3_rsa4gx	t1_hqm0rly	/r/MensRights/comments/rsa4gx/the_reddits_rmgtow_ban_and_what_it_could_mean_for/hqm5rze/

h394ibm1	>I haven’t seen the movie, but it appears from the adds that these women have some inherent magic.  Does that extend to men, or are only women “magical”?     It extends to men too. 2 males actually, 1 little boy and 1 man who plays a big role.    But the magic in the family doesn't really work that way. Only the descendants of their grandmother get the power.      And while there are men being magical too, the majority of them is women but that's very understandable since the movie is for girls. The bad guy isn't even a guy, it's a woman.

It was explained in the backstory. The grandmother's husband stayed back to fight and protect her and their children but when she saw him being killed, the magical candle pushed them all away and created the magical house.   So only her descendants have powers. And in the movie, we saw them help the village with their powers(The strong one as an example helps lifting heavy things, the other one heals the injured with her sweets...etc)	1640909277.0	hqm75bd	t3_rs8weo	t1_hqm678p	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8weo/i_just_watched_encanto_and_i_think_disneys/hqm75bd/

30ymvhrd	 I’m generally a fan of free speech and oppose censorship.  Free speech has always had some limitations such as slander and inciting violence which are limitations I agree with.     I realize free speech allows feminists to disperse misleading, hateful and misleading propaganda, but they deserve the same free speech protections as anyone.   The problem I see is we are now censoring a lot of ideas simply because they aren’t woke or PC.   I find the idea that woke people deserve to be comfortable and anyone who disagrees with their woke ideology needs to be censored.     I see no problem with free speech.  The problem I see is it’s becoming more and more common to give one side free speech while censoring the other side.	1640909362.0	hqm7cq2	t3_rsfong	t3_rsfong	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqm7cq2/

c6dnp	Wherein lies the issue is that others might disagree, or may not see feminism as an ideology to be fascistic in nature. On the surface, feminism appears to be an egalitarian ideology that seeks equality between men and women. It is the way it is employed that sends up red flags.   Every feminist I know in real life seems to genuinely want equality between the sexes, without any of the more fascistic elements that are commonplace in the larger movement's more vocal constituents.

d3ljx	1. That depends on how you define "bad".  I mean, any breakup that I didn't want was "bad" by at least that measure.  I've had a few of those, but nothing "bad" in terms of like "I broke up with her and she went nuts and tried to stalk me" if that's what you mean. 2. This sounds like two questions, because I'm not sure what the second part has to do with the first.      What is Men's Rights about?  You'll probably get 1,000 different answers from a 1,000 different people, but for me, it's about equality.  Specifically, I would like to see these things changed:    * Fathers are often viewed as secondary to mothers in family law cases   * Women have unilateral control over men's parental rights and responsibilities      * If the mother wants an abortion, there's nothing the father can do to stop it      * If the mother wants to keep the baby, there's nothing the father can do about it, and she can force him to pay child support   * Male victims of domestic abuse have few support resources available to them; men are usually presumed to be the aggressor and women the victim in any domestic disturbance   * Services for homeless men with children is lacking, relative to support for homeless women with children   * Only men must register for the draft    Should we be trying to understand what's at the root of dysfunctional romantic relationships in our societies?  Yes; to the extent that relationships are dysfunctional, root cause analysis would absolutely be beneficial. 3. I absolutely see the many difficulties faced by women around the world as important, and think that the human race still has some work to do in the realm of recognizing everyone's humanity.    --- Having said all that, your questions feel a little bit loaded to me.  The way question 2 is structured comes across to me as presupposing that someone who supports men's rights would, by definition, *not* think it was useful or valuable to try to understand what underlies a dysfunctional relationship.  Likewise, question 3 comes across to me as insinuating that caring about men's issues is mutually exclusive from caring about women's issues.  No one cares about one and only one thing.  It's entirely reasonable, for instance, for a person to care both about suppression of women's rights in countries governed by Islamic law, and the prevalence of male genital mutilation (circumcision) in the United States.  The way your questions are worded, however, it sounds like you are of the belief that it's not worth caring about some things because other things are problems too, in other words, it sounds like whataboutism ("sure this is unfair to men, but what about...").  I may be inaccurately characterizing your intent, but that's how your questions came across to me.	1640910313.0	hqm9me0	t3_rsazg7	t3_rsazg7	/r/MensRights/comments/rsazg7/question_for_guys_in_this_subreddit/hqm9me0/

It's as absurd as pushing for separate black rights instead of ensuring that skin colour or racial characteristics are not included as discriminating factors in legislation or societal practices.  The task of mens rights is to do itself out of a job and steer everything towards egalitarianism.

hr1uztpr	I'm not saying it's not safe, I'm saying you don't know the long term side effects. That's a fact. Why would I care if it's FDA approved? You're French. FDA is american. The swine flu vaccine of 1976 was FDA approved too.  Doesn't mean shit. An anti vaxer is somebody who doesn't believe in vaccines. I have approximately fourteen different vaccines in my body right now, majority have I gotten as an adult by choice. You can't logically call that an anti vaxer. We literally did this 19 comments ago. You realised you had no way of debunking what I'm saying(that there's no studies on long term side effects), so you stopped talking about it and instead went over to contributing with nothing to the conversation. Just skip to that part again. Your memory can't be that bad. And you're replying to me. You're a real needy one, huh? You commented on what I said, I'm just answering. You wanna end the conversation, just write a comment saying "let's end this conversation" and nothing else. I won't reply. But you can't take cheap shots at someone and then put "you just can't stop replying can you" and then use that as a gotcha. If you wanna end the conversation, fine. I get you need the last word, so I'll let you have it. Just comment "let's end this" or something similar. Something neutral, without taking shots and mocking me. I will happily end it. You're the needy one who need the attention apparently. But go ahead.

61t4h0c	*She got vocally angry that because women around the world suffer the horrible atrocities of female circumcision*  &#x200B;  my ex wife has been circumcised as a baby and complained to me about it.  I asked her how far it went ( and confirmed with one of her friends) that it had only been a nick and that it was done in her own country to every woman as a tradition ( I also found out it was also done to the boys). in modern times it done with a laser at the hospital.  so when I pointed out that it was appaling to do that to her and likewise where as she had a nick, the boys had a piece of tissue cut off.  "but it violated me !"  Yes, i agree , but it also violated the boys and you cant use religion( islam) or culture to excuse it..  There are many reasons why i left her, and one of which was the vile behaviour her of telling me that if the local authorities( we were living in the gulf as expats) told her to circumcise our daughter, she would do it.  When I asked why , especially given her own complaint, she told me she was worried that she would lose her very well paid job as an international lawyer, and we would be deported.  So I then told her then that would be good because our daughter's bodily integrity is worth far more than any job and certainly has no price on it..  &#x200B;  My point is that some people can be serious hypocrites about MGM and FGM when it benefits them, such as the "*my body, my choice*" which means "**some bodies are more equal than others**"....	1640911467.0	hqmcd8r	t3_rrwamo	t3_rrwamo	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqmcd8r/

Every sane person knows crimes like rape and murder etc are wrong, it isn't something that "needs taught". There hasn't been a rape in the history of humans because the rapist "forgot rape is wrong". The people who really are evil or messed up enough to commit rape are going to do it regardless, they aren't going to be the type to listen to "don't rape" reasoning.

The thing is we should talk about rights, we should talk about rape, but we've turned from a group of men who should be the real decision makers to something like whining. Because these issues shouldn't be seen as an extension of personal problems, at the root it's the fact that many men don't know how to live life because they've had poor role models.

So getting drunk, walking down back alleys off the beaten track in areas where even the police always go in groups, they should never bear any blame for what happened.     And tbh, they shouldn't be blamed for it, but someone should really ask them what the hell they thought they were doing.	1640913593.0	hqmh8xf	t3_rs8x81	t3_rs8x81	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqmh8xf/

What if u ask me out, take me to dinner and drinks,then i wont put out- are u gonna push that?   What if u want to try anal while we are fucking and i freeze up, not fighting u off but obviously scared as u try? Would u stop?   What if i seem wishy washy about not having sex ("no we cant... we need to stop..." Etc but not screaming and yelling). Are u going to try to get me to put out?   The answer to ALL these, by the vast majority of men, is going to be that they try to get some regardless of what i say, do, or feel. And this is my personal experience with many men over the years, just as it is for almost every other woman.

2coj5wj7	The men's rights movement should have a goal of getting feminism outlawed, just like the civil rights movement got racism outlawed. Outlawing racism didn't change the minds of racists, but it marginalized them so they can't spread their harmful racism throughout society. And that is a good thing. Men's rights activists should want to live in a society where feminism is outlawed.  Men are after all dealing with feminists who are advocating for infanticide of baby boys, and smearing all men as pedophiles. These already count as defamation and incitement towards violence, which are already illegal.  Get out of here with this free-speech concern-trolling nonsense.	1640914454.0	hqmj5vq	t3_rsfong	t3_rsfong	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqmj5vq/

bpsn4a8z	But this logic doesn't consider the reason for the separation. The question is who initiates separations more and why. Is it men or is it women, and why? Because by this logic, if a man doesn't want the responsibility of a child, he can walk away. And that's what we need to prevent for a better society.

5e4v852d	>set a curfew for men at night. An enforced one.  I guess women will have to pick up the night shift then. All those dangerous jobs, necessary maintenance and security work will have to be done by women.  I wonder who will enforce this if men are not allowed outside after dark? Will only female police officers be out patrolling? How will a couple of women overpower and arrest a group of male hoodlums who refuse to abide by the curfew?  And what about rapes and crimes during the day? How do we prevent those?  And considering women now rape men as much as men rape women ([source](https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/)) should women be forced into a curfew as well? Will no one go out at night?  Considering most victims know who their rapists are, is it not an overreaction to institute a curfew? There's far less chance of being kidnapped and raped after dark than there is, say, being molested by a teacher. And women rapists can actually sue for child support if they get pregnant. That's right, a woman teacher can rape a 13 year old boy and get money for carrying the rape baby to term (look at what happened to Nick Olivas and Hermesman Vs Sayer, and the legal precedent it set).  Maybe women shouldn't be eligible for teaching jobs. And we need to enforce this.	1640914823.0	hqmjz8o	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqlwag1	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqmjz8o/

bsxsu2ci	If you truly want my opinion on it, I'm not sure that "fairness" has all that much to do with it. It lacks nuance to judge these things on a scale of "fairness".   The first few examples on that page make a few assumptions, such as implying that, because only a minority percentage of leadership positions are held by women, that it's "unfair". Why do you assume that leadership positions are coveted and desired by all women? For me, I would feel like it is "unfair" to make such an assumption, because I find leadership positions to be extremely restrictive and stressful, in addition to hurting my creativity. Putting me in a leadership position would hurt the organization, or perhaps society more as a whole, because it isn't something to be taken lightly (as you are often in charge of other people's jobs, feelings, emotions, etc).   Why does it matter whether women run countries? Do you think it would be better if they did? As the poster below mentioned, I cannot trust a politician simply because they are the same gender or race as me. If it's "power", you're getting at, leadership positions are quite a narrow way to look at power. Does power only matter to you if it's granted by the state or a company? In general, us women generally have the say over which men you want to reproduce with, if any, and whether you want children or not (and that is quite some power, even if you don't personally care for it). We also get to love, nurture, and help shape the next generation if we so choose to have children -- how is that not power? [While I don't agree with Prohibition, its eventual success is widely attributed to women, as they were the main schoolteachers and they pushed an anti-alcohol agenda](https://prohibition.themobmuseum.org/the-history/the-road-to-prohibition/the-temperance-movement/).   If it's simply power you seek without any regard for morality, then there's always Epstein's route, but doesn't that paradoxically make you an oppressor of young girls/women? Anyway, I'm just going to safely assume that many people would find that a reprehensible route to obtain power.   Is being a billionaire or a millionaire, beyond materialism, really something to be proud of? I would much rather see us eliminate homelessness than have more ridiculously wealthy people.   As far as women in STEM, I can't really comment on that, because I'm a female in a STEM field (nowadays I'm doing a lot of web development, but have also done quite some vulnerability research and exploitation) and honestly, my biggest obstacle doing STEM was a combination of poverty, unstable family life, and the almost dogmatic insistence that you must attend a university to master your field. From what I can tell, a lot of women that I've met seem to genuinely dislike IT/programming, although I admit that I can't rule out that the alienation might lead them to feel disinterested.   Sexually speaking, I would highly suggest a lot of women that want sexual freedom to look into dating a submissive man or consider a female-led relationship/maybe cuckolding. There are a lot of genuinely loving subs who will celebrate your sexual freedom and love you while doing it.   Sadly, demonization of movements like BLM addressed in the post and other social movements is a pervasive issue that I suspect is amplified largely by intelligence agencies (modern continuation of [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)), and I don't think it matters whether a male or female is in charge. Hillary said that someone should drone strike Assange, and it is later revealed that intelligence agencies considered several options for assassinating him, so it's prudent to assume that she works with them. I bet a lot of men and women could agree that covert operations carried out by these agencies are extremely damaging to society.   Perhaps this makes me stereotypical, but perhaps the thing that I look forward to in my life the most is having children, and I'd like the freedom to spend time educating them and raising them. Sure, I have a career, but that's mostly so that I can earn money. Having a career is not something that really makes me happy, but I have to do it to earn money.

I watch very closely if dating someone with kids now. If she wants me to meet them before we’re serious, she is not serious enough about protecting them…pass.  It sucks, bc you’d think not by what I’m writing, but I actually like kids and wouldn’t mind being with someone that has them. I just don’t want to be in an adult relationship with someone who behaves like one, and I can’t stand watching kids get mistreated or having to be the abuse police; I had to do that in my own family.	1640915023.0	hqmkf53	t3_rrwpon	t1_hqlmku0	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwpon/be_wary_of_those_downplaying_the_crimes_of/hqmkf53/

8v1e03nm	The question is not whether you are "for equality" or not. Rather, "what does it mean to be 'for equality'?" The way I see it, even the mildest of feminists, the most reasonable sounding, aren't really "for equality," granted they hold the feminist perspective of equality. This feminist perspective being that women are disadvantaged to men and must be raised to their level. Doing so would make the genders equal. I think that's pretty bullshit. This sub has oodles and oodles of proof that equality is a two-way street and the solution is far more complex than "raising women to men's level." Another feminist perspective is the classic "men oppress women in benefit of men" and all sexism men face are the expectations placed upon them to oppress women. I think that's also bullshit. Giving men shittier vaccines because they are men isn't placing the expectation of oppression on them. It's a fundamentally flawed perspective of equality that is incompatible with egalitarianism, and thus there really is no feminist that is truly for equality because in order to become an advocate for true egalitarianism, they must abandon feminist thinking from their perspective.	1640916658.0	hqmo1w9	t3_rrr9df	t3_rrr9df	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqmo1w9/

8v1e03nm	Yes, most feminists are feminists because they want whatever they think is equality. But what they think is equality, may not actually be equality. You feel me? Say there were two groups. Group A and group B. Group A has 2 laws discriminating against them. Group B has 2 different laws discriminating against them. I'm from Group B, and an avid supporter of Group B rights. From what I know and have experienced, Group B faces all the legal discrimination on the basis of groups. And, tired of being discriminated against, I say I want equality. I'm not lying. I really do. But what does equality mean to me, when I think Group B faces all the discrimination? It means raising group B to the same level as Group A but eradicating all the discrimination that they face. And thus, equality will be achieved, right? I am not being dishonest. From my perspective, this would be equality. But the thing is, my perspective of equality is shortsighted and fundamentally flawed. Removing the 2 laws discriminating against Group B would not result in equality, as there are 2 laws discriminating against Group A. It may have meant equality to me, but it was not equality.  Going further, say the president was of Group A, and made these discriminatory laws. Now, coupling my previous shortsighted view with this information, there's a chance I'd be pissed at Group A as a whole and accuse them of being the cause of my suffering, calling them my oppressor when in reality, they are suffering just as I am. This president, despite being of group A, has no qualms with discriminating against their fellow Group A members if it meant a net gain for them. And yet despite this, I continue to base my perspective of equality on two things  Group B is the only group that suffers discrimination  and Group A oppressed Group B.  So, I ask you this. Knowing Group A actually faces an equal amount of discrimination, do I really want equality?	1640917469.0	hqmpud0	t3_rrr9df	t1_hqle9za	/r/MensRights/comments/rrr9df/usage_of_the_term_feminist_or_feminism_for/hqmpud0/

30ymvhrd	I’ve read several articles confirming your observation but none offer an explanation.    My theory is we see fewer men study abroad for the same reason we see fewer men taking fun, easy classes like art, theater, dance, etc.    Society still expects men to be providers much more so than women.   College prices are going through the roof so males feel more and more they need to focus on coursework that will allow them to earn a good income, pay off their student loan and provide for family, perhaps paying off his wife’s student loans.  Men feel that art classes, theater, expensive study abroad abroad programs, etc simply don’t fit their financial burden.    We of course have more scholarships for women.   Women don’t have the same pressure to be providers so they feel free to participate in courses and study abroad programs knowing it’s likely they won’t have to be the primary provider and that a future husband will help pay off their loans.   Related more women than men support progressive tax spending programs like loan forgiveness, so it’s likely more college women than men feel the rest of us taxpayers will eventually pay their loans for them, so why not enjoy the expense of studying abroad?	1640917860.0	hqmqpfh	t3_rsh1tl	t3_rsh1tl	/r/MensRights/comments/rsh1tl/study_abroad_what_are_your_theories/hqmqpfh/

4148otn2	I understand what you’re saying but I think it’s inaccurate to call the humanities easy — any subject can be easy or hard depending on your proclivities or skill set as a student. I would suck at history, social science, art, or theater, because that’s not my shit — science is. Yeah, science and medicine have more steady employment, but that doesn’t mean they’re inherently more difficult.  Your point about providers is true, but I find it hard to believe that male college students are thinking that far ahead and in that complex a manner.  Lastly, the program I attended had a massive variety of science, mathematics, and computer science classes available, and every single one of my classes was female-dominated. I used those credits for my major. So I don’t agree that the long-term incentive system is a good explanation for this gender disparity.	1640918170.0	hqmre89	t3_rsh1tl	t1_hqmqpfh	/r/MensRights/comments/rsh1tl/study_abroad_what_are_your_theories/hqmre89/

7wmdiqb	Censorship of hate speech that incites violence or hatred of people on the basis of sex, race, religion or sexual preference is already wide spread across social media, mainstream media and other mediums. It's actually a crime in most jurisdictions. So censorship already exists.  Problem is that hate speech that incites violence or hatred of men is not being policed, while even mildly offensive speech directed at other groups is dealt with harshly, particularly when men criticise women or especially feminism.   I note you are defending feminism by using the infamous feminist troll method of sequesting feminist hate speech and violence away from open discussion and vigilence, and trying to convince everyone here that we should only see the glossy side of feminist propaganda, the glossy advertisement that says feminism is for everyone, even though the door to feminist empathy and acceptence is clear signed "no men allowed".  Even you are nothing more than a feminist ally, because real-life feminism, the feminism taught in our schools and colleges, the feminism that denies men services when they are in need, the feminism that demands men check their privilege like some kind of branding on their foreheads saying "shame on me, I'm male", this feminism totally refutes the idea that men can be feminists.

2wiog7vi	The only song that resonated with me was Dos Oruguitas.  And that was over too early for me to get something real from it.  Comparing that to Let It Go just leaves me depressed.  My point was that there was no point in pretty much anyone having super powers.  They could have told exactly the same story with only one person having powers(seeing the future) and not only would it have been cooler it would have made things more understandable.  What purpose did everyone else's powers serve in the story?   They almost never used them for anything.  It's like they only included super powers because that is the most powerful force in media nowadays.  The songs weren't bad but the accompanying animations were.  I actually thought that Mirabel's secret power was super speed because for some reason they made that part of her song.  And most of the rest of the songs had backdrops that were not related to anything in reality. They were about how people felt instead but this wasn't really explained and felt very jarring.  By totally abandoning the scene or even reality they cheapened the songs.   But even so, I didn't really like any of the songs.  They weren't clever, they didn't sound good and the whole rapping speaking thing is really played out.  And I didn't really like any of the characters.  They didn't really seem like people, more like caricatures of people in a family.  There were too many of them and I never got a chance to really connect with them or develop feeling for them. This is especially bad in a movie about solving interpersonal problems in a family.    Lastly, Tangled was good but it wasn't as good as even The Princess and the Frog not to mention the Renaissance movies.   Moana looked very good and the songs were better than Encanto(except for the one sung by the crab, that sucked) but it still can't hold a candle to the renaissance movies.  And this is from someone who only saw the renaissance movies as an adult so I don't have rose colored glasses on.	1640918857.0	hqmsw1k	t3_rs8weo	t1_hqm75bd	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8weo/i_just_watched_encanto_and_i_think_disneys/hqmsw1k/

42bgh	(contd.) *"The residual gender gap in access to primary healthcare, as displayed by Figure 1, is probably due in the main to men’s working patterns, and the resulting difficulties of access to healthcare and community health programmes during the working day.*   *There is a willingness to attribute men’s indisputable health disadvantages to men’s lesser use of healthcare services, and to attribute this to men’s negative masculine characteristics. However, this hypothesis crumbles upon inspection. Not only is men’s reduced access to healthcare not as marked as is often supposed, but the part of this reduced access which is not explained by valid sex differences in need may be explicable by working patterns. Whilst it might be argued that men’s working patterns are an individual choice, it would be disingenuous not to concede a societal – and practical – obligation which acts in this respect.*   *Finally, there are clear instances of poorer service provision for men, specifically in respect of less use of national screening programmes and the withholding of the HPV vaccination programme from boys. There are signs here that male health disadvantage is more due to society-wide acceptance of such disadvantage than it is to destructive masculine traits. Adopting a stance that traditional male gender norms are responsible (“it’s men’s own fault”) may be a subconscious means of denying the implied empathy gap."*	1640920678.0	hqmwr4p	t3_rsk1ls	t3_rsk1ls	/r/MensRights/comments/rsk1ls/mens_access_to_healthcare_the_literature_suggests/hqmwr4p/

We keep getting these centrist types who keep telling people not to speak up and fight back against the censorship because it *"makes them just as bad as the feminists/SJWs".* It's amazing on how centrists always fail to grasp that the side influencing the censoring are the aggressors and that being a centrist is aiding the aggressors.	1640921982.0	hqmzihx	t3_rsfong	t3_rsfong	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqmzihx/

i0x2rme5	Ah see that’s where we disagree 🤣🤣🤣 roles play a big part in human existence! One reason I can give is that majority of men don’t desire women who are masculine and most women don’t desire feminine men  🤷‍♂️ also to add to u saying “men and women can benefit from being macho and reserving emotions” reserving emotions is never a good idea however, expressing it in a controlled environment as a man is (Don’t know about women 🤣🤣). Also the macho thing for women is not good, I would like to refer to the second sentence as proof as to why a woman being macho/masculine is not good!	1640924480.0	hqn4myr	t3_rqu9n9	t1_hqmtlqd	/r/MensRights/comments/rqu9n9/do_feminist_believe_that_they_didnt_create_the/hqn4myr/
5e4v852d	Those women are not looking for good partners.  They are a core group of lonely, miserable, bitter women who cannot find a partner. To stop feeling sorry for themselves they simply upped their standards and got together to validate each others' feelings about not being able to attract a decent partner.  They are rejecting men and then celebrating these as if these men are beneath them. And there are no success stories! Why don't they have a string of successful posts? Because the mods and originators of the group don't want other women to have happy, healthy relationships. They are the epitome of sour grapes. Many of them are overweight, have mental health issues and are not pleasant to be around.  Why would any high value man want to bother with them? They act as if they have no trouble attracting decent men and acting like entitled bitches would make a tall, wealthy, handsome man want to jump at the opportunity of dating them. They shame men for desiring younger women because they cannot handle the reality that they have basically been left behind.  They want to go back to the days when dating was easy and men chased them. Then when all the good men got married they could not accept that all they could attract were losers. Instead of working on themselves and becoming someone a good man would want, they double down on the entitlement.  No different to the fatlogic, healthy at every size folks. They just don't want to take accountability for their poor choices and poor health.	1640924487.0	hqn4nje	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqm6703	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqn4nje/

gr4alcz6	Good point, I agree with commenter below too. I understand these opinions potentially offend half the female population being single mothers, but if you're a single mom, or parent regardless of sex, you should not be given just as much consideration in the dating pool as someone who doesn't have kids. I know this mainly applies to women because men are rarely given custody, but the arrogance of demanding the same things from the dating pool once you are a single parent cannot exist, and it's simply because it doesn't. If I am a thirty year old man with no kids, you cannot try to make me feel bad for not overlooking the fact that the single mom already made the decision to have kids.	1640925885.0	hqn7dkv	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqmyk18	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqn7dkv/

7g7eozqb	Umm, sorry to break it to you but the majority of FGM is done by the nicking of the clitoral hood, the skin that covers the clitoris. The clitoral hood is analogous to the foreskin as both serve the same purpose. The removal of clitoris is an absolute minority of FGM.  As for "cleanliness and hygiene", just shut the F up. That's like saying we should completely remove our nail beds because then we don't have to trim them every few days. Basic hygiene and basic daily cleaning will prevent any "hygiene issues" associated with uncircumcised penises.  As for the disease argument, tell me, how do you react if I suggest "newborn baby girls should get their breast tissue hacked off because 1 in 4 women will get breast cancer". Does that sound logical to you? If no, you're a fucking hypocrite.  Finally, you say "people prefer it". Just shut the fuck up. Grown ass (American) women preferring it doesn't mean you'll mutilate and deprave a newborn fucking baby of his genitals.	1640926248.0	hqn82ue	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqlr39e	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqn82ue/

14t0a5	Women have been taking 100% responsibility for rape or the risk of getting raped for many many years. Is it too much to ask to change the spotlight to men, at least 50%? I have never been raped but I have been taught for years to always be safe. Don't take walks after dark, don't wear a short skirt, don't drink too much, keep an eye of your drink, take grabbing your ass as a compliment, have pepperspray in your purse, don't take the bus after midnight etc. Why? Because if a women have been raped she get asked "what were you wearing? Were you drunk?" by the court or society. This has thankfully changed a bit in the last years, but when I was 18 i knew that if I would get raped I would blame myself for it for wearing the wrong clothes or maybe drink too much. How fucked up is that?   So why not start educating men on how to be a part of the solution? Maybe tell your friend to stop grabbing someones ass? Maybe tell your friend to not call a women a whore or joke about rape? Maybe tell your friend to leave a woman alone if she says no? And maybe try to understand the problem even if you are the kindest man on earth.  I have been surrounded by fantastic men all my life and I care about mens right in society as well (custody for children etc) and I know that I probably wouldn't get raped if I took a walk in the dark, but I am too afraid to take the risk. I drove past a man last week who were jogging almost at midnight and got jelaous, because it's to risky for me. A woman gets murdered every third week by a man. 80-90% of women have been sexually harassed in some way in the country I live in. I can say at least 10-15 things I have experienced, and I was not a party chick or a risk taker. it's a bigger problem in the structure of society. I know most men would not rape, but I also know that some men have "friends" that crosses a line with women, and never gets called out on it. "That's on him", yeah, but maybe you can say that it is not okay? What if we all just helped each other out? I think there is a reason for why my three brothers gave me a ride eveywhere anytime without me asking, because they know how their "friends" talk and behave around women and will protect their little sister. Men are aware of the problem, but we need your help to be part of the solution.	1640926477.0	hqn8ik0	t3_rs8x81	t3_rs8x81	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqn8ik0/

30ymvhrd	He had a contract with the college.   To break that contract, the school needs just cause.   He’s essentially arguing the college is denying him what is due him without adequate proof they have cause to break that contract.  Also by claiming he committed an act he may not have, the college is negatively impacting his future opportunities.     If colleges are going to conclude students committed a sexual assault and sanction students, they should have proof these claims are true including offering the accused proper due process which colleges often do not.     More and more colleges are being successfully sued for denying due process to accused students.     You seem to have the burden of proof reversed.   The accused doesn’t have to prove the accusations against him are false.  It’s the burden of the “prosecution” (college) to prove the accused is guilty.  If they don’t offer due process they fail to meet this burden.	1640927442.0	hqnabvi	t3_rrinux	t1_hqhz1pn	/r/MensRights/comments/rrinux/former_usf_football_player_sues_university_after/hqnabvi/

6ap1t	Unless there's more background to indicate this was antagonistic, nothing seems wrong to me with either of these statements.  Assume a 50/50 split custody, "see your kid" is a fine way to ask (also "have your kid", though that implies ownership and probably not a term I'd use with an older kid).  I wouldn't have read that as an attack unless there were other prior comments.  But then, "How about you?" seems like a totally fair reciprocal question, unless she didn't have kids.  Feels like you're just looking to be upset, and maybe she could smell that?	1640927755.0	hqnawab	t3_rshwlv	t3_rshwlv	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqnawab/

What my heart tells me to do is so different then what my head tells me to do. And what is most pathetic and unfortunate about all of it is despite women coming and going, I ultimately choose loneliness over the potential to become so many of these men, and yes sometimes women who get burned so badly in the end.	1640927996.0	hqnbbyo	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqn9qgt	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqnbbyo/

Starts calling it assault because her sorority sisters are slut shaming her and other friends are trying to make it 'not her fault'. "You were drunk and he assaulted you"  (no bitch, you were *both* drunk, and you fucked, YOU got yourself drunk")  6- I straight up tell Jane that I will testify against her if she elevates it (I don't even know Chad's real name).   7- Jane and Jane's roommate both get mad at me that I'm 'not being supportive'.   *Fuck you.*	1640928253.0	hqnbso2	t3_rs6cze	t3_rs6cze	/r/MensRights/comments/rs6cze/she_claimed_he_sexually_assaulted_her_months/hqnbso2/

Criticizing a practice done to one-third of babies worldwide, *including* Jewish babies, is not anti-Semitism in the slightest.  I don't know why you think Jews in particular need to be coddled, but the vast majority of the anti-circumcision movement does not discriminate against Jews.  They want to outlaw circumcision *irrespective* of religion, race, or ethnicity.  You know, because of that pesky notion that all human beings deserve equal rights, which you seem to disagree with.

But none of them have anything to do with "fierce individuals that act on their own merits and should be harshly punished and judged for deviating from social expectations." The parent I  take the last name of doesn't have anything to do with this at all.  >and the reality that we live in a society that’s been established, run by, and governed by men for a millennia exists.  Just because it was a patriarchy then doesn't make it a patriarchy now. It's a democratic society, not a patriarchal one.  The "patriarchy" isn't a sentient being that sees me as a rapist monkey because I'm a brown man. People do. More specifically, racist and sexist people do.

5nwqhfks	Well, according to statistics, 60% of modern marriages end in divorce and 70-80% of divorces (depending on the local sub-community) are initiated by women, so it’s a reasonable and statistically supported assumption to make. But it sure is fun to subvert expectations.   The thing I really hate about that is they act as if when the marriage breaks up, it’s always the man’s fault. It’s ‘what did YOU do’ not ‘what happened’ or ‘what went wrong’, it’s blaming the guy. Assuming that the woman did the divorcing is generally reasonable, but assuming she was doing it for the right reasons and that she was justified, that I have a problem with.	1640929302.0	hqndnev	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqmxpq3	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqndnev/
1eknb9c2	It's a non-factor? Well that's not always true.  I was obliged to sign up for Selective Service in 1980, the year it was reinstated, and I did. 30 years later in 2010 I applied for a job with the IRS. Several hundred people took the written test and I was among those invited back for an interview. I scored highly enough to be given a job offer, contingent on showing proof I had indeed signed up in 1980. I was told that the records are online now, since the early 2000s, and they went back a few years prior to that and put those records online as well, but only back to the mid 90s. I had to file a request for someone to go to to the written archives to get my proof I needed. Someone did, but since the records were kept off-site, a couple of days passed before I got the results. In the meantime, all the positions were filled, all by women, none of whom had the same requirement that I did.  I was denied a job because of my gender and the Selective Service Act. Yes, there are negative consequences for men.	1640929385.0	hqndski	t3_rrx59a	t1_hqm0xy1	/r/MensRights/comments/rrx59a/is_this_true/hqndski/

103mpe	I care a lot about people reading things that are true. When things are willfully misrepresented or grossly exaggerated, I feel compelled to speak up.  Selective Service is stupid, no one should have to sign up for it. Or everyone should. The infantilization of women by our government is sexist, and men are forced to make up the difference. It hurts men and women.  But, to pretend that selective service is an atrocity against men, is ridiculous. The fact is,  a draft hasn’t existed since 1973. Not a single man has been forced into service in 48 yrs. While the tools may exist for conscription, in practice it’s extinct.  I think we have more legitimate issues to address.	1640931185.0	hqngunm	t3_rrx59a	t1_hqnfpz5	/r/MensRights/comments/rrx59a/is_this_true/hqngunm/

(Apart from 99% of western and asian countries which have gender-biased laws against men only. If I list those countries, you wont be able to find even one law that outmatches my claim)....

4uj85tsl	Hey man, here are the nine rules of the red pill. One of the most influential books in my life has been The Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi. It’s a book I wish every man could read, and I wish I read it when I was a young man. It’s certainly not the only influential book of course — we must always be wary of those who only have one book. But it captures many basic truths that most men today are in complete denial about. The most the most critical points the book conveys are the “Iron Rules of Tomassi” — nine rules men everywhere should take to heart regardless of if they are single or in a relationship. Below are the rules in their entirety — read them well. Go and buy the book. Take the red pill and become the best version of yourself: Iron Rule of Tomassi #1 Frame is everything. Always be aware of the subconscious balance of whose frame in which you are operating. Always control the Frame, but resist giving the impression that you are. Iron Rule of Tomassi # 2 NEVER, under pain of death, honestly or dishonestly reveal the number of women you’ve slept with or explain any detail of your sexual experiences with them to a current lover. Iron Rule of Tomassi #3 Any woman who makes you wait for sex, or by her actions implies she is making you wait for sex; the sex is NEVER worth the wait. Iron Rule of Tomassi #4 NEVER under any circumstance live with a woman you aren’t married to or are not planning to marry in within 6 months. Iron Rule of Tomassi #5 NEVER allow a woman to be in control of the birth. Iron Rule of Tomassi #6 Women are utterly incapable of loving a man in the way that a man expects to be loved. In its simplicity this speaks volumes about the condition of Men. It accurately expresses a pervasive nihilism that Men must either confront and accept, or be driven insane in denial for the rest of their lives when they fail to come to terms with the disillusionment. Women are incapable of loving men in a way that a man idealizes is possible, in a way he thinks she should be capable of. Iron Rule of Tomassi #7 It is always time and effort better spent developing new, fresh, prospective women than it will ever be in attempting to reconstruct a failed relationship. Never root through the trash once the garbage has been dragged to the curb. You get messy, your neighbors see you do it, and what you thought was worth digging for is never as valuable as you thought it was. Iron Rule of Tomassi #8 Always let a woman figure out why she wont ƒuck you, never do it for her. An integral part of maintaining the feminine imperative as the societal imperative involves keeping women as the primary sexual selectors. As I’ve detailed in many prior comments and posts, this means that a woman’s sexual strategy necessitates that she be in as optimized a condition as her capacity (attractiveness) allows for her to choose from the best males available to satisfy that strategy. Iron Rule of Tomassi #9 Never Self-Deprecate under any circumstance. This is a Kiss of Death that you self-initiate and is the antithesis of the Prize Mentality. Once you’ve accepted yourself and presented yourself as a “complete douche” there’s no going back to confidence with a woman. Never appeal to a woman’s sympathies. Her sympathies are given by her own volition, never when they are begged for — women despise the obligation of sympathy. Nothing kills arousal like pity. Even if you don’t seriously consider yourself pathetic, it never serves your best interest to paint yourself as pathetic. Self-Depreciation is a misguided tool for the AFC, and not something that would even occur to an Alpha. In romance, insight is the foundation of risk management…	1640934186.0	hqnlise	t3_rrnz6v	t1_hqlcfj8	/r/MensRights/comments/rrnz6v/an_interesting_observation/hqnlise/

The fact that men are more likely to be homeless. The fact that men have no way to opt out of an accidental pregnancy.

And it's not just about freedom of speech and individual rights, but also it's not fulfilling it's intended goal. Whatever you censor, you wont make it disappear, it will go "underground" and you'll lose control. Censorship leads to bubbles and closed minded thinking.

99josor0	>Imagine if a white person said "white people shouldn't have to learn how to defend themselves and stay out of dangerous areas, we just need to teach black people not to murder!" I'd be laughed out of town.  In all fairness, white people murder too. It's just that black people engage in violence more, that ends up in loss of life. It's not necessarily about the murder itself. But you could easily use their monopoly on drugs to portray same point.  >How do they not know that rape is something completely abhorrent to most men, and the ones that rape simply do not care about morals or anything like that?  They watch too much rough porn. One of the major websites released some numbers and it turns out guys tend to search for vanilla stuff, such as: big butt, big boobs, milf, petite blonde, etc. It's the women who go all 50 Shades of Grey and search for the most fucked up and degenerate things you can imagine. Such as: rape, choking, forced sex, slave sex, etc. They search up these stupid things and assume we're all like that, because we all know how women generalize us and that all their talking points are massive projections. These stupid hoes don't even know how to have sex. They think that just standing there and taking it is enough for a guy. I bet you not one of them has ever considered the fact that we might like being kissed on the neck or the chest and feeling her heavy breath. They are BAD in bed. They expect us to be robots with no desires of our own besides the oral and the penetrarion.

Nobody is saying they are equivalent in terms of severity, but what I am saying is:  Those that are going to commit crime know they shouldn't be doing it, the implication that men are ignorant beasts that just haven't been educated about rape being wrong is incredibly sexist and ignorant. The implication that we somehow have a society that encourages rape, and therefore men feel like they have societies blessing to do it is just stupid.

7o73xhl8	I ll give you the hitler (Nazi) analogy...  Nazism believed that jews were responsible for all the ills of Germany and blamed their defeat in WW1 on Jews...    Not all Nazis hated Jews, but enough of them did.       While there were so called 'moderate' Nazis, but they did nothing to oppose the more hateful Nazis.     Even when Nazis started passing anti-Jew laws, taxing them disproportionately and eventually started putting them in concentration camps and torturing them...  This ultimately led to a refugee crisis, and spilled onto other neighboring nations triggering animosity and eventually WW2.     NOW replace 'Nazism' with 'feminism', 'Nazis' with 'feminists' and 'Jews' with 'men'/'patriarchy'.  Feminism believes that all men were oppressors and all women were oppressed in past.     'Men' are to be blamed for all ills in our present society, even ills done to other men.     Feminists pass anti-male gender biased laws, repeatedly in USA and other countries too.      The so called 'moderate feminists' are either silent or actually support the radical feminists, while censoring or demonizing mens rights group to try to raise a voice.     They haven't gone the violent route yet, but there are feminists who have called upon to 'kill on men', 'men-only curfew', selective abortion of male fetuses and  even 'concentration camps' for men.     So, we are getting to the climax for fascism sooner or later.   >>On the surface, feminism appears to be an egalitarian ideology that seeks equality between men and women.  NO ITS ISN'T..     Feminism is as close to egalitarianism as a football is close to a living organism..    Feminism only fights for 'more power' for women. They do not and will not care for mens rights.. They actively lobby for and pass anti-male biased laws. And have been doing since 100+ years.  (I can give you dozens of examples of how they lobbied against gender neutral laws across the world-over... If you stick around)  In fact, feminists do not even act in the best interests if women at times.      Its a political movement, with the only aim to increase and maintains its political abd financial power..  Nothing to do with gender equality.  Feminism was founded on the core principle that 'men are oppressors and women are oppressed.      It cannot and will not accept the fact that men can be victims of female aggression..       In such situations, they either deny, try to downplay the event, or try to victim blame men (toxic masculinity) or blame other men (patriarchy).    You can see this scenario play out over and over gain in cases of F to M rape, paternity fraud, F on M domestic violence, false allegations, etc.    Gender equality cannot be achieved if you start with a flawed notion to begin with.    I dont believe in wikipedia (or any other dictionary) definition. Actions speak louder than words..    And the actions of feminism clearly show that they are biased against men.     (I am not talking about random internet strangers. I am talking about the actions of  national and international taxpayer funded feminist organizations. )	1640939848.0	hqnt9ie	t3_rsfong	t1_hqm8hrl	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqnt9ie/

9ryk8	We tell men not to murder all the time, indeed its wholly reviled in society, and yet it still happens.  Do we have a persistent murder culture.  No.  The problem here is that rapists are, for the most part, socio or psychopaths, and you can put all the laws in place and tell them all the things you think necessary, but its still gonna happen.  Much like murder. we have all the controls and consequences in place, and yet it happens.  Short of a constant surveillence police state you won't get rid of rape.  The feminist mantra of 'just tell men not to rape' ignores the fact that we already do, and the issue of it happens goes far deeper than simple social pressure	1640945161.0	hqnzv26	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqn8ik0	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqnzv26/

a0xsse2g	Let's be clear: Everyone bears the responsibility of protecting everyone, including themselves, to whatever extent is reasonable. I honestly don't think there's really a lot of disagreement here, there's just a lot of entrenched positions which aren't making this any easier to discuss.  The basic position here is that in an ideal world, there would be no risk to people in the workplace, no risk to anyone walking home alone at night, nobody would ever be attacked or slice a finger off in a workshop.  Unfortunately all those things *are* risks. We don't have to like it. I don't like it. You don't like it. Nobody *likes* the fact that there are risks in life and most of us are happy to do what we can to minimise those risks. But to criticise people for "victim blaming" whenever they suggest taking basic safety precautions is madness.  Suggesting people wear safety boots is not in any sense an attempt to blame them for having heavy stuff dropped on their feet, nor is it supporting that happening.  Can we at least agree on that?	1640945179.0	hqnzvvf	t3_rs8x81	t1_hql8rnk	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqnzvvf/
2w2o24ed	There is no court order currently but there was and I'm not interested in testing my luck a 2nd time. We're not technically married but considered Common Law here. She's written an offer to purchase which I've accepted and I'm financing the property for her until our youngest is 18 so the paperwork isn't complete but well on its way.  My goals are difficult to attain as I work away from home up to 100 hours per week on an on call basis. I do what I do so my family can have the best life possible... Our Seperation Agreement we sent off to the lawyer which we co authored stated I had care control of the kids Sunday after supper until Friday after school and she got the weekends so she could work. My mother will be living with me and will watch them when I'm working during the week if it happens because I commonly work Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Mondays.   My goal is simply to make sure that the kids have a stable life during the school week. They complete their homework and have 3 healthy square meals a day and get out and do stuff. They can have a ton of junk and play on tablets with her on the weekends.  I'm not sure what she's going to try and change in the Seperation Agreement but it's weird because everything just went to complete shit over night as things seemed to be improving in my view 🤷  Side note: she suffers from "mild" depression and has a history of sexual abuse in her younger years and refuses to seek counselling and or advice.	1640945240.0	hqnzyfu	t3_rsp8h5	t1_hqnz1if	/r/MensRights/comments/rsp8h5/relationship_fell_apart_how_do_i_help_the_kids/hqnzyfu/

e5j1koem	From my experience in dating, if you ask what happened the man will always blame the woman instead of taking responsibility. 20/20 will say it's the woman's fault no matter who broke it off. Even if it's not marriage, just break up, if you ask what happened it's her fault no matter what. And when I asked one time 'and what did you do wrong' because I wanted to see some introspection and was fed up always hearing that all women are evil, the guy got upset. He started telling me that when women are raped you're not supposed to ask them what they were wearing so How Dare I ask what he might have done wrong when he was the victim and I found it very off-putting somehow.   I think it's not a red flag to ask what did you do wrong, I think it's just very poorly worded. I try to ask what they learned from their past relationships and tell about what I try to work on / improve.	1640945719.0	hqo0jd5	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqndnev	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqo0jd5/

e5j1koem	I just wanted to say it might have a lot of different reasons why she unmatched and not what people say here in the comments. Maybe she doesn't see hers often and got sad. Maybe she was chatting with somebody else and lost interest. Maybe she had bad experiences with the exes of her exes and didn't want to get into family Drama again. Maybe she thought it's going to be even more difficult with her having children and you having children because again maybe she had a bad experience. It is very difficult to make a patchwork family work maybe she was not mentally ready for the headache. Maybe she experienced that children might not get along with each other and decided to prefer to stay single for now. The fact that men assume that it's only about their resources makes me irrationally angry as a child who grew up in a difficult family constellation. The guy might then defend their child and the woman try to defend hers and they might have different parenting styles... maybe she saw how difficult it would be and the likeliness of it working was low and it was not worth it for her. The worst thing about this is that men do this all the time. I hear too often of men who don't date women with children. But when women do it it's outrageous. Maybe it wasn't even that, maybe something else came up like...	1640946871.0	hqo1xge	t3_rshwlv	t3_rshwlv	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqo1xge/

Bleeding post-circumcision usually needs exploration under anesthetic." pg 880-881 Oxford Handbook of Pediatrics 2nd ed 2013   [in infants or children, the foreskin is generally fused to the glans, keeping the area sanitary. Most males become retractable by 10 1/2 years old. Some are older; and that is fine too.

a0xsse2g	Not sure why you've been downvoted. This is largely true.  If you want to get into the details, there is perhaps very slightly more to it than that. The issue is that when people say "rape" they often think of someone being grabbed off the street at knifepoint, which obviously does happen and is hideous, but that doesn't describe the vast majority of reports.  What usually happens is that both parties agree they had sex; he thought it was consensual, she disagrees.  Obviously that's a can of worms in a million ways, but it would probably be nice if there was greater awareness of that reality among both men and women. It would probably reduce the risk for everyone and make for better public policy decisions.   That said, the phrase "teach men not to rape" is as offensive as, say, "teach black people not to deal drugs." I would never say either of those things and I don't think anyone should.	1640949287.0	hqo4y30	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqm3qax	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqo4y30/
hy1v32qe	teach not to rape isn’t just saying ‘hey rape is bad okay?’, it’s about explaining consent, lack there of, and the different degrees & variants of sexual assault.

cnkcc4iz	1. No, not particularly bad.  2. Mens rights?  Equality under law.  Relationship degradation of the sexes?  I feel like I know the driving forces, but no one will listen.  3. Depends on the difficulties you refer to.  I sympathize with suffering people, but sometimes you gotta man up and carry your load.  Sometimes it’s just a shit-pie, and everyone gets a slice.  Men shouldn’t be the only ones a society force-feeds difficulty to.    In summary: Womens issues are mens issues, mens issues are womens issues. We’re one species, don’t get it twisted.	1640950416.0	hqo6dif	t3_rsazg7	t3_rsazg7	/r/MensRights/comments/rsazg7/question_for_guys_in_this_subreddit/hqo6dif/
f153moet	The 'hygiene ' arguments are absurd. All mammals throughout history in all climates have foreskin,  aside from the duck billed platypus and the echidna.  Strangely,  they all manage to live their whole lives without 'needing ' to be circumcised.  And they don't even have hands!  In circumcised cultures only humans are targeted for cutting, not other mammals.  Goats, for example, I've in jungles, deserts, mountains and moors. They don't suffer from the mysterious foreskin maladies of the American male human.	1640950559.0	hqo6jw0	t3_rrwamo	t3_rrwamo	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqo6jw0/

gr4alcz6	Why do we feel that women are more valuable than men thus leading to a higher disposability? I understand their ability to have kids but is there anything more to that? In the modern day, when did that word disposability start being used to describe the sexes? Empathy gap in a way starts with men putting on a show to try and show off to other women lol. I don't speak to either sex any different from one another. I don't even flirt with women anymore lol (and so I don't have to deal with some annoying dude saying to take my sexless tears somewhere else), I'm an attractive guy who has slept with a lot of women. But through all unnecessary back and forth between men and women and what I've experienced seen and heard, the overkill of it all with making dating complicated, etc., I lost interest. Them always asking how I don't have any kids and I'm not married by 30.

99josor0	If the boys tend to be aggressive, it's likely because their idiot mom doesn't show compassionate behavior and is probably traumatizing them (and most likely because you're also being alienated in some way, or degraded in their eyes, in some way, by their mom). That could explain the lack of self control that the darlings exhibit, whether it's the night time accidents or their odd behavior. I am sorry that you and your boys are going through this. I can't give you legal advice, but a lawyer can. But I believe it would be best if you could get custody of the kids and cut contract with her as much as possible.   >Sooooo separated back in September after an argument and a gross over exaggeration of what went down.

46a6opwn	Teach men not to rape? But which definition of rape would we teach them not to do when rape covers such a broad spectrum now of whatever results in a woman feeling uncomfortable?  How do you teach a man not to look at a woman or touch a woman in a way that she subjectively feels uncomfortable with at that instant in time? Men can't read minds in advance, but perhaps you can teach that too.  If the only difference between sex and rape is a woman's state of mind at the time about what is happening, how on earth can one practically teach a man in advance that what he is doing at that precise instant, is wrong, from the subjective viewpoint of another person?  To provide coverage for the man, he basically can not do anything near a woman to have a chance of her not feeling uncomfortable about something and even then she is likely to feel uncomfortable with being ignored, so perhaps we need to add that to the ever expanding list of definitions of what constitutes rape in the mind of a woman.

However, what I have gathered is a common tone for women is:  I’ve been thru some shit, I need a man to put up with that, support financially kids that aren’t his blood.  Why ? - just to reward a chick who perhaps should have investigated or asked deeper questions before hopping into bed with dudes without protection?

7xtu3	Feminists claim that Women earn 63 Cents for every 1 Dollar that a Man earns, doing the same job. This claim comes from a study which was done in the 1960s (im not kidding, 6 Decades ago), which said: If you take all the money that an average Man earns over the course of his life, and all the money that an Average Woman earns over the course of Her life, then it works out that the Man has earned more. This is quantified as "63c/$"  Why is it a Myth? Well, firstly, 12 hours after this comment goes up it will be the year 2022. Not 1960. Its also literally against the law to pay Women less than Men. You also have the common sense question: If you could legally pay Women less, would you not just hire all Women and save money? But more importantly than all that, the study itself was completely flawed and biased. The study said "We see that Men earn more than Women over the course of a lifetime, AND THAT MUST BE BECAUSE WOMEN ARE OPPRESSED. There simply cannot be any other reason for this."   Allow me to offer some reasonable alternative reasons as to why Women could potentially earn less: Men retire 4 years longer than Women. Women take 12 Months Maternity, Men 3 months Paternity. Women tend to work less hours a week at their job than Men. Women tend to go into lower-paying jobs than Men. Just off the top of my head, there are 4 reasonable explanations which COULD be a reason why a Woman would be paid less (over the course of a lifetime) than a Man.  Whats very interesting: There was actually a study done in the late 00s which looked at the same thing, but tried to control for all these variables. That study's results came out at around 95-99%. Now a Feminist who accepts this study (good luck finding one) would say "AHA SEE! 95% Thats a Wage Gap get told" and yes they are correct. However, when you consider that 91% of Workplace Deaths are Men, it would seem Women are having the better deal. After all, would you take a 5% pay cut to NOT BE KILLED AT WORK?  So is there a Wage Gap? Yes. In Women's Favour! Google recently looked into the Wage Gap at their company, and found that Men were the ones who were being underpaid, and not Women. IIRC they had to raise their Wage budget by around $9m a year to get it even. All that affirmative action really worked well for them. If you believe that Google are the only company in the world who are/will have this problem, then I might have a bridge to sell you.  The Wage Gap has been debunked time and time again, and yet it STILL gets repeated as a Feminist talking point. Its crazy, its bullshit, and it doesnt stand up to the slightest bit of study and criticism. But as we know, Feminism good, anyone who disagrees bad.

What’s next, tell people not to shoot each other. For me, this should be obvious stuff that’s been taught already. When someone gets the talk from their parents and sex Ed class, I strongly hope consent is something that is taught.   Being in a brain storming sessions and hearing someone spout that as if they’re the first person to ever come up with it gets old real quick. Why I favor target hardening, situational awareness, how to tell the early signs of being drug, provide self defense tools, explain methods used by actual paroles of mine is simply I personally feel it’s more useful.   I honestly doubt talking to a bunch of college age students about consent should be something we hinge everything on. I’m not saying we should avoid it all together. But I truly doubt any of them were actually listening to us when we said it. So I preferred raising the paranoia level of potential victims instead.	1640955242.0	hqod2kl	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqoaq90	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqod2kl/

hwethzuc	I am completely convinced that feminists keep pushing the hypothesis of toxic masculinity to keep men's suicide rates high.  The desire for men to suffer and die prematurely is abundant in feminist rhetoric. From mocking male mental health through "male tears" and "fragile masculinity," encouraging violence against men with "kill all men," [shutting down events meant to raise awareness about male suicide rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoahGetTheBoat/comments/mu177i/feminists_shut_down_a_mens_suicide_awareness_event/), and the promotion of feminists who openly celebrate men's deaths, there is no evidence to suggest that the only feminist approved explanation for male suicide, toxic masculinity, is supposed to actually address anything. It's a red herring to take attention off the actual causes of men's health issues.   Actually addressing men's mental health would take two things. The first is for feminists to acknowledge that current gynocentric systems are insufficient. This will not happen as long as feminism has so much societal power. The second is for vast funds to be attributed to retraining therapists and other mental health professionals, tearing down justice systems, fixing family courts, and giving men more support nets. No political party in any Western country has ever expressed support for these things that men need.  And when men try to start a conversation about this? It's immediately shut down by feminists. Men are called incels, censored, and banned from online spaces.   When you think about it, toxic masculinity does exactly what it's supposed to. It gives men a non solution to a real problem, it costs no money or resources, and it gaslights men into blaming nobody but themselves for their depression. You'll notice that literally all problems women face are, according to feminism, from the top-down -- they're caused by outside factors. All problems that men face are attributed to internal reasons.	1640955837.0	hqoe06l	t3_rsrkk3	t3_rsrkk3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqoe06l/

103mpe	I do agree with that.   And of course everyone should exercise caution and a certain level of vigilance.  Over 40% of women in the US have experienced sexual violence. My mother and first wife were molested as children. My current wife was violently raped by two 20 yr old men when she was 15 yrs old. You’d be hard pressed to find a single woman that hasn’t dealt with unwanted sexual attention, and every single one of them does things to protect themselves from harm.  OP’s premise is a straw man, meant to paint people advocating for less sexual violence as naive idiots. The notion of people know bad things are bad, so telling them is a waste of time, is the naive and ignorant position. And pretending that the victims of sexual assault are physically capable of defending themselves at all times is equally naive and ignorant. Id be surprised if OP has had an honest conversation with a real life woman in his entire life. His posts reeks of misogyny and I won’t let it go unchallenged.	1640956088.0	hqoef0w	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqnzvvf	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqoef0w/

When an emergency breaks out--a person falls onto train tracks, a child is about to fall from a great height, a fire breaks out--chances are, look at the people risking their lives. The overwhelming majority are going to be men.   Men are tender and generous. We are warm and considerate.   Men give amazing hugs. I love being hugged by a woman, but even as a straight man, getting hugs from big guys is so unbelievably comforting. I'm 6'4 and 220 pounds so it's not often that a guy bigger than me will hug me, but god damn if that isn't a secure feeling.  Men are respectful. We grow up being instilled with a strong sense of awareness about others and their needs.

bsxsu2ci	Whether or not a person believes abortion is murder, this gets at an interesting point. Women, in general, have the final decision of who they want to reproduce with which collectively gives them a lot of power. In addition, they generally do a lot of the early raising of children which will have a significant impact on the belief systems of future generations.   Prohibition is an example of this. When it initially didn't succeed, women focused on pushing anti-alcohol propaganda as they were the main schoolteachers at the time. Years later, it had sufficient support.	1640956480.0	hqof1xb	t3_rsch9i	t1_hqmdkca	/r/MensRights/comments/rsch9i/the_myth_of_women_have_less_power_than_men_in_the/hqof1xb/

When you were a couple, it probably wasn't as important as there was still stability, but now their Mother is effectively abandoning them during the week, I expect they are fearful that you will abandon them too, on top of the time you are away for work. It's not the same thing having some other relative care for children: it still seems as though they are being abandoned compared to what they had previously. Logic and substitution have nothing to do with it from a childs perspective.  I think you would have to compensate by being available for them during the times your ex would have been available, even if you were not, to return stability of availability. It might then be possible to gradually introduce a care-giving relative over time to free up additional time for yourself, but if it's only to make money, it's a poor exchange.  Not sure how practical it will be for you to return to the previous stability of availability, but now with you having to be available instead of your ex from Monday to Friday.	1640957755.0	hqoh9ia	t3_rsp8h5	t1_hqnzyfu	/r/MensRights/comments/rsp8h5/relationship_fell_apart_how_do_i_help_the_kids/hqoh9ia/
3v85ocq3	I went to college near a rather high crime rate and got a job there. So after graduation I was with a minor city outreach program that encompasses city social workers, medical professionals, police, and corrections. Went to various colleges and universities in the area just to try and offer students who just turned 21 how to navigate this new milestone in their lives. Usually stuff, someone would talk about sexual promiscuity and stds, dangers of binge drinking, and I’d deliver my brief talking points about offenders under my support who were convicted of sex crimes and just how easily a situation can turn dangerous. So my little group handled personal safety. I left probation awhile ago though. It just burnt me out and just felt like I wasn’t accomplishing anything so I went into juvenile outreach instead. Still tough work but I actually feel like I’ve helped some troubled juveniles get off a bad path and feel like I’ve actually accomplished something than I did with adult offenders which seemed like a revolving door of futility.	1640957849.0	hqohfio	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqog23z	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqohfio/

c32y0g0	How is the foreskin a vestigial body part. It actually has a function, a very important function to sexual health for both men and women. For men in the USA, the Middle East, and some Asian countries that still practice circumcision, there is no protection against general mutilation unlike how females are protected.   People who think that it’s normal have been indoctrinated into thinking that it’s normal, especially in the USA. It was about around  1920-1930 when the inventor of cornflakes actually invented a device for circumcision, the GOMCO clamp. The shape was based off the model-T tire irons and jack system. It was well known that John h Kellogg was sexphobic and soon others followed with support of his ideas.   By the 50’s when having children in hospitals became the norm, male genital mutilation was at around 98% this continued into the mid 80’s, then the CDC went to Africa during the aids epidemic to “test” the effectiveness of circumcision as a prevention for aids; test results inconclusive.  It wasn’t till the mid 90’s that more information came out from Britain. How circumcision actually has a strong correlation with early onset depression, attachment disorders, and bonding issues.	1640958028.0	hqohr1f	t3_r7g5f7	t3_r7g5f7	/r/MensRights/comments/r7g5f7/a_vestigial_dirty_and_ugly_body_part/hqohr1f/

178qksb5	Back in 2012 my Dad got Christmas presents for his then wife’s (she died this year) 3 kids, as was typical since he lived with them all. I was graduating high school and he felt bad cause I wasn’t spending Christmas Day with him and he didn’t get me any gifts since I wasn’t gonna be there—understandable. He saved up some cash and took me to Best Buy around Valentine’s Day to get me a laptop as a late Christmas gift, since I never had one before. And he wasn’t getting me anything else, just a laptop. Her kids came along too and the youngest daughter whined because she didn’t have a laptop and was jealous I was getting one. My Dad was like “she could have asked for a laptop for Christmas wtf, we got everything on her list that she asked for”. (Also her birthday is a few weeks before Christmas). Meanwhile his wife followed me around the store as I looked around, trying to get me to look at the cheapest laptops they had the entire time, I remember having to actually shut her out and ignore her, after trying to be nice even though it was obvious what she was doing. Trying to persuade me to something cheaper, as she kept on doing it to no avail. After picking one out, as we were leaving, his wife has her sister on speaker phone in the car. The sister goes “why the fuck does he need a laptop?” and she had to take her off speakerphone, but it was a nice slip-up and it sure was interesting to hear how people talk behind your back. I think that within the next few visits to my Dad’s house my step-sister had a laptop though it was worse than the one I got. The competition is a factor with parents who have kids from previous relationships.

I'm sure I made a lot of it in my head about me but it almost seemed like they got satisfaction out of always having an excuse and never offering any compromise who knows.

Imagine getting into a fight, going inside to get a gun, coming back outside, screaming at a dudes face while holding a gun, and then shooting the ground near the guy...and when he fights back, it's somehow your girlfriends fault when you kill him.

Marx had no use for feminism.  There are modern day feminists posting on social media claiming to be a Communist and/or a Marxist, but they are doing it for attention; they don't really know anything about it.

w5zl6	Whats sexism then? And don't we know that this "call to equalizing" only affects woman? Men don't get promoted cuz some woman makes more than then, i actually saw that, and the opposite, happen. I actually saw guys being in similar situation to this -being treated as secretaryes- got wrecked too. So, sexism means that if you are a woman you are entilted to go as up as some men you feel is no less than you in your company, guaranteed there are at least other men beneath her.  For what she said, they worked on a project. Then, a (presumably) unrelated partnership happened. AND, their bosses called some of this new(more senior) staff to come and take over.   Their original responsabilityes got delegated to. And they were moved away, but stood in the proyect/company. Doing what? simple and useless shit.   I don't see much entitlement  to need a secretary as i see the more senior not trusting/needing the other guys help. This might be, of course, that they think too big of themselves or are reactionary/distrustfull of their capabilityes, or just they simply have enought power in the consultory to have its will compromised. But the truth is that they were there on a command and they have the responsability.  So talking about sexism is contrived as hell. Being "reverse racist" or "gerontophobic" towards them and saying they just ask like "old" and "white" is manipulating. Situation and solution are obviously more tricky.   This situation she describes happen a lot and not only among "old dudes" who "don't realice other people exist". Thats even offensive... Has nothing to do with sexism, but she could get away and skip all this problems by claiming it.  And thats not the point, the point is that people actually believe this shit is personal or sexist towards women. Everything that happens to a woman is sexism.	1640961768.0	hqop0pg	t3_rsbi4h	t1_hqnve7w	/r/MensRights/comments/rsbi4h/woman_cant_take_it/hqop0pg/

Thank you for that. Look carefully at my comments. You might be surprised to notice that you will be unable to find any statement asserting that *women* blame men in the event of a divorce. I specifically left gender out of it, and mentioned third parties without mention of gender.   Why? Because it would be unfair to say that women at large blame men for a divorce, just exactly as it’s unfair for you to say men at large blame women for divorce. I have never made that assumption. You created it yourself, hence the projection. You characterize me by the mistakes you yourself are making.   Here’s why it would be unfair to say that women blame men for divorce. The truth is actually much larger than that. Men and women both blame men for the high divorce rates. It’s overwhelming in the media. Why? Because feminism stifles any possible criticism of women. It aims to baby them and make them perpetually mad at issues that don’t exist, by warping their perspective. But enough with that. Let’s talk proof, because it’s so important to you that I provide it while you get to dismiss it.   Before we get into the more concrete evidence, here’s a nice quick little example that should help you see what’s going on. Take a look at [this fairly typical article](https://www.whitleylawfirmpc.com/3-reasons-why-women-initiate-divorce-more-often-than-men/) on why women initiate divorce at a far higher rate than men. See anything in that article blaming the women for initiating? Not enough for you? Here, [this is a blog post](https://ifstudies.org/blog/in-the-uk-today-men-who-marry-are-deciders-not-sliders) from the research director of the UK’s Marriage Foundation. This specifically talks about how men are behaving badly in marriage and that is why women divorce at a drastically higher rate than men. Still not good enough? Here, [look at this article](https://ifstudies.org/blog/in-the-uk-today-men-who-marry-are-deciders-not-sliders) from a divorce law foundation. What reasons do they give? Women are supposedly more aware of problems than men, women aren’t getting connection, men are trying to force women into traditional roles… the usual load of bull.   Now do you still think that society in general blames women in divorces rather than excusing them?  Still not good enough? Then, explain this. In divorce cases, it is widely known that family courts award full or majority custody to the women approximately 90% of the time. If women were largely seen to be the ones misbehaving in marriage, why would courts grant them custody of children in 90% of cases? Rather, this is significant evidence of systematic sexism against men, assuming that the man is the worse parent, the reason for the divorce. This [Utah-based law firm](https://www.cor-law.com/blog/women-get-child-custody-90-percent-cases-isnt-gender-discrimination/) conducted an interview trying to figure out why the child custody numbers are so skewed.   This is hard and fast evidence that men are *widely* blamed for divorces, and considered to be worse parents simply because of their gender in those relationships that do succeed.   So again I say to you and everyone else: I really hate it when everyone acts as if when the marriage fails, it’s the guy’s fault. Stop blaming the men, figure out what actually happened and get rid of sexism.   And you assumed I didn’t do my research.   So now, the onus is on you. You must prove that the indisputable fact of women being awarded 90% of child custody is not blaming the man, but is blaming the women. You cannot say that, you must prove it, otherwise it’s your word against cold hard reality. Then you must prove further that women at large are blamed *specifically by men and men alone* in order for your assumptions to stand. You generalized an entire gender based on the actions of the few people you’ve dated. This is something you have said. You can no longer base your assumptions on your experiences, you must instead base it on statistics and facts.   I was hoping you would tell me to pony up with sources, so thank you for taking the bait. I have a lot more proof where that came from, and an entire Internet to do more research, so please, by all means, ask for more stuff. After, of course, you prove your assumptions. Let’s make a whole debate out of this.   Or you can maybe acknowledge that you shouldn’t have let your bad experiences prejudice you, and admit it’s a trap you fell into, at which point you’ll be able to work on figuring out how to get out. I know the struggle, I was in your shoes a few years ago. It’s not easy or fun to figure out that you have huge biases, but it’s sooooo worth it to get rid of them. You don’t even have to admit anything to me, just have an honest talk with yourself.   Your move.	1640963523.0	hqosr4d	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqon32x	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqosr4d/
gn9g7ooc	A major argument for the quote you have in the title wasn't addressed. Men *do* occupy a majority of leadership positions. It is then assumed that these people represent "men" as a class, which is untrue. They represented wealthy "owners" of land / business etc. They represent the ruling class and oligarchs, not the "common man."  I do understand how someone might see the gender of leaders and say something like that, but it isn't a valid conclusion. It is completely different than politicians making you a special interest group and elevating struggles you face based on gender.  If they represented men, why don't they pass laws like "the male workplace death act" or "jobs and houses for homeless vets act"? Of course it is a valid argument to say that laws can be discriminatory without being explicit. It has a nasty history in US history that impacted slaves and people of color. Hell, even today the gerrymandering practice is *still* doing this to people of color and fucking them by minimizing the impact of their vote. The thing is, those kinds of laws aren't being built to favor men, but rather the "ruling class." Men as a group don't have advocacy at a high level. The ruling class and special interest groups do.  This is *not* a slight against special interest groups for POC, indigenous, women etc. Even in a truly egalitarian government those groups still have purpose imo. People need advocacy *especially* when they represent small segments of the populations. This is an argument that men are not represented simply because men are in office. It's better to see the people in office as genderless, they are defined by being wealthy elites rather than being a man.	1640963549.0	hqost75	t3_rsch9i	t3_rsch9i	/r/MensRights/comments/rsch9i/the_myth_of_women_have_less_power_than_men_in_the/hqost75/

3nrxdp	> They also forget about the fact that the positive sides of eating a chocolate are pretty much nothing. You just eat a chocolate and thats all.  * https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/does-chocolate-make-you-happy/ * A study in 1996 showed that chocolate caused the release of endorphins in the brains of American women, making them feel happy.  * Chocolate does contain a number of compounds associated with mood-lifting chemicals in the brain. Often mentioned is phenylethylamine, a natural antidepressant and one of the chemicals your brain produces as you fall in love. Tryptophan, an amino acid present in small quantities in chocolate, is linked to the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that produces feelings of happiness. A handful of other substances also add to chocolate’s purported effects – for example theobromine can increase heart rate, and caffeine is well known as a ‘wake-up’ drug.  * But most of these compounds are present only in small quantities in chocolate, and now some scientists say that they are probably almost entirely digested before they reach the brain. It may instead be the experience of eating chocolate, and satisfying a food craving, that releases endorphins and ‘happy feelings’ more than the content of the chocolate itself.	1640963719.0	hqot6hq	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqmj5am	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqot6hq/

103mpe	You’re not understanding me. The courts are brutal against men BECAUSE they respect them. They want to hold men accountable for their actions, to teach them harsh lessons, and to penalize them from not complying with social standards.  Women are infantilized by the courts. Given seconds chances and the benefit of the doubt, because they have no respect for women as adult individuals, they view them as weak or ignorant or easily influenced by others.  Men suffer because of this. It’s a perfect example of how the patriarchy hurts men. The social belief that men are more responsible, more capable, and better in all ways means that men should be punished more, have higher expectations of them.	1640964190.0	hqou8ga	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqod8kt	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqou8ga/

3nrxdp	> I agree that women/men shouldn’t have to protect themselves. But that’s not the world we live in. Evil people will do evil shit  You know, there are more dangers in this world than people. In Florida alligators are a problem, they have taken small children and pets from peoples back yards, there are wolves and bears and even insects that can kill you. Being situationally aware is always a good idea.  And rape per se is not even illegal, women most places can't rape a man and the state is unlikely to do anything. The only case where the state is starting to take action is when older women statutorily rape minor boys, but these minor boys are still liable for child support. And when the state does take action here the woman usually gets a short suspended sentence.	1640965523.0	hqox9hl	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqlqmto	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqox9hl/

It’s just more of a problem for men, yet society generally marginalizes men for seeking help and little is being done from a government level.

98nnvncy	I would be careful about this statistic. Cause it might be full of bias. If it’s true than they have a serious problem.   But there are a million things that can make the statistic biased and untrue. And that goes for any statistic not just this one.   It’s like when the 97% of female rape victims statistic went around. And the age range was 18-22. Yet it only asked like 2000 women. And was treated like it was for all age ranges.  The most likely reason this one was so biased was because of either response bias, or non response bias.   The reason I think it could be response bias. Is because it asked women who are victims to answer the statistic. Meaning it automatically turned away women who weren’t victims. Which makes the number much higher than it really is.   The second is non response bias. I think this also occurred because when you have such a small portion of a population. Let’s say in a super small town. Ignoring any other biases the stats may be true for that small town (this is an example which I don’t believe occurred here) but if you were to apply that for a whole state or country you would have to ask a whole lot more people to make it more occur are state wide, or world wide.   So my point is. You need to be super careful when picking your statistics. If it Can proven to be void of any bias. Then you don’t have a problem. But if there is it can easily be used as misinformation.	1640965802.0	hqoxwt6	t3_rscqcm	t3_rscqcm	/r/MensRights/comments/rscqcm/95_of_japans_homeless_is_male/hqoxwt6/
61t4h0c	there are many reasons why women or rather mothers would unmatch you.  someone here has said you obviously mocked her( although I believe that is simply how people come across online rather than face to face), but I will say it sounds very much in the  "shopping list" vein we often see such as " how tall are you, how much money to do you make etc"  I personally suspect it has to do with the age of your daughter.  if you think about it..  you got full custody , hence we all assume mother must be a really unfit parent.  she old enough to think for herself and may have assumptions about how good or bad a mother will be.  the woman on dating site will see your daughter as competition for your attention and resources.  your daughter in turn may be suspicious or wary of any woman trying to get one over you( eg she will be protective with good reason)  blended families are not going to be easy, especially if there has been turmoil in the kids lives..  \- this is of course all speculation, but I think you may have just avoided a "trap"( cant remember what the correct word here is !)  &#x200B;  if anyone wants an example of societal stereotypes for custody, then they should see the movie "blended".  its an example of family blending, but its the mother who got custody( along with the "bad" ex husband), but Hollywood appears to not be able to handle the idea of a father having custody, so they made the "father" character a widower     *a lot of women assume men get screwed in family courts.*  to be fair, most of us men and women assume( or know) that men get screwed in the family courts. it is after all one of the tenets of MRA, but kudos to you for getting custody.  &#x200B;  anway .. well done to you( and thanks for telling us about this), but you do know ( or have perhaps realised) that online dating sites are a joke. they should call it a supermarket, given the  number of shopping lists you can find on there..	1640965874.0	hqoy2ym	t3_rshwlv	t3_rshwlv	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqoy2ym/

103mpe	The pressure on men to provide, the pressure to remain unemotional or to suppress our emotions. The struggles men have with insecurity, inadequateness, and unattractiveness are rooted in patriarchal social expectations.  Learning about my privilege has helped me tremendously to be grateful for what I have, and to be proud of what I’ve earned. This is related to my gender but as well as my able body, intelligent mind, my race, my temperament, my socio-economic status, and my familial support. All of those things present advantages and disadvantages in a myriad of complex situations. It’s all helped me tremendously with self actualization and an expanded awareness of the world at large.

I mean who wants to be with someone close minded and defensive? It's the newest and coolest thing for them to have that as the first line in their profile. The thing that kills me the most about it is (and I suppose I have no data to back this claim up because I'm straight so I'm not looking at the info on single dad's dating profiles), but I'm willing to bet that the majority of single men are not telling women as the first advertising piece to their profiles is again hey ladies! You'll never be as important as my kids you'll never be an equal member of our family so ya still wanna step forward and take your shot? It makes no sense. When a woman is a single mother and she is humble about it and it isn't her advertising piece and it isn't literally who defines her in its entirety, as in she has created other identities that she takes pride in, THAT is attractive to a man. So FEW of them have done this and that's where they lose on single young men who don't have kids!	1640966946.0	hqp0lry	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqoydqh	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqp0lry/

When his wife found out she was furious and called them up and got an appointment the same day. Seems that the husband had forgot to mention that the appointment was for his wife.

I've already spoken to my boss about taking some time away or if there were any modified duties I could perform for the time being and we're going to look at options.   Their mother trends to be a very selfish person and I don't believe she's considered how it's going to affect the children in any of this. I've given up over two and a half years of work to care for the boys at birth because she couldn't handle it or didn't want to. I'm prepared to walk away from my job if that's what's necessary but I'm hoping these other alternatives I'm looking for actually exist.  She currently works part time for slightly over minimum wage and the fact she might have to give that up to home school the boys because of another school shut down is the end of the world 😔 I'd be more than happy staying home with them if the other half of all the issues would disappear and could afford it.	1640967264.0	hqp1cvc	t3_rsp8h5	t1_hqoh9ia	/r/MensRights/comments/rsp8h5/relationship_fell_apart_how_do_i_help_the_kids/hqp1cvc/

It may not seem like it, but I am on your side, I have been under these types of mindsets.   Modern feminism has castrated men and turned their natural mind inside out.  I know my wording in my previous post was really harsh and maybe a bit tacky. But it doesn’t change the truth. I am a champion for mens rights. I have been wrecked by the courts regarding custody and child support.   But at the end of the day, if we want change it’s going to come from enough of us refusing to put up with shit. It’s totally acceptable and healthy to acknowledge and feel your feelings.

99josor0	It does happen though. All the pedofiles are desperately trying to get behind the LGBT "shield of oppression". And there's plenty of woke weirdos with invented sexualities that try to obtain the LGBT label.   And there's also gay men that are red pilled. I too have been mistreated by women. But I got it easy though.  Just disrespect and heartbreak. My boyfriend went through hell because of his cunt ex-wife. 27 years ago, when they divorced, she cost him a cushy police officer job, took his kids, child support for all 4 of them, taught them to tell him to "die faster like the fag he is" and to nobody's surprise they're not all his. Later she tried suing him for not paying child support. Luckily his family had the wisdom to hold onto the receipts. She tried putting him in jail with false allegations of violence because "that's where fags are happy, dropping the soap and all that". I don't know why he kept fucking her, it's obvious he didn't like her. Whenever I asked him he shrugged and wouldn't tell me. This is admittedly an assumption on my part, but I'm getting the feeling he didn't have a choice in the matter. Recently, the scumbag seduced his 91 year old father and put all sorts of shit in his old, feeble minded head, to the point where the old man tried giving her all the inheritance, including the land under my boyfriend's house, which he built from scratch. It got so bad that the old coot even attacked my boyfriend, his own son, with a kitchen knife. They had to call the cops and put him in a psych ward for a weekend. Changed the old man's phone number to keep that vile bitch out of contact and she had the balls to call the police and accuse my boyfriend and his sister of kidnapping the old guy. Luckily the old coot kicked the bucket before he could make my beloved homeless. Yesterday the bitch sent a text wall to his sister accusing him of killing the old man by breaking his heart and that he wants to leave me all his inheritance. All to get them fighting. In all fairness, I think he wants to, but I don't care about that. I just want to spend time with my beloved, the man who's been more of a father to me than my own dad. This guy got me my first job, taught me how to groom myself and has been there for me through my darkest time. He's a good man and doesn't deserve all that crap. But it happened anyway. I don't think "extremist ideas" come out of the blue. Something makes those people have those ideas. But if we silence and censor them for "hate speech, women most affected", then we ignore their pain and suffering. And if we do that, which is obviously wrong, why would they care when they wrong the rest of us? Abusers are generally victims of abuse themselves. What was it they used to say? All that's necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.  Anyway, that's enough complaining out of me. Apologies for the text wall, but like I tell feminists, I have to tell you too that the grass is in fact not greener on any side. Nobody dies a virgin.

3nrxdp	I've not finished it yet, but I found this encouraging...  ---------------  * **Men Accessing Healthcare**  * One of the explanations put forward to explain men’s poorer longevity is that men “just don’t look after themselves”. Men, it is said, do not visit their GP or other health services when they should; they delay consulting a doctor when they have a medical problem, thereby disadvantaging themselves. Is this true? Or is it an instance of blaming men for their own disadvantage? Are poor health outcomes for men a product of a macho male gender script in which help-seeking is seen as weakness? Or is it a result of disadvantage imposed on men by society?  * We have already seen, above, that men and boys are disadvantaged in terms of the ultimate health objective: staying alive. They are specifically disadvantaged in some ways associated with health provision for cancer prevention or detection. Within the NHS, women have screening programmes for breast and cervical cancers, and a national HPV vaccination programme. Men have no screening programme for male-specific cancers and are excluded from the HPV vaccination programme on grounds of cost, despite suffering similar HPV related mortality. Men are invited to no NHS screening programme until they are 60 years old.  * There is also relatively poor provision for protecting men against prostate cancer. Though improvements are being made in prostate cancer diagnosis, there is a way to go yet due to the lack of an adequate primary diagnostic tool. To lay the blame for that on lack of suitable technology begs the question: is this the result of inadequate research funding?  * It is certainly the case that men in the UK visit their GP less often than women (Figure 1). But this does not necessarily imply that men are gratuitously disadvantaging themselves. Women visit their doctor in association with contraception, pregnancy, neonatal and postnatal issues, as well as in the context of screening programmes. None of these apply to men, or apply to a much lesser extent, so less frequent visits by men to their GP may be expected. In addition, it is known that people who work full time find it more difficult to attend GP appointments. This will affect more men than women, since more men work full time. So, are the less frequent visits by men to their GP a disadvantage imposed on them by their working patterns, rather than the fault of their self-destructive ‘hegemonic masculinity’?  And one of the comments is interesting.  * Personally I have difficulties getting to the doctors, for exactly the reason you indicate. Most of the time, the GPs are simply not open except while I am at work. But I have also had problems simply registering with a new doctor after moving house because the admin staff seem determined to put obstacles in the way. I have found I had to visit a surgery 3 or 4 times during working hours on various days, merely to register with a doctor.	1640967538.0	hqp20c7	t3_rsk1ls	t3_rsk1ls	/r/MensRights/comments/rsk1ls/mens_access_to_healthcare_the_literature_suggests/hqp20c7/

Not for any reason other than that’s generally how things are. That doesn’t make it right or wrong, or her good or bad.  A women should want to know how often you get to see your daughter.

2w2o24ed	I believe that definitely has something to do with it as she routinely puts me down infront or around them. However I used to get pulled into it as well from time to time tho I tried to be more discrete about it.   I know their mother lacks compassion and empathy and I've tried to make up for it but I don't believe that it's the nerf guns or wrestling causing the issue anymore than her striking me, screaming/berating at me or them and her readiness to abandon us when things get though.  I've refrained from seeking other female companionship through this relationship and since it's ended due to self confidence issues... I used to be a very high sex drive individual upon meeting her but it's all but dead now. I'm kind of wondering actually if she's found someone else to be honest 😕   The gross exaggeration was an argument we had not about cheating. She claimed to the police that I had attempted to strike her with a kitchen spatula *untrue and schnenigens* and had raised my hand to strike her *also untrue and never have struck her* and I had squeezed her face hard enough to hurt *I may have touched her face but not hard*. We then argued for 30 minutes while I ate and she threw things and berated me. She told me she was going to abandon me and the kids in the middle of the night and go to her parents *Should have handed her keys*. Instead I told her to have her parents pick her up since the vehicle is necessary for the kids. Her mom called the police instead of picking her up.  Background: She had gotten into a fist fight with my sister at the cabin in August and turned into a raccoon. I backed her up to the point she started throat punching my sister. Afterwards I said we needed to consider going our own way and she said she wanted to move to Northern Saskatchewan with the kids. I said no we live here and my work is here. She told me and I quote "That's fine I've got a plan to take you out of the equation anyways." Which I played off as an idle threat... *Big Mistake* A month later this all went down.  Coincidentally a month after that her mother left her father after 35 years without saying anything until she literally walked out the door. Had bought a house in Saskatchewan and bought a minivan for her and her 90 year old mother with Alzheimer's...  She denies there was any premeditation...   So no cheating I'm aware of 🤷   sorry for the long story	1640968580.0	hqp4j2t	t3_rsp8h5	t1_hqo7to4	/r/MensRights/comments/rsp8h5/relationship_fell_apart_how_do_i_help_the_kids/hqp4j2t/

Just because you are an absolutely uneducated screamer I will provide you some links as to why it happens.  ( to be clear the whole religious side of circumcision is shit.

f153moet	Excellent post.  Some modern changes in language are interesting, and can help avert further tragedy and stigma of this subject. The terms 'committed ' ( and 'killing' oneself) arose when suicide was illegal.  It was seen as murder of the self, and survivors were imprisoned for attempted murder. 'Died by suicide' or 'took their own life' tends to be the modern alternative. Likewise, those who attempt suicide have not 'failed ', but have survived suicide. Using words such as successful/ unsuccessful can also be problematic,  as suicide may be read as a desired outcome.   This may be of interest https://emotionsblog.history.qmul.ac.uk/2012/10/the-history-of-the-stiff-upper-lip-part-2/.  Historically, men were allowed to show their emotions,  including weeping, every bit as much as women. British men were noted for being more emotional than other men. Crying manly tears was viewed as a mark of sincerity,  and sensitivity.   This started to change around the time of the industrial revolution.    Time for males to reclaim their natural right to emotional expressions.	1640969405.0	hqp6km6	t3_rsrkk3	t3_rsrkk3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqp6km6/

16jacj	It is hard, because throughout the world you meet all kinds of good people but even good people can have what society deems as bad habits. Often they are cultural differences which can be normal to them but bad to others.   What some people refer to as red flags are not always such just like some people's green flags don't mean they are a good individual.  For example most people would prefer what society shows as successful, or rich in financial wealth to be a good thing however most of the truly kind and humble people I know are those who are poor or barely scraping by where as most affluential people tend to be rude to anyone they see as lessor or poor.  Finding someone you mesh with well is not always easy. Many things present themselves further into a relationship than most can find out in a year or two.  A lot of people think first and foremost that attraction for most people is seemingly skin deep even though for most decent people, they require far more to be attracted into a courtship.   I mean hey, some of these women honestly were super nice and caring and supportive of friends and family just not their own kids and you may not find that out until 10 months or more in. So how do you judge that until you see it.   People all have different qualities and different priorities that you learn over time you know. A lot of it is socially or culturally driven and in today's world a prevalence on choosing your kids here in America over self has been pushed to the wayside.   We've been taught kids need to work as early as possible, need to be out of the house as early as possible, need to not be a hindrance to parents work or life as much as possible so realistically who do we blame here.

f153moet	http://britishorthodox.org/glastonburyreview/issue-122-circumcision-and-the-copts/ "the collective problems of castration, penile amputation and circumcision... grouped together because they were all considered to be undesirable mutilation of the body, God’s perfect creation. This thinking of the perfection of human body as the handmade of God had been the foundation of traditional Christian teaching on matters related to mutilation of the body – God’s creation should not be tampered with. The three practices were, therefore, all banned by earlier ecclesiastical law, putting those who performed any of them under sanctions." This applies to *all* Christian traditions. In fact, the only church in the world to actively promulgate circumcision is the Egyptian Coptic church; and its sister churches in the Sudan. They adopted the practice around 1200 AD (1,200 years after Christ's birth) to keep 'in' with their Muslim neighbours and bosses- much to the disgust of their fellow Christians. They also circumcise *girls* in those same areas...(FGM).  I can verify that circumcision is unheard of in other Catholic countries,  such as Ireland and Italy.  The only exception being the Philippines,  where rampant cutting originated in tribal practices.	1640970219.0	hqp8kc0	t3_rrwamo	t1_hql7wim	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqp8kc0/

cbbbdhgm	Everyone is too emotional about this video to see the facts and understand why the shooter wasn’t arrested:  He asked a trespasser to leave his property, who said something like, “Fuck you, make me!”  The home owner said, “ok,” and armed himself to ask the trespasser to leave again. This is all legal. If someone won’t leave your property, you can go arm yourself and ask them to leave again.  At this point the trespasser said something like, “I’m going to take your gun and use it on you!” And grabbed the barrel of the gun.  At this point, the trespasser has physically and verbally threatened major bodily harm on the property owner.   This is cut and dry self defense. The Supreme Court has had cases where property owners approached trespassers while armed, and determined it was their constitutional right.  You are legally allowed to arm yourself and ask a trespasser to leave your property. What you aren’t allowed to do is grab the barrel of someone’s gun while trespassing and threaten them—that will get you justifiably shot.  This video is sad, and Reddit is mostly emotional, so the hive mind always comes to the wrong decision in this case.	1640970359.0	hqp8wh4	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqntvx0	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqp8wh4/

My experience and the experience of my peers has been one where women are sympathetic when men talk about their emotional experiences.  There are absolutely women online who are unsympathetic (and in real life) but I’ve always found this ‘toxic’ rhetoric to exist in fairly small pockets on the internet, kind of like this subreddit.   It’s funny in the most unfunny way that this post is very seriously assuming that women do not care about men committing suicide.

8z5yv	Very thorough and informative post. You put forth claims and backed them up spectacularly with clear and deliberate methods. There is one claim that I would refute here, namely the debunking of the myth that "men don't seek help".  In the report by Appleby et al. for the University of Manchester, there was a larger number of men that were in contact with health care services than was to be expected, as noted in the report. However, not all of the men that were in contact specifically "sought help".Out of all the 242 men that were studied, only 35% had been in contact with mental health services. A larger group (43% of total) had been in recent contact with their primary healthcare provider (GP) leading up to their death and of those contacts, 71% were regarding mental health. 33% of all men studied had contacted an emergency department at some point and of the ones that recently contacted, 74% did so regarding mental health, self-harm or suicidal ideas.  While these numbers definitely accumulate to a large percentage, an overlap has to be corrected for men that contacted multiple agencies (17% n=242). So even though more men contacted services than was to be expected, not all of them can be considered to have "sought help". It's hard to calculate an exact number without the raw data (I'm sure it can be extracted somewhere but I have to get going to my new years dinner) but I'll throw in a quote from the report itself and simply say: "It is therefore too simplistic to say that men do not seek help".  I agree with this statement and while I don't necessarily disagree with yours, I think further information is needed to truly determine if a majority of men actually seek help or not.  What I find even more incredible and may be the true take-away from this report is that those that definitely sought help, only a fraction actually got help. Out of the 105 men that saw their GP in the last three months prior to taking their own life, merely 19% were referred for further follow up for mental ill-health.And of the 35 men that attended an ED in the three months prior to death, only 20% were referred for further follow-up and 11% were admitted to a psychiatric ward.  Finally, of the 162 that recently (3months) contacted ANY agency for ANY reason, only 9% were categorized as being at moderate or high risk for suicide or self-harm. Others were put at no or low risk (31%) and the rest were not reported or categorized.  So apart from the debate about whether men seek help or not, it is clear that even when they do, They rarely get the help they need and even when they do, it isn't always enough.  I really have to get going now. I hope I didn't bore you with this long comment.I wish you health in all aspects of life and a happy new year!	1640970913.0	hqpa9jy	t3_rsrkk3	t3_rsrkk3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqpa9jy/

A post in this thread cited frustration with the term ‘man up’ used to tell men to forgo any meaningful emotional interaction (talking to a friend, therapist, parent,etc.) when a man, a young man in particular, is struggling. Can we agree that men are told to man up?  I replied saying this is exactly what is being referred to when someone uses the phrase toxic masculinity. It isn’t the young mans fault that he becomes frustrated and angry and resentful after such an experience, it is a cultural framework that tells men to have this imaginary internal strength where they shouldn’t ever have to be emotionally vulnerable. This is impossible because obviously men are emotional beings.	1640971223.0	hqpb1k8	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqowo0t	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqpb1k8/

To put it another way when there's a recession things get so bad that even some women become homeless.  It's the same in the USA.  In good times the homeless can be 95% male.  In bad times it can grow to something like 30% female.  > 2003, the total number of homeless people in Japan at that time was 25,296. However, according to another survey conducted by the Ministry, by January 2007 the number had fallen to 18,564  There go the homeless women.    > In 2020, the number of homeless counted was 3,992  Honestly that's such a fucking small number you might as well just ignore it.

99josor0	>I believe that definitely has something to do with it as she routinely puts me down infront or around them. However I used to get pulled into it as well from time to time tho I tried to be more discrete about it.   This reminds me of my college professor. At some point his wife got drunk out of her mind and told their teenage boy that his father was "a fag that sucks dick and takes it in the ass", which is admittedly true, but not a child's concern. The boy first chewed out him mom and told her she's an idiot, which was a glorious backfire. And then told his dad the same thing. It was a bit of a wake-up call for him though and he later gave her a stern talking to, asking her how she was expecting them to guide and protect their children from bad life decisions, if the kids don't respect and trust them. She never repeated that in front of the kids. Unfortunately, from what I'm reading in your reply, I doubt such logic will work on your ex. I don't think she cares enough about your boys.  >I know their mother lacks compassion and empathy and I've tried to make up for it but I don't believe that it's the nerf guns or wrestling causing the issue anymore than her striking me, screaming/berating at me or them and her readiness to abandon us when things get though.  Oh my God! That is not normal. She is an abuser. And from what you're telling me about her mom, she used to be her mom's abuse victim. Abuse victims often become abusers when they fain power over someone else. She is quite literally dangerous and WILL destroy your kids' lives, if you allow her to have them. And make no mistake, she will try to get them. But not out of love. She will take them to hurt you and only sees them as tools and you as the enemy. She has already justified all of this crap in her head. She doesn't see how evil she is. She legitimately thinks that you wronged her. But she's just lying to herself. And no, the nerf guns aren't screwing up your kids. In fact it most likely helps them control their aggression and have a sense of balance.  >I've refrained from seeking other female companionship through this relationship and since it's ended due to self confidence issues... I used to be a very high sex drive individual upon meeting her but it's all but dead now. I'm kind of wondering actually if she's found someone else to be honest 😕   You're a man of principles. That's good. Good role model for your boys. Sorry, but now is not the time to be seeking the warmth between a woman's legs. Getting full custody of your kids should be your first priority. Then work on yourself to regain your confidence and inspire that same confidence in your boys. I'm sure you're an amazing man. Your crazy ex wouldn't have pegged you as her next victim if you weren't. As for your ex-wife, I'm sorry, but you won't like what I have to say. She's already given you the cold shoulder, cut off the intimacy and made you her enemy in her head. Is she also overprotective of her phone? I think while you were separated, she tried monkey branching to another sucker. Now she wants to completely cut you off because she has no need to string you along. Most likely the other guy is a sure thing, at least in her mind. Which is why you're swiftly going from separated to divorced.   >The gross exaggeration was an argument we had not about cheating. She claimed to the police that I had attempted to strike her with a kitchen spatula untrue and schnenigens and had raised my hand to strike her also untrue and never have struck her and I had squeezed her face hard enough to hurt I may have touched her face but not hard. We then argued for 30 minutes while I ate and she threw things and berated me. She told me she was going to abandon me and the kids in the middle of the night and go to her parents Should have handed her keys. Instead I told her to have her parents pick her up since the vehicle is necessary for the kids. Her mom called the police instead of picking her up.  >Background: She had gotten into a fist fight with my sister at the cabin in August and turned into a raccoon. I backed her up to the point she started throat punching my sister. Afterwards I said we needed to consider going our own way and she said she wanted to move to Northern Saskatchewan with the kids. I said no we live here and my work is here. She told me and I quote "That's fine I've got a plan to take you out of the equation anyways." Which I played off as an idle threat... Big Mistake A month later this all went down.  I am not gonna lie, this part hurt to read. This reminds me a lot of my boyfriend's hell with his crazy ex, which I'm looking forward to break her legs and remove her venomous tongue through her colon. I'm sorry, but I have even more worrying concerns to tell you about. Are you sure your kids are really yours? Or all of them yours? Maybe you should do paternity tests to make sure. Oh and be careful, she's slandering you to paint you in a negative light and give herself more credibility. That police report was not accidental. It will destroy you in the divorce if you don't prepare yourself. CONSTANTLY record her. If she admits to being a shit mother, that might give you a fighting chance, or at least convince her to let you have custody of the kids, in exchange of her preserving her image. Image is very important to psychopaths like her. You really, REALLY need evidence supporting your case.  >She denies there was any premeditation...   Everything she does is premeditated. Her words should no longer hold any weight with you. Judge her ONLY by her actions. She has already proven herself to be a manipulator. She takes sadistic pleasure in your torment.  >sorry for the long story  Don't worry about it. To be honest, curiosity was eating me. From the way you've phrased your post, I legitimately thought you had cheated on her and wanted to leave that out. Turns out you're just too good for a broken thing like her.  Take care and do your best to save your sweet, innocent, boys from that monster. She is hurting them too. The trauma she already caused, will take years of therapy to undo.

z2u8f1w	Traditional paleoconservative Republicans never cared for men’s issues. When it was white women accusing black men falsely, they said black men need to behave better. They say they want to bolster nuclear families but oppose paternity leave. They dislike gay men.  The modern right wing is thankfully made up of more than just them, but the people in power are still stuck in a time and place that no longer exists. Josh Hawley is close to the worst of them all.  This is part of the reason why MRA gets a bad rep, because people think it’s made up of men who want to go back to traditionalism, when that’s the minority.	1640971642.0	hqpc3cw	t3_rstsnd	t1_hqp1461	/r/MensRights/comments/rstsnd/mens_fascination_with_porn_and_games_is_on_the/hqpc3cw/

cbbbdhgm	Incorrect. You, as a homeowner, have every right to go retrieve your gun before asking a trespasser to leave again. That is both your constitutional right, upheld by the Supreme Court in multiple cases, and your god given right of defense of your property and person.  The trespasser should not have reached for the gun and threatened bodily harm on the homeowner—he should have left the property as he was legally obligated to.	1640971724.0	hqpcar4	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqo4etu	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqpcar4/

87vc6k6h	Ah nice I responded to you in a different comment.  But this type of comment is gender specific. Hence the specification. Sure behavior knows no gender in that men or women can be mean or nice or ambivalent or cruel.   But if we’re giving men specific directives and telling them how to behave in certain situations, and those directives are formulating a basis for what constitutes ‘masculinity’, as in we’re telling them how ‘men’ behave, then yes, the behavior is gender specific. I’m arguing that some of those directives are harmful, like telling men to ‘man up’ hence toxicity attributed to that form of masculinity.	1640971792.0	hqpcgw1	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqpaveq	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqpcgw1/

The child isn’t on his property, his property is not where the father was supposed to pick up his child, etc.  The father stated his child is probably at his ex-mother-in-law’s.

The trespasser states something like, “you better shoot me or I’m going to take that from you and use it on you,” then reaches for the gun. It’s hard to argue he wasn’t threatening major bodily harm, which is all you need for the Supreme Court to support an armed property owners right to use lethal force.	1640972589.0	hqpeg6v	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqp9vjp	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqpeg6v/

bxbpq1g	Here is a list of all the boys. There were zero teenage girls murdered in London in 2021:  [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/teenage-murders-london-record-homicides-knife-crime-2021-met-police-b974430.html](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/teenage-murders-london-record-homicides-knife-crime-2021-met-police-b974430.html)  The BBC website is littered with "women" this and "girls" that. And every subject is twisted to give the "female" angle.  Just think for one moment if all, or even a majority, of those killed had been female teenagers. Do you think that the BBC would not mention the sex/gender of the majority of the victims? Heck, even if a tiny minority of the victims were female; that would be the lede story.  See how they cover domestic violence killings — it's all about the "majority are women":  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49459674	1640972730.0	hqpeswu	t3_rsz2y6	t3_rsz2y6	/r/MensRights/comments/rsz2y6/30_teenagers_killed_in_london_in_2021_all_of_them/hqpeswu/

cbbbdhgm	Almost doesn’t matter what a jury feels, because the Supreme Court has upheld that if a trespasser threatens major bodily harm, you can use lethal force on your property. The trespasser stated he was going to use the gun on the homeowner and then grabbed the gun and tried to pull it from the homeowner’s hand.  Even if some jury was as emotional as you and somehow claimed that wasn’t a threat to him—which is ludicrous—he would win on appeal, because he was exercising his constitutional rights.	1640972855.0	hqpf3wg	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqp9nou	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqpf3wg/

2w2o24ed	Man that's a terrible thing she said to her child. I'm glad the kid called them out on it. I'm far from perfect and I've said some stupid things but try to keep them discrete... Some tasteless jokes over the years that she's never gonna let me live down tho 🤦.  Honestly she doesn't even care enough about herself to get the help she needs 😢 my fear is her depression is going to transfer to the boys.  She claims her dad and brother were the abusers in her family... I'm not so sure but I do know that something isn't right with that family... Rarely see the kids haven't bothered to come see them in almost 3 years... I thought I was the problem so I even offered to have her invite them to the cabin and I would go away for a week and still nothing... She does have past trauma that I know she NEEDS to deal with but refuses... I hope she doesn't try to rip them away from me.  I'm far from perfect and have had opportunities over the years and several recently but I'm nowhere near ready to start messing around in a small town. I've chosen to seek therapy and the therapist has told me I'm a unique case and we've got 1 last session before taking 3 months to digest what's going on. She claims the lack of interest is because of her meds and me ignoring her needs. I'm doing my best to figure out how to support her and other women better mentally, emotionally and spiritually but Rome wasn't built in a day 😔 I hope it's not because she's found someone else.  I'm fairly confident the boys are mine... The first one is the splitting image of me at his age, the second as well... But the 3rd concerns me. I'm considering getting them tested but I'm afraid I'll get information I don't really want or care about... No matter the paternal father I'm the one who held him as a baby, named him and gave him everything he's ever wanted or needed. He's mine and she's not taking that away without a fight.  As far as being prepared we're not actually married... I'm not marriage material I've been told. We did write up a Seperation Agreement which is at the lawyer being written up in legalese but now she wants to make changes 🤷 I'm also carrying the Mortgage on the family home until our baby is 18 so she's got the necessary security for herself and the boys when they're with her. I'm still dealing with the fallout from the police issue but it seems to be a she said, he said nothing situation because I grew up being told nothing ever good comes from talking to the police 🤦  The whole thing should have ended years ago but like a fool I've done everything I can to make it work 😔 thanks for the insight and hopefully you get to rip that colon tongue out yourself 🤪	1640973215.0	hqpg048	t3_rsp8h5	t1_hqpbwii	/r/MensRights/comments/rsp8h5/relationship_fell_apart_how_do_i_help_the_kids/hqpg048/

do42emzv	The "Men are walking wallets" trope is just outright sexism, and expecting a male passenger to get out and put fuel in the vehicle to save the female driver doing it is just a weird stereotype that belongs in the 100-years ago past.  Generally the driver should be the one to put in the fuel and pay for it. If a driver is doing someone a favour by giving them a lift and expects petrol-money from them or something like that, the etiquette is to arrange this before the journey.	1640973395.0	hqpgg4f	t3_rsx8wm	t3_rsx8wm	/r/MensRights/comments/rsx8wm/apparently_not_pumping_gas_is_ungentlemanly/hqpgg4f/

Someone that is seen as a "babysitter" when doing normal things any parent would do?  Sorry, but there's no shame in being open with things that annoys you, and makes you uncomfortable.

I get what you're saying, but it doesn't matter what the perpetrator has, it all comes down to their mindset. Because stabbings and strangulations are more up close, it becomes more personal than shootings. They feel that adrenaline rush and the strength from it and they'll want more of that, so they'll go and do it again to someone else. Banning guns doesn't get rid of murders, they'll just switch over to something else or illegally have a firearm.	1640973955.0	hqphtkj	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqpcl0i	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqphtkj/

The tenet of the story didn't make sense : Mirabel isn't allowed to help/is looked down upon (she isn't even included in family pictures) because she doesn't have any powers (but neither do her father and uncle, and no one cares).  When faced with pressure, the women of the family just keep it down and take it upon themselves. The one guy ? He runs aways, but not really, he's such a coward that he just hides in the walls (but hey, he comes back at the end when it's all over !).	1640974163.0	hqpibnt	t3_rs8weo	t3_rs8weo	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8weo/i_just_watched_encanto_and_i_think_disneys/hqpibnt/
cbbbdhgm	I mean, if a mailman refuses to leave your property when asked multiple times, and then steps onto your porch and puts his head into your head and threatens to take your lawful weapon and use it on you, then grabs your weapon and tries to pull it from your arms—then yes, you are within your constitutional rights to use lethal force.   The only reason you’re not agreeing is because you’re emotional about it. Yes, it’s sad that this father was killed, and it was very avoidable. But the father did put himself in a ludicrous position where he was figuratively (and actually literally, a few times) asking to be shot.	1640974180.0	hqpid69	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqpgn22	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqpid69/
dghd027x	>Does that mean the murder is his fault?   Absolutely yes, if only your scenario was similar to this one.  >If only the man did what he should have done and be faithful   Your scenario would be similar to this one if the man killed the woman when the woman was trying to talk about his actions, as the issue was started with the man's side (the man cheated) and ended with the woman's side (the woman ended up getting killed) just like in this case which was started by the woman's side (not obeying the court's orders) and ended with the man's side (the man ended up getting killed)  Then surely it's the man's fault.   >So by your logic it's his fault.  The woman in this case and your scenario is the one which is faulty.  >You're responsible for your own actions. Trying to blame some idiot woman because you went and got a shotgun to start a pissing contest is embarrassing.  Obviously the man is responsible for his action in this case as he is facing the charges.

Toxic women especially hate porn because they want to be the sole path to a man's pleasure, that way, they can use sex as a means of control.  Weak men let women control their sexual identity.  I don't exist to serve women.  Men are starting to get off the plantation and discover their worth.  Sorry not sorry.

k5qcy8	> https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/circumcision/about/pac-20393550   I think the stats on the items listed by the Mayo clinic sheds great insight.  - Hygiene: We have easy access to water for hygiene. It’s easy to wash body parts.  - Lowers UTI: ["It has been estimated that 111 to 125 normal infant boys (for whom the risk of UTI is 1% to 2%) would need to be circumcised at birth to prevent one UTI."](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision). And UTI’s ["can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss"](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)  - HIV: [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) Condoms are an actually effective transmission barriers to STIs and must be used regardless.  - Penile Problems: ["An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision."](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)  - Penile cancer: [“Decreased penile cancer risk: NNT = 900 – 322,000”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision). It is incredibly rare.   - Cervical cancer is from HPV which has a vaccine. Which is so effective that (turning to news) ["Australia could become first country to eradicate cervical cancer. Free vaccine program in schools leads to big drop in rates."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/04/australia-could-become-first-country-to-eradicate-cervical-cancer)  These stats are terrible, it's disingenuous for these to be called legitimate health benefits. And more importantly, all of these items have a different treatment or prevention method that is more effective and less invasive.  And importantly [the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the penis.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847))  Also check out the detailed anatomy and role of the foreskin in this presentation (for ~15 minutes) [as Dr. Guest discusses how the foreskin is heavily innervated, the mechanical function of the foreskin and its role in lubrication during sex, and the likelihood of decreased sexual pleasure for both male and partner.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=28m20s)   > https://www.elsevier.com/connect/circumcision-benefits-far-outweigh-risks-finds-study-in-mayo-clinic-proceedings  Like most that try to claim this, Morris is not considering the value of the foreskin itself and trying to limit the risks to only surgical complications.    Here's a response from Dr. Ian Jenkins specifically on Morris's study:  [“on closer inspection, [Morris’s article in Mayo Clinic Proceedings] is marred by bias. ...The authors make no mention of position statements against MC 2, 3 or strong international critique of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) position, 4 and they omit the AAP’s own conclusion that “health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns.”5 Ignoring this equipoise, they claim that MC benefits “vastly exceed” risks and suggest that parents who do not authorize MC are unethical and violate the rights of children. The bias does not stop there. Morris et al claim that important analyses were published since the AAP report, but the reference citations are to Morris’s own work”](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(14)00747-2/fulltext)  [“Morris has previously claimed that the statement ‘the foreskin has a functional role‘ is not ‘supported by research,‘3 which would surely perplex many men who value or miss their foreskins. Although I do not feel strongly about MC, I do believe that any issue deserves a dispassionate review of the facts. Morris et al, who note potential ‘cosmetic‘ advantages of infant MC over adult MC while claiming correction of harelip has ‘no medical benefit,‘ did not provide a dispassionate review,1 and readers may want to consider alternative viewpoints.2, 4”](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(14)00747-2/fulltext)  Noteworthy here is that MD Jenkins specifically wrote this to call out Morris.

cx05s	Lol I am gullible retarded fuck now am I?  You do know there is no surer sign that one has won the argument when all you got is insults.   Bumfuck retard.   I haven’t heard that one since grade school.  1) phimosis is normal to at most 6.  It’s usually done by two when the 4skin and gland separate.  Rarely takes longer.  Further ……. Phimosis is ONLY a problem when something is wrong, either infection, skin conditions or contact with an irritant.  It can usually be treated, however can lead to balantis and bala…bala- something.  Paraphimosis is the one that is somewhat terrifying.  When your 4skin doesn’t return, and instead cuts the blood off from the glanz. Can be exceptionally painful and can lead to real problems.   Finally, if you are going to argue with me, at least google the crap your spewing “ phimosis is good until 10!”  I performed my first autopsy when I was 14.  I have literally performed manual stimulation of an exposed heart while being transported in a helicopter.  I am familiar with, and comfortable with performing emergency tracheotomies, emergency stitching and emergency surgery if needed.   I can stitch, administer drugs, understand how to set bones, set dislocations, tourniquets, shock treatment, burn treatment, etc.  I was a certified WCB OHS Level 3 professionally for 6 years, and had all the required add ons for being a paramedic(before I realized how shit they get paid in Canada)  The only reason I am not a doctor is because I absolutely can’t stand whiny people, and bedside manner is a thing.  I would have been sued the first time a fat person came in complaining about their knees or ankles or some shit.  Now to recap.   1) I know a lot about the medical field. 2) I agreed that many hospitals do not recommend it anymore.  It’s a hygienic preventative surgery. 3) this doesn’t change the fact that there can be serious issues with foreskin being intact. 4) men are fucking terrible at getting help when I’ll, even with their penis for some reason.  People have lost function l, both full or partial because of things like paraphimosis. 5) if you would wish to talk about your OBVIOUS incel related mental illness, we could switch over to private chat, however by this point you have probably gone thru the last 12 months of my post history and realized that I am a trump supporter, low tolerance for dumb and an avid poster some subreddits that may scare you.  In short, I am smarter, more intellectual, have an obviously better talent for insulting people without using swear words and ableism and final could actually help you become a better person.   But that’s not really what you want.  You just want to scream and be validated.	1640976763.0	hqpopfc	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqp6syi	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqpopfc/

49uvc	I have known a few people who have killed themselves, at this point I am not sure if I have lost more friends to suicide than all other combined causes but its probably close.  Several of them were my friends from the military, 3 army and 2 marines who killed themselves due to PTSD and likely due to neurological damage due to Mefloquine.  Two were teachers who killed themselves due to accusations of improper relations with students, one of them was a close family friend that I had known since birth, about a year after his death the girl came forward and admitted it was a lie.  Another was a guy who lived down the road from me when I was a kid, he was going through a divorce, then his wife claimed he was beating and raping her and their 3 year old daughter, he shot her in the face then killed himself.  A childhood friend of mine got really hurt in a car accident and got hooked on pain killers in college, he ended up with a nasty drug addiction, we are not sure if he tried to kill himself but he shot up enough heroin to kill a dozen people or more.	1640977050.0	hqppeo6	t3_rsrkk3	t3_rsrkk3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqppeo6/

25nw748a	Paraphimosis cannot be fixed by circumcision, it is redundant. To cut the skin you have to have coverage, to have coverage you must be able to move the skin, if you can move the skin forward you no longer have paraphimosis.  And yes, physiological phimosis is a normal part of penile development and the median age of foreskin retraction is 10.5. This is also documented in the NIH.   I don’t see how your background is relevant when you are spewing absolute bullshit. The moment your views got threatened by proper sources you resort to “b-b-but I’m smarter!!”.   It is not preventative, it is not medical, and last of all, it is not hygienic. All of these have been debunked, the claims were pseudoscience in the first place. The risk of injury for leaving a penis intact is 0.5%.

a0xsse2g	>meant to paint people advocating for less sexual violence as naive idiots.  I think that's an extremely unfair characterisation. Complain about no true Scotsmen if you like, but I don't think any sane human being is seriously proposing we shouldn't advocate for less sexual violence. In extremis, you risk seeming to accuse someone of supporting rape, which is a very serious and unpleasant accusation. I don't think you're really trying to do that, but people may interpret it that way, which, well, doesn't help.  I don't recognise a strawman here. I think /u/danielnogo's main argument is well put and gets to the heart of the matter, which is that it is acceptable (or at least more acceptable) to generalise about one group in a way it is not acceptable to generalise about another. I don't think it's acceptable to generalise in that way about *anyone*, but regardless, you can't have it both ways. I view that as a double standard, as hypocrisy, and *another* reason people are likely to get angry and be less willing to engage in a worthwhile discussion.  Personally I wouldn't refer to "the wage gap myth" without significant qualification. The most incendiary interpretation of that is that /u/danielnogo is denying the existence of a gendered offset in whole life income in first world countries. I suspect everyone reading this, including /u/danielnogo, will already be very aware that is very real and not a myth. On the other hand, the most flattering interpretation is that "wage gap myth" is a shorthand for the vast over-interpretation of the statistics which reasults in people waving placards like [this](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/CtGvOb4-GgZYnWP-mrGbAqs4Om_KcBQwNNsujBHcoDQzwn7i3RvDpQYiaTXX4Zqt4LACntkzcIenV_kkYBIbzI_n2fgRghqPPJc7UYdLLzUuKAejKlq8M_91_gS5Ww), which are at least as much of an oversimplification as anything /u/danielnogo said.  I would agree /u/danielnogo should have caveated several of his statements a lot more than he did, and I'd criticise him for unnecessarily increasing the risk of heated argument, but let's not leap to conclusions. As you may be able to tell, what I'm doing here is pleading with both sides to do their best to avoid leaping to the worst possible conclusion about what the other means.	1640977488.0	hqpqh04	t3_rs8x81	t1_hqoef0w	/r/MensRights/comments/rs8x81/i_shouldnt_have_to_lock_my_doors_at_night_we_just/hqpqh04/

8v1e03nm	Yes, that covers a handful of the issues, but it's a very limited approach to gender equality that does not cover the vast expanse that it truly is. There's far more sexism against men than simply the expectation of stoicism and providing. How would you attribute a 20% grading bias against boys in education to this patriarchy model, without making a huge stretch of logic akin to conspiracy theorists? Thing is, it has nothing to do with breadwinners or stoicism, it's just straight up misandry. It's this straight up misandry which feminism by nature is incapable of considering. You can consider any form of sexism against women to a part of the patriarchy because it is literally what it entails, but what it fails to realize is that there is more misandry than just toxic expectations.   Feminism gives a good starting point but it's fundamentally incomplete and cannot be the vessel for equality.	1640977696.0	hqpqz0w	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqoy7gx	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqpqz0w/

It's about making choices without being biased, and just seeing the options as they are. You can even have radical views on a certain topics, and as long as agreenebless (sry idk the word) with left and right topics are balanced (circa), then you can be a centrist. I agree that Centrism isn't being used as it should be, ever, though.	1640978685.0	hqptcpk	t3_rrljbd	t1_hqisxkj	/r/MensRights/comments/rrljbd/you_do_you_guys_lean_politically/hqptcpk/

99josor0	>I'm far from perfect and I've said some stupid things but try to keep them discrete... Some tasteless jokes over the years that she's never gonna let me live down tho 🤦.  Drop this attitude. From what you're saying here, you're too nice. She just kept gaslighting, abusing and manipulating you until she crumbled your self esteem. Chances are, those jokes weren't "tastless" but rather she's uptight and has shit taste.  >She does have past trauma that I know she NEEDS to deal with but refuses... I hope she doesn't try to rip them away from me.  Brother, you are so past the point where you should care about her trauma. If she was indeed abused, although I have a sneaking suspicion that she's just adopted the typical "men bad" feminist attitude, but if she was indeed abused, as bad as that was its her responsibility, as an adult, to address that. She is no longer a victim. She is an abuser. She is dangerous. She destroys everything she touches.  >I'm far from perfect and have had opportunities over the years and several recently but I'm nowhere near ready to start messing around in a small town. I've chosen to seek therapy and the therapist has told me I'm a unique case and we've got 1 last session before taking 3 months to digest what's going on. She claims the lack of interest is because of her meds and me ignoring her needs. I'm doing my best to figure out how to support her and other women better mentally, emotionally and spiritually but Rome wasn't built in a day 😔 I hope it's not because she's found someone else.  Nobody's perfect, but from what you're telling me, you're damned close to perfect. You did good to seek therapy. Trying to find love with a broken heart leads to disaster. You might also be drawn to familiarity and end up with a similar woman. Also, change your therapist. It's not good for you that she blames you of not being understanding, when you are in fact the victim. Seek a male therapist. I don't wanna sound*like that*, but women are highly cooperative. They'll defend each other in front of a man, even when they don't know each other. Right now, you don't need to be told how you supposedly screwed up. The only one you've wronged is yourself. Let me, once more, make it abundantly clear: your ex is poisonous. She's not right in the head. She's the one who screwed up.  >I'm fairly confident the boys are mine... The first one is the splitting image of me at his age, the second as well... But the 3rd concerns me. I'm considering getting them tested but I'm afraid I'll get information I don't really want or care about... No matter the paternal father I'm the one who held him as a baby, named him and gave him everything he's ever wanted or needed. He's mine and she's not taking that away without a fight.  I suggest you do a paternity test regardless. I know it's scary. And it would be heartbreaking if any of them wouldn't be yours. Look, full disclosure, I have wanted children for some time now. But being gay and with HIV... there is no way any woman would ever consider me for... well, anything really. I would quite literally kill to have kids. But you already do. And you said it yourself, you love them either way. Still it might be good to know for when they grow up or in case of a medical emergency. Besides, you don't want this to eat at you. It can built resentment. Better to confront the issue now and get it over with. Have courage, brother! You are not alone in this.  >As far as being prepared we're not actually married... I'm not marriage material I've been told.  More degrading lies meant to erode your self esteem and make you easier to manipulate. Do not believe these lies. It's what abusers do.  >We did write up a Seperation Agreement which is at the lawyer being written up in legalese but now she wants to make changes 🤷  Don't allow her. And use your own attorney. She's trying to use and destroy you. But you have rights too. In contrast she has no right to do all this to you. Fight her with everything you have. Reclaim your strength and get out from under her high heels 🍒⬇️👠. Just look inside. The strength you need is there. You just need to find it. If you yourself aren't enough motivation, than do it for your children. Because they deserve better. And so do you.  >I'm also carrying the Mortgage on the family home until our baby is 18 so she's got the necessary security for herself and the boys when they're with her.  That is horrible. You're being used by your abuser. This alone should prove who is the responsible and better equipped person for raising the kids. Sadly, men are often being prevented from raising their own children, but are forced to give up everything for children they don't even have access to. This is the situation that you want to avoid. That's why I'm telling you to gather as much evidence as you can to prove that she's unfit to parent and that you're the better choice for your kids. Trick her into spilling the beans on camera if you have to and if it's legal. An attorney and a PI might be able to help you come up with a plan and possibly the PI can execute said plan. But you need to make sure you don't do anything illegal.  >I'm still dealing with the fallout from the police issue but it seems to be a she said, he said nothing situation because I grew up being told nothing ever good comes from talking to the police 🤦  Sadly, the police are some of the biggest simps on the planet. You get your eyes scratched out and they arrest you because she broke a finger nail while doing it. I've heard it happen.  >The whole thing should have ended years ago but like a fool I've done everything I can to make it work 😔  Forget that. What should or shouldn't have happened doesn't matter anymore, beyond the lessons you learned from those mistakes. Beating yourself up about it won't help anyone, least of all your kids. What is important now is to find your inner strength, even rage or maliciousness if need be, and to start fixing this mess as best as you can.  Mind if I ask you some more personal questions? Like your age or what country you're from. In a previous comment, you mentioned some town names, but I don't recognize them. I'm 32 and I'm from Romania.

"Did dad left because of me?" "yes, mymotherfuckedbenafflec".  If she just got genually angry, and broke contact, had the childr and, being forced to/decided to raise it alone, names it without the father knowledge, i would understand. But this...

dghd027x	>Using gender when it benefits them (such as this, holding doors open, paying the dinner date bill etc). However when it's something directly not benefiting then it's all about "equal rights".  If only it was this simple.  It's using gender when it's your turn to do things but when it's time to virtue signal then all this is turned into misogyny. This there by creates a cycle of them  not doing anything for equality and at the same time they could point out that this is because of misogyny and therefore showing that it's because of patriarchy. For them it makes sure that there are reasons for their existence with no questions asked because they are fighting against the patriarchy which also harms you.  >Still haven't heard a major outcry about equal rights for Women being required to sign up for the draft at 18...  You have given the perfect example to this.  You would see many saying that they don't have any problem with getting drafted but if that's the case where is any uproar when Republicans opposed the inclusion of women being added to draft by giving the justification that they should stay at home and raise kids. There was way more outcry when the abortion laws were restricted in Texas, but what about the draft which would be in affect in the whole country. For someone fighting against the patriarchy ,which says that women should stay at home and raise kids, I would have definitely expected a huge oproar but on the other side it's time to get drafted so nothing here.	1640979266.0	hqpurkr	t3_rsx8wm	t1_hqp5457	/r/MensRights/comments/rsx8wm/apparently_not_pumping_gas_is_ungentlemanly/hqpurkr/

cx05s	You really are not very bright are you.  And I quote.  complete circumcision, or removal of the foreskin, may be necessary in very severe cases of paraphimosis. This will also prevent the condition from happening again.  And low and behold, it only effects the uncircumcised.  Some of the less circumcision fixes are, a small incision to allow the skin over the glanz. Or, even more fun, an injection into the glanz to reduce the swelling.  Full article if you wish. https://www.healthline.com/health/paraphimosis#treatments   Circumcision is the absolute cure for paraphimosis.   You literally can’t get it if you do not have a foreskin.   Because it’s when the foreskin gets stuck pulled back.  Like literally.  How can you say paraphimosis can’t be fixed by circumcision??????  That is the literal final option if everything else fucking fails.  Do you read?  Do you know how to read?  Did you even attempt?  Like honestly how am I able to have a debate with someone who states, Paraphimosis can’t be fixed by circumcision, it’s redundant.”   At this point I have written you off as troll, reported our conversation and am seriously wondering how you managed to survive all this time without getting eaten by a rock or other higher life form.    Paraphimosis, a condition caused by foreskin, can’t be cured by circumcision.  Wow.    I included my credentials as well as well as proper sources because I am smarter then you.  Your tactic was to call me a retard.  My tactic was explain that I was essentially 18 to 24 months from being a doctor before I was 18.  It’s been some time, so no longer valid these days.   My credentials don’t make me smarter then you.  The fact that you accused me of spewing bullshit, when your main retort is “Paraphimosis cannot be fixed by circumcision” tells me where you fit in the iq scale.  And your garbage about median ages.  “Phimosis is normal in uncircumcised babies and toddlers, as the foreskin is still attached to the glans. It will start to detach naturally between 2 and 6 years of age, though it might happen later. It can happen at up to around 10 years old, in some boys.”  It can happen.  It’s not fucking normal.  Like honestly.  “The foreskin can be pulled back behind the glans in about 50 percent of 1-year-old boys, and almost 90 percent of 3-year-olds. Phimosis will occur in less than 1 percent of teenagers between 16 and 18.  It is most likely to occur in older boys with:  repeated urinary tract infections foreskin infection repeated rough handling of the foreskin foreskin trauma”  https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319993   Get a grip.  Take a deep breath.  Admit to yourself that you really don’t know anything about the topic you are trying to champion.  Then do some reading, and educated yourself a little more.

25nw748a	The possibility of phimosis (tight or non-retractable foreskin) does not warrant circumcision. Pathologic phimosis is rare. It can be cured by stretching the foreskin gently at regular intervals. For faster results, topical steroids can also be used. In the unlikely event that theses methods don’t work, surgery like Y-V plasty, Z-plasty, and preputioplasty can be done as a last resort. None of these treatments result in the loss of tissue. Moreover, some doctors misdiagnose phimosis in young children, when they're supposed to have foreskins which can't retract, until puberty, though in some cases the foreskin becomes retractable earlier or later. Improper handling of the foreskins of children can cause phimosis due to scarring leading to inelasticity.        From the Canadian Pediatric Society: http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision        "An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction ... allow\[ing\] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision." http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/        Conservative Treatment of Phimosis: Alternatives to Radical Circumcision        "Phimosis" is a vague term. In common usage, it usually means any condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be retracted. Most infants are born with a foreskin that does not retract. This is normal! "True" phimosis—better termed "preputial stenosis," because "phimosis" has so many different definitions it now is devoid of any useful meaning—occurs in less than 2% of intact males. The incidence of preputial stenosis in circumcised men is actually similar. Of these 2%, 85–95% will respond to topical steroids. Of those who fail this, at least 75% will respond to stretching under local anesthesia, either manually or with a balloon. The arithmetic is simple: At the very most 7 boys in 10,000 may need surgery for preputial stenosis. A number of reports in the medical literature of the United Kingdom indicate that medical doctors are not trained to distinguish between normal developmental tight prepuce in boys and pathological phimosis. This results in cases of misdiagnosis of normal developmental preputial tightness as pathological phimosis in the UK. Alternative treatments for phimosis are effective.        The foreskin of boys may be tight until after puberty. Phony phimosis diagnoses in boys in America, where unaltered male penile anatomy is misunderstood even amongst doctors, is not uncommon.        Conservative treatment of phimosis in children using a topical steroid http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/berdeu1/        Topical steroid for the treatment of phimosis is a safe, simple, and inexpensive procedure that avoids surgery and its associated risks. It is effective both in primary and in secondary phimosis. It obtains excellent results in diverse age groups and is well accepted by parents despite the fact that they have to play a more active role in the care of the foreskin.        Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for phimosis: a comparison of surgical and medicinal approaches and their economic effect        Topical steroids are a real advance in the treatment of phimosis; this approach, which is supported by many studies, should induce medical decision-makers and practitioners to establish the local application of topical steroids as the standard practice for treating genuine phimosis. We conclude that circumcision cannot be justified, as it is in neither the patient's nor society's interest, and is incompatible with current standards of safety, ethics, effectiveness, and rational spending.         **Paraphimosis**    This is when the foreskin gets retracted and stuck behind the glans causing constriction. Paraphimosis is, again, a rarity, not worthy of prophylactic circumcision of infants. Forced retraction is a leading cause of this condition. There are conservative treatment options for paraphimosis if and when it does occur. http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/paraphimosis/        Phimosis cannot even possibly be diagnosed until the child is several years old. It almost always resolves on it's own accord. The majority of cases are brought about by improper care. There are treatments for it that preserve the foreskin.	1640980043.0	hqpwnmi	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqpvh9j	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqpwnmi/

As long as you know and are self aware that you’re being toxic with the way you’re going about this comment thread (most of your comments actually), I don’t care.   I hope for your, your friend’s and family’s sake that the disdain for the term does not impede you/them from addressing the toxic beliefs/attitudes/behaviours clubbed under it.   But even more I hope you explain to them that you’re against the term and educate them instead of going full attack. And of course this applies to all the terms you are against.   what you’re doing, deflecting from the actual point of discussion (boys being told to man up, debunking common reasons cited for high suicide rate among men), is also pretty toxic. And that’s all I wanted to point out from my previous comment.   As long as you acknowledge there is a problem, higher suicide rates among men, boys shouldn’t be subjected to preconceived notions of how they should behave, I’m good. This goes for all other issues that exist under the sun.	1640980169.0	hqpwyl1	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqpalml	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqpwyl1/
cx05s	So……for the 4 billion of us who don’t always have access to running water?  Or clean water?    Or how about the people that do have problems because of it?    It is a hygienic procedure, especially at this point.    I mean honestly, you can get both phimosis and paraphimosis via excessively rough masterbation….tho it can also fix it…..cure and solution.   And I have seen many of the stats you show me, not the first time I have argued for directing the MRA towards more important shit as opposed to u/lmaogetbodied32 severe shortening due to a botched circumcision.  I mean…..that’s all this account does is shill out bad information for its agenda.   Such as paraphimosis cant be cured by circumcision.  /rolleyes   I am all for serious debate, I believe circumcision is hygenic, and not required for most of us in North America, but it’s a simple procedure that can save grief down the road.  The MRA movement isn’t going to win many outside support if we keep collectively crying about our penises.

ijsp3	It was her blatant violation of, and refusal to comply with, a court ordered visitation with his children that led to the confrontation.  When her and her ex started arguing over her blatant violation of the court order, her boyfriend did what men do when women are involved and got in the middle of it where he didn't belong, which led to the death.  Legally the responsibility lies with the boyfriend, however it was the woman that was ultimately responsible for all of this because if she had of followed the court order, none of this would have happened.  If I were the DA, I would personally have her in court to answer for why she felt like she didn't have to follow the court order, but we all know that a women will never be held accountable like that in court.	1640980477.0	hqpxpsd	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqoayn3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqpxpsd/

103mpe	Men are graded more harshly in school for the same reason that they are penalized more harshly by our justice system.  Our entire society expects more of men, and conversely, less of women. So any subjective measurement of a man and a women puts them on a different scale.  High expectations for men and the infantilization of women is omnipresent. In education, the justice system, the workplace, the military, etc. Because we all exist in a patriarchy.   The patriarchy is not a conspiracy by men to oppress women. It’s a universal set of expectations set upon both men and women, where men are expected to be MORE.  Women receiving higher grades for lesser work is not good for women. It’s a lower expectation of them, and creates a false sense of success. It’s likewise bad for men, because it fosters an unfair environment. And clearly develops resentment from men toward women, which is a huge portion of the misogyny that’s displayed in this forum every day.	1640980991.0	hqpyy5v	t3_rrmnu5	t1_hqpqz0w	/r/MensRights/comments/rrmnu5/teen_boys_are_being_made_to_think_they_cannot_be/hqpyy5v/

3nrxdp	> I was denied a job because of my gender and the Selective Service Act. Yes, there are negative consequences for men.  It's ridiculous that you should have to prove you registered in 1980. This requirement should at least have been clearly listed with the job ad.  There is a narrow window for men born between March 29, 1957 and December 31, 1959 where registration is not required.  * https://www.sss.gov/register/men-born-before-1960/  * **Men Born Before 1960**  * Men born from March 29, 1957 through December 31, 1959, were not required to register with the Selective Service System because the registration program was suspended when they would have reached age 18. The requirement to register with Selective Service was reinstated in 1980, but only for men born January 1, 1960, or later.  * **Status Information Letters Are Not Required**  * Men born before 1960 are not required to be registered with Selective Service to be eligible for federal job training (WIA), and federal jobs, including the U.S. Postal Service. Thus, they should not be asked to provide a status information letter from Selective Service.  * NOTE: Immigrants born before 1960 who are seeking U.S. citizenship may be asked by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to provide a status information letter. However, for applicants over 31 years of age, the applicant is eligible for naturalization even if the applicant knowingly and willfully failed to register because the applicant’s failure to register would be outside of the statutory period   If you were born before 1960 the SSA site says that you are not required to provide a status letter for eligibility.	1640981189.0	hqpzfcx	t3_rrx59a	t1_hqndski	/r/MensRights/comments/rrx59a/is_this_true/hqpzfcx/

Make the state pay and declare the amount and percentage of taxes they take from people for it( make all costs available to the public to scrutinise), remove the profit incentive from it.

3nrxdp	The US government has given up on direct prosecution, instead it has worked with states to punish those who don't register. There was a lot of bad publicity the last time they vigorously enforced the draft. I can't find a reference to that, but this was what happened during the Vietnam War.  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion#United_States * **Avoidance and resistance at home**  * Significant draft avoidance was taking place even before the U.S. became heavily involved in the Vietnam War. The large cohort of Baby Boomers allowed for a steep increase in the number of exemptions and deferments, especially for college and graduate students.[88] According to peace studies scholar David Cortright, more than half of the 27 million men eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War were deferred, exempted, or disqualified.[88]  * The number of draft resisters was also significant. According to Cortright, "Distinct from the millions who [avoided] the draft were the many thousands who resisted the conscription system and actively opposed the war".[89] The head of U.S. President Richard Nixon's task force on the all-volunteer military reported in 1970 that the number of resisters was "expanding at an alarming rate" and that the government was "almost powerless to apprehend and prosecute them".[90] It is now known that, during the Vietnam era, approximately 570,000 young men were classified as draft offenders,[88] and approximately 210,000 were formally accused of draft violations;[91][88] however, only 8,750 were convicted and only 3,250 were jailed.[88] Some draft eligible men publicly burned their draft cards, but the Justice Department brought charges against only 50, of whom 40 were convicted.[92]	1640981677.0	hqq0kti	t3_rrx59a	t1_hql2c0p	/r/MensRights/comments/rrx59a/is_this_true/hqq0kti/

The only reason these cuckservatives want men to work more is to have excess income to pay towards a woman and her children. The rich men don't want to pay taxes to help women, they want individual men to do that.     Sorry I'm not going to university simply to improve my chances of finding a partner, which is about it's only use at them moment due to high female attendance and hypergamy. (Statisically I'd say you are better off not dating a woman who has experienced higher education because majority of them have nothing to show for it except debt and a sense of moral superiority)     If playing videogames is more fun or enjoyable for people than earning excess income (that has historically be spent by others), why force us all to earn more money.

Jesus Christ the majority of us are from extremely wealthy countries, we have so much time we can spend on "porn and videogames" especially when you think about the cost of said "porn and videogames"     Compare what every woman does to me with their free time: SHOPPING!     I shit you not women could spend everyday shopping, if you listen to them honestly they will tell you. They can spend A LOT of money. On the other hand I pay a fraction of what they spend on clothes, on videogames. Porn is free. Games are pretty much free. I and most men wear and think of clothing differently and so make good use out of what we own. Speaking for myself my largest costs are and will be a single house, (maybe) a single vehicle and then consumables till I die (food, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs) - hardly a consumerists dream.      When you realise how much more money women are willing to spend you begin to understand why cuckservatives fantasise about men giving money to women. https://www.renolon.com/male-vs-female-spending-statistics/     >According to Hawley, men have long been persuaded that they and their male nature are problems in themselves. Because of this, they drop out of school, are less likely to get married and work.      Well he's not wrong, take it from me that my generation no doubt has this feeling as men. This feeling that we should step back, shut up and let weaker people take over. It's honestly one of the most pernicious of all feeling I get. It prevents you from taking credit. It prevents you for asking for more money. It prevents you from competing for a job or a position and it prevents you from feeling like you did something yourself.      However I also think were it not for these feelings I would not be here on an MRA subreddit talking to you all about this, I would be more like Hawley, telling you to pull yourselves together instead. **Hawley strikes me as a guy who's penis is only up if the S&P400 is.**     While I think a decent amount of stoicism is useful, if our society is going to get *all touchy-feely, all nanny-state, all-caring and all-encompassing,* you can bet your sweet fucking ass we are going to be getting our fair share. Pretty much all responsibilities women had historically have been altered or amended yet here we are with men still having to provide more, whilst we are either criticised by them for earning more money that women, or because we aren't earning enough for women. You simply cannot win, It is always *your fault*. You, the individual man, are then only one with **real** responsibility.	1640982112.0	hqq1lp6	t3_rstsnd	t3_rstsnd	/r/MensRights/comments/rstsnd/mens_fascination_with_porn_and_games_is_on_the/hqq1lp6/

Trust me, just because in some cases it's actual self defense, you'd still have a lengthy legal process ahead of you. You will have to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that you feared for your life. Guaranteed if this posts situation had happened in Germany, the guy would've been arrested and charged with AT LEAST manslaughter for escalating that situation by bringing a gun out. There's something called "rational thought" we have in Europe, where everyone can see that the right course of action should've been to call the police. There was no physical threat whatsoever, dude just wanted to pick up his kid.

cbbbdhgm	In the UK, you may be right.   They appear to just have a “reasonable force” law that is I’ll defined, and they have no strong constitution rights as we do in the US, so a jury could and have found homeowners guilty of murder for shooting trespassers and burglars.  The only reason this one may still fly, is because the trespasser in this case does try to take the gun for the express purpose of “using it” on the homeowner. Because of that action, it’s likely a jury would agree that reasonable force was used, like it or not.	1640982235.0	hqq1w1o	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqpy4g3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqq1w1o/

Every time I go to therapy they seem to never accept what I am saying and it feels like they refuse to listen or understand what I am saying. They reframe it and try to constantly sneak other things in that I did not say or elude to. It's like they are trying to tell me what I am thinking or feeling instead of listening to what I am saying and expressing.

c6dnp	There's so much you're just wrong about here, specifically when it comes to all of your accusations about me personally.   I have never banned or censored anyone. I am not in charge of any online spaces. Even if I were, I am anti-censorship.   You claim that most people who claim to be for free speech are just lying, and trying to cover for something. The obvious implication is that this applies to me. It doesn't, and you're just simply wrong in this regard.   I don't believe that other groups should get protection. I hate the level of censorship that wokists employ. It's disgusting. The issue for me is that I don't feel us doing the same to other people is morally correct. That is the entire crux of my position - we should try to not become what we are fighting against.   I agree that we need to hold men and women to the same standards, but this is a departure from the main point. I am talking about general feminist spaces, and the fact that we shouldn't shut them down entirely. You are conflating all feminists with the most radical among them, and using that as a basis of justification for shutting all of it down.   And finally, I'm not saying that we should have to tolerate misandry *in our spaces.* What I am saying is that it is morally wrong for us to go out of our way to interfere in *their spaces.*	1640982469.0	hqq2foe	t3_rsfong	t1_hqp1cfq	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqq2foe/

130cqf	I think we are getting somewhere. Because no, I don’t subscribe that a man doesn’t cry, etc etc.  But the inverse is equally if not worse for the state of a man.   It’s not black and white and needs nuance. But polarizing men into macho fools or fem metro soy boys. Are both (and in my opinion intentionally) destroying the concept of real men.  I think what makes a “man” a “real man” centers more around character and responsibility.  However, I also believe in traditional gender, while being willing to make the compromise that there is a spectrum between masculinity and feminity.  Masculine behavior being dismissed as toxic is toxic to men. Bad behavior is bad behavior.  Masculinity is neutral, it can be used positively or negatively.   A man of good character should desire and embrace his masculinity which include controlled aggression, vigilance, leadership, being strong physically, mentally and emotionally as well as stable in the pressmen of chaotic feminine energy.  It should not be, victim minded, defensive, fearful, powerless, etc.  Any of those feelings can be felt, and are natural. Should not be suppressed. At the same time they should not be embraced or reveled in. They should be worked through and utilized. They are pointing at a definciacy or weakness or wound. These should be identified and if outside help is needed than definitely should be pursued.  But more often than not that pain and fear is your masculinity pointing out a weakness. And it wants you to rise. It wants you to get stronger.	1640982516.0	hqq2jjw	t3_rshwlv	t1_hqpgr5i	/r/MensRights/comments/rshwlv/got_unmatched_on_a_dating_site_for_returning_an/hqq2jjw/

According to a study by NIH, 37-39 percent of the male population is circumcised, roughly a bit over a billion(math).  It concludes as such, “Conclusions  The present study provides the most accurate estimate to date of MC prevalence in each country and territory in the world. We estimate that 37–39 % of men globally are circumcised. Considering the health benefits of MC, these data may help guide efforts aimed at the use of voluntary, safe medical MC in disease prevention programs in various countries.”  I like the part about “considering the health benefits of MC, these days my help guide efforts aimed at the use of voluntary, safe medical MC in disease prevention programs in various countries.”  Pretty sure you said the NIH said the opposite but who knows.

High blood pressure, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases that are products of the environment where fast food is more available that organic items. Or where medical facilities are overbooked because the population of three inner city blocks, where the main demographic is black or Hispanic, is already five to ten times more than an entire town or village in the suburbs.  This is just risk calculation and prioritizing based off of who’s the least likely to survive. It’s no coincidence that black women die more giving birth than other women by ratio, or high blood pressure being the highest in minority communities. I see your take but in this case, the science and stats say that much like someone in a immunocompromised position, they’re at a higher chance of dying. That’s just how it is.

z2u8f1w	Traditionalist ideals don’t mesh well with modern society, for instance it’s not really possible for many to sustain a single income household so the wife must work.   I suspect that many men would like to go back to traditionalism if they felt they were getting a fair deal: women going back to traditionally feminine roles, the economy, culture, and society at large favoring nuclear families, lasting marriages, chastity, and fatherhood. But clearly those ships have sailed.  Most men just want a fair deal, fewer false accusations, equal footing in family court, paper abortions, women to ask men out and pay for dates and date men who earn equal or less than them. All this since men are expected to do half the household chores and child rearing only seems fair.   Most women want men they are attracted to, including men that are masculine and make more money than them. Fewer men going to college, having ambitious careers, and high paying jobs combined with women doing all that means there are less eligible partners as women don’t want to “date down.” Many women are happy having casual flings with these hot, unsuccessful guys, but don’t want to marry them. The list of eligible men is short.  Porn is a much easier outlet for sexual frustration than a one night stand. Dating for men often isn’t fun, it’s work, it’s another job to entertain the woman, say the right thing and make it work. Games are just a fun pastime, that one’s simple. It’s more active than TV, and it doesn’t require too much money to start, that’s really it, just a hobby. As for guys getting consumed by it or porn, that’s a different problem that deals with mental health, culture, and the lack of support for young guys.  I’m not blaming women for any of this (most of them anyway). However, if they want dating and relationships to improve, they need to think outside of themselves and their man and do than just condemning badly behaving men. Young men need real support and direction, and men and women need to make compromises in order to reach each other.	1640984574.0	hqq7cm6	t3_rstsnd	t1_hqpwp7l	/r/MensRights/comments/rstsnd/mens_fascination_with_porn_and_games_is_on_the/hqq7cm6/
87vc6k6h	Yes, that woman does show toxic masculinity.  Yes, that man is showing toxic femininity.  Anyone who tells a man how they ‘should’ behave is exhibiting toxic masculinity. Masculinity exists as an expression from an individual but is created by a culture. The culture creates a warped sense of what a man should be, and some men become isolated, angry, maybe they lash out because they don’t have any other emotional outlet. The toxicity is manifested in the failing of the culture to tell men it’s okay to be yourself, to express yourself however you would like to without feeling judged.	1640984617.0	hqq7g5i	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqq5o9b	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqq7g5i/

30ymvhrd	They are using a correlation fallacies and doing so in a cherry picking manor.    For example let’s say (correctly) that having diabetes makes one more prone to complications from Covid and let’s say a larger percent of blacks have diabetes than whites so corresponding higher percent of blacks have Covid complications.   Being black is correlated to Covid issues but being black isn’t the cause, meaning it’s not a risk factor.   Diabetes in this case is the risk factor regardless of race.   They are giving or denying anti-virals but based on a correlation not the actual risk.   Of course it goes farther than just that error.  They consider some correlations but discard others which makes it clear it’s about identity politics not about targeting those individuals who would most benefit.

It states that the formulation of masculinity in our culture is toxic, such as telling men that if they want to be masculine they have to ‘man up’.   The condemnation of toxic masculinity is an attempt to reformulate the way our culture treats men, raises them, tells them how to express themselves. To restructure masculine ideals that say you have to be dominant, you can’t show emotion, you have to be strong, things that don’t actually represent who men are in all their varied forms.	1640985106.0	hqq8la0	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqq4f42	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqq8la0/

k5qcy8	> So……for the 4 billion of us  Running water is just a bit of rhetoric, indeed it does not need to be running at all! It doesn't need to be potable, treated, or whatever else, you just need basic water. And yes, hygiene is easy.  > Or how about the people that do have problems because of it?  Well I addressed this: ["An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction. This therapy ... allow[s] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision."](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)  This is uncommon. And like pretty much every single other medical procedure, you address it if and when it becomes a problem. You don't start removing body parts when there is no issue and the chance of an issue is slim.  >due to a botched circumcision.    Arguably the complication rate is literally 100%, since [the foreskin which is the most sensitive part of the penis](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Sorrells.gif) ([Full study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847)) and since circumcision is not medically necessary.  Only by ignoring the removal of the foreskin can a lower complication rate be claimed. Or complications be limited only to surgical complications.  Ethicist Brian Earp discusses this idea: [“if you assign any value whatsoever to the [foreskin] itself, then its sheer loss should be counted as a harm or a cost to the surgery. ... [Only] if you implicitly assign it a value of zero then it’s seen as having no cost by removing it, except for additional surgical complications.”](https://youtu.be/SB-2aQoTQeA?t=2m32s)  >bad information   This is good medical information. It seems you don't like it so you try to attack it as bad.  >Such as paraphimosis cant be cured by circumcision.   Addressed above. This seems like a strawman fallacy.   >I believe circumcision is hygenic  As such you are free to circumcise yourself.  The standard to intervene on someone else's body is medical necessity. The Canadian Paediatrics Society puts it well:  [“Neonatal circumcision is a contentious issue in Canada. The procedure often raises ethical and legal considerations, in part because it has lifelong consequences and is performed on a child who cannot give consent. Infants need a substitute decision maker – usually their parents – to act in their best interests. Yet the authority of substitute decision makers is not absolute. In most jurisdictions, **authority is limited only to interventions deemed to be medically necessary.** In cases in which medical necessity is not established or a proposed treatment is based on personal preference, interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices. With newborn circumcision, medical necessity has not been clearly established.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)  To override someone's body autonomy rights the standard is medical necessity. Without necessity the decision goes to the patient themself, later in life. Circumcision is very far from being medically necessary.  >and not required for most of us in North America  It's about 99%.  >, but it’s a simple procedure  Simple does not mean that it's medically necessary. Nor does it contribute to its medical necessity.  Any number of surgeries can be simple. That is not an argument to perform them. Rather the need to perform them must be based on the actual medical need.  > that can save grief down the road.  You just talked about "not required for most of us in North America" and then you talk like you're discussing routine circumcision of newborns. Along with your 4 billion comment.  So which is it? It seems like you're trying to play both sides here. No matter which one I address you can go back and say 'but I said this'.  This is also essentially portraying it as an either-then-or-now scenario. This is a false dichotomy. It doesn't need to happen at all.  > The MRA movement isn’t going to win many outside support if we keep collectively crying about our penises.  This is a weird strawman and attack. I'm here to discuss circumcision, nothing else. Who said I was crying? That's a strawman, trying to pin a weird emotion on me to blow it down.  >  > Let’s fix the important shit first.   Fallacy of relative privation.  The fallacy of relative privation rejects an argument by stating the existence of a more important problem. The existence of such a worse issue, the fallacy insists, thereby makes the initial argument irrelevant. This fallacy is also known as the appeal to worse problems or “not as bad as”.  https://academy4sc.org/video/fallacy-of-relative-privation-all-problems-are-relative  So going back to the original response, I notice you didn't respond to my addressal to "benefits out weighing the negatives". I gave all the stats, you didn't respond to any of them (with the possible exception of hygiene, which I addressed again). None of this makes circumcision medically necessary. Not by a long shot. Nor did you respond to the value of the foreskin itself, which puts the whole calculation off (and that ratio is still not the standard, medical necessity is).	1640986283.0	hqqba9s	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqpx2c9	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqqba9s/
3nrxdp	Well, there are a lot of confounding factors.  1. The closure of MGTOW and incel other subs lead to many redditors coming here as the sub nearest to those closed. I've never been tho any of thise subs so I can't corroborate claims made about those subs, but the MGTOWers I've seen seem reasonable. 2. This sub has a very non-censoring policy, so we also get feminists and other who post here. Sometimes they identify as such, sometimes not. I rarely look at post histories unless things really don't make sense. 3. We occasionally get posters here from againatmensrights looking for subject matter. By reading that sub you can see that many have created a burner account to try and stir things up here.  There may be other things, but basically because of changes to reddit the community has changed, and not always for the better. Some things get downvoted to oblivion real fast, a few things I've even reported, but generally I don't upvote or downvote unless I strongly agree or disagree.  But despite these posters supporting banning dissidents (if I read that right), the mods are still doing things the same way. So I'd not worry about it that much.  I think it's better to try and reason with feminists if possible, if not I spend some time trying to nail down what they support and object to. Basically I've not seen any who see any problems with the VAWA + Duluth Model + mandatory arrest policies requiring police to arrest male DV victims of females. They simply define anything feminism says or does as 'equality' and real discussion is impossible.  So stay or do, but I'd not worry too much about the responses to this post. Your choice of course.	1640986379.0	hqqbi5h	t3_rsfong	t1_hqq6abb	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqqbi5h/

30ymvhrd	Yes, it matters.   Femicide is when a woman is murdered because she’s a woman.  She is being killed specifically because of her gender.   Spain, according to the article will now count any murder of a woman by a man as femicide even if the murder wasn’t due to victim’s sex (so it wasn’t actually femicide).   The only reason I can think of to do this is to intentionally far over exaggerate femicides.   It’s a way to make it look like there’s more hatred against women than there actually is.    Also flawed in this accounting is to assume that when a woman kills another woman it’s not because of her gender.  They are essentially saying whenever a man kills a woman it’s must be because she was a woman but gender never plays a role when a woman kills another woman.    They of course don’t assume when a man is murdered his gender was a factor.    It’s very one-sided, biased accounting to overplay violence against women while downplaying violence against men.	1640986939.0	hqqcsdo	t3_rt3c11	t3_rt3c11	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqqcsdo/

It's rather difficult to look those things up, but this is from previous legislation in Spain.  * https://www.equaltimes.org/the-ongoing-struggle-to-end-gender?lang=en * **From the lack of legal protection, now resolved…**  * Thanks to the protests following Ana Orantes’ death, Spain began to see the prosecution of gender-based violence and the emergence of restraining orders, but such measures proved insufficient and the feminist movement kept up the pressure until its calls for new legislation were met. The long-awaited law was finally passed in 2004 **and included an increase in prison terms**, prevention measures, awareness-raising and specific training on gender-based violence.  So it looks like any man who is accused of killing a woman will automatically face an increased sentence. I can't find any reference to how much longer the sentences will be.

7wmdiqb	Feminist theory, and by extension gender studies, are based on an existential understanding of the experiences of women, but a shallow stereotyped framing of "men" as a homogenous class of sub-humans with limited emotional intelligence and a generally brutal personality. This ideological gynocentrism, mixed with marxist theory, provides a hive like environment of intravalidation.  The idea that feminists are entitled to spaces in which feminism operates unchallenged and unaffected by external laws, ethics and morality, is a particularly feminist core idea. It is no more reasonable than members of a house hold declaring that the laws and morals of the US do not apply on their property. Clearly, if hate speech is given an enclave or safe space it which it is validated and nutured without recource, it will grow and spread.  Your belief is this idea that feminists are "entitled" to so called safe enclaves, shows you are still affected by your gender studies mom.  It take courage to move away from these core beliefs, and re-examine their justifications and reasoning, and your clearly have both the courage and the ability to do so. Your mom taughtyou what she believed, and that couldn't have been all bad as you have independent thoughts. Now use the tools your mom gave you to re-examine some of your core beliefs.  Either way, you are welcome here. We can disagree with each other, but still find common experience, as really, we are far more similar than we are different, and difference is a strength not a weakness.	1640989387.0	hqqibh4	t3_rsfong	t1_hqqeu3p	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqqibh4/
87vc6k6h	I’d call it nuance. It’s stating that masculinity doesn’t have to be toxic, it isn’t inherently toxic in any sense in that a culture formulates it’s own forms of masculinity. It isn’t masculinity’s fault that it’s formulation in our culture has become toxic in certain expressions. Masculinity can be positive or it can be negative, if we’re in a culture that tells men to ‘man up’ then unfortunately that’s a negative representation of what people think masculinity should be.  We agree that the bad things are bad, if you feel that toxic masculinity as a term is attacking you, okay fair enough. But here I am trying to explain that it doesn’t simply say men are bad, it says some men have been told that masculinity means xyz and that has caused men to act out in ways that are destructive. Therefore the masculinity we’ve taught them is a failed version of masculinity, it isn’t masculinity entire, but it could be something else, we could change the way we talk about masculinity and it could become something that doesn’t tell men to man up or quit being a pussy or stop crying.  What’s frustrating to me about this is that I’m seeing a bunch of men here who are really sad and angry that they feel they’ve been let down and are being shit on. And whether you want to call it toxic masculinity or anything else, the people who call it that or something else want the same thing. They want men who feel good about themselves.	1640989428.0	hqqier6	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqqfshl	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqqier6/

At least in Catholicism it goes something like this: humans were given a free will to do whatever they want and after death they will be judged. Free will implies that you are responsible for your deeds which makes responsibility in itself a gift of similar value to free will. It is not responsibility in front of society but in front of God.

gatel	What I mean is the only way to progress has for a long time been using the strength of feminism (as backed by the elites) against them.  Specifically because MRA are censored out of all media and feminists are promoted on the major media, the best way to get our message out there is to get feminists to do it for us.  How do you do that?  You provoke them to sound off with their man hating bullshit in public instead of in secret.	1640989517.0	hqqilvp	t3_rsfong	t1_hqpidub	/r/MensRights/comments/rsfong/ive_recently_been_told_by_members_of_this_sub/hqqilvp/
3nrxdp	> Correction, any man who kills a woman I'm which gender was determined to he a motivator.  Apparently previously that required that they be in a relationship.  * Since 2003 Spain has logged killings as gender violence if there is evidence that the killer and the victim had been or were in a relationship.  So if they were in a relationship, it automatically becomes GBV. Now it looks like any killing of a woman by a man will be logged as GBV.  So this is assigning motivation, no determination is done.  > Much like killing someone because they are black carries harsher sentences. Killing a woman ~~just because you hate women~~ carries a larger sentence.  FTFY. Whereas killing a man is apparently not much of a crime.  > I'm not sure people who kill women because they hate women are a group people should be defending.  But that's not what's being done.  In the US we arrest male DV victims of women because of sexist laws written by feminists. Instances of female on male DV get counted as assaults against women, and this gets transmuted into lies that women don't commit DV or that they do so only in self-defense (Duluth Model I'm looking at you). This is the same shit. I'm sure you have no problems jailing male DV victims as your twist that into protecting female victims.	1640989546.0	hqqio8k	t3_rt3c11	t1_hqqh4m9	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqqio8k/

3nrxdp	> Free will implies that you are responsible for your deeds which makes responsibility in itself a gift of similar value to free will.  Maybe, but they also say that god and the devil muck with it. God is supposed to answer every prayer, but unless that answer is 'no' then some divine action has changed cause and effect on earth. And the devil is said to give people anything they want for their soul later, same effect.  Your exposition is great BTW and I'm not disagreeing, I'm just pointing out that the free will dialogue is contradicted by other biblical claims.  I also don't necessarily read his text as responsibility to god, it reads more like responsibility to women and society to me.

4rmz6	The problem is continuing to use it after it has been explained that a significant amount of people consider it attack, or that the source of the phrase is from a group outright hostile to men, shows that you don't actually care about how men feel. Your intention is to preach to them and then pat yourself on the back for trying to have done well.  You can't nuance your way out of what you said, you are trying to talk out of both sides of your mouth, and that is the inherent problem with the phrase. Hell most "Toxic Masculinity" could be 1 to 1 relabeled as Feminine privilege without issue and it would be as far as terminology goes accurate. That is why you get the hostility to this phrase, because it was a phrase born of hostility.	1640990124.0	hqqjyzf	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqqier6	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqqjyzf/

k5qcy8	You don't need filtered, chlorinated, UV treated water to take a bath. You don't, basic water will do. You don't like that so you really come out swinging, seemingly in the hope that I won't address it. Ever taken a dip in the creek? In the lake?  You need that water for drinking and yes for brushing your teeth - I notice how you try to misportray that and strawman that on me. Easy to see through.  >drinking water  Drinking water is, wait for it, *drinking water*. Yea you really go off trying to conflate everything to attack.  Yup you really keep going off too.   > Here you go cupcake  And straight out ad-hominem fallacy. X2. X3. X4. X5. X6.  And you swing at the other again, it's quite something to watch. Let's go back and count. X1. X2. X3. X4. X5. X6. X7.   >where it is given the opportunity to enter your body  Basically another strawman fallacy. That's X2. Drinking and bathing are different things. Again, ever gone swimming in a lake? Ever gone into the water at a beach? You really want to lash out at the notion of any of that even touching you.  More swinging at the other. That's X8.   >trying to provide drinking water.  More conflation, already addressed. Let's go back and count those too. X1, X2, X3, X4.  >nuclear powered desalination plants.  Desalination for drinking. That's conflation X5.   More lashing out, aka attacking. That's X9, X10, X11.  So your entire response was ad-hominem, strawman, attack, lash out, and conflate. That's quite a list. Six (6) straight out ad-hominem fallacies. Two (2) strawman fallacies. Eleven (11) attacks/lashing out. And five (5) conflations.   **I'm just going to count them all as a fallacies for simplicity. So that takes you up to twenty-four (24!) fallacies. Wow!** Twenty four fallacies! You went hard on them trying to lash out.   **Looks like your tactic was to lash out so hard, complete with strawmans and conflations, to hope that the other person would be dissuaded from responding.** Well it's all easy to see through and fun to call out.  It also seems that was all you had. **Notice how you don't discuss the entire topic of circumcision**. Not one word. **No response to the medical data, no response to the medical ethics, no response to the value of the foreskin, no response to the strawmans (plural) that I called out, no response to simple operation does not contribute to its medical necessity, no response to you trying to play both sides, and no response to the fallacy of relative privation.** Yup. No response to anything.  I think you had no response to any of it, so you try full out attack in an attempt to distract away. You tried really hard with a full song and dance to get away from the topic. Bub it's so very easy to see through.	1640990325.0	hqqkf6j	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqqdl8a	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqqkf6j/

30ymvhrd	You are right, it’s not very clear from the article.  Their first paragraph and the one you quote frame the change very differently.  There is no mention of exactly how they will determine gender played a factor, but gender playing a factor is not the same as killing someone because of their gender which is what femicide is.   Let’s say a wife begins domestic violence and it accelerates getting very violent and she dies because he’s stronger.   Gender played a role, but she wasn’t killed because of her gender.  She was killed because she started a confrontation that got violent and the other person was stronger.   Labeling such an event a femicide indicates she was killed because she was a woman which is very misleading.     It’s much like saying because women earn less than men, employers must be discriminating against women in pay.      Many of the laws that discriminate against men have been justified by twisting facts to show oppression against women which doesn’t actually exist.   I think Spain’s new, misleading crime accounting methods can be used that way, (which is likely the intent) which is why I think it’s a men’s issue.   Justifying discrimination starts with propaganda.	1640991080.0	hqqm2oc	t3_rt3c11	t1_hqqh323	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqqm2oc/

I do care about how men feel, which is why I’ve taken the time to respond to you and others here without simply saying ‘you’re all idiots fuck you’ because that’s not how I feel.   You’re saying the phrase hurts some men. Agreed, which is why I’m trying to use nuance to dig a little deeper into what the phrase means. At what point have I patted myself on the back? Is it because I’m taking this disagreement seriously?   You want to accuse me of talking out of both ends of my mouth? Okay, and you’ve resorted to tactics implying I’m arrogant and saying I don’t care about men simply because I’ve challenged your perspective. At no point have I demeaned men for the behavior some deem toxic masculinity, I am not demeaning you for believing men deserve better. Ad hominem, eh?   You aren’t taking the time to seriously consider what I’m saying if you’re deciding my only goal is to make the men on this subreddit feel worse. I’ve intentionally stated numerous times that we want the same outcome, men who feel good about themselves.   So why point a finger at me like we’re enemies? Once again, men’s feelings are hurt by the term toxic masculinity? Okay, let me try to explain why the phrase you hate is geared towards changing the way our society treats men for the better. That is all I’ve tried to explain. If you disagree with my argument about the phrase, I don’t care, that’s fine, we disagree. But there’s no basis for your claim that I don’t care.

If you disagree with my argument about the phrase, I don’t care, that’s fine, we disagree. But there’s no basis for your claim that I don’t care. Read through the comments I’m posting. You’re absolutely wrong about that much.   This right here is the entire problem, you don't get to explain that men should not be offended by it. Continuing to do so is offensive and is why you get the hostility. Your insistence on using the phrase and then demanding men accept it would ironically cut under your definition of toxic masculinity.  No other group would be forced to accept a phrase they found harmful and yet here you are after being told repeatedly that is the case making that argument. Want to help men grow, don't diminish their right to self determination.  The phrase is born of hostility, and even with a perfect definition, its connotation implies it.	1640991623.0	hqqn8mv	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqqm8jn	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqqn8mv/

4jhltni0	In Spain the gender violence law "LIVG" that was enacted in 2004 was limited only to people in relationships and the law only applied to men, not women. There are separate courts to prosecute these men, and judges can be ordered to undergo training programs if they are not sufficiently pro women.  The definitions of violence was then expanded to include psychological violence. Looking through a partners mobile call list, intense questioning etc. One husband was convicted and fined for farting in front of his wife in Valencia.   If a man slaps his wife it is a felony crime and goes through the woman's only court. The sentence is for a felony. If a woman slaps her husband it is a misdemeanor and goes through the normal court system. The punishment is for a misdemeanor.  Not surprisingly these laws are exploited and lawyers will push their clients into abusing them in order to get child custody.  The Supreme Court has ruled that a judge can convict on just the word of a woman, without  witnesses or supporting evidence, as long as she doesn't change her story during the process from the initial complaint or that the man cannot prove his innocence.  These laws are now being expanded to include men that are not in a relationship with the women in question. This article deals with the thin edge of the wedge and starts to include murder by a non partner, it will then include violence by men in general and later psychological violence by men in general against women.   Spain is considered to be the 5th safest country in the world according to university of Georgetown and every year 60 women are killed by their partner on average (50% by immigrants, 15% of the population are immigrants). Spain's population is 47.000.000  , husband deaths aren't recorded only wives and girlfriends. The law has been in effect for 15 years now and the number of female partners killed is still an average of 60 per year. The law is useless in terms of stopping women being killed.	1640991892.0	hqqnsla	t3_rt3c11	t3_rt3c11	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqqnsla/

You’re not being forced to do anything just because I disagree with you. You clearly don’t like my explanation of toxic masculinity but you’ve skipped over the point I made in my last post entirely.

46a6opwn	It certainly is a difficult situation for you.  Putting children ahead of personal safety is not a good idea, because children depend on their parents and if the parents are no more, then they are in an even worse situation than less than adequate availability. The first instinct of parents in an airplane emergency is to put a mask on children, but that's the wrong thing as unless they take care of themselves first, they won't be able to take care of the children in future and children can't take care of parents.  I was speaking more about stability of availability for the "accidents" and bed wetting you mentioned. That should resolve once the children return to stability and their fears are eased and then you could consider gradually introducing a substitute they also trust to free you up a bit more.  I wish you luck in obtaining greater availability over the short term to stabilise matters and then move forward. However, even if you can't, children are adaptable and as long as they can develop a new stability they trust, things should eventually improve, but it will take longer.	1640993120.0	hqqqg6q	t3_rsp8h5	t1_hqp1cvc	/r/MensRights/comments/rsp8h5/relationship_fell_apart_how_do_i_help_the_kids/hqqqg6q/

aba5aa1o	Hello, and Happy New year, I am a lady and I am really sorry that you have witnessed their shameful demeanor and experienced their toxic vibes. I completely understand that you find mall shopping with them unbearable. Maybe if they were of the kind, compassionate women, your journey would be a little more pleasant.  But they made rough mistakes. First of all, usually the driver of the car should get off and take care of the pump. It's normal for her daughter to do it, if her mom's ass is lazy enough. Second, your mother made a bad mistake to remain silent. If I were her, I would retort that shake to watch how she treat my son, and her other mistake is the tricking. Clearly, She should ask you, if you wish and state you the plan if other people gonna come. You deserve so much better, and whenever you are ready I wish you to be blessed with a loving supportive partner, who will nurture you and treat you with respect the way you deserve. Hoping that the new year shall give a good refresh to everyone.	1640993709.0	hqqrr5l	t3_rsx8wm	t3_rsx8wm	/r/MensRights/comments/rsx8wm/apparently_not_pumping_gas_is_ungentlemanly/hqqrr5l/

46a6opwn	However, the feminists would argue that over 15 years the number of women killed as a percentage of population has actually decreased, assuming population has in creased over 15 years, so their program is having an effect. I would not be surprised if this emboldens them to extend misandry even further in an attempt to reach zero women deaths by men.  What is appalling though is believing the end justifies the means and equivalent mens rights (as in justice for both accused and accuser and discrimination bias) don't matter in all of this yet no-one seems to be considering the consequences to men or even to society.  It will be ironic if women turn to men to fix the mess they will create by driving men away, but the way the legislation is tending, they seem to want to make men generally responsible for any discomfort a woman subjectively feels, even if they are not in a relationship, and to pay one way or another as compensation.	1640994288.0	hqqt1pi	t3_rt3c11	t1_hqqnsla	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqqt1pi/

Your view of this situation is objectively inaccurate.  He *is* justified in arming himself and confronting a trespasser. He doesn’t need to feel threatened to arm himself and say “Leave my property.”  The point at which he was justified in shooting is when the man rushed towards him and said he was going to take the gun and “use it” on the homeowner. Literally anyone, in that moment, would be justified to use lethal force to neutralize that violent trespasser.	1640994537.0	hqqtlrd	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqqt6de	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqqtlrd/

I had to lock myself into a room to protect myself from her.  Nobody believed me or took me serious because "she's such a sweet and innocent woman". People experienced her abusing me and acted as if things never happened.   I can't imagine people looking away if a  man would have done the things she did.  She was the kind of nutjob who would scream at me on the street and then shout at people that there's nothing to look at when they stared.  There was no way I could have called the police because she would have started crying and they would have arrested me.  I had recordings of her abusing me but during consulation I was told that I can't use them due to breaking privacy laws.   I was close to killing myself but decided to give up my life to go on to protect the children from her. She manipulated my entire family and friends against me. She never worked, neglected the children but nobody ever called her out for her BS. But people would be sure to attack me whenever they see me.  I would have been just another bitter man who commited suicide.  Even after prooving at court that she's lying with every statement there were no consequences. The court psychologist said that it doesn't change anything about the glowing report about her if she lies or not.  The judge laughed at stone hard proof. They refused to contact schools to confirm my reports. She dismissed the hospital report that I was hospitalized because of her.  I called helplines for men but no one can help. The only thing they will tell you is that they know that this happens and that I need a very good lawyer. Since I am a broke father who raised the kids since birth while working at home I don't have any.  Although the mother only sees the kids four days per month she doesn't have to pay alimony and the judge ruled that I have to drive one and half hours to bring the kids to her on her weekends, even though she is the one who moved away.  This world is rotten to its core. No newspaper in my country would ever dare to report ont he struggles of men or fathers during the pandemic. Every week there is a new one about how hard things are for women though.  When talking about homeschooling during lockdowns they don't even mention fathers. It's all about mothers.	1640995063.0	hqqur7v	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqo4qff	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqqur7v/

cbbbdhgm	He only shot after the trespasser was overtly physically trying to disarm him. Go try stepping on someone’s property and doing that and see what happens. This was not cowardice, it was cause and effect. The belligerent trespasser had no right to act aggressively towards the property owner and try to disarm him. Had he done that to a police officer, he would have also been shot.   You seem to be confusing the two parts here.  1. He confronted a trespasser after arming himself. This is a perfectly reasonable, ethical, and legal strategy to ejecting a belligerent trespasser.  2. The trespasser chose to attack him, at which case he was within ethical and legal boundaries for using lethal force.   A homeowner never has an obligation to try to deescalate, or hide inside and call the police, because there is a belligerent trespasser on his property. He does, though, have the right to arm himself and confront the trespasser again.	1640996208.0	hqqx55a	t3_rsl1se	t1_hqqucof	/r/MensRights/comments/rsl1se/texas_man_gets_gunned_down_by_his_exwifes/hqqx55a/

cx05s	You fucktard.  You need potable water to wash, cook, clean, etc.  I can’t believe that you and buckaroo there are absolutely that stupid.  Potable water.  Potable.  Say it over and over so it sticks.  Potable water doesn’t mean pure water, it means safe for human consumption.  No disease. Bad metals.  No dead people in the water.  There is no fucking straw man there you uneducated idiot, you need potable water to wash, clean and drink.  Potable water can be made with 3 different routes, mechanical filters, chemicals and heat treatment(boiling or evaporating)  All of them have flaws, however, they will make the water potable.  Filtration may not get all biological elements, so is best mixed with a secondary system, such as chemical treatment or heat treatment.  This isn’t purifying water my low browed contemporary, this making it potable.     And yea, I drink water right out of well in back ground.  It’s fucking potable water courtesy of natures filtration.  I can also show you all kinds of perfectly nice looking creeks that will make you shit for months courtesy of guardia.  My well has been tested.   I know it’s good. The river behind it, is both cold and fast, which hinders the development of disease.   Slow creeks or creeks from ponds?  You go ahead bud.    Like seriously, how fucking hard can you struggle to prove yourself right when you are just so obviously wrong on so many levels.    Like seriously.

53y0s059	It’s not saying that women don’t care. Obviously anyone who isn’t an abusive piece of shit would care if their boyfriend, husband or son wanted to kill themselves. Just like it would be the other way around. The issue is society not realizing how bad this is. And lets be honest, most people who are so depressed that they are willing to kill themselves don’t have wives, daughters, or girlfriends that love them. These people are *alone*. Like I said the issue is that people (as in society as a whole) are unaware and blind to the fact that men are more likely to commit suicide and kill themselves and that this “toxic masculinity” is not to blame. That is the whole point for Mens Rights, it is to advocate, and inform people on the issues that men face in hopes of getting these issues to be known facts and help resolve them.	1640996617.0	hqqy0a7	t3_rsrkk3	t1_hqp97l3	/r/MensRights/comments/rsrkk3/male_suicide_is_not_caused_by_toxic_masculinity/hqqy0a7/

30ymvhrd	I don’t get your analogy.   This isn’t about a program for women it’s about purposely misrepresenting violence to portray a false sense of men murdering women simply because they are women.   I think homelessness is a problem especially affecting men.  It’s an area that needs attention but a homeless system should help all homeless people in need regardless of their sex.     Hospitals don’t turn away one sex because the other sex is more prone to a certain health condition.  They help anyone in need of care.   The same should be true of domestic violence shelters and homeless shelters.	1640996738.0	hqqy9gg	t3_rt3c11	t1_hqqncch	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqqy9gg/

99josor0	>They were also taken by the ussr?  From what little history I know, Romania has indeed been one of th USSR's bitches. But by the time I was born, Nicolae Ceaușescu, the last communist leader had cut ties with the USSR. Basically he flipped them off and told them that Romania will not be bending over for them any longer. But life was still crap for the citizens though, with severe food shortages, isolation from the rest of the world and so on. He took a cap between the eyes in the Christmas of 1989, 11 days after I was born. There was a revolution and both him as well as his wife were executed. The people suffered under him, but the country was really well off, with multiple production lines in multiple cities, good agriculture, amazing tourist destinations and virtually no debt at all. Unfortunately the eagles surrounding him became the new democratic regime's politicians and now we're in the crapper once again. We have supermarkets and foreign products, even Starbucks, but we don't produce anything and people can barely afford anything at all. I'm 32 and I still live with my parents.

z6f8x18	I'm just not sure if there is a clearly distinguishable toxic femininity and toxic masculinity at all. And whether it's good to distinguish it.       Sure, there is toxic behavior in general. But how and why to distinguish between toxic masculinity and femininity, it's hard to say. It occurs to me that many people mainly use the term toxic masculinity as a stick against men. When something is disliked and can be attributed to men, it is toxic masculinity.       But it can only be my impression. It may be a language or cultural barrier. Let's leave the discussion now and I'll try to learn more about it for a while. Then I decide what to think about that term.

She doesn't respond to that directly and just keep heckling him that "every day is mens day".  As someone who's barely scraping through hell (life) most days that sickened me to the core.

The first month of their life, and the naming process  Originally supposed to be a junior but people understood why not to do that but then she went with basically ex bf Jr with her maiden name and grandpas middle name. Then in the first picture says she isn't going to co parent but "parallel parent" and can't grasp that is just co parenting.  Her responses to everything asking about co parenting or the husband's feelings were just r word.  And then when someone (the rest of the pictures) stated he could go to court to petition a name change and have a good case and maybe win if in a certain part of the us. Op got mad and a random commentor decided to attack them as well. And anyone saying op was in the wrong (that was male) got downvote spammed.

8xzopzvw	I know I’m late to the topic but I just found this sub. I’ve been to multiple court hearings over this with my ex and not one time have I been granted less money or more time with my son but you can bet your ass I still have to pay $1200 a month.   The first time I went to court I just wanted more time and the judge didn’t even acknowledge that I was even in the same room as him but coddled my ex as she spew her nonsense.   The second and third time I went to court for less monthly payment and more time, he rearranged some time where I could get all my monthly time at once but that was it.  Don’t even get me started on what kind of an absolute shit show the attorney generals office is in Texas. That is an absolute waste of recourses and time.

4jhltni0	The population in Spain has been falling as in all western countries. In Spain from 3.5  children per woman in the 70's to 1.3 per woman nowadays. 2.1 is required for population maintenance.  I think English speaking countries fell from around 2.4 in the 70s to generally 1.7 today. This is not such a hard fall as Spain, Portugal or Italy.  The law came into effect jan 2004 and today is jan 2022 so it has been 18 years not 15 as I miscalculated before. People live for longer now, the entire population in Spain has only recently started to fall.   Once you get to get to grips with all the true facts you realise that, the details are irrelevant. Feminism is an ideology that is based on lies. There is no point arguing facts v feelings because feelings just don't listen to facts.  Having said that, it is essential that all MRAs understand all the true facts in order not to go astray.	1640999908.0	hqr4zos	t3_rt3c11	t1_hqqt1pi	/r/MensRights/comments/rt3c11/spain_expands_femicide_laws_because_too_much/hqr4zos/

4zyym	From the article:  > Stone thinks that the practice was extremely rare, and that it attracted more attention than it deserves because of the temptation to spread word of the strange ritual far and wide—and even to make up fictional wife sales to sell newspapers. “In the end,”writes historian Roderick Phillips, “too little is known about wife sales to enable us to draw firm conclusions.”  So it's not fictional, just something made up on the basis of an extremely rare event.

They are labeling cases as femicide based on the sex of the people involved, clearly often without knowing that sex of the victim was the motivating factor.   They are using a classification system contradictory to the definition.  Obviously they know they are doing  so and have a reason.    In the U.S. the famous Koss survey asked women if they had ever had sex after drinking and counted any affirmative answers as rape, concluding 1 in 4 college women were raped.   Spain is doing essentially the same thing.  They are changing how they classify femicide in a way that will greatly inflate the numbers.
