737crz7b	My wife is a therapist who had a client who was sex trafficked by a “friend”. They went to NYC to go shopping and see the sights. Before they were to return home, the “friend” said she wanted to visit a friend of hers. They went to the person’s apartment and hung out for awhile. The “friend” excused herself to go to the corner store to buy cigarettes…and, never returned. The woman was repeatedly raped and then forced to prostitute herself. It took her five years to escape that life. The kicker is that she still sees her “friend” around town and the person, when she sees her, doesn’t acknowledge her or apologize.	1640832898.0	hqhwxjz	t3_rrnggo	t3_rrnggo	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrnggo/un_report_confirms_women_are_the_majority_of_sex/hqhwxjz/
82h98hd9	You got downvoted (why?!) and I upvoted you. I do think everyone should be able to vote. I also think **everyone** should be subject to the military draft, and that **includes** women. I once dated a chick in grad school who came over from Israel to attend grad school in the US. She was fit and pretty and very nice. She showed me pictures of her with her unit in the IDF, carrying a rifle. I asked her what she thought about compulsory military service, and she said "Would you fight and possibly sacrifice your life for your people and your way of life?" I said I would, and told her about my own service. She said "Well then you understand. It's about loving your people and being willing to sacrifice for your people."   She was an awesome person. She totally got it. She thought American chicks were fu&%ing children, and I understood that. She had been rocketed, shelled, and fired on, and had fired back, to defend her people. And in doing so, she had earned the right to have strong fu&%ing opinions about the world and what should be done, and I respected that. She wasn't a feminist or an anti-feminist... she didn't have time for that. She was a world citizen and had confidence and knowledge about her positions, and people respected her for it, because she had stepped up and done the big scary things, for the greater good.  I'm not Jewish, though, so things didn't proceed beyond that, LOL	1640832947.0	hqhx1d7	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqhi3ba	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqhx1d7/

18q1w2ti	>"Globally, most persons prosecuted and convicted of trafficking in persons continue to be male, with around 64 and 62 per cent respectively."  This is a direct quote from the UN report cited.  While I wouldn't be surprised that female offenders are more likely to fly under the radar or cry their way out of convictions (ie "I had to or else I'd have been hurt...") there's no evidence that supports the claim in this post that a majority of trafficking is committed by females.	1640833949.0	hqhz98v	t3_rrnggo	t3_rrnggo	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrnggo/un_report_confirms_women_are_the_majority_of_sex/hqhz98v/

qgjik0p	i meant firewood as in the twigs branches and chunks of wood from rotten or insect ridin trees. my sister certainly doesnt like chopping firewood. that's a solid point about how time consuming cooking was. one of the keys to economic development is childhood nutrition and education. i was trouble when i was a kid then during highschool i did a 180. if a household is large like if a family is rich or they have to work some distance from one another there is plenty of work to do and women would let their neighbors or friends use equipment or materials or they would outright hire folks. a lot of education can go into those aspects and i think about 60 of small farmers worldwide are women and that can take a lot of education. lol the thing about the more agreeable sex is that if they see someone as predatory, exploitative or disgusting then they will have it in them to be even more cruel and disgusting "in return". its also pretty damaging to be in the military even outside of combat due to all the trekking material transport poor conditions and the risk of hanging around low ranking military personel as it turns out that the same traits that make for good officers also makes them more trustworthy XD so support personel will be left tending to the larger portions of the army who arnt as likely to be so trustworthy due to a number of factors. overall women tend to avoid poor working conditions and even with dating a women will tend to rate herself as above average while rating an average man below average. with men it tends to be a bit more accurate but guys will rate girls based on both looks and personality but tend to be bad with estimating a girls personality	1640835738.0	hqi37cc	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqhtsuq	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqi37cc/
2u414jx5	Man invented the interpretation of religion, religion invented the sciences, the interpretation of religion stimulated the idea of strategic warfare, the military kicked out the Puritans who created an important country for the world, the cycle of war created the United States and who did not fight was destroyed. The woman took the subway built by men, came to the house designed by men, put her things on the furniture assembled by men, turned on the computer designed by men and wrote on the Internet invented by men that men are not needed and men are evil because of whom all the troubles of the earth. Well, I can only add that men motivated the leftist agenda in the geopolitics of all countries, because 20th century capitalism doesn't work in 2021.  Women scream and hate men the loudest at the moment when men gave women privileges. Ordinary men who love women do not understand how to live in this world.	1640835907.0	hqi3k7i	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqgubxe	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqi3k7i/

I have also never met a guy who hated women. I wouldn't have a friend like that.   I did know a man who was bitter about the courts because his divorce was messy and  another guy who was wrongfully accused of rape.

It will just harm them, as it does. But if Middle East is a sick body, it needs this antibiotic. Doctors say that antibiotic as a medicine can kill good bacteria along with the viruses, that's why they reccomend small dose consumption. Or can even write probiotics, that protect from antibiotics damage. (Speaking from experience.

4uvq8vx3	actually, women do not make much in prostitution and pornography. if they do, they are in the top 1% of those in the porn industry which is extremely unlikely.   also yes, pornography and prostitution does exploit women and children. i hate the mainstream narrative that sex work and pornography is empowering because the reality is very different for women in prostitution.   a woman will enter sex work because of financial troubles. “Poverty is the primary driving force behind women becoming prostitutes. Prostitution is a repression of women and children, and utilizes the vulnerability of poverty to further exploit them.” https://www.borgenmagazine.com/prostitution-poverty/  many— “82% had been physically assaulted; 83% had been threatened with a weapon; 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes; and 84% reported current or past homelessness “, “Of the 130 people interviewed, 68% met DSM III-R criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. Eighty-eight percent of these respondents stated that they wanted to leave prostitution” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9698636/   many would much rather have a stable job that being a sex worker, and this is why they cant “just leave”  —  https://www.womenslaw.org/about-abuse/forms-abuse/sexual-abuse-and-exploitation/forced-prostitution/leaving-prostitution/why  Educate yourself. Do not fall into the liberal feminism propaganda that sex work is empowering — and yes, women ARE exploited in sex work.	1640862326.0	hqj81qu	t3_rpudo8	t1_hq6q5td	/r/antifeminists/comments/rpudo8/thats_it_this_ones_completely_gone_in_the_head/hqj81qu/

1x6rbyhc	A lot of cultural appropriation is highly appreciated. Now I don't mean stealing cultural artifacts from other societies and displaying them as colonial trophies. I mean cooking like an Indian, working hard like the Chinese, Producing tech like a Russian, Making art like an African, sculpting like a European, camping like a native American. Matter of fact, if you don't steal physical artifacts from people, then whatever you're doing, if it makes your life easier, is probably alright. Imagine applying melanosilicates on your skin to survive radiation damage, and getting called out for blackface? Melanosilicate compounds are black. Or seasoning chicken with paprika and getting called out for cultural appropriation of Indian culture. Or adding agbayun to your condiments table to cure hot sauce burns, and being told your...ah; you get my point.     What is termed cultural appropriation is in most cases just preserving or spreading culture. I'm certain if the Greeks said they wanted the alphabet back we'd regard them very weirdly. And yes, People should return stolen artworks to their native societies (if requested).     Keep cooking like and Indian, and creating like an African. Don't let some dunderhead tell you you're wrong for using another culture's means of survival to survive.

I dont care about feminists,but i made fun of you guys basing your identity on anti feminism or bothering with anti femnism.  In the optics field, you lose immediately because you are opposing women.  In the argumentation area,most people here are incels,or palecons or something else right wing. So its the same bullshit but from the shit humanity has seen for thousands of years.  Ill come with a hot take. Most feminists are misandrists and have some deeply held hatreds towards straight men and women. Its not a healthy community.  This place here has people i cannot stand just like the misandrists on the other side. Paleocons,incels, religious people, fascists.  Just because feminists are garbage people doesnt mean you guys are better.  And lastly, I expected to get banned.

1x6rbyhc	And being the native in question, I can tell you it's entirely a matter of favoritism. Here, in your last year, as part of the final examination process, you must apply for a position in campus. You are not given a choice in this matter. So, females and males apply. And there are actually more females alive, thus in school. So more females apply. But despite this, a very huge percentage still fail to meet the cut off point. So the ever higher cut off points for boys is entirely means to lock most of them out. The result is a much more sophisticated crime network, as many brilliant minds loose the opportunity to advance themselves legally. So while we do not have a very high violent crime rate, we are considered the de facto capital of cyber crime and financial crimes on earth. Most of these boys, learn to code or design systems, and since they have no "papers" their skills are generally irrelevant. So apart for the occasional freelance gig, a majority of their skills are used in advanced crimes. Further, though careful lobbying, we do not have laws that restrict this. Now there have been petitions to make the cut off points equal and permanent, but the feminists, daughtered fathers and simps in government are numerous, so this is unlikely to happen. Hence more boys will be locked out of tertiary education in future, and the sophistication of "crimes" will continue to advance. I say crimes, because what is done is illegal in the client countries, not here. From online cheating, cyber espionage, criminal accounting, tax evasion systems and other interesting things.  The root cause is gynocentrism, an ideological child of feminism. It tells society to put down the boy and empower the girl. Leading to a society with more than 3 million broken arrows. And yes, considering we now have bio hackers, it's not going to be good for anyone. Specifically the feminists.	1640870978.0	hqjkzni	t3_rix4o6	t1_hpf1096	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqjkzni/

3sl19poy	I don’t know what sci fi movie you’re living in but it’s definitely not reality. Besides if you don’t mind me asking so I can confirm these statistics, what school is this in question. Also just because more women are alive by a really minutiae percentage does not by default mean there are more women on campus. Also I’m pretty sure that regardless of the school, it’s trying to heighten the national average of women in stem, so in other schools where this imaginary test may or may not be applied to get in stem positions, there are still more men entering than women on a national basis. In order to change those numbers on a national basis, there needs to be a lower standard for more women to enter the field. For example, if there is a school that one group of specific people are entering and there is a surplus of those people, a school will make the bar higher in order to cut down on disparity. Have fun with your sci fi novel in the making though. Cause half that response was sickeningly hypothetical. Boys that may get rejected for conventional positions and documentation can still do freelance work since you don’t need a degree in computer science to code. They don’t become top secret web spies, most of them just end up doing html or building a portfolio with smaller jobs like a normal person. Plus biohacking isn’t actually biotechnology hybrids, it’s legitimately a term that gym rats came up with for pushing their body over its natural limits using supplements and psychology tricks.	1640871680.0	hqjma86	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqjkzni	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqjma86/

Now, you've used terms which I assume are meant to be insulting, but I don't understand most of them. Incel I get, involuntary celibate. A fallacy, as the world is populated with very many cheap whores, so the celibacy of these chaps is entirely voluntary. Fascists I also get, but regardless of our disagreement in many positions they hold, I still consider all opinions to have some level of reasoning, and thus may have merit. Religious people are just that, believers in invisible deities, and while I will never understand them, I do understand that in this forum, they're against feminism.  Yu are right of course, on the point of loosing ground because feminism is considered a female. But as I have come to learn (through this forum), feminism is not the same as women. Thus not being a feminist doesn't mean you hate, or have to hate women. Now, some do, and that's fine. You have the freedom to hate or love whatever or whoever you want.  The mods do indeed give a fuck, but are quite tolerant to opposing opinions. This forum is not an echo chamber, your opposition is welcome. We are not always right.	1640872181.0	hqjn8nz	t3_rpftbk	t1_hqjjc24	/r/antifeminists/comments/rpftbk/do_women_cringe_at_you_guys_or_do_they_pray_to/hqjn8nz/

An example would be her listing ‘hardworking’ as a character trait that she’d like. I can give my old economics teacher who was an amazing teacher, hard working, dedicated, inspiring, properly made you love the subject. He was the poster boy for hard working, but, as a teacher, he probably didn’t make as much as he could’ve. Reckon this woman would want to date him, or is it money that she’s attracted to, and not the hard working personality trait.	1640876650.0	hqjwlrp	t3_rrsoy0	t3_rrsoy0	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrsoy0/whawhat_in_the_f/hqjwlrp/

It’s a rather hateful word because it literally means hatred for women. And I don’t think I’ve ever met even one guy that actually feels that way. Maybe that Elliot Rogers guy but then again I never met him and supposedly his issue wasn’t that he hated women he hated the fact that he couldn’t get a particular type not sure if this led to him becoming a real incel or not that’s up for debate. But regardless I have yet to meet a man that is the actual incel. Like I said it’s just a term used by women that are either upset or trying to insult usually a man when they are right about something or saying something logical or truthful that they don’t agree with.	1640878866.0	hqk1qno	t3_rs0gge	t3_rs0gge	/r/antifeminists/comments/rs0gge/theory_on_incels_and_femcels/hqk1qno/

I don't disagree with you on any point. But you do realize that this woman in the picture, Andrea Heinz, joined the sex industry because she had gotten herself into a lot of debt by 22 due to bad life choices and then made millions of dollars doing it, and then opened up a brothel for other women during the last 4 years of her career. So if she was being raped for her entire experience, I highly doubt she would have opened a brothel for other women to get raped too.  This is what we're making fun of. A transactional relationship that you agree to is not rape, especially if you consented to it.  She by the way is completely sex-negative, and believes that all sex work is bad for women, even heavily regulated.  >Also, sex-negative self proclaimed feminists are not that rare. The entirety of FDS is anti-sex work, and they seem to be called feminists in your book.  FDS is a group of extremists and is the most hated sub on reddit.

I know, it feels like a different kind of problem but I think these people share the same kind of belief in their head. (Incels & stubborn people)  They often block their own progress because they don't want to work on themselves.

7exrq0w2	>Its not just about the severity but about the frequency, and you can bet your ass both these things are tipped to one side especially in muslim countries  Women are both much more likely to commit domestic violence and do it more frequently as well.  Quoting Dr. Donald Dutton (domestic violence researcher):  > Then there's the data, the information on who perpetrates domestic violence. Now, you know the US is the world leader in this respect because there's been five excellent victim surveys done in the US. Huge samples, representative samples, starting from 1989 and running right up to 2004. And they all say the same thing. That it's 50% of reported domestic violence is bilateral. It's a two person thing, back and forth, back and forth. 35% of the remainder, the unilateral domestic violence, is female perpetrated. 15% is male perpetrated. And of that 15%, 10% or 2/3 of it, is just like a push or a shove or a slap, it's not the serious stuff. So that leaves 5% that fits the stereotype of serious domestic violence, male perpetrated domestic violence. 5% of domestic violence actually fits that stereotype. That's all.  From [Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence (Whitaker et al., 2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/):  > Almost 24% of all relationships had some violence, and half (49.7%) of those were reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases.  That means women are 2 1/3 as likely to commit domestic violence as men.  See also [References Examining Assaults by Women on Their Spouses or Male Partners: An Updated Annotated Bibliography (Fiebert, 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261543769_References_Examining_Assaults_by_Women_on_Their_Spouses_or_Male_Partners_An_Updated_Annotated_Bibliography):  > This annotated bibliography describes 343 scholarly investigations (270 empirical studies and 73 reviews) demonstrating that women are as physically aggressive as men (or more) in their relationships with their spouses or opposite-sex partners. The aggregate sample size in the reviewed studies exceeds 440,850 people ___ > especially in muslim countries  Hard to know without data. Either way, why does the average prevalence / frequency even matter in an individual case? Just because a certain race of people murders more on average, doesn't mean we should punish an individual from that race committing murder more, right? In a similar way, I don't see how you justify not punishing a woman in the same way as a man, unless you believe women are inherently better than men.	1640882396.0	hqkai4e	t3_rquh65	t1_hqjrxnh	/r/antifeminists/comments/rquh65/science_proves_the_world_has_a_profemale_bias/hqkai4e/

And as long men and women are unhappy, they will destory themself and normalize that behavior. Its the downfall of humanity and its collective concioussnes. But I blame the society, because we who came from dysfunctional families got brainwashed by sex in the city, Californication and the goverment.

1x6rbyhc	No. That would contravene the private information statute.     Regardless, in STEM, reducing cut off points is similar to allowing sub par individuals into fields they are not qualified for. That happens, and it's not going to end well. But I'm looking at the whole picture, And the whole picture does show this to be a fact. It is not Sci-Fi. I have lived it, and seen how it ends. Feminism by gynocentrism is the cause.  Biohacking is not the same as dieting and playing such games. Biohacking is gene editing to create desired results in living organisms. From creating better seeds, to creating seeds susceptible to certain diseases in order to damage the standing of agro-companies. This actually happens a lot nowadays, just more sophisticated due to the interesting methods we have of verifying produce.  Going back to stem, this gynocentric BS, make it very difficult to trust females in STEM. One always has to consider the risk that the individual is sub par, only acquiring papers through the mercies of a system laden with favoritism.  As for your point on building porfolios, that's great in the west, but doesn't work around here. A portfolio is great, but one cannot stay hungry and homeless for 5 years. You do what you need to do, and get to your life goals.  The point stands. You females want equality, then you must be treated exactly like men. That is equality. That is the stated goal of feminism. You cannot justify favoritism, based on the fact that you are female. You had the same chances in life, you got through high school. Then given the fact that we have the same capacity for intelligence, then you must attain the same cut off point as the boys. Otherwise, you're all just full of it, and equality through your methodology is just female supremacy, nothing more.	1640883852.0	hqkearq	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqjma86	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqkearq/

1x6rbyhc	Well, it's difficult for them to enter the career. If you got your hands on freshman applicants, many are females. Before the end of the semester, very few are left. A look at the coursework will show you that the material has over time been easier. Whether this is due to advancement in technology to pick up the slack, or just gynocentric activism in the senate boards, is up to you. Of course, one only has to look at how the job market is to understand these things. There's less females in the workplaces, because you can't have lower requirements for one gender to enter the workplace than another. A worker is a number that must output the market average to be viable. Otherwise, fire her and employ the young lad who can actually do the job.	1640884331.0	hqkfk16	t3_rix4o6	t1_hp0iqfj	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqkfk16/

9d5310md	Reddit is a weird echo chamber sometimes but my votes seem more normal now. I also do not have a problem with women voting however they should be required to serve the nation as much as men do. Otherwise I dont care how much a woman cries for "equality", it will only be her asking for privileges.   I dislike compulsory military service personally especially since I am in the Middle East but it is one of those aspects of life you gotta take care of. I feel like it's the state's way of getting free labor without calling it slavery.   In the very least, I think that accountability between the sexes should be equal. I hate nothing more than a "strong independent woman" that blames literally everyone else once things go wrong in her life.	1640889189.0	hqksg89	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqhx1d7	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqksg89/

3sl19poy	If the standards are lower that doesn’t imply subpar abilities it just implies that standards are higher for males because there’s simply more of them. I’m sorry you feel so personally attacked by the way that statistics work but it’s just fact that to deal with surplus, people set things higher to act as a filter. The scores that women get are adequate. Besides, it’s literally coding and computer science, something that can be done without a degree. Given the nature of coding too, there’s no such thing as producing sub par code. Codes have one conducive route to the program that’s being run so if a woman was actually subpar, then her codes just wouldn’t continue to run correctly. Coding is like math in the sense that one input has one output.	1640889583.0	hqkthrz	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqkearq	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqkthrz/

ir2g7	what's funny is that the double standard is so ingrained that if you use the same body-shaming, sexist insults on them "fat bitch, cunt, slut" suddenly you are the misogynist and "hate all women".... but if they use it against you (small PP, incel) they are definitely not misandrist because they are "empowered" to do so!... WTF?  Yet at the same time, we are all supposed to be equal... (but not really)   The best example of this was when I heard a co-worker saying the delivery guy was gay for rejecting her advances, and she sounded disgusted and angry about it... I laughed about it and told her jokingly that she sounded a little "homophobic"... She told me with a straight face "I can't be homophobic...

Yet, her identity has been kept anonymous and she has not been held to account. What a disaster. The British injustice system is truly criminal. Feminism is truly criminal. I remember being attacked relentlessly by feminists when I first wrote an article about this story. They attacked me for stating that it was a false accusation. They claimed that it wasn't proved a false allegation, despite being retracted and dismissed by the police.   It wasn't just me that they attacked. They attacked any and all newspapers that made this claim. They forced The Telegraph newspaper to amend their article on the story in which they called it a false allegation. They forced The Telegraph to apologise for calling this story a false allegation. They weren't satisfied with only killing this boy but they also went after him after his death. It's no wonder his mum took her own life. Feminism killed these two people!!

18q1w2ti	Yes, that's why I can believe the numbers might be a little low for female convictions... but I don't think the numbers are so wildly off that it'd support females being the majority if that makes sense?  Closer to 50/50 would be something I could potentially believe given crime statistics in general... especially since women are more likely to involve themselves in the less "violent" criminal behaviors. Women in trafficking operations primarily work as a "lure" to capture vulnerable people, but aren't as common in the steps further down the trafficking chain... this is why coyotes in Texas are almost entirely male, even though I'm sure many probably have females in Mexico who put them in contact with their victims.  Even Ghislaine Maxwell fits that profile, she helped to find girls, move them around, and entrap them but wasn't often as personally involved in the next steps of the process as Epstein and his colleagues. Luckily it seems like justice will be served in her case since.	1640914467.0	hqmj6vt	t3_rrnggo	t1_hqm4yhu	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrnggo/un_report_confirms_women_are_the_majority_of_sex/hqmj6vt/

7bjndvbl	I would support it if it wasn't in places that don't need feminism, like America or the UK for example. And it would have to be equal with both the goods and bads if it were in places that don't need feminism. If it was actually for equality and not equity.   I'll support it but I won't be a feminist.   If feminism is actually about equality, then they should have no problem advocating for the following: Make women register for the draft alongside men, or get rid of the draft. Make women have equal sentences for the same crimes as men, acknowledge men get sexually and physically abused and raped, make laws that make it rape if a woman rapes a man, teach kids that both men and women can be victims and victimizers, get rid of anti-male hate speech on social media (they don't remove it because it's technically not against their TOS,) have the majority of custody 50/50 if both parents are fit for it and want custody (the majority of custody cases are mothers having full custody, even when they're the abusers,) actually arrest women for domestic violence against their children, husbands, boyfriends, etc., let fathers have a say when it comes to pregnancy and abortion, have news articles label it as rape instead of "has sex with" when it comes to women raping minors, including students, acknowledge men have feelings and support them aswell, have homeless and abuse shelters for men too.   That would be actual equality but let's be real, feminists are never going to advocate for this stuff, especially with what they're still teaching children in schools. They only want the benefits of "equality." they'd be pissed if you said workplace deaths and suicides should be 50% men 50% women.	1640918253.0	hqmrkrn	t3_rsi039	t3_rsi039	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsi039/if_they_could_define_misandry_and_feminism_as_two/hqmrkrn/

We do not base our opinions by the behaviour of the radical feminists, to then dislike feminism. That would be just what they accuse us of doing.

Dad didn’t really do much  and relied on his mother for money  until a few years ago and really didn’t offer to help while my mom had seizures on the road and went to the ER frequently. He is now hard-working factory worker and sells shoes on the side and is now there for the both of us.

aba5aa1o	Probably burly ladies are more likely to go to the army, as not all ladies are small, some are tall and big - 1.8 - 2 m. I think they have higher chances. I am 1.74m, not burly enough, especially when I lost some weight 2 years ago. I'm 22. And I've seen people who look small and soft but are strong and big people, who look burly but aren't strong enough. You don't need visible muscles to be strong. You don't even have to be the strongest human in the world.  F-movement followers complain loudly that they are the ones forced to perform toxic roles and think that society has toxic expectations for them, which seem annoying. But that's false. The most toxic expectations are towards the males, and this triggers me a lot. They say, that noone would give a crap for a man who doesn't provide or similar things and the worst nightmare is not being allowed to show emotions. Guys are not robots and they too deserve unconditional love and compassion and this is why the submissive feminine pages on Instagram teach ladies to be loving and supportive to their partners. And this is why I am here, as a lady to catch every chance to send you positive nurturing vibes.	1640939946.0	hqntdzr	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqj1mf5	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqntdzr/

Some things you can try to dive into next: the philosophies that feminism evolved from; feminism being contradicted by neuroscience; feminism having no historical or factual basis; the core of the people that shaped feminism were abusive, pro-pedophilia, and wanted to kill men; the improvements in mental health and personal relationships of those who abandoned feminism.

4uj85tsl	It seems like we live in a feminine world where compassion and kindness come first at all cost. This is a huge danger for the children as it teaches them self-depreciation and harmlessness as a virtue in and of itself which means the children will be either very weak (if they are boys) and doormats or entitled brats(girls). Instead, he should show them kindness and compassion have a value as a sacrifice for something greater to be achieved in the future. There is no honour and respect that you get by depreciating yourself in front of someone who may not feel that way about you and whereas he may have done it with good intent, the road to hell for men becoming weak and incapable of standing up for themselves and valuing themselves is paved with such chivalrous gestures.	1640942206.0	hqnw8ho	t3_rsomra	t1_hqnq0p9	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsomra/an_interesting_post_from_fds_simping_is_their/hqnw8ho/

7c5l7lw7	People often call me names when I don't support something or believe something that's a temporary fix because I actually look at the end result of what happens long term with certain movements. I was born a woman, I was designed to be a woman and I have absolutely no desire to be equal to a man. Equal respect yes, for our differences. I really don't care if a man makes more than I do, they are providers by nature, they should. I don't care if they have the majority of the jobs. I don't care or desire to take on the responsibilities they have or have had. I just want to be able to be a woman, and I can't anymore. Because of the feminism movement, men don't make as much anymore, men don't have the benefits anymore, society assumes every household is two income so the price of everything is based on that. Relationships suffer now, marriages suffer, children suffer because we aren't allowed to be men and women anymore,  we have to be both and that goes against human nature!

aba5aa1o	I understand you. Feminism originally was about free Choice. Simple. But feminists are scared to be dependent and perceive the homemaking as slavish dependence, think that housewives are victims and slaves of domestic violence shit. And this poison fear turns into hatred against homemaking and the desiring homemakers end up being underrated and seen as doormats, but they are diamonds. Material success, whatever it is doesn't matter, the most important thing in life is being a good person. The point of a life is to love and being loved.

glkrg48i	Honestly, I kind of feel what your asking is too broad. to make any kind of definitive statement the 'feminists' would need a manifesto, as for me, I'm never on just one side. there are parts I agree with on the left, and parts on the right etc.. and parts where I don't care, others where I do, but am not informed enough etc etc..   my point being, I'd need to see a clearly defined list of what you're asking me to support :P because SO much of feminism today starts good, and drops off a cliff.   'we want more women in the tech world' - Ok, I'm down, if they want to sure!   'we want more women in the tech world, then patriarchy is keeping them out' - Well, no, go fuck yourselves.

Roughly speaking, even the constant hormones testosterone and samathropin will not make a woman a man.   Even calcium metabolism and cortisol and adrenaline metabolism is different in women...so the female army is something like a sedative for the female ego. A Chinese weak man with a height of 1.50 meters can easily kill a woman with a height of 1.90 with the same trim.  What can I say about feminism, I like the struggle of the women of the 2nd wave.   There was logic and results, modern feminism destroys everything...   All this politics of double standards and hypertrophy of everything because men had more power in the past? The Germans had Hitler, is that a reason to hate Germans in 2021? History is for learning and correcting mistakes, not for hating people for past mistakes.	1640950662.0	hqo6on5	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqntdzr	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqo6on5/

304eh18o	No. TRP, unlike feminism, isn't a movement. Never was. It's a way of seeing the world. And how you utilize it, is up to you. For a lot of men, it's going through the divorce system makes them take the TRP. It's not fictional imaginary ever pervasive patriarchy, where mansplaining, maninterrupting exist. Where we live in a rape culture. Jokes lead to rape. TRP is where gender differences exists.   Now, is there a toxic version of it. Yes, the ones that mixes with the PUAs.The main TRP on reddit is toxic AF. but the TRP that MRAs first used isn't.   It also learns about womens nature, though it sometimes goes to toxic level when it mixes with the PUAs.	1640957113.0	hqog4yu	t3_rsoxug	t1_hqns1lr	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsoxug/when_feminism_meats_rselfawarewolves/hqog4yu/

The next day in assembly the minus points were read out in which I was given some minus points. I had to work off the points by sweeping the courtyard. This is just a small example showing that this is not a new phenomenon.  &#x200B;  >Pablo Maggers \[4 days ago\]: ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRz8EMwOLjA&lc=UgwrsmgRTEkoRgi1UXd4AaABAg)I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRz8EMwOLjA&lc=UgwrsmgRTEkoRgi1UXd4AaABAg)I) recently lost access to my two children because my ex made a false allegation of rape against me.

35c0i	No they did not. They lobbied for the current definition and fought against one that included envelopment. Have you read the current FBI definition?  Lots of influential sexist feminists are seeking power and promoting misandry rather than helping all victims of nonconsensual sex.  For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)  She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the "victims" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely "unwanted contact"**   You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g.   Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206  > > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**  Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf  She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.  Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the "rape" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for "made to penetrate" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.  As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm  > **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**  and  > The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  vs  > **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**  and   > Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators **For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),  So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of "made to penetrators" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**  But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs "only" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group "nearly all the men were raped by other men" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...  And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.   2010 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf  2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf  2015 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf  Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known  *data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*  And non CDC study...  *A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*  The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/  Another non CDC study...  *a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*  And another non CDC study...  *National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”*  Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers  *when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*   If my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.  https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/  Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at "rapists", rather than "men".  And it isn't just the US.    Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms  So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.  Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.  https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape  Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...  > Women’s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn’t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims’ fight for justice.  https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities  **Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.  http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528  So women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men	1640974386.0	hqpiv69	t3_rsmsmq	t1_hqphqg2	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsmsmq/feminism_was_broken_from_the_start/hqpiv69/

h2jt1i58	Honest question: how is feminism a good thing for equality?  Seriously would love an answer.  because you people love to say this, you literally never back it up.  You people just spew out talking points with zero substance behind them.  At least here people can actually explain their stance and give non anecdotal reasoning behind their statement.  If it's so good, why is it literally not working and no progress has been made in 50 years?  Why is it such a rejected concept by like 75% of people if it's so good?  Funny we can agree stealing is bad, but we can't seem to agree feminism is any good.  It's not where near as clear cut as you want to pretend it is, not even close.  So I ask again, how is feminism good *for equality*?  And no, I'm not patronizing you, I am asking you to support your claim with facts as a common curtsey because of a statement on a forum you made publicly (and managed to throw insults in there too unprompted... feminism sooo good.  right?

It's always we don't owe men shit... but also, hey, I'm a woman of this group, you should respect me by default and fuck it, give me more because I "**deserve** better"  You deserve what you earn, period.  If you earned a life being a single mother because you got pregnant and kicked the father out, that's a you problem, and unfortunately the child's too to a much bigger and impactful degree.

19w9grf9	from wikipedia:  Feminism is a range of social movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unjustly within those societies. Efforts to change that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men.  u just said to give some substance then pulled out a 50 years of useless feminism and 75% of people rejecting it out your ass. lmao.  fighting for womens rights has stopped in the last couple of years as women have equal rights in most places. thats why the term now isnt all about women its equality of the sexes. to be anti feminist is undermining all the shit people have fought for.   to directly answer your question, feminism is fighting for equality. not against it. i think this sub has a skewed definition of feminism, or a lot of them are incels who wont take the time to google what it is. not saying you are but thats probably what majority of reddit sees this sub as.	1640982913.0	hqq3gee	t3_rsvbv7	t1_hqpz2gn	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hqq3gee/

h2jt1i58	So first off, I really appreciate your response and having a conversation. I am not attacking you, but am giving a detailed rebuttal.  Christianity is about helping the poor.  How does that work out?  point here you can say all you want, but what you do is what actually matters.  A man can say he doesn't hit women and believes women are princesses, does that matter though if he hits his wife?  Of course not, you don't care about the words, you care what he actually did.  >to directly answer your question, feminism is fighting for equality. not against it.  If you fight for ONE group and not ALL groups that is NOT equality.  If you own 5 cars, but you only drive one, are you driving them equally?  No, you are not, you're favoring one.  Say you are trying to get the miles up (say miles are rights) so you drive that car to get the miles up *like the rest*, are you being equal?  No, you are STILL not driving the other cars the same amount.  When you fight **for** women that is **NOT** fighting for everyone.  Calling feminism about equality sounds nice, but that's absolutely not what you people do, you favor women over men.  That is by definition not equal.  Which is 100% fine, but we ask y'all stop saying one thing while doing the other.    Let me put it this way, mens rights, MRA, *is not about equality*, it's about men, no one else.  Same concept as feminism, but for men.  Neither of those movements are about equality, egalitarianism is.    Here is a real life example of how feminism is not about equality and in fact against men, abortion.  I have literally never, not once, seen a feminist say "hold up, we are fucking men over with this, we need to include them since this impacts them"  Literally never.  Equality with abortion would be "Women need the choice, but it should not come at the expense of men (say he wants the child or not, just the opposite stance of the mother), so we should include them in the conversation"  But it's not that, at all.  It's "men make abortion hard and it's *women's* health", which is framed that way to make it all about women and blame men, that's why they refuse to use the term "family planning" anymore like we did 15 years ago.  It was to intentionally exclude men, that is by definition not equality.  I understand your reasoning behind giving me the wiki page and definition.  But what I am saying is I don't care what you say, I care what you do. And my point is *what feminism does* is flat out, undeniably, not good for the overwhelming majority of men.  If you exclude men or any group, at all, in any capacity, you are not about equality no matter what you say.  Saying it's to get women even or whatever is fine, but it's not equality and it does not benefit everyone, it benefits women.   You simply can not be about equality if you do not treat all involved equally, feminism as you stated with your definition is fighting for women, no mention of men.  That's flat out not equal treatment.  If you favor women that's fine, but don't pretend favoring women is good for everyone, it's good for women and no one else.   Feminism: the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes *favors women, excludes men*  Mens rights: The MRM in particular consists of a variety of groups and individuals (men's rights activists or MRAs) who focus on general social issues and specific government services which adversely impact, or in some cases structurally discriminate against, men. *favors men, excludes women*  Egalitarian: the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. *favors no one, excludes no one*	1640984414.0	hqq6zbc	t3_rsvbv7	t1_hqq3gee	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hqq6zbc/

Also, your reading comprehension is terrible. I didn’t say 99% of women identify as feminists. I said they buy into the feminist narrative ( “women are oppressed, underpaid, sexually repressed by men, etc.”) That in turn makes for misandrist legislation and policies that discriminate against men.	1640986442.0	hqqbn8v	t3_rs77yz	t1_hqofrpu	/r/antifeminists/comments/rs77yz/she_couldnt_handle_the_fact_that_i_have_a_height/hqqbn8v/
h2jt1i58	I am stating through action, forge the definition, feminism is not for equality, that's all.  Which is 100% fine, we just ask that people stop pretending it is when it favors women.  It's like it's worse to admit it favors women, but honestly even this sub would not care if feminists would just say they are looking out for themselves and no one else, because then we can have a discussion which leads to fixing things (much like you and I discussing here and not throwing insults and stuff).  If more responded like you did to me, the tension would be almost zero.  So I, and I am sure most others here, appreciate you for this.  We need these conversations and need them to be productive for either side to move forward with the other.  And yes, I 100% agree feminism even as we know it here and now in the US, is needed elsewhere.  There is no doubt about that.  If you lurk around here and MRA enough you'll see we mention this often.  Almost as a dig at western feminists to say you want women's rights, but you care about petty things instead of standing up for women living in real rape cultures and real male dominated societies.    I get what you are saying about FDS, but FDS is like Scientology to Christianity in my analogy.  Regular feminism is still rather extreme to men.  FDS does though crank it up way more to beyond extreme levels.  So again, I appreciate the conversation and I appreciate, and will speak for others, that you took my response for what it was and to see my perspective instead of throwing talking points at me.	1640986479.0	hqqbqct	t3_rsvbv7	t1_hqqa975	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hqqbqct/

dsa9cr2s	That’s because women like men. Actual grown-up take responsibility for their own actions, take care of themselves and have a good heart for taking care of people around them men.  NOT whiny-assed little boys.  But do not be deceived, I don’t care how good looking a man is; if he treats me badly either in words or actions I will leave.  Life is too short to put up with that kind of treatment. If a man is kind, honest and has integrity it doesn’t matter what he looks like because strength of character stands the test of time. Looks fade. Not just of course for women but for men as well.  I do not believe men get better looking with time.  This site says women don’t have the same “quote” market value as they age but neither do men. Men lose their hair. And their teeth. And they get bellies. And their muscle turns to mush. Same as us. Men and women really are not different in that way at all. And if that’s not attractive to a man to see a woman like I doubt most women would find  that attractive either. I know I don’t.  I don’t care how much money he makes because I make plenty of my own.  However if a man respects himself and takes care of himself a woman notices and that is hugely attractive to a woman.  And of course speaking for myself I noticed that right off. No one wants to crawl spend time with someone who is flabby and smelly. Doesn’t matter whether they’re a man or a woman.

If a woman were to call me a dog well they should be able to take being called a bitch. If you want equality you need to be able to take your own bullshit. Oh this hole thing with quite a few feminists I've see saying a man should take care of a woman. While a woman remains independent is a fucking contradiction. You can't be independent and be taken care of and if you say that is what a man is supposed to do it is inequality for women. Wanna know how cause the man does literally everything. If you want equality maybe start tallying down the things woman do have that men do. Which is actually everything and more. Then something most extreme feminists do is not realize you can't fucking change the entire God damn world. Something bad is always gonna happen learn to get over it and stop acting like a child.

And yeah, they were all nit picking that he was big and scary and a nazi and acting like "well yeah, I'd be quiet if a huge nazi ...." but they completely missed the point. Big Tall Fit Chad with muscles and hair and all of a sudden the women are IMPRESSED (not really scared but kinda, and they like that). It's the 'bad boy'... I mean, if the dude was holding a TV, would they realize it was about him being a crook/bad boy/petty thug? No.. So the nazi tattoos are used to insinuate he's, at minimum, a non-conformist.  And they see the girls as if they are looking 'scared' but not really.. they look impressed and curious and submissive.	1641007458.0	hqrkb33	t3_rsvbv7	t3_rsvbv7	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hqrkb33/

It seems that most feminists subs are misandrist totalitarian echo chambers.

It’s a positive movement based on improving oneself and understanding biological and social truths.  Feminism... puts men down. It’s a negative movement based on perpetuating victimhood and the bitterness that goes along with that, which it does by spreading lies and misinformation.

d1l8v4fn	In my opinion women calling other women pick me's is like men calling other men white knights or simps. Sometimes they genuinely are pick me's, sometimes they genuinely are simping, but the term gets thrown around so easily that it doesn't have a lot of meaning at all anymore. These are simply buzz words now. Like the terms Feminists like to use "incel" "scrote" if you call people those things purely as an insult, the word loses its intended meaning. And such doesn't mean much at all, most of the time it's the person throwing around insults like those who are actually the deluded ones. If I were to call a random woman on the street a bitch, does that make her a bitch?

d02d86er	Patriarchy definition:  "a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it."  Okay, so let's see if men's issues and a patriarchy can co-exist.   A patriarchy is built on the idea that men are more capable and should control things and women are weaker and should stay at home with the children.   "Men are subject to selective service". A patriarchy would see men as more capable, and therefore they should be the ones sent into war and they should make the tough decisions.   "very rarely given custody in family court" According to sexism and patriarchies, women are the ones who belong at home with the children. So the kids go to the women.   "commonly have to pay alimony" Men are supposed to be the strong breadwinners, they can pay. The poor women shouldn't have to work, they're supposed to be at home with the children after all. You know, the children that they won in the custody battle.  "are substantially more likely to be charged with the crime if done, and twice as likely to be convicted of the crime." Women aren't as smart or strong as men, so they aren't as dangerous! Let's let them off free, so they can get back to baking cookies and making sandwiches.   "They are laughed at and ignored when victims of rape and DV." Men are big and strong, they don't have to be protected like fragile little ladies. (I hope you can detect the heavy sarcasm.)  &#x200B;  When you think of stereotypes of the feminist movement, you might think of women wanting to the freedom to work instead of being forced to stay at home as a housewife. Or the idea that women are as strong as men and that they're not intrinsically better caregivers.   Now, let's see how some of those ideas about men, would be seen through a stereotypically feminist lenses.   "Men are subject to selective service." Women are just as capable as men, they can do what a man can do. If men can be drafted, then women can too.   "very rarely given custody in family court" Women aren't more nurturing then men, that's a sexist assumption. Both women and men can take care of their children.   Trying to free women from gender roles, would also free men from gender roles. If feminists fight against the ideas that one gender is inherently different or better then the other, then that idea can't be used against men. Now, some feminists are sexist as hell, and they're actually hurting men and women with their sexism. (Usually in TERF or radfem spaces.)   But feminism as a whole, the point of it is to fight sexism.	1641020192.0	hqs5e71	t3_rsmsmq	t3_rsmsmq	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsmsmq/feminism_was_broken_from_the_start/hqs5e71/

9d5310md	A lot of it is also has to do with how women show aggression, especially towards men. When a man wants to show aggression, chances are he will either directly intimidate you or assault you physically. When a woman decides to it, she cannot try those alleys because she will be weaker overall and that is an uphill battle. Nobody will take a 5'2" petite girl seriously if she decides to throw down.   Instead women show aggression through social and emotional attacks and literally anyone who has ever made a woman really mad can attest to this fact. In a sense, feminism is women's way of partaking in gang violence (mostly because they hate men as a group for some reason. Maybe they were ugly and rejected or maybe they had a shit relationship with a man in the past). This is also observable by the way they treat other women that disagree with their ways and their "empowerment". I am certain there are multiple women here who have been mistreated by the feminist hivemind because they dared disagree or ask a question the hivemind disapproved of. If feminism was truly just about women's empowerment (notice how I am not  even attempting to say equality but instead saying empowerment), these women wouldn't have been chased out.   The reason they cannot accept that men didn't really have it good and the reason they portray MRA's as evil incels, is because once they are forced to acknowledge it they cannot attack men without losing their social backing.    Or so is my theory. Feel free to add or discuss parts you disagree with, as long as your argument makes sense and isn't stemming from what you "feel".	1641025449.0	hqsc430	t3_rtb575	t3_rtb575	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtb575/the_feminist_basis_and_its_issues/hqsc430/

aba5aa1o	Originally feminism was simply about free choice. If you wanna be a housewife, free to go, if you wanna be a man who likes to focus on you family more, completely free to go. But unfortunately f-movement turned into poison. But I as a lady second guess patriarchy, although I submit to my boyfriend, because it make males suffer. They aren't full-power masters as moderns try to describe them. They weren't allowed to show emotions. What kind of regime gives men rights and economic power, but deprives them from the right to express feelings. This is the core reason why I am pro-mens rights. Old-school patriarchy also didn't allow men to get closer to their families and other similar things. These disturbing things about patriarchy must be most regarded, because you guys deserve compassion and loving environment. And I wish you to be gifted by fate with loving, adorable partners.

It's full of comments written by someone that is clearly extremely young that likes playing computer games for children. She has an obsession with playing computer games for young girls, like really young girls. What's a woman in her 40s/50s, one with kids doing playing computer games? Her overly exaggerated, pornographic story does not add up at all!! It's clearly nothing but a figment of her own imagination.   Don't let perverts/lowlifes like this girl her drive you to separate from women.

ebllwz7n	Also were talking about the USA right because I live here granted it's Tennessee but I still don't see much privileges men have but I do for women oh boy I see a lot for women like for example the healthcare plan here is called tenncare guess how you can get on it..... Be disabled or be a women that's pregnant or be a woman with ovarian cervical or breast cancer nothing for men.. btw all the easy non hard labor jobs are taken by women here I have a herniated disk but due to not having a car or health insurance (can't stand past an hour) I can't get it officially recognized again in Tennessee their is a transportation system though for women and children but not for men I call that privilege	1641033068.0	hqskudx	t3_rtfgzm	t1_hqsja5u	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtfgzm/least_pathetic_modern_feminist/hqskudx/

ty81kiz	In your example, the latter half I would chalk up to misandrist influence on the original idea. So if you remove that, then you've already said you'd get behind it. So would I. I'm just curious to see how many people have written off feminism entirely, and how many would be open to supporting it if the toxicity was taken out. Granted, it'd mean taking out about 60% of the entire ideology, but... well, it's a hypothetical.

glkrg48i	Exactly, we're talking in hypotheticals, but at the same time, I think.. I get it. you know? we're tribal people by nature.. the left gave women a cause to rally behind. an excuse. you aren't where you want to be in life? It's no longer your fault.. who wouldn't ride that train?   I think your last sentence, as tongue in cheek as it was, is quite accurate.. hell, even in the last 48 hours, I asked for proof on a post about some claims made, and they used the fact I post here, as reason to dismiss me.. when I'm here debating with you rationally about their movement and how to HELP it gain traction in the right way! this is my point.. Sanity and reason have gone out the window.   If a feminist mouthpiece does something.. it's great. if it comes from somebody on the otherside.. it's bad. it doesn't even matter what it is. It has gone TOO far down the toxic rabbit hole, how can it wind back? how do you go back from 'kill all men' how do you go back from 'all men must be taught not to rape' etc.   This isn't a fight that concerns me, I work from home, I'm married.. the only person I sexually assault is myself on tea breaks! but I'm fighting it because I feel so bad for all the young guys out there who are good people trying to find direction. because the feminist movement is the biggest redpill recruiter there is. and I do not agree with the redpill movement, I think it's the other side OF feminism. both crazy imo.	1641039774.0	hqssd14	t3_rsi039	t1_hqsnxrt	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsi039/if_they_could_define_misandry_and_feminism_as_two/hqssd14/
glkrg48i	I'll simply ask.. please list the benefits we get?   higher suicide rate?  Draft? Maybe it's the high uptake on all those dangerous jobs!   There is no benefit to being a bloke anymore, 10-20 years ago, maybe. but not anymore, hell, the biggest proof the wage gap doesn't exist IS capatalism. because if it did, the male unemployment rate would be higher by a large % as companies would hire women for cheaper.. Capitalism doesn't give a fuck about your feelings. so the fact that isn't happening... goes a good way to disproving its existence without some bent stats.	1641039956.0	hqsskue	t3_rtfgzm	t3_rtfgzm	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtfgzm/least_pathetic_modern_feminist/hqsskue/
