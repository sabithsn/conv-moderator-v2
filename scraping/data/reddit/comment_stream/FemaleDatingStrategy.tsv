9f513x5h	When I meet a guy who is overweight and his profile pictures are NOT, it tells me that 1) maybe he's dishonest, and 2) it is medically possible for him to be a healthy weight but for some reason he has not made his health a priority.

qi5i5	Thank you for this break down! I’ve always hated Issa and Lawrence’s dynamic because it reminded me of toxic relationships I’ve been in or witnessed firsthand. I was proud of Issa initially for walking away from Lawrence and the baby situation but when they ended up getting back together? It just seemed childish and immature. After making so many strides with her professional life, Issa backpedaled on herself so hard. It was disappointing.  And even in regards to Nathan I cringed when she was trying to get him to say he loved her. Like girl! What are you doing?! Issa needed more quality time with herself being single.	1640862884.0	hqj8s0f	t3_rrdgzf	t3_rrdgzf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrdgzf/insecure_has_a_lot_of_examples_of_lvm_hvm_and_the/hqj8s0f/
9f513x5h	They will also defend your ra pist in court. They will also "not choose sides" if your soon to be ex-husband is violently abusive towards you and you are trying to leave the relationship. They will act distrustful of you if you are single/separated/divorced and you are invited to any event where "their man" is present. They will brag about how they were "good" because they did all the housework and baby care right after giving birth, thus setting impossible standards for women who experienced complicated recoveries after childbirth. They will snoop in your bathroom cabinets when they come to your house to get your beauty secrets. They will also dump you for people they think are "cooler". They will act competitive about their children, because their children are ALWAYS better than yours. They think it's cute to post on social media that their husbands are "the 4th child"... and include photos of their husbands sitting on a couch looking at his phone while all around him are unfolded clothes and unwashed cups.  They will lie to get the men they want. They will take up str\*pping, s\*x work, or amateur p\*rn to impress men. They will discover that it is dangerous and say that they do not want their daughters to do that sort of work... but walking around without a bra on in front of their 23-year-old male co-workers is totally fine.	1640862886.0	hqj8s56	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqj8s56/

There were garbage insecurities that he would never grow out of.   He did not improve. He never learned to take care of himself or his surroundings. He perpetuated incel ideology more the fatter he got. And he absolutely tried to neg me, because I was young pretty and rejected him when he tried to touch my thigh while we were hanging out.  He idealized our shorter friend as his manic pixie dream girl.

There's a reason why she tried to break up with him but got back together with him after being disfigured. Yes, some women cannot stand the thought of never finding love, but seriously, given how this guy (and other men) are extremely dangerous, it's much better to stay single.   I highly suspect the guy is now pursuing her in the hopes of persuading her to stop filing police complaints against him so that he can escape from being jailed. Unfortunately he did succeed.

czlxwnft	This is so untrue.... all my LV exes had both parents.   It just depends if the mum was a pickme or an enabler.   If the mum is single, independent and fierce refusing to settle in a bad relationship, well I think the son will ultimately see that and respect women even more so for it.   What children look at and bring with them into adulthood is the dynamic between the 2 parents...   if he sees his dad abusing his mum, he'll be more likely to abuse women. If he sees his mum no standing up for herself, he'll later take advantage of women as well.  If the dad was absent for travelling or whatever and coming home as he pleases and the mum was still lingering for the relationship, this is what he'll see too...  The all single mum generalisation is so untrue and very narrow minded	1640864398.0	hqjata6	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjata6/
8chnorsd	All right, I was gonna just scroll on by without comment but since you’ve specifically asked for opinions here it is.   Your post strikes me as naive. I understand how you got to here, but it honestly just screams that you’re young and have limited experience of single mothers as a whole and not just the common tropes. Which, I will admit, do exist but aren’t indicative of the whole.   It reads as the same tired argument I hear from men all the time. LV ones at that. “Single mothers are good for fun but don’t keep one.” “If you raise another man’s child you’re a beta.” And other general “they’re failed as women” comments. This is the next logical step to they’re failed as mothers.   Yet again it’s the idea that the woman who stayed to be a parent is to blame for the actions of the man that leaves. Now, with that said, there are certainly points to be made about being more careful about who you procreate with. Granted.   Here’s the thing though;  - Men can seem high value for a long long time. May not even start to show traits until you’re years in and potentially already married with kids. - People do die. Widows exist.  - People are allowed to realise they made a mistake and course correct, in fact lots of abused women do leave when children enter the picture or they become pregnant - It’s possible to be a good Mum alone and a bad Mum with a partner.   Etc etc   Basically, it reads as immature, a little cruel, a continuation of lots of lower value societal nonsense, a lack of nuance, and generally made me eyeroll.   With all that said; if this is a boundary for you, have at it. It doesn’t personally affect me one way or the other what your red flags are, and your reasons are sound (even if I personally find them misapplied).   Not my area, I don’t really have to take offence to this and it doesn’t change my life in any material way.	1640864667.0	hqjb6c5	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqhwudk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjb6c5/

8r15jxb0	I guess some women want to gold dig as as think they can go "from rags to riches", but you need to remember at the end of the day, it's his money not your money. Most men are not dumb enough to shower a women with luxurious gifts without expecting something in return. A lot of these rich men not only want a trophy SO but someone he can control.  Don't forget if your SO comes from a wealthy family and you do not, they may look down upon you for being born poor. Many rich families are classist as fuck and want nothing to do with the poor (except donating money, establishing charities, and volunteering to boost their public image). Maybe they'll like you if you look like a supermodel as many rich families want their sons to have a hot wife, but many will expect you to always listen to them simply because they are the wealthier ones.	1640864906.0	hqjbi05	t3_rrlubb	t3_rrlubb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrlubb/another_post_about_golddiggingsugarbabying/hqjbi05/
cw1rizx2	Just no, OP. You keep saying everyone's not that black and white and that good people can do shit things. No. I've been there before as the cheater. There's nothing glorious about it, and I was being a shit person. It didn't matter how shitty my partner was or how good the next one was.  To make matters worse, apparently the partner of your romantic isn't that bad of a person. Cheating is cheating. It's the easy option for when you want to have it all and cower in fear of the consequences. Honestly, people will say anything to talk good what they've done, and you never can until you can accept that what you've done has made you into a liar and a person who hurts others in their favour.	1640865004.0	hqjbmwz	t3_rrwdke	t3_rrwdke	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjbmwz/

These men label these women as superficial yet they want an extremely hot SO so it's not like they are any less superficial.

4974ugy9	Pickmes have deep-rooted, pathological amounts of jealousy. I understand being a teenager/early twenties woman who gives a man too many chances because she's inexperienced. After all, all women have been socialized to be pickmes.   But I don't understand the women who are sycophantic slaves to men. That pickmeism isn't about naivety. That's a choice. Once you start endangering other women, you can't be redeemed  My mother defends every rapist in the family: her father, her husband, every fucking man she ever met. She's the first to cancel women for non-issues like having standards. But wax poetic about giving men leniency. I had a friend 2 years ago who got involved with a porn addict that admitted to taking secret videos of people.

5ffusqdz	I agree that there is an attack on HVM and HVW by the media, and I don't care about your love for the 2002 Spiderman either.   All I'm trying to show you is that the majority who read your post aren't taking you seriously because you presented a poor argument since you haven't even watched the movies and you're basing everything you're writing on superficial first impressions of compilation clips on YouTube.  I honestly wish you wrote up an analysis of movies or TV shows you have actually watched. We would have all enjoyed the critique.  For example, I would have compared the early 2000s Spidermans to other popular LVM TV shows that came about in the late 2000s like Mad Men, Californication, Shameless, Sons of Anarchy. Shows that appeal to LVM and implant in their minds images that successful rich men are cheaters and that women should put up with LV broke scrotes.  The recent Spiderman movies are TAME compared to the filth being promoted to men on TV in the late 2000s.   Tbh, Peter and MJ in the 2020s Spiderman are really awkward and cute (as they should be, they're kids in the middle of highschool) and I think Tom Holland is a positive example to young boys of how to be a HVM when you're just 15-16. He respects and treats MJ really well, he is attentive, a good listener, cares about her interests, respectful of her boundaries and looked for a good moment to get to know her better, and made a huge effort to make sure that he can confess that he likes her properly. It's all very age appropriate, and their relationship is only *just* beginning at the end of the second film.	1640865775.0	hqjcpte	t3_rrc214	t1_hqgxvs2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrc214/the_change_in_spiderman_films_reveals_how_men/hqjcpte/

yx4bq	Even single pick mes can be dangerous as their need to get a man is above the friendship. But yes regardless we should just keep HV people around us and avoid pick mes at all cost. I think it's ok to try and help a pick me friend to see the wrong in her ways and be there for her when her pickeism is still on a non damaging state and if they show to genuinely be your friend but if they don't want to listen or if her pickeism goes up and up then it's time to let that pick me go.	1640866962.0	hqjefwp	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqix1lf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjefwp/
15f5s8	He was aware that he was being entirely selfish. He also said there's no way he could start his new career homeless.   His partner is awesome. He said that, too. She's always been a great girlfriend as far as I know, and he always tried to be the best boyfriend he could be to her. When we just became friends, he talked about how they just made sense. I thought it was cute. I actually usually only have friendships with taken men, and in those cases know their girlfriends as well. I met this guy through a mutual friend of ours.   I really didn't expect to fall for him, but our friendship seemed to naturally progress that way. I could've saved myself a world of hurt had I stuck to my guns the first time of no contact.	1640866965.0	hqjeg27	t3_rrwdke	t1_hqjbmwz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjeg27/

8zttver0	If you're living with my alternative - debilitating cramps every month that often are debilitating even with a double dose pain killers - then giving birth is not that bad. And I tore all around, one tear definitely went to the outskirts of my clit, too... Another one through my right inner labia - and with that one, the stitches couldn't keep it together. But even a split labia doesn't really bother me at all.  Saying birth isn't that bad (with proper medical care) is like saying traffic isn't all that dangerous (if you adhere to all the rules): Most of us go through it with no (lasting) issues, and a very low percentage gets it really bad.	1640867046.0	hqjekbl	t3_rr88l6	t1_hqh2f0e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rr88l6/forced_female_bonding_over_kids_though_childfree/hqjekbl/

9p6f6ftv	I’m sure he felt the exact same way for his girlfriend at some point, but he was **grooming you by making you feel special**. I’m not saying you’re not special, I’m saying that the way a man feels about a woman is often way more about the type of man he is than about the type of woman she is. Any woman who’s fresh pussy pining for him outside of his relationship would be “special”,  because it makes him feel desired. It’s not about you, it’s about his ego. I’m sorry this is harsh, but it’s the truth. It doesn’t take much to get along with a man, especially if he’s using you.  As long as you believe you are somehow much more special than other women (or you desperately want to believe you are better or desperately want to be better), you will fall prey to grooming and lovebombing.  To reiterate: you are special and deserving of love, but no more than his girlfriend (unless she is somehow a really LVW and a total pickme, but she’s not the one getting involved with a committed man and hoping he leaves his girlfriend…).  You are a victim of a misogynistic culture, raised to believe that a man saying you’re special is some kind of prize. Everything from music to movies to proverbs grooms women to this type of behaviour.  Who needs to be special is him, sis. You already are, and so is his girlfriend most likely. He’s proven to be the opposite of special. He’s ordinary, a LVM.  This is a simple case of… you don’t need to be picked by a man and told you’re special. You need to pick a special man (not a committed cheater, for starters).  Don’t ask him to pick you over his girlfriend. You know what that makes you.  You will get over this, and hopefully spread the gospel of With An HVM, You Don’t Need To Compete With Another Woman.  HVM do not put you in a position to root and count the days until another woman’s life gets uprooted, her heart broken being left in shambles, betrayed and abused, facing possibly losing her house.	1640867702.0	hqjfjy7	t3_rrwdke	t1_hqjcnfn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjfjy7/

wyjia	A guy I had been dating for maybe 3 months said if we were still together after a year I could move in with him. He talked about how his rent was fixed at about half of what I was paying for my rent, and I’d save so much money splitting with him. He eventually planned to buy the house he was renting. I said nope, I’ll never move into a man’s house and pay into his mortgage. Why put equity into his house especially if we break up, he keeps all that and I get nothing? Plus his house was shittier than my nice apartment and it was in an area of the city I was not interested in moving to. It would’ve been a total downgrade. If I’m gonna move anywhere with a man, it’s gonna be a place we both decided on, after dating for multiple years (I don’t want marriage) and an upgrade from my current living space.	1640867908.0	hqjfv9t	t3_rqm1t1	t1_hqclmkj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rqm1t1/why_you_shouldnt_live_together_before_marriage_2/hqjfv9t/

15f5s8	He didn't get closer, we started wondering about whether our feelings were appropriate for each other around the same time - we were grabbing coffee/lunches together, going to the movies. We were just curious about each other as we seemed to have a lot in common. He initiated the talk about his possibly inappropriate feelings for me, and that not seeing each other again might be the best option, to which I agreed. That should have been the end of it of course. Instead.. this is where several months of emotional investment got me.	1640868410.0	hqjgnoz	t3_rrwdke	t1_hqjep1r	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjgnoz/

410o4mj2	I'll agree with you that there was a total lack of quality TV in the mid 2000s, however, I am not even talking about the extreme examples of misogyny that we saw then, and instead, a more insidious kind that tends to prevent itself as empowerment.     And a lot of less intelligent, IMO, women fall for it.  I felt like the post got the kind of feedback I was expecting, with a lot of gullible women disagreeing and a lot of smart/older women confirming me and saying theyd observed the same thing. I think it takes some life experience and more deep knowledge to pick up on what I was explaining, and presumably the Marvel set is extremely young and more prone for falling for the "It's empowerment"! tropes that Hollywood sets out.  That's fine.  Water seeks its level, and it doesnt bother me.  I just wish there was a space on FDS where you could sort out the younger, more naive types, and really talk to only HVF.  But, I think most online spaces become kind of congested with less "woke" people as time goes on.  It's the nature of the internet, and FDS has blown up over the past year, so definitely to be expected.  A lot of the new women are genuinely immature and need the knowledge FDS provides a lot more than me, so it's fine that they have come into this space.  But yeah, that's how I feel.  My post really wasnt supposed to be "gotten" by everyone, and if there was a way for me to have tagged it as something like "deep analysis and discourse for vetted HVF only" i definitely would have.  Oh well. Like I said, water seeks its level.	1640868835.0	hqjhcej	t3_rrc214	t1_hqjcpte	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrc214/the_change_in_spiderman_films_reveals_how_men/hqjhcej/

tfi8qd	You’re so right about the hot and cold behaviour, and this is quote apparent in texting conversations with these kinds of men.  I feel like there’s a lot of cross over with narcissistic tendencies and avoidants. They’ll love bomb you and chase you in the beginning, and then pull away and start with the hot and cold behaviour. They’ll be unresponsive to your texts but weeks later, they’ll pop out of nowhere and text you like nothing ever happened.   Avoidants have a hard time maintaining friendships as well, so watch out for men who cycle through friendships quickly and try to escape any mess they’ve made by moving away.   If someone is not giving you the attention you deserve and is not consistent with it, leave.	1640869211.0	hqjhybt	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjhybt/

8zttver0	My last ex clearly exhibited your #1 and #4 issues. Also some covert #3 whenever he was expected to do something, like \*gasp\* being a parent to our daughter. I'm not sure about #2, but he sure partook in their (shitty) investments - or at least followed their example.  However, he grew up as the (single) child of married parents. And, yes, the parents were married until death parted them.  I think these issues are much more prominent in families with a narc mother, where everything has to be just about herself. In other words: A LVW and (most likely) pickme (for all the attention and validation). It's also more common in only sons than in sons with brothers, albeit the latter is not unheard of. With the man being one of several brothers with a narc mom, it's most often the "golden child" that gets the special mommy treatment, as far as my anecdotal evidence shows.	1640869372.0	hqji7ur	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqji7ur/

dqicycba	This is a great post. The only thing I will add here is that it isn't always the "less attractive" friend that is a pick me. The "pick me" woman is also a woman who is attractive sometimes and is obsessed with her own appearance and the appearance of other women. I have had pick me friends around who were more beautiful than me and they would act very insecure and angry and as if they were slighted if they seen a man they wanted give any attention to a woman they thought was not as "attractive". Insecurity is sadly something that can affect any woman regardless of how beautiful or not attractive they may be.	1640869434.0	hqjibn8	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjibn8/

cw7827nc	It’s not that the Pick Me is less attractive is that she *feels* less attractive. For some women, them being beautiful isn’t enough, you have to be ugly, too. They aren’t satisfied unless all male focus is exclusively on them. And like I said men are about control. The attention they give and their obsession is rarely just about attraction, it’s about who they feel is outside their influence. If you’re an FDS women, you’re actually going to attract that obsession and jealousy because they’re going to want to bring you down, and the pick me, not caring that this kind of “attention” is toxic and meant to hurt you, is going to be jealous because the men are pathologically focused on you. So you’re in danger from both ends.	1640870317.0	hqjjttb	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqjibn8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjjttb/

ayt8m0x9	That is terrible and of course there are lvm from all "catergories" of men. In my experience there are more from dysfunctional families but they certainly exist everywhere.  My only relationships that were good or at least not horrible were with men from a stable family.  For me it is like short men. Not all short men are terrible but it improves the odds that they will be terrible if they are short.  Not all men from broken families are terrible but majority of them end up with no positive role model because pickme moms and lvm fathers, ending up with bad behaviors or emotional baggage they never work through.	1640870817.0	hqjkpfw	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjiuvz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjkpfw/

6nqo3j94	Yup. My ex had a deadbeat dad who popped up once in a blue moon (he was a community dick that had a whole other family, classy) and was raised by his mom. Guess who hated his mom and idolized his cheating scrote dad? Guess who grew up to treat women *the exact same way?*  I don't know why people are taking this personally and raging at you in the comments, OP. We all know that 99% of men lack introspection and while a woman can come from a broken home and do the inner work to overcome childhood wounds, *the vast majority of men are never going to bother.* They'll treat women like garbage because they've learned that a man can be a cheating, absent, deadbeat scrote and yet will still get showered with unconditional love by a pickme.	1640871229.0	hqjlg3p	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjlg3p/
b2fueeui	I've heard a lot of talk about friends from my last ex, yet I've never met them. When I moved in with him, he never went to see said friends. Turns out all his social interaction was with colleagues and his mom. Maybe brothers if they needed something from him.  So if a man talks about friends, not only could those relationships be superficial, in some cases they might be nonexistent. I'll definitely be paying more attention to this if I ever date a man again.	1640871233.0	hqjlgc6	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjkdo0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjlgc6/

She bitches about other colleagues and is the only adult woman I work with who tries to form 'cliques'. Everything to her is about getting that sweet, sweet male validation.   I can tell that she *really* doesn't like me (probably because I conduct myself with FDS standards) and would just love the opportunity to knock me down a peg or two. I keep interactions to a bare minimum and never reveal personal information at work.   Women like this are exhausting.

9f513x5h	It's hard to know, I think. I guess if someone just isn't into you and isn't willing to communicate, you have to move on.   I struggle with getting close to people because in the past, I used to become attached (anxious attachment) and this attracted an abusive narcissist. So now I have over-corrected by being very reserved about my affection, especially in the early stages. It is hard for me to trust people because of my experiences. But it does weed out anyone impatient who is trying to love bomb me. I suppose some people might call this "avoidant".	1640872348.0	hqjnk9n	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjnk9n/
6330th43	There’s rarely an easy and immediate sign but someone over the age of 30 who’s never had a long term relationship is definitely a red flag. Another one is if they come on really strong and pull away shortly after (hot cold like everyone else has said). People may also be temporarily avoidant/emotionally unavailable following a breakup or something traumatic, so don’t date anyone who hasn’t been single for at least a year. Also just listen to the way they talk about themselves - do they say they’re very independent? Do they say they have trust issues?

5eyjl40e	My first husband was avoidant. I've read a lot about it, and it still baffles me overall. However, I understand how he got that way: physical, verbal, emotional abuse as a child; his father died before he was born; his mother married an Appalachian coal miner back in the late 50s. P had three step-brothers, and was treated like a step-child. He also had orthopedic problems (pin in hip at a very young age, teens, I think). He got immersed early in toxic masculinity, and left home around age 17. Never went back or saw his parents again so far as I know.   What I remember:  \-- wanting love, but feeling easily overwhelmed and flooded;  \-- wanting someone around for company, mostly, but giving each other lots of space;  \-- avoiding emotional connection, usually in his case with jokes designed to push me away (which angered and frustrated me);   \-- avoiding in-depth conversation which creates mental and emotional connection;  \-- solitary hobbies, or if social at all, very limited, superficial interaction. He was "hail fellow well met" with guy buddies, who just didn't demand very much;  \-- not a lot of eye contact, smiles, or positive body language; very closed off;   \-- very, very negative feelings toward other people, saying people can't be trusted;   \-- creating a life where they don't have to interact much with people or at any depth.  Hope this helps. I just know that P would have been an acceptable partner for far longer had I had the money and knowledge of living apart together but I was in my young 20s when we met. I wanted marriage and cohabitation, intimacy, sex, all the basic things one associates with romance and relationships. He \*thought\* he wanted that, but no.	1640872494.0	hqjnuea	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjnuea/

My ex had herpes and when talking about a 4some was talking about a lack of condom use because "i already have the worst one" and would shrug.

6bu8qams	Another thing I remembered - total inability to offer support.  Example 1: I was upset and crying as my beat friends father received a terminal diagnosis and I didn't know how to help her. He sat next to me cold as a stone patting me on the back with all the empathy of a statue, then left. And this is a supposedly sensitive introspective guy! By contrast, a female friend even just via WhatsApp empathised, gave sensitive advice, and later inquired on how it was going.  Example 2: I was wrecked by period cramps. He chilled on the hammock completely ignoring me. Not a sympathetic word, a hug, god forbid an act of service. By contrast, a female friend sympathised, offered to make me tea, inquired how I was doing, etc.	1640872640.0	hqjo4n6	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjo4n6/

cej81zn3	my younger brother was raised by all women and my mom who was single her whole life after leaving my father. he is definitely more emotionally intelligent and sensitive than the average scrote, and he has healthy boundaries with our mom and myself. he provides even at 18 with a job and is always trying to better himself and ensure he can help my mom when needed. I think OP’s list is a good checklist of things to watch out for if a guy has only a mom on his life but it’s not a red flag in itself that he was raised by a single mom.	1640872722.0	hqjoad5	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqia9cj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjoad5/

4u61c9cd	I used to feel both intimidated and tempted at the same time by men's aggressive behavior to get sex at all costs. A lot of women must've also succumbed to pressure and given in. It's hard! Especially when the scrote looks physically attractive and you're cornered.  But now I just think it's so pathetic and hilarious of them to try THAT hard to become manipulative and get laid. 🤣  As a FDS sister once said, my vagina makes a "Windows shutdown noise" and I don't even find these LVMs physically and mentally attractive anymore.

bvnm37an	This gave me chills.. such an excellent post. I've been reluctant to share my story about two of my ex-friends who were ultra pickmes. They have been the reason I'm terrified of making friends or getting super close to other women in real life.   These two people literally went to extreme measures to ruin my reputation and tore me down to everyone they could because I ended the "friendship". One of them even began dressing like me, talking like me, got the same haircut and dye.. and even went out and got similar tattoos as me.. and went for guys who she thought I would be 'into'...   It's a really long story, but it's creepy and I still sometimes worry that they have their flying monkeys watching me, so I've now developed agoraphobia from it.. so that's fun. 😑	1640872832.0	hqjoi9c	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjoi9c/

7djs5tcj	Cosigning /u/sermuonielis's comment. Adding a few more:  * Love bombing. Coming on super hot, way more than is appropriate. You don't even know each other!  * Commitment shy. They can't even take the lead on initiating dates, and when they do, it's half-assed.  * Mixed messages of any kind. Don't try to rationalize it, that's your cue to dip.  [This list is accurate, ime.](https://psychcentral.com/blog/love-matters/2018/07/16-signs-of-an-avoidant-or-unavailable-partner#4)  I got in a situationship 2 years ago with a guy who was fearful-avoidant. He came on strong and sweet, but the mixed messages were always there, and he told me red flag stories upfront about his history: He had no friends, he had a history of burning bridges, he had a savior complex and was attracted to "crazy" women, he was indecisive and didn't know what he wanted out of life in general. This is verbatim what he told me. From the beginning, he also had bizarre preferences that he forced on other people and got shitty about if other people didn't cater to him. Like, he hated soup and found the thumbs up emoji offensive.   I ignored all of this to my peril, thinking his good traits made up for it.  Nope, the mask eventually dropped. He became sullen, passive-aggressive, and had explosive anger over the dumbest shit. Absolutely could not control his emotions or his feelings like a rational adult. Couldn't have a 30-second conversation about minor issues, just ghosted me. The 2nd time he ghosted me, I gave up and stopped trying.  When I took a step back, I realized the problems had always been there. He'd always been unreasonable and self-centered. He didn't know how to get along with others and pissed off absolutely everyone around him.  You can memorize the list of red flags til the cows come home. Honestly, your best way of recognizing one of these people is paying attention to YOU and YOUR feelings. When you start feeling confused, anxious, ignored, or held at arm's length, you need to look at the cause. I felt all of these things when I first met him and ignored my gut. Don't be me.	1640873016.0	hqjoveg	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjkdo0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjoveg/

6bu8qams	I think my problem was that I couldn't really see the distance for what it was because I'm also very independent and enjoy my private time. He just seemed like a very reserved, solitary guy, happily independent. It took a few months to realise that this behaviour was masking a deep inability to bond. The normal distance at the beginning of the relationship masked it well. It became evident once I started growing closer, we started spending more time together and the relationship was supposed to move forward, which is when it ended instead. Fortunately I wasn't particularly invested yet though of course I cared for him.	1640873334.0	hqjping	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjoveg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjping/
ae9ft0ya	Many may have good reasons to disconnect from family (unavoidable toxicity), but if they didn't replace those connections w friends at least...

6bu8qams	I noticed a depressive tendency, as well as an eagerness to distract himself with novelties. His mood fluctuated wildly between "child excited by new toy" and "despondent and negative when bored". This second phase only relatively affected me as I left him to stew in his own juices while I went off doing my thing. Only when we spent a week away together it started to impact me and make me feel down and depressed too.   That instability should have been a glaring red flag in hindsight.	1640873540.0	hqjpxvs	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjp5oe	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjpxvs/

en8tould	There is no benefit to women when it comes to tiptoeing around men's feelings in a relationship when we are speaking about our needs. A HVM will take criticism thoughtfully, and change what you feel is an issue, because he values you and your feelings and wants you to be happy. A LVM will not.   Tell him ONCE, and tell him directly. For example: "What you did is unacceptable to me", and opposed to "I think what you did was unacceptable." Leave no room for arguments or gaslighting. Put his behaviour on him and his choices, not your perceptions of it. If he acts like a tantruming child or ignores you, then that is when you know you have a LVM on your hands, and it's time to exit his life.	1640874705.0	hqjsdbo	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqjsdbo/
6bu8qams	I see your point. My ex was an acceptable partner as long as we lived in the place where we were, in a sort of bubble away from real life. But we were moving (we're both travellers) and continuing the relationship would have required to organise the next trip together.  This is a man who can't even plan tomorrow's dinner as it's too much "commitment". So he just cut everything off as it was too daunting and he "didn't have enough feelings to make the effort to organise to meet again". I never bothered speaking to him again.  But that's another huge red flag - inability to commit to even small plans, both in his life and for the couple.	1640874821.0	hqjsm4v	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjnuea	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjsm4v/

It's not helpful, especially insulting me calling me a pickme and implying I don't have hobbies, friends or a job, this is very poor behaviour coming from a so-called 'coach.'  My strategy of having a phone call before a date is so that I can avoid going on a first date. It's worked well for me, I've avoided lots of dates with men after I had a phone call with them first and realised that I didn't want to date them. I'd much rather a longer phone call, rather than a short phone call and an in person date.  Someone recommended this sub to me. I used to be in this, but had left. Now I remember why.

en8tould	God yes, she is a total pick-me! How many pictures have we seen of her clutching at and draping herself across Jeffrey Epstein, and he with a smug grin on his freakishly long face?  She was clearly in love with the creep, he knew it, and she was willing to do anything to keep him happy, even if it meant violating young girls with him. She's just another Karla Homolka. Pick-me's are utterly dangerous to women. The thin edge of the wedge can lead to this, and it is just a matter of degrees. Stay safe, and vet your friends too, ladies!	1640875412.0	hqjtvup	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjtvup/

8bscg3mc	I did say that if it worked for OP then that was perfectly fine, I have no qualms about their own personal preference on how they choose a mate. I did also state that it would make sense when learning of that familial situation to vet harder, so perhaps to consider it an orange flag and continue to look for the reasonings that are the actual red flags stated in the post.  Again, here is my issue with this: Having a single mother does not necessarily dictate the way in which you are raised and the values that are instilled in you, as is mentioned many times throughout the comments here. It's rather short sighted to think so. Yes! It should definitely be considered as a possibility, but not a guarantee or an assumption that having a single mother has screwed you up for life. And if anything is being considered at all, it should actually BE the way in which the man was raised and the morals and values he holds, not his mother's marital status.  Would you rather your son be judged for his own merits, or be judged solely based on your choice of who fathered him, and whether or not you saw fit to stay in a relationship with that man?	1640875590.0	hqju9kh	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjm821	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqju9kh/

10fuzrmb	I think the issues that men raised by single mothers have are largely due to the father who left. I used to work under the supervision of a woman who was an attachment therapist, and she said when you hate a parent, you hate part of yourself. Her goal was to get people to feel neutral towards parents they hated. It really messes with your self concept and self esteem if a parent leaves, **especially** if it’s the same-sex parent. It’s a rejection on the deepest level. Women who become mothers don’t tend to leave, but men who become fathers do so men are almost always the ones dealing with these issues.	1640875743.0	hqjulky	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjulky/

dzvrbovn	They want to take all the credit for female pleasure and none of the blame for the lack of satisfaction that males provide to females. I wish I had done this. I was convinced I could never orgasm because men and society constantly made me feel as though I was the problem. I didn’t even understand what an orgasm was or felt like. Men would act like I had one even though I didn’t because their ego hurt, they’d try to say I’m lying when I straight up said no - I don’t think I had an orgasm. Then I got a vibrator and had my first real climax ever. I was so upset about how many women fake it and how many men gaslight women into pretending like they had a mutual climax. It’s such bs. A HVM will try to either make you cum first or keep pleasuring you after he cums until you reach the same amount of relief.  Lmfao this guy should probably learn how to give her head too, women orgasm well if you learn how to eat it right. A lot of women feel so terrible after sex because we don’t orgasm and they do, but a lot of women don’t even recognize it because they haven’t ever came. The happy women I know who experience orgasms have this standard with men that the man has to be able to make her cum and so do I. No more pity sex. I’m not worried about intimidating any one because I’m no longer interested in lazy male partners. The guy I’m with now loves to pleasure me 🙏	1640876171.0	hqjvjmk	t3_rs3cw1	t3_rs3cw1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs3cw1/this_should_be_how_women_approach_sex_if_he_cant/hqjvjmk/
ckuhxjgw	Complaining about having no close friends: it's because they push people away, and they'll begin doing the same to you too once you get too close.

40on2lwh	Thank you for this post! I will repeat myself- we should not look at each other as competition, that does not benefit us. Tearing a woman down does not add value to you. Have each other’s back. I had a friend who would tell my most personal problems to her boyfriend (whom I didn’t like at all). I cut her off and never looked back. What’s the circle of this? She tells him, he tells his bros, his bros spread it to their bros, and everyone ends up knowing. Suddenly, you’re vulnerable to strangers who can be real predators.	1640876383.0	hqjw08d	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjw08d/

jyy92	When they’re sick, or emotional, they disappear or they “need time to be alone” and you’re left distraught for days or maybe even weeks. They can’t handle the emotional effects of a relationship.   They won’t have many if any past relationships. They won’t have many friends. They will chase you more when they feel they are losing you, and when you chase them, they’ll run as well. It might take a while but usually the dopamine jump will wear off and you’ll see the behaviors more readily.   They aren’t consistent in showing you love/attention. They will have serious doubts early on and make up things just to have alone time, but will come back hard if you ignore them too. It’s an unhealthy cycle of neglect.	1640876421.0	hqjw379	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjw379/

As others have mentioned:  * No friends * Never had a relationship * No empathy (can't console a person who's upset) * Hides on the internet * No social media that includes their real selves (names, pictures) * Not close with family (or always the invited, never the inviter) * Pessimism ("jokes" that he'll always be alone)	1640876797.0	hqjwxmj	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjwxmj/

b6zdp8f8	You need to drop him. He is like a drug you're addicted to and like any addiction, all he does is ruin you. He brings nothing positive yo your life, only rot.  >He had been with his girlfriend for 9 years at that point, and they own a house and pets together.  He was happy to string her along for nearly a decade, keeping her as a forever gf, wringing all manners of benefits of her while keeping a foot out in case someone "better" came along.  >Cue two months of an emotional affair  He is a cheater. If you were with him, he would cheat on you too.  >pretty serious talks about what being together entailed and what breaking up with his gf entailed - selling the house and deciding who takes the pets, they have mutual friends  Excuses to keep you on the hook so he has the thrill of an affair while he keeps a backup (girlfriend) at home.  >Because of how the first time of breaking up went around, he wanted to wait until his assessments were done. He got his results right before christmas, and celebrated christmas with his gf and their families. He texted me how much he wanted to be with me.   He has no problem lying to everyone, playing happy couple in front of her family while cheating on his girlfriend. Again, this would be your life if you were with him. He would cheat on you with no second thought, and only do things that benefit him, not you. He doesn't want to be with you, it's just a fun fantasy for him, because he likes female attention. It could be anyone, it makes no difference to him.  >He called me on monday after christmas and said he was breaking up with his gf. I told him rather than tell me, just do it, i want the decision to be made independent of me. He also just wanted to hear my voice.  He was checking he still had you in his snare, he doesn't care about hearing your voice itself, he just wanted to hear the emotions in your voice.  >I had a near psychotic breakdown. I have dealt with mental health issues in the past (C-PTSD) and haven't experienced a fallback like this in many years. I felt like I was going insane. I was.   He is poison. He is not even with you and yet he is ruining your health. Compare how you feel with him in your life and how you felt before knowing him. You know deep down it was better without him.  >He loves his girlfriend, they've always had a great relationship.  No, he doesn't, and no, they don't. When you love someone you don't cheat on them and great relationships do not involve cheating and stringing someone along for a decade while you look for someone else.  >He is 100% an equal partner, though I suspect actually he was carrying more of the emotional labour in the relationhip.  I highly doubt it. In fact, I know it's not the case, since he was emotionally investing into you, so he's definitely not an equal partner and probably does very little emotional labour in his relationship.  I think you been giving him the benefit of the doubt way too much, and it sounds like you projected qualities onto him and built an imaginary version of him in your head which you fell in love with. You are a complete person, as you say. You have built a good life for yourself. Don't let someone in who doesn't add value to it, and especially not someone who cheats with you, will cheat on you and makes you feel miserable. He's been putting up a facade because he needed entertainment in his life, it was all a con. But the good thing is that you now know. So you can block him and delete him from your life. It will be hard at first, but when you realise how much better your life his without him in it, you'll realise it was worth making the effort. You can do this.	1640878328.0	hqk0gga	t3_rrwdke	t3_rrwdke	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqk0gga/

6bu8qams	It can definitely change! I was secure, turned extremely anxious after being cheated on, but after discovering attachment theory I started working hard at it and several years later, I am nearly back to secure (with anxious tendemcies still).  One year ago, being involved with an avoidant would have wrecked me with anxiety, self blame, absolutely triggering me. The breakup would have destroyed my self esteem. This time, I was so centered I barely even noticed and got over it in no time, fully clear on the fact that it's his problem and he's an unsuitable partner.

ayt8m0x9	My son will be judged on how he behaves, things he says, what his job is, how tall he is, how well he looks after himself and his home, if he is bald, etc etc etc.  Depending on the woman he may be judged for much more. That's normal and expected.  If a woman thinks it is a red flag that his parents split up and he may have some potential issues as a result, that is fair and often the case.  I try extremely hard to guide my son to be high value and I hope he is.  Might he have some emotional baggage attached because his dad is a dick, maybe. A woman interested on him gets to make that decision, not me.  I might differ from OP in the sense that I think most the problems from a broken home is going to come from the dad.  (I seriously do not know any men from split families that are high value and it is the fathers influence mostly that has created these monsters, many of their mothers seem to have been lovely, but some have been as low value as the fathers)  You could be right that it might be more of an orange flag, but I believe it is something to consider for sure.	1640878765.0	hqk1i1e	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqju9kh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqk1i1e/

dqicycba	I have sadly seen the lengths some women will go to sabotage at work. I myself have dealt with it at every job I have had with a woman that was a pick me type. It gets really bad when they have influence over most of the other women or the other women at the job fear the woman and her capabilities in manipulation and sabotage.  I had to leave my last job over such a woman. My new job is mostly males, but there is one "pick me" woman there who was furious that I was hired . She loved being the only woman there and she has tried little things already to try and get me in trouble. We are in our 30's.  Last week a beautiful young 23 year old woman was hired and she is now beyond furious. She is angry that me and the beautiful young woman get along very well. She has begun to make little snide remarks out of nowhere about the young woman. Then she tried yesterday to invite the young woman out to party with her. I plan on warning the young woman today at work . This pick me woman does not mean well. She often talks about her woman friends in ways no one should talk about a friend. She seems to like making sure they all get wasted and then reporting embarrassing stories about them to the males at our job🙄 .	1640878911.0	hqk1umr	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqjlesj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqk1umr/

765eiop8	My dad taught me a lot of basic maintenance so I “will never need to be in a relationship so some man will fix things.” Most repairs that I can do are an inexpensive fix. The bigger items aren’t what that man is making them out to be, if you find a good, trustworthy worker. It’s like the car dealership quoting me $2500 to replace my breaks, while the indie mechanic (referred by friends; I could not be happier!) completed it for $600.  And really: it is highly unlikely that previous workers did such a terrible job that his maintenance adds up to anything approaching market value for rent.	1640879363.0	hqk2y5r	t3_rs1zle	t1_hqjx8k6	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1zle/men_of_all_ages_will_take_advantage_of_women_when/hqk2y5r/

h57msag5	Interesting. If you don't mind sharing, do you have a  certain timeline in your vetting strategy?  FDS does promote not being a *forever girlfriend*, which to me implies an aspect of long-term view in vetting: dating with the end goal to find a HVM or HVW life partner, and nexting those who refuse to commit.  I know people who 'date' the same commitmophobe for months, without any perspective of getting a relationship. I know people who date expats who'll certainly move back abroad within two years.

It was a calculated method to wear me down to the point that I would rather just do everything myself than deal with the fallout of saying something to him.

4qrd1k4w	Yeah. I have an HV dad, and hope to have a child on my own when I turn 35. I really worry about this, but it's true.  My ex also had a lovely mom and a cheating scrote dad that abandoned their family for his mistress. He ended up treating me spectacularly poorly for the last hear of the relationship, and then it came to light he was cheating. He mirrored his LVM dad *exactly*.  Most of the women I know from difficult backgrounds have done *so* much work and are some of the kindest, most mature people. Men handle it differently - they can project their anger out at those around them for years without seeing a therapist. The fact that there's a gendered response to trauma has also been documented in the research community.  It's really tough though; I've known really good men from some very difficult backgrounds (one of the best grew up raised by his father, because his mother had Huntington's). I've also seen some men turn out well after being raised by a single mother and surrounded by sisters. But mine treated me well for 5 years, and then flipped as soon as there was some adversity in his life.   I think it's fair for us to want to discuss these patterns with one another here on FDS and make decisions accordingly - it's one of the only places we can speak freely.	1640880576.0	hqk5x5v	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjlg3p	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqk5x5v/

h57msag5	I'm WLW, as are many of my friends, and I still see a similar pattern emerge. It seems to me the more emotionally unavailable person takes on the 'male archetype': low-effort, avoiding commitment and real intimacy. While the other either starts showing PickMe behaviour in an effort to 'earn' love and attention, or lowers their standards and convinces herself she's a Cool Girl to accommodate the low-effort partner.  The end result is always: situationship limbo with the female archetype (secretly) hoping for romance and commitment, while the male archetype keeps feeding crumbs of effort and/or future faking to receive sex.	1640881088.0	hqk76tr	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqilp2g	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqk76tr/

Granted, sexual risk drops dramatically with WLW. But as far as the emotional, it’s like this social sickness of avoidant detachment is so deeply engrained now, there is no escaping it. And for those not wired for it, they become anxious, with all sorts of bullshit like what you describe in the OP used to paint over that desire for connection and pretend it does not exist.

765eiop8	I had a high sex drive throughout pregnancy and couldn’t wait to get back to that. My husband was the one taking care of everything in the household, and getting up to do diaper changes in the middle of the night. He kept telling me not to rush things, and to rest and heal. And when we did get back to it? He was exceedingly gentle and made sure I was comfortable throughout.  I think our sex life resumed six weeks post partum; whatever was the earliest to get my OB’s approval. All because I had a HVM who never treated me like a sex toy.	1640882671.0	hqkb7th	t3_rs4y2c	t1_hqk6sj7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs4y2c/first_your_wife_had_a_baby_not_you_second_youre/hqkb7th/

It was feminists who came up with this saying, and it originally was in response to men pressuring women into sex or specific sex acts. "Men, you are responsible for your own orgasm. Stop pressuring women and acting entitled to our bodies."  Now the only time I hear it is when men say it, as a refusal to even try to get women off and to justify just using women's bodies as masturbatory aids.

h57msag5	Ah I see you too have read up on Attachment Theory! Great, then I can provide you with the lingo version: the anxious-avoidant trap is real across all genders. And let me assure you, WLW relationships aren't the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. ...though we do have the most orgasms during sex, lower divorce rates, no unwanted pregnancies, etc.  I've also noticed hook-up culture caters to avoidant attached individuals. And it seems to have been romanticized in a way among most millennials. The YOLO culture, live in the moment, forever young, bla bla. So much so that the anxious- or even securely attached partners emulate these 'preferred behaviours'. Being anything but a Chill Girl who goes with the flow, will get you strange looks unless you're in a heavily religious social circle (at least in my observations).	1640883462.0	hqkda3x	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqk8djy	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqkda3x/

mr2s2	This absolutely wouldn't work on me. 😂  1. I don't know what "vibing" means when we've never met in person and absolutely hate the word. How do you even vibe with someone over a dating profile, a photo, or a few text exchange? It's over used and completely meaningless. It's like they are telling you upfront they don't know how to connect with people and only know how to have superficial relationships. 2. I don't drink. At all. So drink dates are a no-go for me. Just asking me that would turn me off instantly as it's low effort bullshit. But it's always funny to see what they say about it or what they try to come up with afterwards. 3. I don't use social media anywhere, and even if I did, I wouldn't add someone to my social network that I don't know well. We could be friends for several months before I would even think to add you. I have also declined to add people I just met and got along with. Never had a SnapChat account. So you'd never get anything other than my Google Voice number, which I can promptly delete along with anyone attached to it.	1640883698.0	hqkdw3n	t3_rrupmg	t3_rrupmg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrupmg/basically_they_admit_to_everything_fds_warns_us/hqkdw3n/
dla9qnb	I let the men worry about timelines and how to lock me down. My only goal is to show up with queen energy and enjoy myself on dates with men who meet my vetting standards. When I'm exuding hedonistic, take-it-or-leave-it energy, and the men are investing time/resources/effort into me without sex, they naturally ask for commitment within 1.5-2 months or they filter themselves out of the running. The combo of being a ruthless vetter and strategic hedonist makes dating fun and carefree because it sets up a natural dynamic of the man being the 'planner'.   > I know people who 'date' the same commitmophobe for months, without any perspective of getting a relationship. I know people who date expats who'll certainly move back abroad within two years.  This guys wouldn't get through a basic fds filter. Men are either planning with you or playing with you, and their actions will reflect that.	1640883724.0	hqkdyof	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqk56ka	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqkdyof/

6nqo3j94	I've looked through your post history. I mean this in the kindest possible way, but I strongly suggest that you take a break from dating/trying to meet men. This sub deals in tough love - we don't sugarcoat, we don't coddle and we don't enable self-destructive behaviors, but we DO strongly support women who take accountability and are actively working on overcoming negative patterns of behavior.   I felt defensive and called out when I first started reading this sub - but it was the kickstart I needed to stop making excuses for the crap men I let into my life and start making real positive changes. I'm sorry to hear that you left FDS before: it sounds as though you're not yet ready for the self-work that we recommend here.

The women who agreed with you were women who also never had seen the movies, hate and avoid Marvel in general or didn't mind the holes in your logic.  A lot of us come here to enjoy intelligent women writing well-argued and backed-up FDS strategy posts, as has been the standard that I've personally seen since I joined FDS 3 years ago when only a few of us were here.  Many had an issue with your analysis because it did not live up to these standards. You wrote it without fully understanding the characters or watching the movies and it makes it hard to take your points seriously when you used unverified assumptions and misinformed character information.	1640883966.0	hqkelf9	t3_rrc214	t1_hqjhcej	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrc214/the_change_in_spiderman_films_reveals_how_men/hqkelf9/

It’s truly as if the avoidant are the best self-advocates (as masculine energy tends to be), and unilaterally decided on the hookup dynamic for all, with little protest from the other two groups whose interests are not well-represented in such a dynamic.  Any ideas on what we can do for a culture shift? My counter strategy is to reject casual encounters, have high standards, be single indefinitely, and build up other women or the rare man (who tend to be gay) discontent with hookups, to encourage them that they need not settle. And I put content on my social media that rejects the culture (in moderation, so it is not perceived as my entire online personality).

2ngg36dl	I'm not remotely conservative,  but current culture's focus on immediate gratification and unwillingness to recognize the responsibilities we innately have toward others when engaging with them socially or intimately is wildly unhealthy and untenable.  Everything in OP is an expression of that imo.  "Can't force it" is just a way of shrugging off people's agency in relationships - when things go bad it's because someone decided to take them in that direction or decided not to course correct.  Relationships are not the weather - own your actions.   And the ethic of "I don't owe them anything..." is antisocial trash. We owe some people some things in virtually every situation where we engage with other people,  and they owe us, too. Where sex is involved,  the bulk of responsibility toward a partner,  especially a female partner in male- female relationships,  begins with sex because that's where the acute risk lies. It does not begin with formal commitment, it's not something you can avoid by refusing to label things lol.  I devote a lot of time to polemic on this but it's needed. I'm borderline convinced I need to start writing a collection of essays on sexual ethics because popular contemporary thinking about these things is such a garbage fire.	1640884422.0	hqkfsp8	t3_rreyrl	t3_rreyrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqkfsp8/

7osmnunj	Historically it’s always been dangerous for women to criticize men. Always. So, for forever, women have coddled men to avert danger. If a criticism HAS to be made, a woman can’t just tell a man this information and expect a neutral reaction. She has to deliver the news gently otherwise she’ll be perceived as aggressive or argumentative. Even if she phrases her critique warmly she’ll still be seen as nagging or nit picking. All this is because, like i mentioned, generations of men have been handled with kid gloves by women. So they recoil at criticism when it comes from a woman. They are not used to it and feels is inherently aggressive. Hard to even wrap my head around but that’s how they are. Pretty sure it’s all of them	1640884655.0	hqkgf6w	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqkgf6w/

8l6c7	A walk is not a date, I agree. But I'm not taking a girl on a date before I've seen her in real life. The walk is because all of your makeup, filters, slim waist pants, angles and what not that make girls that aren't hot look hot in pictures. Among my friends, anyone who is "worth dating" wouldn't take a random girl from a dating app straight to a fancy restaurant. Really, I advice you to reconsider this position and accept that a quality guy who wants to take you on a date will want to see you IRL first. Otherwise, you should expect to be dating below your own standard.	1640885038.0	hqkhg5m	t3_rs5nro	t1_hqkdlqj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqkhg5m/

5587k26c	This is why you don't try to correct guys like this. He doesn't care that you aren't into the idea. His focus now is to "debate" and wear down your boundaries so that you'll accept something you don't want to do to make him happy. Walk dates are shit tests for this reason: it's an opening for him to see how little you'll accept for the privilege of being seen in public with him.  If he were actually interested in doing something you'd enjoy, there would be no mention of a walk date.  The ultimate "low risk" situation is no date with him at all.	1640885157.0	hqkhrnf	t3_rs5nro	t3_rs5nro	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqkhrnf/

4nwjez7b	I think you can usually get rid of an avoidant with time. Don’t think that avoidants live the hermit lifestyle and have no friends as some of the comments here are saying - I met and even unfortunately dated many avoidants who had flourishing careers, had a solid group of male friends, and were close with their family.   In my opinion, the defining attribute of avoidants is love bombing you at the beginning and then pulling away once they have you/realize that you have fallen for them. Sometimes you don’t need to even fall for them, they naturally pull away after dating for a month because going on more than 5 dates is too serious for them and they feel trapped 🙄  My advice would be to keep your guard up and don’t get too attached too quickly. You’ll see their mask fall off within a month.	1640885311.0	hqki6iy	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqki6iy/

They’re not some type of feminist altruists who only want to help young women through the goodness of their hearts.

h57msag5	I confidently and unapologetically advocate an FDS viewpoint among my friends and acquintances. Sometimes, I can hear the *click* of a mindset shift in others. So my solution is similar to the FDS forum: empower eachother. In my experience, people are most receptive to the message when they are themselves anxiously attached, or in a situationship with an avoidant, and being OUTSIDE of a group setting helps the most. Otherwise everyone will just start parroting the dominant hook-up culture dogma again.  Example: recently I had a private conservation with a friend who is pining over a man with multiple women chasing him. She had had sex with him once and he told her he found it moderately enjoyable. I let her vent and when she finished, I looked her dead in the eye and said:  "Or you could have standards. Why would you chase some manslut around who is obviously using you for sex, and says he didn't even like the sex? Why are you accepting this disrespect? This cannot be good for your self-esteem and this will reflect very badly on you in the dating pool. If you chase him you'll just be the next desperately available pvssy in his harem" ...and went on for another good three minutes non-stop throwing arguments for my case. Al she could exclaim was: "You're right. You're absolutely right."  I thought I had a breakthrough. 10 minutes later, she slipped back into hook-up culture mode and made excuses again. But, a seed has been planted.  **tl;dr: I try to contribute to a culture shift by being unapologetic, vocal, and ruthlessly advocating for FDS school of thought. I've noticed the most influence in one-on-one conversations with anxious attached individuals.**  DISCLAIMER: If someone is in a situationship with an avoidant, and they're extremely defensive about your message, let it go. Some people are too far gone in denial and will burn every bridge before they ditch their LV partners.	1640886612.0	hqklmxr	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqkfqdn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqklmxr/
85wa1d0h	Saying something difficult or odd to start a fight at a time when it would make sense for you be closer e.g. on your birthday or some other celebration or on a romantic weekend away. Or if you’ve been having a lovey dovey few days together. One way to do this is to triangulate you with other women. Anything to squash any ‘closeness’. Always saying ‘what are your plans this weekend’ even though you’re an established couple. There’s no ‘what are our plans this weekend’. Look at what their default is at the beginning of the relationship in terms of wanting to connect with you. That is their preference. They may change when you ask them but they show you who they are at the beginning. E.g. like you say, hot and cold or never calling you on the phone - just texting - when you’re both trying to establish a relationship. Will drag their feet in introducing you to their family. Will keep their friends and you compartmentalised. Will be single - they are constantly recycled back into dating because they cannot form proper relationships. This is why we meet so many of the awkward tossers! Grr..	1640886700.0	hqklvcn	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqklvcn/

eo34pdbz	And this may cause a scene, which is uncomfortable    But this is still a way less dangerous situation than going on a walk with a male stranger who could easily overpower you (e.g. drag you into a car, house or the bushes... and bring friends) or outrun you. And that's not even mentioning actually having a comfortable environment to get to know each other.  Imagine they got the chance to ask their absolute dream girl (let's say someone like a superfamous actress, singer or even fictional character)out on a date. Would they offer "going for a walk" to her? No. They'd pull out all the stops to impress her and win her over.

h57msag5	Love your point on ignoring agency in relationships. Every action is a choice. Not taking any action, is a choice as well. Indeed like not course-correcting.  I feel like ""you can't force it" started as genuinely well-meant advice for people who'd obsessively throw themselves at their love interests. So a warning to PickMe behaviour.  Now it has been weaponised: "You have to accept low-value behaviour, otherwise you're a high maintenance b1tch who is forcing it". Not getting a text back for 24 hours-- Life happens!  Not seeing eachother for two weeks-- So busy! Not in a relationship but you've been dating for 6 months-- Oh well, I'm fine with the way things are. She never cums-- Can't force it!	1640887586.0	hqko85k	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqkfsp8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqko85k/

cunf5ap7	Thank you for this post. FDS works. The people it protects us from are at the least time wasters, and at the worst predatory, dangerous, fatal. It’s a big span, imagine like a solid color fading into a different solid color on the other end. If being treated with respect and a loving, healthy relationship is one end/color, and at the other end/color are men who don’t consider your humanity whatsoever and take joy in your suffering, somewhere in the mixed colors is a man who wants a submissive and obeying life manager, baby incubator, maid, therapist, money source, sex machine, who never questions him, is grateful for nothing, and sacrifices everything about who she is to benefit him. FDS teaches us these colors, this scale, how to get for generous, competent, respectful, committed men, and REMOVE men who show detrimental quantities and what those are in tangible terms. DOES THIS SEEM WILD YET? FDS is teaching us how to have standards and why it benefits us. This same phrase is repeated over and over on this site FOR GOOD REASON, because that IS the reason we are successful and why they are mad.	1640888302.0	hqkq43f	t3_rs7ii2	t3_rs7ii2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7ii2/fds_angers_reddit_at_large_and_thats_how_you_know/hqkq43f/

dsz5cs6w	Monkey branching. He has “long term relationships” that last about 2-3 years. His history of partners bleed into one another with almost no breaks in between. Often cheats on current partner, then jumps right in with the affair partner , with no break in between . Even worse, ALL of his “relationships” start and end this way. Another sign is serial monogamy. Only taking a few days/weeks/months to be single. Emotional cheating .physical cheating. Excessive need of alone time, yet needs excessive validation from the opposite sex.  Avoidents will do awful things to you to make you feel insecure, then gaslight you about it.  They are big fans of using “dread game”They will call you “needy”.

I’m on Lexapro and foolishly tried to wean myself off of it to increase my libido for a guy (yes, I was a 🤡 of the highest order) and not only did it obviously not work but I magically figured that I could actually orgasm without him—he was just an asshat.	1640888690.0	hqkr4yk	t3_rs3cw1	t1_hqk8cp8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs3cw1/this_should_be_how_women_approach_sex_if_he_cant/hqkr4yk/

mr2s2	According to male logic, you can't criticize a man because men don't do anything wrong. And if he did do something wrong, it was because the woman in his life *made him do it*. Men are allergic to responsibility and are incapable of accepting accountability for their actions.   You can't criticize a LVM because they don't know how to self reflect, analyze, or respond appropriately. They just react. And usually poorly as a defense mechanism.	1640889027.0	hqks10g	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqks10g/

86ugvp1g	Just last year, my best friend of 30 years and I broke up. I had had enough of her bullying. FDS taught me the red flags. I never knew what negging was. I knew she had bullied me when we were younger and I cut her off for several years as a result. I thought she changed with maturity. I was very attached to other parts of her personality. She was fun. The impetus for this most recent break up was her attempting to relive her bullying me when we were in our late teens, when she and her brother thought it would be funny to hit me in the head with a phallic shaped balloon yelling SUCK IT. I would run out of the room crying.   So she says, giggling, “remember when me and my brother used to hit you (it was multiple occasions) with the ballon yelling s…?” I stopped her and said, “l never like that, it was horribly not funny at all!” She tried to back track with, “I thought you liked it.”   I started having nightmares. I told her this. I told her I needed a break from the friendship to sort it out and to be sure that I don’t unfairly look at her through the lens of the past. She didn’t respond. A week later, I got an email from her (bc she swore I blocked her from other forms of communication) to ask me if she could use a my “coupon code”. I said I wasn’t comfortable with that bc we’d have to discuss the details so she didn’t get caught using a code she wasn’t supposed to. Well, that set her off, cue the bullying.   I could write a book on all the ways she’s mistreated me, but that is not the point. The point is that I missed every single red flag waved in my direction. My gut felt it, but because she’s otherwise a “good friend” for 30 years, I convinced myself that I was overreacting.   She never missed an opportunity to hate on women. She never missed an opportunity to have a group of women at a party hate her because she behaved like she was looking for sex. Her ex husband was an abuser in prison, for life, but she sneaks him burner phones. She has sons, and she hangs out with them and their friends, buying them “goodies”, while hating their moms and girlfriends. She LOVES her alcoholic Dad who abandoned her, and hates her mom who worked 3 jobs to feed her. I was never comforted with any of this. I just shrugged it off as, well yeah, she’s a bit desperate for male attention, but she’s such a good friend because she…because she…she’s just so much fun to be around…that’s all I could come up with.   She would have been the girl in the video pushing me, breaking me, to make the guys would think she was so cool. Then apologize with some bullshit that somehow made her the victim. That girl could have died or spent the rest of her life paralyzed.   These women are the right arm of the patriarchy. If you find yourself in a situation where you’re wondering if you’re dealing with Ms.Scrote, you probably are. Treat them how you treat Mr.Srote - block-delete.	1640889337.0	hqksug6	t3_rs7vtt	t3_rs7vtt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqksug6/

5vhe0zcp	I've looked through your post history also. You seem very angry, and your comment comes across as very patronising, after I called you out on your aggressive behaviour towards me. You don't seem to be in a position to be mentoring anyone about anything right now. I suggest you take some time out and work on yourself and why you're so angry, before calling yourself a coach and potentially causing harm to the women you claim you are helping. It's great that FDS apparently for you, but there isn't a one size fits all for dating and improving your life. I personally could never find such aggression being in any way helpful. All the best.	1640889769.0	hqktzeu	t3_rrdlo4	t1_hqkeeob	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrdlo4/this_sht_right_here/hqktzeu/

caxkcnil	Yup. When I “criticized” my exes, they either 1) gaslight me, by repeating “I doN’T undErsTaNd” when I was being clear or 2) pretend they “got it” only to make a hurtful comment about me (personal attacks that had nothing to do with our relationship) to get back at me/punish me for calling them out on their behaviour. 3) give the silent treatment	1640889798.0	hqku233	t3_rs1gt7	t1_hqks10g	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqku233/

I'd bet all my limbs he consistently refers to himself as a "gentleman" or a "good guy", too 🤢     Promiscuous men like this fuck around because they have emotional issues, and are scared of the vulnerability that comes with actually connecting with a woman.

One of my favourite laws is conceal your intentions and I think you can apply it to FDS. It's better to not be open and direct about your FDS ideology and feminist beliefs.

5qgi7cue	One of my first sexual assault examinations was done on a patient from a “walking date.”  She met him on OLD, got in his car wearing a cute dress and heels, and he drove her to the woods 20 miles outside of town for a “sunset hike.” She tried to object because it was getting cold and dark, and she wasn’t dressed appropriately for a hike, but he ignored her objections and kept driving. She was effectively trapped in his car.  She said she had to be as pleasant and accommodating as possible so he wouldn’t murder her in the woods, or get angry with her and abandon her in the forest. He raped her in the woods.

He was in his early 30’s. 20 year old tried to tell pickme supreme off because she was still hanging out with him, even though he had abused COUNTLESS women. The youngest being 17. To this day, pick me supreme sticks up for the serial abuser. She also sends him nudes when he is in relationships. She sends him nudes when she is in relationships.

mr2s2	>LVM would literally rather emotionally abuse you than make efforts to become better men.  Because they can't accept that they are the problem. You bringing up that they are indeed the problem, hurt their feelings/ego/whatever, and now they have to hurt you back because they don't know how to process their hurt feelings and turn into an infant who throws a spiteful tantrum to get even.  It doesn't even need to be outright criticism for you to see this in action. I told my ex (when we were still married at the time) that I didn't feel loved. That's it. I just made a factual statement of my own feelings. I didn't criticize him outright. I didn't even ask him for anything. I just stated my thoughts and feelings into one simple sentence: "I don't feel loved."  Well, that surely pissed him off internally. How could I, after 13 years together, not feel loved?! I must be crazy, right? Never for a moment did he sit and think about what I said and what it might mean to him as my husband. Nope. He just blamed outwardly and concluded that if I didn't feel loved after so many years together, that that was somehow my own fault. Ok. And then he did what all male logic would make him do. He did nothing. And made pretty damn sure he was going to continue to do nothing to change that unloved feeling I had. It's like when abusive parents say, "If you're going to cry, I'll give you something to cry about." It runs along that same mentality. *If you're going to feel nothing, I'll give you nothing to feel about.*	1640892232.0	hql0eow	t3_rs1gt7	t1_hqku233	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hql0eow/

There are HVMs out there, not in here :).	1640892308.0	hql0lwp	t3_rs7ii2	t3_rs7ii2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7ii2/fds_angers_reddit_at_large_and_thats_how_you_know/hql0lwp/
9zlwye6c	I found FDS on posts like you have mentioned OP and I’m so thankful for that 😂  People on here can tolerate r*pe subs, borderline pedo subs and zoophilia but draw the line at a subreddit that promotes women wanting better themselves. They only see women as f*ckholes that they can abuse and use. Redditors hate female people except when we’re being sufficiently abused, humiliated and exploited by men.  And this is why men (and sadly many women) feel so threatened - because we talk about it. We motivate and help each other. We criticize the patrichary and how liberal feminism only benefits men.  Be strong girls, we’re doing everything right 🥰	1640892319.0	hql0mwh	t3_rs7ii2	t3_rs7ii2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7ii2/fds_angers_reddit_at_large_and_thats_how_you_know/hql0mwh/

It's only purpose is complete annihilation of the soul. The only men I've known to handle *constructive* criticism well is my grandfather, my current husband, and his late grandfather.	1640892412.0	hql0vmd	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hql0vmd/

1172dx	7 part series on tiktok where a woman goes live to tell off her boyfriend/husband (not sure if they're married) because he won't clean up after himself, he won't get a job, an education, and he won't take care offhis child. He had a meltdown because she went to the movies and he had to watch their kid despite that he had no plans that night. Instead of taking responsibility for all the problems she mentioned in their relationship, he gaslights her and makes thinly veiled accusations that she is cheating despite that she never has time to leave the house and they both live with his parents.	1640892451.0	hql0z7j	t3_rs9tw0	t3_rs9tw0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs9tw0/realities_of_being_with_a_manchild/hql0z7j/

However, a Secure person is confident in communicating their needs and boundaries. Whereas an Avoidant will avoid communication and tends to withdraw / shut down.  As a recovering Anxious attached, I'm running as soon as I spot Avoidant behaviour. The most important thing to recognise here is that the Avoidant feels most at ease with a partner at arm's length, because they feel suffocation easily. Whereas the Anxious fears neglect and will thus feel the urge to chase, to receive the affection they crave. This is the anxious-avoidant trap, and it is HELL ON EARTH for Anxious attached folks.

7vijlezo	Wow. I could have written this except some minor differences in who this person became as an adult. I realize now why I kept flocking to narcissist abusive men as an adult—my “BFF” of 30 years set the stage.   I haven’t yet blocked and deleted—I don’t know why. I’m trying to grey rock her, but with her hoovering just amping up, I know that I need to cut the chord—I know it’s the only way.   After I found FDS, and took a long look at the men in my life, I realized I needed to take an even harder look at the single woman who had been treating me like shit since we were kids. It’s a rough pill to swallow, but the continued ignorance could have literally killed me. Her behavior was and is still abysmal/dangerous towards me—and many many others.	1640895012.0	hql7k86	t3_rs7vtt	t1_hqksug6	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hql7k86/

Not to mention that I had literally no male role model for a HVM anywhere around me.  In general: If he doesn't treat you like the queen you are, he's not really into you - or unable/unwilling to show it.

He should pay rent, probably either market rent or prorated to their incomes. None of this “I pay utilities she pays mortgage”  weaselly workaround, supposedly so it doesn’t look like he’s paying the mortgage and owning—no landlord thinks they’re getting a co-owner when they lease a property and the money they get in rent pays the mortgage. He should just give her a check/Venmo every month.   Just figure out a number and stick to it.   If he feels he should get a discount for the home repairs, he should quantify and then negotiate.	1640896112.0	hqlackb	t3_rs1zle	t3_rs1zle	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1zle/men_of_all_ages_will_take_advantage_of_women_when/hqlackb/

Then we leave and divert all of that energy back into ourselves. And you're right, no one levels up like a woman leaving a bad relationship.

caxkcnil	Exactly. Their sons are going to be alright. It’s not because a some of us on FDS choose not to date them that they’ll be single forever.   This is still a man’s world and the vast majority women don’t vet/aren’t as ruthless as we are here on FDS.  I truly don’t understand why so many single mothers took this post personally, this isn’t an attack on them, and it’s not on their sons either, if they’re so sure they raised high-value men and have a healthy relationship with them, they shouldn’t be worried at all.  It’s weird to see women invalidate our experiences and downvote you to oblivion. If they don’t want to participate to this discussion, that’s fine, but don’t try to silence other women.   This isn’t about you, put your feelings aside, and let women find ways to protect themselves from low-value men who come from dysfunctional families.	1640897227.0	hqld5tj	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjq8z3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqld5tj/

cw7827nc	That’s not really what happened in Medea. She was basically Barbara the builder, she gave up everything for Jason, made him wealthy, made him famous, was with him for years. But when he took her back home and they had two sons together, then he had a chance to upgrade and marry the king’s young daughter. Medea was older than Jason and though he was glad to take advantage of her magic to get ahead in life, in his hometown, he joined everyone else in calling her an old witch and treating her terribly. It was very Betty Broderick. Jason had left her and was planning this elaborate wedding to the princess and he was taking the sons with him into his new life with a new mother. Medea was basically a prisoner being forced to watch this. So she poisons her sons because that will hurt Jason more than anything. She does it even though it’s going to hurt her, too. As she explains in the end, anything else, killing Jason, his fiancé, etc would only leave her more vulnerable. You also have to take the story with a grain of salt, because it’s written by man. I’ll say this, it’s my favorite Greek play. None of that whiny shit. Medea isn’t sitting around waiting for a man to rescue her or give her purpose. And she’s not shaking her hand at the heavens like most people who get dealt a bad hand.	1640898197.0	hqlfmwv	t3_rs7vtt	t1_hqkvpcj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqlfmwv/

7r96naxj	It's the out of control inconsistency. Being consistently reserved and wary is fine.  Avoidants have a childhood wound that makes them feel smothered when they get too close. Usually an absent or unreliable parent that put them through the hope-abandonment-hope cycle. They become walled off to protect themselves. Hoping hurts.  They're alone for a while, feel the normal need for connection, start up some shit with a woman, go overboard with love-bombing because they don't know how to grow a relationship naturally, and don't want to put effort in for too long anyway.  Then the relationship progresses, they panic and pull away to feel safe again. They start to blame the woman for their own feelings. She's overbearing, smothering, controlling, hampering his freedom. He feels better, then lonely, he reaches out again. Completely self-absorbed and uncaring as to the effect he's having on the woman he just put on a shelf.  They usually activate a woman's anxious attachment, so then she *does* become clingy and needy, trying to get normal levels of communication, openness and intimacy. The idea of being wanted by a woman seems like a trick so he panics again.	1640898318.0	hqlfy1y	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjnk9n	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqlfy1y/

h57msag5	 I've been at both ends of the spectrum (higher and lower libido) in WLW relationships, and the best strategy for the higher libido is, in my opinion:   Either do everything within your power to become more sexually attractive, accept the situation and don't bother your partner about it, or break up if it really is a deal breaker. Resent never helped anyone, and begging/pleading never gave any woman the hots.  That said... If I had a wife who was pregnant with our child for 9 months and gave birth, you bet I'd be taking care of every single chore and pampering her like the gem she is. While ofcourse also helping out with at least half of the childcare, or paying for a babysitter if my job doesn't allow me to be present myself.

As the other ladies have said, a lot of subs **require** a very watered down version of feminism because they are ran by men who obviously do not like getting their feelings hurt at the truth 😔 and with FDS in your history it's just an easy target to hopefully dismiss you before other women look too hard at it.   I've actually had success saying the exact same things I feel on my main, but ultimately I'm not sure it makes a difference. I think a lot of women are waking up to the collective gaslighting we get on here and are pushing back because I've seen it a lot more frequently, but with men in charge they just do their best to bury it.	1640900711.0	hqlm15w	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqlm15w/

3kh4c	i've learned that if i find myself criticizing the guy i'm dating, then that's a good indication i'm not compatible with them. i can only observe their behavior and then choose to accept them or move on. my best relationships have been with guys who i admired and respected through and through *despite* what i perceived to be as their flaws.   i've only dated 1 guy who i criticized heavily, and it only started bc he was constantly criticizing and trying to change me. nothing about me was right, at best i was 'good enough'. in turn i criticized him back to try and show him that there were things about *him* that *i* would like to change too. it was such an un-sexy dynamic and it killed all of the romance/sexual attraction that we had bc it doesn't feel safe to be vulnerable with someone who thinks they settled for you.   he was shook when i left him. SHOOK. my self confidence was too high to be with someone who didn't cherish me. i think he got the idea that this was how couples acted from his very stereotypical boomer parents who never had anything nice to say about each other. and unfortunately i think this kind of relationship modeling is endemic to people who were raised by boomer parents, which is why so many of us experience this same kind of shitty treatment from the guys we date (or worse, marry).	1640900819.0	hqlmavf	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqlmavf/

If you 'attack' them, they need to lash out to get back on top.  Hence, the majority of cops being rubbish and needing to be fired and replaced with people who don't flip their shit when they're not immediately obeyed.  If you're with a man who has displeased you or fucked up and you make a direct statement, eg. "I don't like that, don't do it again" or "You did this, I'd rather you do that", and they don't acknowledge what you said and agree to do better, but instead they start to JADE (justify argue defend explain), cut him off. Even worse, reacting emotionally and explosively. Get out.  Do this ONE TIME. If they escalate instead of calming down, get rid of them immediately. It will save you years of pointless coMmuNiCaTion. They don't think they did anything wrong. Or they shouldn't be held accountable.	1640900855.0	hqlme5o	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqlme5o/

It totally satiates my competition and drama cravings and some (not all) of the women on the show are crazy talented and inspiring. Yeah, some contestants aren’t HV, but the show doesn’t focus on their personal lives so it doesn’t take away from the show. Eric from season 16 is hands down my favorite, what he did in season 17 for his wife (ep 5 for those that are curious) I melted.	1640901064.0	hqlmxd5	t3_rsabu7	t1_hql6p65	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsabu7/spot_the_pattern/hqlmxd5/

167ebmzu	I personally struggle with avoidant behaviors sometimes and from my perspective, I don't invest in a relationship emotionally at all until I know the other person will reciprocate, and even then I am watchful for waning interest so I can break and run faster.   I wouldn't use small gestures of affection as a measure because it's so easy to drop a few compliments/how was your days/remember a few details etc. Test their willingness to put in actual work in the relationship- be it communication, conflict resolution etc. You just have to keep in mind "if he wanted to, he would".  In my experience and understanding as a psych related scientist, avoidants learned that their parents weren't reliable sources of comfort, and into adulthood, they probably won't rely on their partner for comfort either. They can still provide comfort, but look at where they go to get it, if that makes sense.	1640902642.0	hqlqvto	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqlqvto/

Someone else took her to the hospital, she gave birth without him and he took his time before he actually bothered to visit... It gave me the ick before, now I know why.  She was saying how she understands, he needs to work on his career, he'd be too anxious anyway, blah blah, coddling bs. I lost my respect for him after that. He's always portrayed as a great loving dad, meanwhile he didn't give a shit about his wife when she was going through all that pain to birth their children.	1640903263.0	hqlsezy	t3_rsabu7	t1_hqllecm	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsabu7/spot_the_pattern/hqlsezy/

h57msag5	There is a deep sadness and internal turmoil within insecurely attached people...  My Avoidant LVW ex had an expectation of abandonment and was very closed off from day 1, putting me in the position that I had to 'open her up'. She was so closed off that she fulfilled her own prophecy: "Why be vulnerable? Everybody leaves" and I left hurt and frustrated, after trying to get her to open up for 4 months. I got crumbs for my effort and she triggered my Anxious attachment style by her scarce and unpredictable affection.    If you don't mind me asking, how long would you say you test people's investment/commitment, without showing vulnerability in return?  On the flip side, as a recovering Anxious, my deepest fear is "You don't really love me, do you?" so my gut instinct is to merge and smother. Earn their love, and have them prove they love me by constantly providing affection. This behaviour is also very toxic in its own way: the perpetual chaser leaves no room to be desired, is usually the first to compromise their wants and needs, and may be controlling to calm their anxiety.	1640904297.0	hqlv0a5	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqlqvto	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqlv0a5/

Some scrote whining about:  >”the way you women are currently acting is red flags for all men. look how hysterical you are”  >“that why divorce rates are so high and when the man is asked, he thought the relationship was fine. women file for divorce far more to boot?”  So women are “hysterical” and emotional, but also secretive and impossible to read to the point where we hide our marital issues from our spouse until the moment of divorce?

3yz8979y	Let me share a story that perfectly illustrates my thoughts on this.   A man that I met at mutual friends’ party messaged me saying that it was nice to meet me and we began messaging back and forth. This was before I started really applying FDS to my life and before I started leveling up. I used to binge drink and I honestly have very little memory of meeting this man because I was very drunk at the party. Not sloppy falling over drunk, but very silly carefree super friendly drunk and enough so where some of my memory was impaired (I quit drinking for many reasons, the way I acted around men being one of them). I know for a fact that nothing sinister happened, as we were at a friends home surrounded by old friends, and when he messaged me when I was sober I was interested in getting to know him and didn’t have any lingering negative emotions or gut feelings from the night.   Within the first day of us messaging he offered a drink date. Like I mentioned, this was before I truly started following FDS principles so I accepted. Our schedules didn’t line up so the date ended up being set for about a week out. During this time we were still messaging with me being sober throughout every exchange. Looking back there were multiple red flags that warranted a block and delete but I wasn’t in that mentality yet.  FDS was on my mind though, and the way that I was presenting myself was different than the carefree drunk me that he initially met. For example, he sent me a sexual meme and I asked him why he would send that to me, that it was lame and not funny. Now this would be a immediate block and delete for me. He changed his tune and apologized for sending it. The next day he asked if I would prefer dinner instead of just drinks.   I think this is such a good example of how LV men think. They want to do just enough to get you to sleep with them. From my perspective, it seems as though he thought that drunk me was how I normally am and that I would be so down for a drink date to get wasted and have sex with him. When he realized that that wasn’t actually me, he offered dinner to try to impress me and make me think that he was serious about getting to know me.   I said yes, and of course he didn’t follow up with a time until the afternoon of the dinner date (yikes). I still went though, and boy was that date a field of red flags in itself. That was our first and only date.   Moral of the story is, men know exactly what they’re doing. Men know that it’ll take more than drinks for a first date to impress you WITHOUT you telling them. If he is dating, he should be more than capable of making dinner the initial date offer.   I hate to say this because it’s incredibly unfair and stupid, but the majority of LV men look at us and label us as easy or hard to sleep with. It’s all about how much effort they think it’ll take to have sex with you and has NOTHING to do with your worth as a person. This guy thought I was “worth” dinner without me having to ask to change the offer, and he still treated me poorly and was trash. LV men show LV effort.   Someone who is genuine, has their shit together and wants to get to know you as a whole and complete individual will offer dinner or an equally HV date. These are the only men who are worth your time.	1640906104.0	hqlzf7z	t3_rs5nro	t1_hqlm1tp	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqlzf7z/
cw1rizx2	Apparently they think that if you post on FDS you agree with EVERY single post here, and that an HVM is a 6-6-6 guy who needs their rights infringed on by installing spy cams and apps that monitor them 24/7.     Get mad. Sometimes I want them to just strike me up for a conversation instead of banning me or judging me for FDS, but then I remember they're all brainwashed by the idea that we've 'achieved equality'.	1640906306.0	hqlzx0g	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqlzx0g/

psdyfxu	I think we need to start teaching “emotional well-being” classes in high school, to help people start looking at behavior in their own lives and realizing that some of it is not acceptable - and setting boundaries. So many people go through life just trying to fit in to whatever horrible things are going on around them. This would help them step back and realize that some of it is just unacceptable. And maybe we could begin to finally break the cycle of misery that so many people keep perpetuating.	1640907645.0	hqm363j	t3_rs7vtt	t3_rs7vtt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqm363j/

bpbux1pi	This exact line of thinking is what led me to researching and meeting with estate planners recently to set up a living will and revocable trust. Since I'm divorced with no kids, my estranged parents would get 100% of my assets if I didn't do anything. I had always thought estate planning and trusts were for the super wealthy but I was wrong. I really only have my 401k and life insurance through work at this point (totalling well under $1m) and the firm I went with was lovely and nonjudgmental and understood my situation without question. I can also make any changes I'd like in the future as my financial and family situation changes.   I'd really recommend everyone look into this even if you have good family relationships because people can turn nasty when money is involved. My will and trust covers the obvious things like beneficiaries and charities and who gets specific items but also everything I hadn't thought about like naming a caretaker for my pets (with money set aside for their care) to who has access to my medical info if I'm incapacitated and (content warning) how long I'm willing to be on life support so no one else has to make that decision.  It was a weird conversation and it's hard to think about (especially when you're young and healthy) but I feel so much peace of mind having all of that legally covered.	1640908014.0	hqm422k	t3_rseqn2	t3_rseqn2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rseqn2/vet_rigorously_not_just_for_present_you_but/hqm422k/

I also made a point to wear normal pants a few times a week... or a dress. If I had lived in sweat pants and not adjusted my lifestyle, I would have gained more weight.   I honestly think gaining 39lbs over a few months is too much.

87jjfums	I remember being 14 and a freshman in high school. A junior boy was interested in me. He had been held back I think because he was 17 soon turning 18. I remember being so flattered and all the girls in my class being a mixture of jealous/excited for me because I had an older boy’s attention very early into the start of the school year.   We texted, and he would meet me outside of my classes to escort me to the next one.   I thought things were great. But then he asked me to prom which was a whole year away basically. We weren’t even officially bf/gf. So I asked him about that. I don’t remember exactly bc it’s been so long, but he basically said we were already together despite having never been on a real date or having a conversation about it prior to that one.   I gently told him going to prom sounded wonderful, but we needed to get to know each other more first before committing.   He then told me he had lost his virginity at 13 at a church function. Wtf?! I freaked out because 13 is incredibly young for that. He told me it was one of his biggest regrets and tried to get sympathy from me. Soon after he was asking for inappropriate photos. Thankfully I had the sense to break things off with him and avoid him.  But the boy I dated afterwards wasn’t too much better. Dating in HS is a joke.	1640912549.0	hqmevzn	t3_kwe52m	t1_gj4c1m3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/kwe52m/keep_it_real_out_there/hqmevzn/

4nm98s2k	This is not a new idea. We're bred since we are young to be told "you have to be pretty, and also it's cool if you don't care about the guy's looks". And every time there's a pretty girl with an ugly guy the masses cheer.  There's a reason the body positivity movement is female. Because that's subversive. Saying guys can be fat is not subversive.	1640912617.0	hqmf1ky	t3_rrjgbd	t3_rrjgbd	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrjgbd/nope_im_gonna_keep_dating_men_that_im_actually/hqmf1ky/

j2z76	I remember my dad said he was happy to retire a senior manager.  I told him he can’t, I already told my friends he was on his way to become VP.  a little push and he did retire as company VP. LOL.   Mom told him in no uncertain terms are they buying a house with less than two garages for the future cars this was in the 90s when they only owned one which was second hand.  Fast forward today, 5 cars and two homes.   What can sound demanding to one can be a motivation for the other.  In our family, everyone is pushed to “level up”. Not gonna lie it can be stressful but it has it’s own rewards. It also gave us a mindset, “if others can, I can. And if I can, others can too”.

5eyjl40e	True, but if he's really doing it to model good and kind behavior for his sons, and otherwise leaves his ex alone, then I'm okay with it. Christmas, Mother's Day, her birthday, that's okay to me. Otherwise as long as he keeps current with child support and isn't a flake about when he takes his kids, doesn't haul her to court all the time for power issues, and just tries to be a good man who realizes they didn't work out and owns his own part in that, yep... I give this one a pass, so long as all those "ifs" are met.

h57msag5	That is *intense*. Happy you are alive and well!  My spidey senses tingled when on the first week of uni, a guy insisted on escorting (extremely drunk and naive) young me home "just to make sure I was safe". I told him that wasn't necessary, but he insisted. I thought "how chivalrous, what a gentleman".  He escorted me to my street. I said "Thank you, I can find it from here." He insisted to take my to my building. We reached my building, I thanked him again, said he should go now. He then insisted to escort me to my room "Just to make sure I reach it safely".  What started as a feeling of unease, instantly became Red Alert survival mode. Even in my drunken stupor, I managed to RUN to my dorm, unlock the door in one swift motion, and slam it shut just in time because he had already followed me to my doorstep.	1640914417.0	hqmj2yx	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqmj2yx/

I had a strange instance where I had been Christmas shopping a few weeks ago and instead of driving I had taken the train. When I returned to the train station a man behind seemed to fall. My FDS kicked in and I shuffled away because I've seen men use this as a tactic to touch me. There were woman of a similar age group around who vocally asked 'Are you ok? Do you need an ambulance?' Suddenly he's ok. It's a Christmas miracle!	1640914967.0	hqmkaq0	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqmkaq0/

According to Google, 50% of it's users left in 2010. It was most popular 2005-2008 (a current 21 year old would have been like 5-8 at the time). I barely remember dial up.

amm3tygb	A few months ago, I was meeting a friend at a restaurant with a small parking lot. The lot was full that evening, so I went to go park in the dimly lit residential area a block away. As I was driving by the restaurant, I saw a very drunk man walking along the sidewalk. It took me a minute to find parking, and as I pulled into a spot I saw that the man had turned the corner onto the block that I was now on. I got out of the car for a second, glanced at him, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Thankfully, I also forgot my phone, so I got back into the car after only a few steps. I looked out the rear view mirror, and saw the man was leaning against a fence, next to an alley, maybe two car lengths from me. Just standing there. I locked my doors and decided to sit tight for a few minutes, watching him out of my rear view.   This man did. Not. Move. I sat there for ten, fifteen minutes. Finally, I decided to start my car again and see if any spaces in the lot had opened up. The way the streets were set up, I had to drive a bit and then go back the way I came, and I saw that after I drove away he started walking again.   I’m sorry this happened to you.

7vgrv1od	Absolutely. I’ve witnessed PickMes defend child predators and blame the woman for trying to “seduce” them. 🤢🤮 I’ve also witnessed PickMes throw their own female family members under the bus just to desperately flirt with any man they think might be interested in the women around them and try to take the attention off of their more attractive and successful friends or family members. They get very upset when they’re not the center of attention. It’s disgusting the way they behave.	1640915745.0	hqmm0yw	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqiolqf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqmm0yw/

I once dated a guy who was going through a brutal divorce with a woman who had just horribly abused him and fucked him over, and he still never said anything unkind about her. He was over it and moving on and all, but when he’d talk about it, he’d never call her names or say anything disrespectful, and I was always impressed at how much he took the higher ground. (I personally wouldn’t have been so kind). He was a really HVM.	1640916654.0	hqmo1kt	t3_rsgt37	t3_rsgt37	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsgt37/date_men_who_think_like_this/hqmo1kt/

cw7827nc	I see people are mad, but this is the gospel truth. It’s just an uncomfortable truth. Just like the truth most m.en are hot garb.age. We all had to grow up and get over that, in spite of the fact that we all have fathers and brothers and other male relatives that we love. I’ve dated LV sons of single moms and LV sons of two parent homes and the difference is night and day. You’re right about the anger. There is a vitriol, a forcefulness that just doesn’t exist for other men. My first bf was crazy emeshed with his mother. His parents have been divorced since he was a little boy and his mom had him working to pay her mortgage as a teen! He started off sweet as pie to me. Getting me extravagant gifts, talking till dawn, scads of what seemed like emotional support. I think he wanted to be the ideal man his mom talked about. But years under her tutelage had taught him to be a master manipulator by 18. He began trying to isolate me, said horrible things about my parents and tried to convince me to cut them off, just because we had a normal parent child relationship where they paid the bills. He was straight emotionally abusive, encouraged by his mother, who hated me for taking her husband surrogate away. She was angry in the beginning when he treated me so well and she was thrilled when he tried to break my spirit. Literally once I went over at his invitation and he was in the kitchen with another girl, triangulating. I went on the porch to cry and his mother came outside and smiled at the sight of me weeping. Just stood there. I broke it off after that, realizing that whole dynamic was insane. But it wasn’t unique. I’ve seen it over and over. I used to think my mother was just being classist when she told me to date boys from intact homes, but I had to learn for myself. The rules are the rules. And yes, maybe there’s an exception to the rule, but that’s an exception. It’s rare. And people don’t like the rules because they seem skewed or classist, this-ist or that-ist. But this is your life, not a charity. You don’t owe men a chance and you don’t have to be equal opportunity. You do what’s right for you.	1640918668.0	hqmshar	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqmshar/

Literally including the whole group in their first date. Cringe.  Oh wait, LVM stick together and view women as dolls who exist solely for their amusement. Probably rating her appearance the minute she goes to the restroom on a scale of *bangable - bag-able*. Highfives for Scrote if he manages to 'hit that' at the end of the night, or bullying him for being a B3ta Cvck if he fails.	1640919076.0	hqmtdc1	t3_rsiyez	t1_hqmqj3w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsiyez/anyone_else_experiencing_the_desperation_going_on/hqmtdc1/

cw7827nc	Listen, I’m a BW, you can check my post history. And yes sons of single mothers are disproportionately bla.ck. And they’re disproportionately useless as well. Check our r@pe and homicide stats-double everyone else’s or higher. BW as a whole are unprotected and preyed on by these men. There’s a reason so many BW are divesting. I don’t think that she saying that women can’t raise sons alone. The blame is on their absent fathers. But whatever the cause, no one can deny the effect. And I think part of being an HV woman is learning how to make better choices. Clearly what BW have done in the past has not worked.	1640919320.0	hqmtw40	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqkxfg7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqmtw40/
feq968si	Why should higher earning women “pay up” to a man when studies show breadwinner women spend more time taking care of kids AND spend more money on their kids than higher earning men.   Studies also show men who receive child support are more likely to spend it on themselves compared to women. Men don’t deserve a penny from women.   Also why simp for a deadbeat dad? He should be spending the money he would use to leave the country on paying his ex back.	1640919352.0	hqmtyk5	t3_rses1k	t1_hqmrnwm	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rses1k/an_israeli_queen_is_making_her_kids_dad_support/hqmtyk5/

h57msag5	My father used to be "unable to wake up", unless pestered/begged by his wife. After they divorced, teenage me took over this task.  He'd have ten or so alarms set, shut them all off one by one, and rolled back into bed each time. This started at 6 a.m. and they always woke me up, one hour before my alarm clock, so I could never sleep in. It took me half an hour each morning to drag him out of bed. He'd never thank me. In fact, he was moody as hell when I woke him.  Eventually I, fifteen years of age, told him: "You are a grown man. I'm not waking you up anymore."  **Ladies, the mantrum was**  ***u n r e a l***.  *"Go ahead. I'll lose my job if you do."* Your problem, it's not my job. *"We'll see how you like living in poverty. You're living off of my income, you're screwed if I lose my job."* No I'm not, I'll just become an orphan, you will be homeless though. 💅  He set his alarm clocks to start at 5 a.m. on full volume as revenge. This stopped after two weeks, because I ignored it. He overslept *twice* before he was suddenly perfectly capable of waking up, probably because his boss got pissed.	1640920489.0	hqmwcp0	t3_rsih6h	t3_rsih6h	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsih6h/yeah_yeah_i_know_the_answer_is_just_to_leave_but/hqmwcp0/

We get to a 4 way stop sign and this crazed maniac puts his car in park and gets out of his car! I was like oh shit, windows up doors locked.

I can be:   1) happily single   2) happily in a relationship with an adequate, mature, and fully capable man who knows how to take care of stuff.   If these are my options, why waste my time one educating, teaching, training, and ultimately patronizing a man who is actually a child on the inside?   I ain't got time for that.

5cp1c9w0	Oh yeah, 100%! We should have higher standards than the bare minimum I outlined, it’s just that they can’t even meet the bare minimum hence why we need to employ so many vetting strategies. It’s absolute BS. If they just stopped being so selfish, they would even have nice lives and relationships. Instead, they would rather use and abuse women, suffer shallow lives and then blame women for it. It’s insane.

fv6ar7ce	Reading  this I recalled Ted Bundy's tactic pretending to need help/ask questions. Yikes.   Once I was getting fuel at night (in this place people put the fuel in for you, you don't have to get out of the car) and I noticed a car parked with a man inside. I started to drive away and noticed the car moving following me. From the gas station I got on to the highway, because I was not going to go straight home and let that person know where I lived; I managed to at the very last minute grab an exit and lose him, then drive back home. Otherwise I would have driven straight to the police.   Always be aware of your surroundings, many victimis of crimes are victims of opportunity; lock your doors the minute you get into the car; keep windows up, especially the back ones. Never park in a lonely dark far away spot ever; If you can't get out of your car, drive away or call someone.   Trust your instincts.	1640922369.0	hqn0c6a	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqn0c6a/

fv6ar7ce	No. Don't mention your savings to any dates. Your financial status and mortgage status is on a need to know basis. One thing is being honest and another being transparent (i.e. blurting out  all about you)  You don't need to mention you live in a house that you own or whether it is paid in full. Just say "I live in Throwaway District or or in a one-storey house. How about you?" and divert the topic away from home ownership unless they have facilitated that information first **and** they own their place **and** their mortgage is paid in full. I.E. if they are renting I am not going to say *oh I own my home*, instead I'd ask if they like the area and why and take the topic away from home ownership.  Take a while to work on your self esteem, see a therapist, and enjoy life with yourself. When the time comes and you are strong and confident, then you need to strongly vet a man who has it together in life.   Since this takes time, before any serious commitments you should know if he is responsible with his finances. Only then I'd disclose that mine are healthy etc.  If you think of marriage, make sure you have a prenup.	1640924402.0	hqn4hdk	t3_rsl0l8	t3_rsl0l8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqn4hdk/

5d2k45wp	Ah thank you for the advice, that all makes sense. Yeah I have a tendency to overshare / blurt things out (but I'm working on that) and am typically a bad liar but yeah I guess steering the conversation away is the best bet.  There have been several times where people have directly asked me (not dates nescesarily) 'oh do you rent?' And I usually just say yeah, but that can be tricky if I get closer to them and they realise I don't or if they find out. I don't want to seem untrustworthy but I also need to be careful.  Thank you, I do plan to use the next 6 months / year to focus solely on myself and recover from all my past relationships.   That's a good point though if a guy is in the same situation as me financially there's not as much need to hide it as he can't really take advantage compared to a jobless or broke guy. And good advice on the prenup I would definitely get one for marriage.	1640925312.0	hqn69r6	t3_rsl0l8	t1_hqn4hdk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqn69r6/
a500fd6w	Don't tell a date anything about your finances, family or sexual history. All of these are things are potentially "sensitive topics" that can put you in a vulnerable position with manipulating LVM.   It's not relevant to dating at all, and only once you're in a position where money is truly relevant to your committed relationship, like preparing a prenup or moving in together prior to marriage, should you discuss it.	1640925402.0	hqn6g6a	t3_rsl0l8	t3_rsl0l8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqn6g6a/

I feel like, after the latest maybe 25ish (but realistically younger than that), the sex with as many people as possible should get kind of old… I just don’t understand this new “thrill” that even cheaters talk of. Want some excitement in your life? Try something new! Go travelling to a new place, study for a new career, open a business, sky dive, become a sky dive teacher, learn to scuba dive, go trekking somewhere, go to a theme park, paragliding, swim with sharks, ANYTHING!

5cp1c9w0	My gosh, this is so scary. Good on your for trusting your instincts and I’m so glad you’re ok! I feel like a lot of people would fall for his tactic and it’s a common one for people to leave things on the windows so the driver gets out to check it out, then they rob them or steal their car.  It’s terrifying out there.  I was in a car park in broad daylight around the corner from my home a few weeks ago, chilling in my car after I had been to the shop, which I often do. A guy walked super close to my drivers window and looked in and then kept walking past, and while he did that, another guy went to the passenger seat and tried to get into my car! Luckily the doors were locked. One of my friends said “maybe he thought I was an Uber driver” but no way. This guy was really dishevelled and had a Suspicious look on his face, plus he didn’t have his phone out (which most people do when waiting for an Uber).	1640927943.0	hqnb8hm	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqnb8hm/

fmxwzjyb	Wow you definitely did the right thing. Any man who can't understand a lone woman locking their door in this situation isn't living fully in reality. His immediate aggression is an obvious sign he was up to no good. I've been the man in situations like that and my immediate response was to communicate the situation without aggression if it was important enough and to make sure i was being as nonthreatening as possible. Cuz I'm 200+ pounds and bearded i already look crazy 😆 in any case just to add to the tip about the window. Don't roll it down even a crack. Once closed it creates a sort of seal that strengthens the integrity of the glass. Cracking the window weakens that some in case he tried to strike the window.            edit: That sounds like something I've read about as a tactic for human traffickers.	1640921182.0	hqmxtc8	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqmxtc8/
atoamyeg	These kinds of interactions are terrifying. My first encounter was the turning point to realize that there are RANDOM men out there who are 100% willing and capable of hurting you.   Mine happened when I was going home from work. As I was turning down the street to where I was staying (it was a street that had one entrance/exit and it was circular. Can’t spell what these kind of streets are at the moment lol) and as I was turning onto my street I noticed this man walking down the road (he was facing me and we made eye contact before I turned). I immediately had a horrible gut feeling as my street was dark and very rural with very few houses with people living in them. As I was pulling up to my house I looked in my mirrors and noticed this man running and dodging lights and ducking behind buildings. He walks in front of my car on the sidewalk as I park and just stand there. Staring at me. I immediately call 911 and he stays out and pulls out his phone before pretending to play on it. He realizes that I’m on my phone and says “I’m not going to do anything, I’m just on my phone come see” (mind you it was like 7/8 PM. I was so frozen with fear that Dispatch is asking me for his description and I hesitate before telling them “I’m putting my car in reverse and leaving”. As soon as I do this, the man runs off into a field behind the houses.   I can only imagine what this evil person was planning on doing. Caution and gut feelings will always save your life. The next day I went and bought my first gun and took concealed carry classes afterwards.   Also I have found that if you are unable to escape, a good method of deterrence is to act at least 10 levels crazier than the creep. This also has saved me in another incident. If you do not show fear or hesitation it will deter them. Most scrotes are looking for an easy target. Do not let it be east for them.	1640923809.0	hqn3adn	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqn3adn/
5f3urblc	Unfortunately too another point I’d like to add (unless I missed it) but never stay in your car for extended periods especially to text or to finish up a song. Men prey on this and watch for this because you become more vulnerable as you’re distracted and sitting in one place. It’s best to be in and out as fast and alert as possible.   I would have been too scared to get the food but good instinct to not go and roll down your windows. I would have ran the man over tbh	1640923903.0	hqn3hcy	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqn3hcy/
b13e8k0q	This was the right way to handle this situation! You did excellently, sis, and I'm very sorry he made you go through that when you were just minding your own business.  It's really disgusting that we as women have to have about 1000 things to worry about whenever we go out. Hell, just staying at home we have to worry about whether men will break in and/or violate our place and/or ourselves. Otherwise, we get victim blamed: why did you go to that place at night?? Why did you need that thing at that moment?? Why did you talk to him?? Why were you wearing that?? Etc. etc. etc.  But when we do all the things to avoid all the situations, suddenly we're "paranoid" or "over-dramatic" and made into these crazy people.  Men and women really do live in different worlds, but it's all 100% due to the mass actions of men.	1640928235.0	hqnbrgy	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqnbrgy/

10fuzrmb	Love there’s absolutely no reason to let anyone know how much money you’ve saved. It’s not going to just “come out”. You need to be discreet about your savings in order to protect them. Accounts like a Roth IRA are a great option because you’re not able to access that money until later in life and you don’t need to pay taxes on it until then. Standard bank accounts hardly give you interest, so if your money is in there I’d take the cash out and get a safe deposit box at a bank. Just say you have jewelry in it or something if he asks. That way you can keep your savings private. If you’re close with your parents and have a trustworthy relationship, you can add their name to your account and say that all of the money in the account isn’t yours and that you are sharing it. I agree with the comment above saying there’s a difference between honestly and transparency. I consider myself to be a mentally healthy and happy woman and I admit that I am not fully transparent with a single person in my life because there’s simply no reason for it. If a man is truly high value, he will not consider secret savings a dealbreaker if they ever come to his awareness. He will understand why you have them. A man that doesn’t plan on f*****g you over has no reason to be upset about such a thing. It’s noble of you to want to be honest to that degree, but it’s not a move in your best interest.	1640929679.0	hqneaz2	t3_rsl0l8	t3_rsl0l8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqneaz2/

So practically speaking, dating is high risk and low reward for you. There's tangible nothing to gain, and you also are mentally healthy enough that you aren't emotionally dependent on them.

If you’re in/near a city you can join University Clubs - lots of them don’t even require you be an alumni. Wine tastings, lecture series, fundraising committees, events etc.   My next thing I might do is join a racquetball club near me - it’s a bit of a scene/has a members lounge and at least I’ll learn a new sport.	1640930262.0	hqnfas1	t3_rsiyez	t1_hqn1av4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsiyez/anyone_else_experiencing_the_desperation_going_on/hqnfas1/

5cp1c9w0	Yes! 💯!!! I spent years with various LVM and was scared to be alone and cut off all contact with any. As soon as I did, I did have to do some grieving and I was alone, so I had to build my life and friends back up. But suddenly after a few months, I had energy! I had brain space at work and I was motivated and excited to learn new things (and learned things faster and easier), I needed less sleep, wasn’t constantly in a daze or headachy, I didn’t want to drink so much, i wanted to eat better and had energy to exercise, i felt light… and carefree and dare I say, happy! And things just started to feel easier.  I realised it’s because with the relationships, I was constantly worried and stressed in the back of my mind. Constantly confused due to being subtly and not so subtly pushed down by them.   It’s amazing how much free time you have when you get rid of all LV people in your life.	1640930500.0	hqnfpeq	t3_rrwdnj	t1_hqlc678	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdnj/levelling_up_man_free/hqnfpeq/

10fuzrmb	When I was practicing therapy, I had a client who had two children and an ex husband with a very serious drug problem. His brother was also an addict and died due to same drug he was abusing. He was just in a horrible, horrible place. This woman would still go with the kids to get cards and gifts for their father for holidays and special days and mail them to him when he was at treatment (that was the only time he’d have an accessible address). She would bake his favorite things with her children and send them to him because that’s what they wanted to do. She’d still call and FaceTime him so the kids could talk to him. Even though he’d forgot” and didn’t answer, she’d still do it. I ended up tearing up in one of our sessions *(note: my belief is that if the emotions you are showing promote a corrective, positive experience for your client, it’s okay to show them)* and told her I’ve never seen such selflessness and that the way her love for her children trumped all the BS was one of the most moving things I’ve ever seen in my life (which also made her cry lol).    It takes A LOT to do this. I love my mom, and she’s the best, but she couldn’t do this. She crapped on my dad every chance she got (and I don’t blame her) but when you hate a parent, you hate a part of yourself. And there is parts of myself I hate. I hope I’m never in the position where I need to this, because it requires otherworldly strength.	1640930692.0	hqng18m	t3_rsgt37	t3_rsgt37	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsgt37/date_men_who_think_like_this/hqng18m/

7yp276el	My brother-in-law actually volunteered to me that when their 4 kids were all babies he would deliberately pretend to be so sound asleep that he would never wake up to help feed or change them in the middle of the night.

f4fr272a	Having sex to avoid dangerous and painful retribution from the man is called rape.   Marital rape is perhaps the most pervasive form of rape, be it physically forceful or coercive, which is why it's often legal and has been legal until the 21st century in many first world countries. It almost never is reported or even acknowledged as rape, even though it is. Victims not calling it rape of course contributes in this.	1640933222.0	hqnk366	t3_rs4y2c	t1_hqmclyh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs4y2c/first_your_wife_had_a_baby_not_you_second_youre/hqnk366/

ai3mkngd	This is so 💯 true! I had an (ex)friend in highschool who is a pick me girl who bullied me. When I became top 1 in class, she gets jealous and turned me into an outcast. I was naive at that time, I should've noticed the red flags when she told me that she doesn't believe in female friendships and she only talks about boys. Social bullying is hard like any other bullying, what's worse is that most adults don't notice this kind of things because there is no physical evidence. She manipulated all the friends that I made at that time and sabotage all my group projects. She insults everything about me behind my back, you know what's even harder? My classmates who are bystanders who doesn't do anything to stop it. Most stereotypes revolve that only people who are timid only get bullied but that's not true. I'm aware of my capabilities, I'm above average in looks, personality, and intelligence in my class. Never thought in my life that my optimism shattered and I will have suicidal thoughts. Thank God, I'm rational and never acted on it.   That's why vetting even on friends is very important, they will affect you in some aspects of your life whether you are young or old. They can have positive or negative influence in your mental, spiritual, and physical health.	1640933414.0	hqnkdsv	t3_rs7vtt	t3_rs7vtt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqnkdsv/

2swlbfjo	One of my exes was absolutely helpless when it came to general health checkups because, for 18 years, his mom or aunts would schedule them all for him. After he turned 18 and was out of the house, he managed to date a number of women back-to-back who took on that responsibility. When him and I dated, he revealed that he had never once scheduled a single doctor’s or dentist’s visit in over 30 years! 💀 My biggest regret was not leaving at that major red flag. When I told him I refused to mother him and that he needed to learn to take care for himself, he sulked but said he would.  Guess who never visited the doctor or dentist despite having cause to visit both? Him. Guess who still sulked and wanted to be babied when he had constant stomach aches or toothaches or even loss of sensation in a hand for TWO DAYS? Him.

5v2tflaa	I didn’t like the video for women - since all of the traits were related to men somehow, as if everything is about how it will make your boyfriends feel.  And it felt less like a list to help women understand their flaws and become better, than it felt like a list a man made for women to do what he likes.  Things like “don’t be a drama queen” and “don’t try to take control” feels like a man saying “don’t talk too much and always smile”   And it wanted women to not care about their appearance but at the same time always look presentable for their man. That reeks of “I like women with no make up, you know, like Kendall Jenner”	1640936772.0	hqnp602	t3_rse7y6	t1_hqmq13m	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rse7y6/8_signs_of_a_low_value_man/hqnp602/
4lajsip1	This in general is what always bothered me about this show, even outside of the sex scenes. These women's entire lives were centered around dick and men. I never thought this show was avant garde in any way. They were all mostly completely neurotic over men.  As far as the sex scenes and media in general, unless it's what most would consider a steamy hot actress performing like you said, people don't want to see it.   It's Hollywood. Sex sells but only a certain type of sex that caters to men and mimics porn. I've noticed this crap since I was small. It needs to be top tier good looking women doing what men think they should be doing, or it doesn't make the big screen.   Kind of like how men don't care what opinion a female has in any setting at all, unless he thinks she is hot and wants to sleep with her.   The patriarchy (and all the machines that fuel it) is not just centered on men, but rather centered on their dicks and their sexual pleasure and their gaze.	1640936881.0	hqnpbdz	t3_rsnr2u	t3_rsnr2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsnr2u/whats_considered_good_or_bad_when_it_comes_to_sex/hqnpbdz/

He told her the dishes were "dirty" and serving food in them was "disgusting" but the woman told him it was "really no biggie" and she was getting over her "impossibly high cleanliness standards.  > She also shared another example in which she asked her boyfriend to refrigerate some leftovers from a meal served the night before. He failed to do so, with the dish left out overnight.

d0gwrccn	Not exactly bad job related but it was the period when I wasn’t in school (pre occupied by graduating) and haven’t started my job yet that I participated in my most toxic hook up phase and relations with men. This idle time was bad for me because of the notion/culture that young women SHOULD be dating and sleep around - so since I didn’t do that in college I took that time gap to do it, because I thought it was the “fun/liberating” thing to do... a mistake. Once I started working and found new hobbies I stopped this.   I see why so many men work as hard as the devil in trying to make women feel insecure and aren’t preoccupied with things that bring them joy. Because then we lower our standards and they get an easy in 😒 why would we search for joy in ourselves, our career, our hobbies and our community when we can get it from their backhanded validation /s	1640930413.0	hqnfk3m	t3_rsmsac	t3_rsmsac	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsmsac/was_wondering_if_any_fds_ladies_on_here_have_lost/hqnfk3m/

I have my own small business and I'll be able to live off of other streams of income, but it's still a bummer. Even if I found a man who wanted to pay for everything, they often pressure you to not work and not have your own finances, or just interrupt your work life constantly with their emotional bs.

I'm right there with you with this pandemic depression. It sucks big time. I've taken an optimist nihilistic approach on this; take joy in which enriches you, as long as it doesn't harm others. Add maximum value to your life, with or without a man. 2022 is your year. Seize it to the best of your ability and always work on being the best version of yourself as possible.	1640938999.0	hqns5k8	t3_rsojeo	t1_hqnpinj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsojeo/queens_what_are_your_plans_for_nye/hqns5k8/

7vgrv1od	Yep absolutely! After becoming financially stable and getting an amazing penthouse I see every date through a “risk” lens. I decline a lot more date offers and only go on dates that I know will have substantial benefit in some way - like giving me a new experience or a luxurious one. Because a) I will not abandon enjoying the incredible views in my home for some lowly scrote so they would need to be spoiling me for me to even date them and b) learned to enjoy my own company immensely and also take myself out to really nice and awesome places too and enjoy that experience way more than I ever did when I did that with toxic people. So I am not going to settle for any less when it comes to dating. Plus eating my favorite food or watching my fave kdrama or drinking champagne + enjoying penthouse views at home > going out with some scrote with a high risk of emotional distress tenfold.   I definitely wasn’t as secure as this years ago. I think many women experience this shift after becoming financially stable because they no longer require an escape from their circumstances. They create an amazing environment and life around them they have no wish to escape from, so it takes a high value man to even get them to think about taking on the risks involved in dating.	1640939192.0	hqnseiy	t3_rsmsac	t3_rsmsac	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsmsac/was_wondering_if_any_fds_ladies_on_here_have_lost/hqnseiy/

4ecrr915	As a gen Xer, I feel almost obligated to give this show a try. While there are moments of SATC-like satire, it's pretty cringey. Charlotte and Carrie are sooooo uptight and conservative. I couldn't stand Carrie's behavior following the sex scene. In general, she seems very needy which I get after losing her partner unexpectedly, but it's almost pathological her need not to be alone. Her friends just seem able to drop their lives for her and then she starts screeching at Miranda cuz of HER insecurities.   I digress. Personally, I found this sex scene hot. The chemistry was excellent and Sara/Che was and is 🔥. (I ignored Miranda and inserted myself.) I swerve hetero but good lawd. The light sheen of sweat on Che's forehead after their afternoon delite made me warm. I could not care less what any man might think of that scene. I give it four out four paws up.	1640940073.0	hqntjq6	t3_rsnr2u	t3_rsnr2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsnr2u/whats_considered_good_or_bad_when_it_comes_to_sex/hqntjq6/

86ugvp1g	I too was very attractive to narc-friends. They all were very similar- very very funny, and very very fun to hang out with. But, mean mean mean. Oddly, this didn’t extend to people I dated. I always went for the safe men. Lol, I needed some balance from the abuse. Looking back, my Mom had girlfriends who treated her like shit. She was such a sweet woman, I mean she literally would take the shirt off her back in a thunderstorm. And, those bitches took full advantage. As a child, I hated those women and could not figure out why my mom put up with it. Later, I discovered it was guilt. She was taught to value all relationships regardless of how she felt, and to forgive and forget;that her boundaries were selfish. She grew a spine out of nowhere and got rid of every last friend and did some leveling up. She also canned my Dad. She found like 2 solid friends that loved and admired her, as well as an awesome boyfriend. When she died, those mean bitches didn’t show their faces. Probably a good thing because I would have kicked them out…lol. So, I followed in my moms steps,leveled up, divorced my husband (he was LVM, but I wasn’t in love) and found a LVM that I’m crazy about. Today, I do not ignore red flags. If I get a feeling in my gut, I don’t question it bc my old body knows to run.	1640946522.0	hqo1i8x	t3_rs7vtt	t1_hql7k86	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqo1i8x/

yx4bq	The more and more it's obvious that there's absolutely no advantage for women (and big risks) in sending nudes. I don't care if it's a new relationship or a 2 decades long marriage. There's never any reason to send nudes. And we also need to be aware of being filmed or taken pictures of without our knowledge. Absolutely terrifying!	1640947240.0	hqo2dls	t3_rsr4b2	t3_rsr4b2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr4b2/is_your_boyfriend_part_of_the_secret_nude_trading/hqo2dls/

8r15jxb0	Oh I didn't know a lot of Dutch women are into foreign men. Anyway, I think the idea of meeting men who live abroad via OLD is a bad idea regardless of where you're from. It's really hard to vet a guy who doesn't live in the same country (or even continent) as you. And honestly the men who look for love abroad are probably extremely LV. Most people have zero interest in long distance relationships if they can find an SO locally. Those who look for an SO abroad via OLD do this for a reason. They either struggle to find women locally due to having extremely undesirable traits such as looking very unattractive or having a criminal record, want to sexually assault foreign women by luring them to visit them when they travel to their countries, want to marry for foreign citizenship, or plan to find women to scam.	1640947379.0	hqo2jpd	t3_rqmwig	t1_hqefm26	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rqmwig/frauds_on_datingsitesapps/hqo2jpd/

eo34pdbz	Simple shit test if their "you are my one true love blabla" is actually serious (which it never is):  Tell them that nothing whatsoever will happen (not even messaging, a date or a meeting) until they can present you with actual proof that their divorce is finalized and ties have been cut with their ex (so no "divorced but still living together" or anything) and to come back when they can show you that. Even if it takes a year or two. And if you are still available then, you will agree to a date.  If they truly love you as much as they pretend they do and are actually serious (which is absolutely never the case), they will move mountains to be able to be with you. They will initiate the divorce immediately and wait however long it takes. If he wanted to, he would. The problem is that they don't. They just want to cheat on their wives while keeping them around as cheap housekeepers and nannies.	1640949093.0	hqo4pbb	t3_rsr680	t3_rsr680	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo4pbb/

8r15jxb0	Yes. And going to a place you're not familiar with to visit some guy you've only talked to online is dangerous. He's familiar with the local surroundings when you're not. It's harder for you to flee if the chooses to sexually assault you. Things are even more complicated if the guy doesn't live in the same country as you. You're probably not familiar with the local law and unable to communicate fluently in the local language so even filing a police/legal complaint against him is tough if he sexually assaults you.	1640949466.0	hqo568w	t3_rqmwig	t1_hqo3elj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rqmwig/frauds_on_datingsitesapps/hqo568w/

8uuz5573	To add to the pictures without our knowledge thing: no matter how much you trust a guy, if you ever plan on being naked in his place, CHECK FOR CAMERAS. Check the bathroom, the toilet, the bedroom, and anywhere else that he seems to *really* be trying to get hot and heavy in.  Turn all the lights off, look for obvious camera lights. There are also apps you can install on yout phone that help you scan the wifi network for devices like IP cameras, if you have their wifi password. You can also use the camera on your phone aimed around the room to detect (infrared, or like night vision?) cameras. You'll see a weird looking light that you can only see on your phone screen, you can do this with the lights on or off.    Some of these men are absolute degenerates and literally get off on secret recordings. You never know what man has purposely chosen not to mention this to you.	1640949889.0	hqo5phq	t3_rsr4b2	t1_hqo2dls	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr4b2/is_your_boyfriend_part_of_the_secret_nude_trading/hqo5phq/
8r15jxb0	I have a question to ask. Can a guy who falls in love when they're still married (while their marriage is falling apart) ever be HV despite how they only start to pursue the other woman after the divorcement is finalised? At the end of the day, they're still leaving their SOs for someone they like more. If they truly hated their wives that much, why did they only decide to get divorced *after* a woman they liked more appeared in their lives?	1640949973.0	hqo5t9t	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo4pbb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo5t9t/

boazij7d	in my opinion, no. A HV person will be responsible and only start a new relationship after one has ended officially, and not leave any room for ambiguity (marital status). falling in love while still married blaming it on a "failing marriage" is just an excuse. his mental energy could be spent on fixing the marriage or finalizing the divorce instead of finding a new person	1640950452.0	hqo6f3y	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo6f3y/
9p6f6ftv	A kink: getting turned on by feet, or a glamorous woman littering, or food fights, or ballerinas being lifted, or clown make up.  If it involves degradation, pain, violence, humiliation, or any harm, it becomes impossible to practice those acts with love and respect, even if there is “consent”. Violent acts are not kinks, you just got trained to sexualize abuse.	1640950607.0	hqo6m3n	t3_rss00i	t3_rss00i	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rss00i/reminder_bdsm_is_more_than_a_kink_its_indicative/hqo6m3n/

eo34pdbz	I think it depends and life is complicated.   I could imagine very rare cases (actual abuse, their partner having developed heavy substance abuse, addiction or mental health issues during the marriage etc.) where I would accept it, depending on the timing and behaviour. I would absolutely leave a partner like that, even if we were married with kids and I won't judge someone for doing the same. If you are stuck in a situation like that and already feeling guilty for thinking about leaving your partner, no matter how terrible the situation is, and then meet someone new you just instantly feel a connection with and that gives you the final push to get out of there and save yourself because you see that there might be a happier future possible for you after all...  I would never condone cheating (even emotionally) or getting together with someone else while still married.	1640950991.0	hqo73yo	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo73yo/
8wa6gkov	Yeah it’s more like monkey branching, I knew of a guy who was separated from his wife for 15(!) years - don’t know how many girls he got with that ‘separation’ clause, he got his divorce finalized after meeting me- but I kind of lost my respect for him with the idea of only finalizing divorce when you get another person to hop on right away. A good example I saw ( but in a series, Good Girls Revolt), that the HVM hubby gets attracted to another girl, also the lifestyle he was leading was frustrating his wife, he does not say anything to that girl he is attracted to, but he goes to his wife and mentions he would like to get a divorce , it clearly shows he identified their marriage was not working for them anymore, he would like to close this chapter and only then bring forward a new commitment. It clearly showed how respectful he was to himself, his choices and also to the people who are and will be in his life.	1640951138.0	hqo7aqq	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo7aqq/

a19i2ivx	1. If she is the only one taking care of y'alls baby, cleaning, cooking, being the family secretary, etc... she is TOO TIRED TO FUCK. And that's if no complications in healing arose.  2. Let me fix his wording "my wife forced a melon through a hole that is typically the size of my urethra, but it's been 6 months and she STILL won't put my dick first!"  3. If you aren't willing to wait until she is healed and mentally ready (most births are EXTREMELY traumatic and can create a temporary or permanent fear of sex and getting knocked up again), don't get her pregnant. Selfish cow.  4. Your dick is NOT the most important thing in your life and relationship. The brand new tiny cute precious babu is the priority now, and will be at least until they grow up and move out.  5. Even if everything went perfectly, sex can be painful after childbirth because it can effect the vaginal feel. Even more so if the doctor pulled the "husband stitch" bullshit. It can take years or even life for stuff to get sorted out properly down there.  I had 2 c sections. The first time my husband was bitter because I couldn't have sex for 6 weeks. The second time he wasn't so harsh. But these goofy ass men need to realize RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC Z CHANGE KNCEA BABY IS INVOLVED.

8r15jxb0	Yeah I was wondering if men like the one in Good Girls Revolt are seen as HV. Yes, a lot of men fall I'm love with someone else when they are married as they are LV and horny, but I was wondering if it was possible that if could be that the marriage just didn't work out.	1640953111.0	hqo9yb7	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo7aqq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo9yb7/
8zttver0	Considering that I once found myself in this very situation, only I wasn't married and I was the one suddenly falling for someone else while still in that relationship: It really depends.  In my case, I was just realizing that my then BF was showing some red flags and abusive tendencies after the one year mark. It was less than a month after that realization - and me thinking about how to get out of this as well as possible - when I met someone else and had that terrible love-at-first-sight syndrome. (Didn't end well, either.) Which gave me ample motivation to end my relationship pretty much the very next time we met before pursuing the next one.	1640953268.0	hqoa6ep	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqoa6ep/

8zttver0	Well, it would probably come out really soon where you live. But you can always not tell your date that the house is actually yours. If need be, say "I pay xxx for it every month" - xxx should include your mortgage, monthly average of your taxes (and whatever else there is) and utilities. That should be close enough to normal rent that it's not even suspicious. If you pay less than it would be for rent, just say you're lucky you got a great deal or some such. If you pay more, just say that it came furnished, which costs extra. Or... don't say it directly, hint at it instead.  Anything else regarding your financial situation: "I'm doing okay." That can mean literally anything from "I live paycheck to paycheck with no savings" to "I'm actually a millionaire, but don't want to boast." After that non-statement, change the topic.	1640954355.0	hqobq7p	t3_rsl0l8	t1_hqn351n	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqobq7p/

86ugvp1g	No worries, it’s a good question. There are Quaker (private) schools all over the US, mostly east coast, and England, where Quakerism was founded. It is technically a religion, but there’s no authoritative literature (like a bible), hierarchy, or dogma. And, they operate on consensus, not majority. Not all Quakers will have the same philosophical thoughts or ideas, but they do all believe that our relationship with G-d is between you and G-d and not something that can be preached into you. They also believe that there’s is that of light and G-d inside all of us, and that we should seek it out, particularly with our enemies. Most Quakers are pacifists. Quaker Meeting for Worship (their services) are done in silence to encourage your individual relationship with G-d. If someone feels compelled to share their testimony, they stand up and share. Quakers do not proselytize, and that’s why you likely haven’t heard of them, but most social justice movements in the US were started by Quakers.	1640954533.0	hqobzow	t3_rs7vtt	t1_hqo5tok	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqobzow/

I was at his house a few times, and he had security camera in his living room. I spotted it the first time and asked him to turn it away from the couch we were sitting. He had no problem with that. We had sex in his living room a few times, tv was on, camera was turned away. Last time I was over, I forgot about it until afterwards, and I saw camera wasn’t turned away. I still get paranoid thinking about it. I try to convince myself that he wouldn’t keep/share it because it ended up he was actually engaged with someone else at the time and he wouldn’t want his fiancé to catch him cheating.	1640954963.0	hqocn2v	t3_rsr4b2	t1_hqo5phq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr4b2/is_your_boyfriend_part_of_the_secret_nude_trading/hqocn2v/

You should immediately contact the police and make screenshots of it, to save these proofs.

7osmnunj	This might be controversial but i actually think most women eventually reach this headspace. The only difference between you and them is that you figured it out early while it takes most of us an entire lifetime. Because of social conditioning it seems like most women don't snap out of it until they're like 50+. I'm in my late 20s and I'm struggling with letting go (of limerence). But I've come to learn that happiness is a fleeting emotion, (and if men are involved you have to sacrifice a lot just to get small scraps of it) so it's not really worth it once you discover a much more appealing sensation: peace. I'm not quite where you are at mentally (I am in a relationship and trying to sort out my feelings about commitment) but I feel a slow pull in that direction. I admire women who are ahead of me on that path because I really think it's liberating and inspiring for women as a collective. ❤️	1640957485.0	hqogsa7	t3_rsmsac	t3_rsmsac	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsmsac/was_wondering_if_any_fds_ladies_on_here_have_lost/hqogsa7/

9f513x5h	It is not love if you don't get to know the other person on a deep level. It is just lust and maybe familiarity. But why would a person who is married allow themselves to become familiar with someone who isn't their spouse? If the other person is a friend, you basically have shifted your mindset to see them as a friend, like the way a sibling is a "friend". If they see you as a potential date, they are already looking outside their marriage to fulfill something that they think their marriage is lacking, and because they don't know you that well, they are just chasing figments. In the end, if they get together with you after having made you the cause of their marriage breaking down (by saying that they fell in love with you) it is likely that they will become equally as dissatisfied with you and look elsewhere. Usually the issue is not the person they are with, the issue is they are deeply dissatisfied with themselves and are looking for external validation.  There are very rare cases, I am sure, where a marriage breaks down without animosity and the man leaves the wife for a woman that he spends the rest of his life with and the second marriage is happy. But this depends on circumstances. Some people marry very young and have children but are unable to grow together, instead they grow apart and stay together for the children... and then while they are doing this (with the best intentions) they meet someone else. It's possible.  Being married is a state of being. When you uncouple, it takes a year or two for your mindset to change. You take time to rediscover yourself outside of the marriage. So anyone that is still in a marriage or fresh out of a marriage comes with the baggage of the ex or soon-to-be ex. If you get into a relationship with someone like this, you are also getting into a relationship with the ex.  That's my opinion anyway.

5cp1c9w0	You’re 100% right. I’ve mentioned a few times about my exes best friend constantly abusing his gf saying nobody else would want her as a single mother in her 30s. He’s terribly abusive to her psychologically and emotionally - talks to her like she is absolute dirt, as well as her child. And will then post on social media about how much he loves her. Sh runs to my ex (her partners best mate) for solace, but she doesn’t realise he’s just as bad - he just plays the part to get extra information that he feeds back to his mate. Even my ex talked about how he wanted to smash her in the face because of her music choices. And that she brings the abuse from his mate on herself because she’s “crazy” when she’s drunk.  I feel so bad. She has been mentally, emotionally and even now physically beaten down so much, with some occasions pops of what seems like love from him (intermittent reinforcement)… but he’s constantly hitting on other women, then gaslights her that he has to delete everything because she snoops and if she didn’t snoop then he wouldn’t need to delete everything…  I wish I could’ve told her she’s smart, and he IS a liar and a cheat, and there’s a reason she snoops -  because her gut knows. But she wouldn’t listen. She’s too downtrodden and invested and just hangs off everyone word that the group of guys say to her.  It’s really disgusting and honestly I do worry that she will end up dead also.	1640958066.0	hqohtfg	t3_rr5d5d	t1_hqf2jjt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rr5d5d/turkish_woman_marries_boyfriend_who_threw_acid_in/hqohtfg/

9f513x5h	Yeah the terrible love-at-first-sight syndrome. It's like a Trojan horse. When people go on first or second dates and insist to know if there's chemistry, I don't understand. You need to know a person more than 1 or 2 dates to get that. If it's love-at-first-sight, it could be your body reacting to danger signals and you mistaking the nervous discomfort for "falling in love".  I think love should be like a gentle afternoon rain, not a lightening storm.	1640958166.0	hqoi00i	t3_rsr680	t1_hqoa6ep	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqoi00i/

If I'm talking to a man I can usually tell when he checks if he doesn't outright say that he did. It's wild. Irl, I have an extremely feminine name (which as a tomboy I loathed, but as an adult tomboy I've embraced... people who know my name before I meet them (say a work function) are always kind of like "oh, okay..." or outright say "I expected you to look different" ...simply because of my name... lol) I'm glad this guy saw the light and is hopefully working on himself to change his way of thinking, as well as spread this newfound information to his friends and family!	1640958501.0	hqoilrj	t3_rssu7e	t3_rssu7e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rssu7e/selfaware_guy_realizes_he_doesnt_take_debate/hqoilrj/

But even then, it’s not foolproof because unfortunately these daytime attacks happen also and it’s literally the kind of situation where she has to leave her entire life behind to get away.

5q9e9eii	OMGOSH THANK YOU FOR THIS! I've been waiting to talk about this season finale with someone who shares the same opinion. I am so shocked by everyone is happy that Lawrence and Issa are back together. They've been toxic from the beginning. I agree with all your sentiments. I really would've loved to see how Issa could have found love within herself and kept scaling her business. You don't always NEED a man. It's okay just being a woman in the world. That is enough.   I went back and forth with someone over how Lawrence is trash and it just appalls me how no one is seeing the signs. He's done nothing to even earn Issa's love all season. All they have done is play phone tag and at the end settle for one another saying "If you believe it will work, it will work". I'm tired. I'm tired of these messages being shown to black women about trusting in struggle love. Love isn't that hard.   Hell, Nate isn't all that either but at least he is self aware, supported Issa in her business ventures, and tried to open up to the possibility of healthy relationship but could see she was still stuck over Lawrence. I'm glad he got away from Issa and her toxic web.   Kelli is the star of the show. She really does need her own spinoff. I'd be hilarious and she'd be giving us that REALNESS.	1640959351.0	hqok7pa	t3_rrdgzf	t3_rrdgzf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrdgzf/insecure_has_a_lot_of_examples_of_lvm_hvm_and_the/hqok7pa/

h57msag5	Did he also flip his shit whenever you took an interest in something he was interested in 'first'?  Both my Avoidant exes would get extremely defensive in these situations. One would be rather aggressive about it ("Stop copying me! Stop trying to be me!") and the other more on-guard ("You don't have to like everything I like, you know?").  They'd compartmentalise 'me' and 'them' as two completely separate entities. Any perceived 'fusion', however small, was cause for alarm.  Ordering the same food? ALARM. Using the same catchphrase? ALARM. Picking up a solo hobby they also enjoy doing solo? ALARM.  As if I'm plotting to absorb them, fuse with them, *become them* because I also got the Pepperoni Special. Their sense of self seems rigid and they're overly protective of it. They also seemed to look down on me in a way, as if *I* had no sense of self because I wasn't as rigidly defined by arbitrary interests as them.

It helps to make it known that you don't have financial problems, but that's easy; you just don't mention the problems and carry yourself with confidence and the knowledge that you have options and financial security.

We would go out and all he’d do is have his arms around me the whole night as if he was mate guarding. One time he followed me to the bathroom in a club just to wait outside for me because he was so insecure.

When you do begin driving, also be very very careful about honking and other signifiers of aggressive driving. I never honk at people except very lightly in extreme cases (ex. drifting into my lane or backing out into me, etc.) because of the amount of road rage incidents in the US. You always have to let it go and just be cautious that most men can become aggressive out of the blue.

b2js99lw	I agree strongly with all of this!! OP, I think you’ve spent enough time being financially abused that your conceptual norms have been screwed with. At least in the US, which I’m guessing you are, it would be SO bizarre for someone you were just getting to know to pry into really anything about your finances. “I own my home” can mean anything from living paycheck to paycheck with the mortgage, to having it completely paid off. Being financially stable is a badass accomplishment… but also not anyone’s business but yours.  Anyone you might date has absolutely no business knowing about your savings or financial setup overall until you were perhaps discussing getting engaged, I’d say. There’s so much vetting you would do along the way, and if someone starts to try to pry into your private information, that’s a flag.  Even if I’m bragging a little with close long-term friends, I’m only going to say things like “yeah, my retirement savings are on track, that’s pretty cool” or “I’m paying some extra principal on my mortgage, happy about that”.	1640960290.0	hqom1fx	t3_rsl0l8	t1_hqn4hdk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqom1fx/

6jsf3nlr	Happy NYE everyone! 🥳  I don't really celebrate NYE myself. But I went to the gym and for a walk earlier. After that, I studied a bit and now I'll probably spend the rest of the evening studying for a couple of hours more, then maybe eventually reading for a while and watching some Netflix, because it's fine to chill a bit too! ☺	1640960388.0	hqom8gq	t3_rsojeo	t3_rsojeo	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsojeo/queens_what_are_your_plans_for_nye/hqom8gq/

It got her into a lot of shows and helped get her established enough so that she could reveal that she's a woman. Sometimes you gotta manipulate the patriarchy to get that bag.	1640960389.0	hqom8jj	t3_rssu7e	t3_rssu7e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rssu7e/selfaware_guy_realizes_he_doesnt_take_debate/hqom8jj/
5i3py9km	Absolutely! My career and my hobbies are so fulfilling and rewarding that I feel absolutely NO desire to date, and potentially upset what I’ve got going on right now 🤷🏼‍♀️	1640960598.0	hqomnjb	t3_rsmsac	t3_rsmsac	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsmsac/was_wondering_if_any_fds_ladies_on_here_have_lost/hqomnjb/
