The officers were suspended and under investigation the next day.  They were charged and taken to court.  I think Chauvin was overcharged and the jury intimidation was grotesque but the riots for it made no sense.

But additionally it doesn't address his argument that he actually made, which is that the vaccine confers lower immunity than immunity from natural infection. Because the jury is still out on whether or not the spike protein antibodies are hindering the bodies ability to make a more diverse range of antibodies based on other features of the virus, leaving them. Meaning the vaccine takes you to a peak of protection, but it takes you to the peak of a mountain shorter than the mountain next to it, which is reached through natural infection.	1640869799.0	hqjixy5	t3_rrlhox	t1_hqiqkqp	/r/Conservative/comments/rrlhox/twitter_suspends_mrna_pioneer_dr_robert_malone/hqjixy5/

xewsdn5	💯  I had a fever from 12/15 thru Christmas Day and no amount of rest, Tylenol, aspirin etc did anything to subside it. Finally on the 25th I went to the ER because I wasn’t getting my better.  I was advised I had covid and pneumonia and was given a 5-day prescription for a Z-pack. I specifically asked for the antibodies as well as as steroids. I was told the antibodies are no longer available as they are no longer prescribing these for covid cases and steroids only if I am admitted to the hospital.  12/26 I wake up and O2 dropped around 86/88 and I went back to the ER immediately. Finally given a steroid shot and a steroid prescription. Chest CT confirmed pneumonia from the diagnostic X-ray from the day before and no clots. A few hours after the steroid shot my o2 was back up in the mid-90s on its own and I was released to go back home and continue handling it on my own.  No I’m not vaccinated and relatively eating healthy and physically fit in my early 40s.  No longer have a fever and I feel 100x better minus the pneumonia still kicks my ass here and there with being easily short-breathed but it’s scary knowing I may not have seen my kids grow up because the antibodies weren’t “available” even when asked for them.  Instead of being pro-active it’s like they want to wait and be re-active to anything when it’s potentially too late.  And yes, I’ve already had the lovely convo with some liberal family members saying being pro-active is getting the the shot 🙄 and wanting to know if I’m going to be getting it in 30 days	1640870020.0	hqjjbfj	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqjghkv	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqjjbfj/

They told us it was jus about letting people marry, and they called us crazy for correctly predicting where it was going to lead. The deterioration of society is exactly what they want so they can be degenerates without shame.   The scary question is what comes next. After they normalize pedophilia and make it commonplace to call us bigots for not tolerating it, where do they move on to?	1640870686.0	hqjkh2r	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqidcnb	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqjkh2r/

57bfkjzq	That’s wrong on so many levels.  First, it *is* being taught in undergraduate and graduate schools outside of law schools.  There are literally *hundreds* of CRT-specific courses being taught at universities across the country.  Open up a course catalog for any major college and you will find *at least* one.   Second, the theory itself isn’t being taught in secondary schools (as far as anyone can discern…yet). But there are many school districts across the country that are teaching courses *based* on CRT.   One example:  https://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/yes-virginia-there-is-critical-race-theory-in-our-schools/article_ba449c18-cf99-11eb-a719-4bfc9103236c.html  They have introduced  “anti-racism and culturally responsible” curricula at many public schools.  “Anti-racism and culturally responsible” courses are derived from CRT principles.    So, they *are* teaching CRT.  You can call it anything else you want.  But you can’t say that it *isn’t* CRT.   They may not be teaching the literary and legal principles of the basic theory.  But then, they don’t teach 5th-graders the technical principles of orbital mechanics either when they’re learning that the earth revolves around the sun.  It’s still orbital mechanics; just a simplified version of it for children to learn.   Saying *“hurr-durr, they’re not teachin CRT”* is either incredibly dumb, naive, or cynical.   It is also factually and objectively incorrect.    You, sir, are a troll.	1640870756.0	hqjklht	t3_rrt4sb	t1_hqjerzy	/r/Conservative/comments/rrt4sb/desantis_critical_race_theory_is_crap_vows_to/hqjklht/

Something like 1 vaccinated person is dying for every 14 unvaccinated.  The POTUS has only 2 real things he could do to lower the number of deaths: mandate that folks take the vaccine or start lockdown procedures again.   Also...  [It's actually only 74% that have 1 dose and 63% that are fully vaccinated.](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/)      >Biden said he would shut down the virus just one week before he was elected.   Yeah, and he's an idiot.  That wasn't going to happen and folks should have realized it.  All presidents make promises that they can't keep.  We were promised an end to the virus (Biden). We were promised we wouldn't pay for a wall (Trump).  We were promised that we would keep our existing coverage (Obama).

46xf018r	Can I write, AND SUBMIT, an essay to ASU describing why I think both these "Hateful And Visceral Women Should Be Banned From School Campus Property For Life And How Both Oppressed White Male Students Should Be Allowed/Able To Sue For The Entire Lifetime Worth Of Both Women"...? Yeah that's my essay title.  The main instigator, Hateful And Visceral Woman With Dreads, wasn't even a student but a volunteer at ASU Multicultural Center she can and should be barred from all campus property FOR LIFE.  The other woman is/was a student and needs to be cancelled herself, dropped as a student, and also barred from all ASU campuses for life.  ASU....for their part...needs to make this story and it's "what should really happen" endings as public as they possibly can. Special comment on their own website, front page article on campus (all -- student and staff) newspapers, invite community newspapers to interview university leaders about what happened and how it was resolved, plus submit editorials to all national newspapers and news outlets giving as full of a detailed account as possible on the incident and resulting punishments.   Since the verbal attack happened on campus and inside a university sponsored student center neither woman can cry "I have a right of privacy" to stop it all from going public again. After all, it was the women that released the initial video...thinking about the online praise they would receive for the actions they took as "oppressed and scared" women of color against the police loving, white supremacist, male students they (verbally) assaulted.  Until these types of VISCOUS attacks, verbal and/or physical, end in greatly publicized and high-end punishments they will keep showing up on Twitter and YouTube.	1640871362.0	hqjlovs	t3_rs1469	t3_rs1469	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1469/angry_women_who_harassed_male_students_at_asu/hqjlovs/

What it actually is is in practice is K12 schools teaching bullshit like:  - In Cupertino, California, an elementary school forced third-graders to [deconstruct](https://www.city-journal.org/identity-politics-in-cupertino-california-elementary-school) their racial and sexual identities, then rank themselves according to their “[power and privilege](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20447929-social-identity-slidedeck)”. - In Springfield, Missouri, a middle school forced teachers in a [diversity training session](https://christopherrufo.com/antiracism-comes-to-the-heartland/) to locate themselves on an “[oppression matrix](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20459636-oppression-matrix).” The trainers told straight, white, English-speaking, Christian males that they are members of the oppressor class and handouts warned of “[covert white supremacy](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20459690-white-supremacy-handout)”. - In New York City, a public school principal [sent parents](https://nypost.com/2021/02/16/nyc-public-school-asks-parents-to-reflect-on-their-whiteness/) literature including “[tools for action](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20803056-east-side-school)” and touting “white traitors” and advocating for full “white abolition.” - In Portland, Oregon, students are not only subjected to a critical race theory curriculum, but also trained to develop their so-called [white identity](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20784918-portland-area-public-schools) and are taught about racial justice in the terms of “revolution and/or resistance.”  - In the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, they published (and then retracted after pushback) guidelines for talking about race entitled "[Aspects and Assumptions of Whiteness in the United States](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1610610/smithsonian-aspects-white-culture.webp?w=450&f=2af39218175efa379af3434273711858)," which declared that, "individualism”, “objective, rational, linear thinking," "quantitative emphasis," "hard work before play," and other values are aspects and assumptions of whiteness.	1640872273.0	hqjnf24	t3_rrt4sb	t1_hqiuui9	/r/Conservative/comments/rrt4sb/desantis_critical_race_theory_is_crap_vows_to/hqjnf24/

46xf018r	Kind of.  500 million won't be enough. Look at all those that aren't vaccinated and will need weekly testing  And the whole federal mandate thing is starting to fall apart. Except with the military, departments within the federal government, and all those major corporations that believe the federal government is Lord, God, and King...like airlines, major league sports, and transportation companies.  Given the quick rollout of the three vaccines with the serious expectations that they would be full effective was kinda dumb. Which leads to the question "Why wasn't additional research into better vaccines continues so better stuff could be more effective?" And that could have been asked before it was found out people still got sick and were contagious even after being "fully vaccinated and boosted." That was under Biden's watch.  Biden's campaign, after being the nominee, was conducted from the Biden basement..I'm sorry, I mean the Biden Command Center. He mouthed only what he was told to say. Any idiot with OPEN eyes would have seen that much of what Trump did had a positive effect on the US and the American population. Biden, Harris, Schumer, Pelosi, AOC, and so many others with a D after their name cursed  the three vaccines that came out of Operation Warp Speed. The all said how bad it was and "I'm not going to take it" every time they had a microphone in front of them.  But who televised it when they got their first, and second, shots? Just look above for a list of names.  You're right, in a generalized way.

Is it that they have a mental health condition or do not understand that more cops mean less crime? The fact is, if a police officer is standing at the front door of the bank, I am not apt to want to rob it and get shot while doing so. Knowing this, then why are there now dozens of these cities cutting their police forces and putting the law-abiding citizens at risk of being robbed, raped, and worse?"   this sums it up perfectly.

Let's say a state rep needs 51.5% to win, so blue state votes like this   51% blue 49% red Blue doesn't have enough votes for a clear victory so we have backup votes on the same ballot if your first choice doesn't win vote here for your second choice (generally 3rd party)  68% moderate popular 3rd party people were afraid to throw votes away on wins.   Or something like this, I believe having multiple parties from each state would benefit the people so much more and would bring new meaning to the word bipartisan.

I didn't say trust the media. I was trying to say trust the scientific process. While delta was prevalent it was demonstrably more damaging to non-vaccinated folks and was so pathogenic it literally overloaded  the US healthcare "system" to point that patients were being denied care. With omicron there are still a lot of unknowns and data is still being gathered and evaluated. Preliminary reports suggest much more virulence but less pathogenicity, which hopefully means less hospitalizations. Point is that we're constantly gathering and evaluating data and things change because of that. That's science and it's been correct the whole time.	1640873515.0	hqjpw11	t3_rrgk49	t1_hqil1nm	/r/Conservative/comments/rrgk49/dr_fauci_says_fourth_covid_vaccine_shot/hqjpw11/

6z9vr07t	You said that Biden isn’t a bad person. When drunk driving became a political focus, Biden falsely and publicly accused the truck driver involved in the accident that killed his first wife and daughter of being drunk. The driver was not, but he had no public forum to fight back. (Biden’s wife ran a stop sign. She had an infant and two toddlers in the car. Her mistake was understandable, although tragic.)   Mental fitness should not be judged by age, but by the individual. I have had relatives who were mentally fit in their nineties. Others started declining at a younger age. Unfortunately, we have a media that only questions mental fitness if the politician is conservative.	1640873915.0	hqjqpce	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqj9igo	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqjqpce/

You can try to shield them all you want but the minute they have access to the internet, the whole world is at their fingertips. Children that are sheltered their whole life typically end up being the ones who lash out, at least in my life experiences. I wouldn’t bring my kid to this kind of parade, but that’s just my opinion. I won’t judge others who do. 3. I agree with you here. This is a major problem that extends way beyond a this parade, though. Literally everything is all about sex everywhere.

3g3gi	>Hospitalizations for Covid after omicron are down despite virus transmission going up. Why? Because people are vaccinated.    This makes no sense. Hospitalization rates for everyone are low, vaxxed or not. In the UK 25% of hospital admittees with COVID are unvaxxed. 30% of the population is unvaxxed, which means they represent a smaller proportion of the hopsital population than the vaxxed.     Omicron is the natural evolution of covid, and it has nothing to do with vaccination or not. In fact, we've been repeatedly told for 2 years that mutations are more likely to happen in an unvaxxed person. But *mutations are usually good*. So likely some unvaxxed person out there handed us the best vaccine there is, a soft-hitting auto-vaccinating machine.    And besides, more people aren't getting vaxxed under Biden. The number is frozen solid. Hell, nearly every person I know that's refusing to get it is doing so because Biden/Dems have attempted to *force* them.	1640874813.0	hqjslib	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqjhk1p	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqjslib/

There are some people still dying that are vaccinated which is really sad.  At this point though with all of the resources to dramatically increase your survivability rate I have very little sympathy for those dying.  It is a personal choice and that comes with some personal responsibility for your actions.    I think both Trump did a good job to help develop a resource that has saved hundreds of thousands-millions of lives and also it isn't on Biden that people aren't deciding to get a vaccine.	1640874852.0	hqjsojn	t3_rrrhih	t3_rrrhih	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqjsojn/

Not sure if people are deleting them or what, but to the individual who said that a "virus is a disease", no, it is not. For example, the FLU is a virus, an infectious agent that exists outside the human body, and when you contract this virus, you do not get a "disease" called the FLU. CoronaVIRUS is also a virus, of the same family as the flu, and when you get it, you do not have a "disease". A virus can (sometimes) lead to an actual disease, but the virus itself is not a disease.

Let's finally call it what it is - racism - and start doing the work to exterminate it from society.	1640875085.0	hqjt6g9	t3_rs1469	t1_hqjovdj	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1469/angry_women_who_harassed_male_students_at_asu/hqjt6g9/

Kids were never really supposed to go to pride, but now they are so we have to have a conversation about how to separate the kinky folks from the kids. Because it is obvious that the two should not mix. However, there should be a place for kink in pride because people used to be jailed for sexual immorality. They have a right to be proud of who they are.      Plus, pride is not the most safe environment for children, a lot of the time cops harass pride goers. The mayor this year even asked the NYPD to not show up to pride because they have a history of harassing pride goers (all the way from Stone Wall).	1640875599.0	hqjua9e	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqiq3sd	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqjua9e/

This may seem callous or uncouth, but I wouldn't shed a tear if Clinton got COVID, Ebola or anything in-between and died a horrible and very painful death.    Her contributions, like Biden's, are all about self-empowerment and ensuring her own legacy over that of the people she claimed to champion.  People like Clinton exemplify why I despise career politicians and especially the hypocritical ones on the left.  They are cold hearted, more callous than I, and would burry the down-trodden for a buck or glass of champagne.  Trump was a breath of fresh air despite his unpolished nature.

11idjg	Gender is not at question here. Covid antibody and gender science is certainly an apples and oranges comparison, with a mix of personal opinion..which I think is what you’re trying to get out of me.   So since you’re asking, I’ll give you my opinion only. I believe gender definition has changed a lot over the recent years. When the general public heard “gender” 5-10 years ago they likely thought male or female…gender definition and thought process is certainly more advanced now. I am of the belief that there is simply only male and female sexes. One can consider themselves non-binary, transgender, etc but you cannot simply rewrite someone’s genetic sequence.	1640875770.0	hqjunq4	t3_rrmoud	t1_hqjlwxw	/r/Conservative/comments/rrmoud/aaron_rodgers_science_that_cant_be_questioned_is/hqjunq4/

gb3j7avt	You can't say that kids are likely going through a phase based on nothing. People that detransition in their lives are a minority within the trans community and it's most often motivated by dysphoria persisting and a desire to escape transphobia.   I'm not sure what you're referring to by "men that are trans assaulting people in bathrooms" but it is by no means a common occurrence and you can found countless more examples of cis men assaulting women in bathrooms. There would also be a lot more trans women being assaulted by men in bathrooms if they were forced to use them. I thought we all realized that this narrative was pure hysteria and that bathroom policing led to nothing positive. Even gender nonconforming cis people were starting to be targeted for trying to use bathrooms in public.	1640876981.0	hqjxcnh	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqjwgyb	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqjxcnh/

oxlku5w	Some people just know when to run with an idea.   I have a brother in law who, back when the "storm area 51" meme started, created an online clothes/decal store with different area 51 memes on them. Other people made the memes, he just took them and put them on clothes and decals. He no shit made close to $130k in like two months, which he then invested into a real business that he never would have been able to do beforehand.   I just don't have that kind of mentality in me. In my mind, I think "what moron would actually buy this shit" because *I* would not buy this stuff.   But it doesn't matter what I think. What matters is what you think other people would be silly enough to buy. That's the difference between me and a meme entrepreneur lol.	1640877305.0	hqjy32o	t3_rs12u3	t1_hqjkgva	/r/Conservative/comments/rs12u3/lets_go_brandon_store_chain_to_expand_in_new/hqjy32o/

15u0lp	Oh jeez.  "Science" as folks frequently phrase it, isnt some shadowy process meant to deceive you. Just because you can't see every scientific development process doesn't mean its inherently deceptive or malicious.   To speak on Science as a whole, as if all science is "X" is silly. But I will mention this.  There are facts in the world, and many researchers spend much of their lives specializing to discover these facts. Many times, the researchers who discover these facts *dont also follow up with recommendations*. They save that for the policy makers. Most research papers you'll see generally stick to proving an observation, whether that be climate change, vaccines or covid, there are verifiably true facts that these excellent and talented folks present.  The issue you have isnt, or shouldnt be with what facts they discover, because thems the facts, but what the policy makers *do with those facts*. To entangle the policy holder's actions with the scientific research process is a dangerous practice.   Now to be fair, often times policy makers will take scientific research and speak as if it unequivocally supports or was made to support their positon. That is malicious. Good scientific research is impartial, it presents and proves an observation.   I listen to Shapiro a lot, and I hear him constantly speak on "THE SCIENCEEEE" as if the scientific research process itself is the issue. No, its not. Aa well you aren't an expert and have very little to refute the conclusions of the researchers. Your issue is with what the policy makers *want to do with* the research. Don't conflate the two.   If you want to refute a scientific observation, conduct  research of your own and present it for peer review like any one else. Saying "nuh uh" like a toddler does when told to eat his broccoli since its good for him is along the same vein as this blanket "Science" skepticism.	1640877456.0	hqjyfjd	t3_rrmoud	t3_rrmoud	/r/Conservative/comments/rrmoud/aaron_rodgers_science_that_cant_be_questioned_is/hqjyfjd/

57bfkjzq	No, we do not partially agree.    In fact, we do not agree at all.  Simply changing the name of what is being taught does not change the substance - and intended purpose - of the subject.   Critical Race Theory *is* being taught in many schools.  Simply calling it something else doesn’t change this fact.   If it makes you feel any better, you can more accurately state that “Exclusionary Racism is being taught using core CRT principles.”  That statement is entirely accurate.  But, its length somewhat compromises its forensic value (the very reason leftists seek to disconnect its use), and moreover leaves it to further leavening by CRT advocates to deny its curricula insertion.   Therefore, the statement can be accurately short-handed as: “they are teaching CRT in schools,” which is correct and  verbally nimble enough within the context of the debate.  Leftists don’t get to unilaterally change language for the express purpose of *avoiding* debate when important discussions need to occur.   Or rather, they *can*.    But people who oppose naked racism will continue with the debate anyway, irrespective of CRT advocates and their education partners’ desires.	1640877895.0	hqjzg6h	t3_rrt4sb	t1_hqjpjrw	/r/Conservative/comments/rrt4sb/desantis_critical_race_theory_is_crap_vows_to/hqjzg6h/

Even with the media covering for him Biden is as unpopular as ever. Makes zero sense to put this on Trump just because he wasn't perfect. Imagine if the mainstream media showed images like [this](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/18/4C48A47400000578-5732423-image-a-11_1526405133642.jpg) and [this](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/18/4C48930D00000578-5732423-image-a-1_1526404485936.jpg) instead of ignoring them to spin false narratives. Imagine if they covered Trump honestly - public opinion would be way different. The fact is people got fooled by the Dems and their media - they just will never be able to admit it to themselves. All the fake anonymous sources and statements taken out of context - that's Trump's fault you see.	1640879548.0	hqk3ekk	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqjouol	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqk3ekk/

2jr8lnr	The article does say you have 95% peak if vaccinated and 38 if unvaccinated for load. I just Googled that quick and posted the first link. I don't even use Facebook nor do I get my news from it. I watch unbiased YouTube videos for the most part. And omicron will be what ends this pandemic and it is the best thing that could have happened. It has literally one death associated with it in the entire United States. It would be good if it spread like wildfire and it is now the dominant strain 59% and climbing. Natural immunity may have been shit for all the people that died obviously, when you're old or  healthy that's what fucking happens same with the flu literally any other life threatening illness, not just covid. Natural immunity you get from omicron will be just fine even for almost all older people and it will stop covid from spreading as fast afterward and no one will really be affected by it once they've had omicron. I don't see how they can say the vaccines are better than natural immunity for younger people in the long run. The vaccines are only effective for a short amount of time unless you keep getting boosters and modified variants, natural immunity lasts for forever.	1640879819.0	hqk4229	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqk24q0	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqk4229/

16yer3	"There is no federal solution, this gets solved at state level ... and that ultimately gets down to where the rubber meets the road, and that's where the patient is in need of help — or preventing the need for help," Biden said in the beginning of his remarks.  He added, "My message to the governors is simple: If you need something, say something. We're going to have your back in any way we can."  How is this not him standing back now and letting the governors do their thing? This is a good thing. What you’re talking about is what happened before, and not a part of this speech where he “admit his policies failed”. I’m surprised this sub isn’t absolutely cheering that Biden actually stated such a big reversal like this (of course, follow-through will be the next big issue but that’s typical of all politicians and at least this is a huge difference from before)	1640879862.0	hqk45t3	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqk1vqo	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqk45t3/

And removed travellers from airports and brought them to "quarantine hotels" for two weeks instead of allowing them to quarantine at home, then made them pay for 2 weeks stay at the hotel while police and private security patrolled the hotels and barricaded them from the public with barbed wire fences.

4deig	More than 1.  And the death of any child is a tragedy.  Also the kids spread it to their parents and grandparents who are more likely to suffer severe and sometimes fatal illness.  The need to take something seriously shouldn't be some binary "dead or alive" scenario.  My mother, a Frontline hospital worker of more than 30 years, had Covid for 3 months in mid 2020.  The worst part, she couldn't work in the hospital to save others lives.  So yeah, my mother lived thank God, but when she and other people cannot be at work to save other people's lives, there are consequences.  When a wave of sick people overwhelms doctors, even if none of those people die, everyone's suffering from a lower quality of care, which yes, can make people without covid suffer and die too.	1640880682.0	hqk66ng	t3_rs2a6g	t1_hqk56be	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2a6g/teachers_school_permanently_cancelled_after_wolf/hqk66ng/

For instance, she has stated that policies that allow trans women into women's bathrooms will increase sexual assaults on women. The leftist bigots twisted that into saying she was calling all trans women rapists, which wasn't what she said at all.  Try reading her actual words. Or if you had any intellectual honesty read her essay she put out in response to those misrepresenting her arguments.  Also, note the left has long held that gender and sex are different.

They flamed me because I said F that….your medical history is nobody’s business but yours…..we built laws around insuring people with AIDS could hide their status…..I’ve completely complied, I went in lockdown except for work where I’m essential, I wore a mask, I have been vaccinated 3 times with a vaccine that neither prevents me from getting covid, or spreading covid which in my mind makes it the worst vaccine in the history of vaccines. So if you think I’m going to tell you of a potentially false positive covid test that would significantly set me back from life goals, you can go to hell.	1640881064.0	hqk74n1	t3_rrjv1z	t3_rrjv1z	/r/Conservative/comments/rrjv1z/i_cant_deal_with_this_covid_sht_anymore_french/hqk74n1/
6aqceniz	Omicron has been proven to circumvent the Pfizer vaccine. That is a huge issue, as all variants are. These variants are precisely why getting vaxed but also continuing other protocol such as masking and distancing still matter. You can still get a virus after being vaccinated, it is just far less likely to kill you and even less than that capable of being transmitted.  However, simply getting vaccinated then just going about life as you did before COVID is a sure-fire way to increase the likelihood of mutations and of transmitting those or any other mutated versions. Diligence will win but given the extremely high numbers we are seeing, people have not been diligent.  I lived in Missouri most of this year and NO ONE was wearing a mask, EVER. The state is deep red and talking about the vaccine, or worse that you had taken it, was as taboo as saying you banged horses.  So, I am not so sure of your statistics because being in the thick of conservatism I did not see the support for the vaccine, distancing, masks, or any mandated protocol that you insinuate there is among conservatives.	1640881068.0	hqk7514	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqk5bzq	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqk7514/

7rxe3jpy	I asked my Dr this after I found out that Canada has a death count of (now a little higher) 30,000 people from Covid over 2 years (already inflated numbers as anyone who dies from any cause but tests positive for covid within 28 days of death is listed as a covid death) but a total of 13,000 (now roughly 17,000) people that have died from the vaccine in a total of 8 months and how he justified that.   He told me they were old anyway and would have died.   Canada has effectively killed more than half as many people in half the time that covid has killed people in twice the timeline.   So no, if you're over 65 you definitely don't want the jab.   If you're overweight or fat or obese, if you're sickly, if you're immuno compromised, maybe. I'd still argue proper diet, sleep and supplementation is far better.  My parents are 63 and 55 and I have them on good vitamins, whole foods, and exercise. They haven't been sick for the last two years and they aren't jabbed up. All of their friends that got the jabs have been sick several times over. The hospital I've worked at only had several outbreaks and people sick with covid after they have received the jabs. I never once got sick the entire time. Neither has my buddy who worked their either and held off getting the poked for as long as he could. Our boss got sick with covid 3 times after being fully vaccinated, twice within a month of being "covid free".   I may be wrong, but from my personal experience, from what I have seen, from my own research and digging, from listening to doctoers, researchers and actual scientists, the jabs are making people sick by destroying their immune system. If you're healthy and take care of yourself you have nothing to worry about.   Average age of death for Canadians is 78.  Average age of covid deaths for Canadians is 80.   I use to work for my provinces health care system. They have been caught at least twice admitting that they artificially bumped up and padded the covid numbers to make it higher.   They claim all these people that are unvaccinated are in ICU and clogging up the hospitals. What they fail to tell the public is an unvaccinated individual is anyone who has not had the jabs, or, someone who has only had the 1st jab, or someone who has had both jabs but is within 14 days of receiving the second. The majority of hospitals are filled with people who have only had the first jab and the second jab and are within the 14 day window, are older than 50 and fat or smokers or another health issue and now have issues or are sick with side effects, and then unrelated to covid such as car accidents or injuries.   As I said, I may be incorrect and don't want to start a fight but this is what I have found out over the past 2 years of researching covid and the political agenda.	1640881265.0	hqk7n0m	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hqjzuuc	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hqk7n0m/

2jr8lnr	Either way it doesn't mean getting vaccinated is saving other people's lives. I think the vaccines are a good thing mainly for at risk people but I absolutely don't think people that have a 99.9 percent chance of not dying should feel obligated to get a vaccine. I'm 28 and I got the vaccine but my wife didn't. It's a personal choice and should be. No one should have to feel coerced to get it to keep their jobs or anything like that. If you are worried about an unvaccinated person in your work place, you're just an idiot, especially if you yourself are vaccinated. It just doesn't make any sense. Vaccinated can easily spread it to others that are vaccinated. The only point of the vaccine is to make your own symptoms less severe. That's what I'm trying to get at. And masking is dumb too especially for kids. All the psychological damage and economic damage the mandates, isolations,  and fear mongering has done is just ridiculous. It would be more understandable if there wasn't a vaccine and someone wasn't able to protect themselves from the virus. It's YOUR choice to keep working or not, it's YOUR choice to get vaccinated or not. This isn't that hard to understand. There never should have been mandates or mandatory isolation whether by the government or by your employer, if you want that shit, move to a different country. Like I said earlier, this isn't polio and omicron is less sever than a common cold for all age groups.	1640881586.0	hqk8g2l	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqk67b9	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqk8g2l/

4deig	I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	1640881768.0	hqk8whe	t3_rs2a6g	t1_hqk73o2	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2a6g/teachers_school_permanently_cancelled_after_wolf/hqk8whe/

7rxe3jpy	I worked for AHS and left due to the mandate. They plaved 26,000 healthcare workers on unpaid leave "until compliance is met". Now they're bitching about short staff in hospitals.  About a week after I had went on vacation I was informed from a coworker that our bosses came in and demanded to see papers proving of being vaccinated. If we didnt have them our fellow officers were to remove us immediately off property and not allow us back until we complied.   Absolutely disgusting.  Best part is no one got sick until everyone started getting the jabs. In the first month 5 people on various units had covid and spread it around. My boss got covid 3 times after being fully jabbed. I asked him why he wants to get something that isn't going to work and he said to protect his kids. Ironically he gave covid to his kids twice when he was fully vaccinated.	1640881791.0	hqk8yl8	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hqk86v4	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hqk8yl8/

46xf018r	We aren't....but it's time we "fight fire with atomic weapons."  Being the "nice party" and taking it, dry, up the ass, with no reach-around, has gotten us nowhere for these last years.  Their lies and made-up shit gets heard because....they are the loud ones.   Long past time that we use F-A-C-T-S and T-R-U-T-H, in a loud voice, to counter the ideology and bullshit coming from the left....and the deranged.  We can do the same as they...but without the lying and the making shit up parts. And we don't have to yell, unless being yelled at. We can just speaking a voice loud enough the heard.  I've seen and gone through this same crap for more than 15 years with the TRA (trans rights activists) and their cult followers as a mature gay man. There's absolutely  no difference between the tactics of the TRA and Democrat party. And I believe the DNC, the mindless progressive liberals, and the likes of AOC and the squad took pages from the TRA manual and followed it letter by letter.  And what will writing an essay do? What are the guidelines they have to follow? What says these essays don't turn into printed pieces demanding the university changes course and make them folk hero's?  First off....the one that started it all, the one in dreads, isn't even a student! They can't make her write anything. She has no grades or marks to worry about. She can just say "No". The other one can demand a review of this "punishment" to a body of school professors and administration workers....that probably believe she was in the right.  This isn't staying after school and writing "I shouldn't pull Mary Sue's ponytail" on the blackboard 200 times! This was a verbal assault on the rights of students to believe as they wish, and express it in a non-combative way....putting a "Blue Lives Matter" sticker on his laptop. Both male students, and the one that came to their aid, had their own rights trampled on by a pair of self entitled women who shouldn't be allowed to continue spreading their own hate driven agenda on campus.	1640882311.0	hqkaa9t	t3_rs1469	t1_hqjxjf2	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1469/angry_women_who_harassed_male_students_at_asu/hqkaa9t/

g4qjl	> 30% of the population is unvaxxed, which means they represent a smaller proportion of the hopsital population than the vaxxed.   ~25% of the British population is unvaccinated, but they make up 35% of the hospitalizations.  But you have to adjust for age and note that the demographics (old people) getting hospitalized are vaccinated at higher rates than that (>90%).  [Check out Texas.](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/covid19/data/Cases-and-Deaths-by-Vaccination-Status-11082021.pdf) This is pre-omicron which we all know is a lot more mild than delta, but it's very clear that unvaccinated individuals are extremely over represented by share of population in the death stats than their vaccinated peers. What's skewing the population numbers is most unvaccinated individuals are young who aren't likely to get hospitalized and even if they do they are even less likely to die.  You are right, though, that the attempts at coercion have done far more harm than good as far as vaccination rates are concerned not to mention damage to the core principles of the US. They keep pushing doublethink arguments about why the unvaccinated need to vaccinate regarding public health that are just completely bunk and cut against the efficacy of the vaccine. It's *extremely* good at preventing hospitalization and death and shit at preventing infection/spread. That's why they should have kept pushing the "once you're vaccinated you can go back to normal" line because it's true. Instead they switched over to "you're killing grandma if you don't" once again despite it being blatantly false. Unless you yourself happen to be grandma, of course.	1640882444.0	hqkamge	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqjslib	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqkamge/

1bjj7ahi	Technology isn't an all-or-nothing thing. It's a tool, and some devices, such as computers and tablets, can be beneficial for children as learning or information aids, while those same devices can be outright hazards if used incorrectly. Parents who wouldn't think of letting their children near things that are physical hazards, such as motorized vehicles, power tools, edged kitchen utensils and weapons, give them unmonitored long-term access to internet-linked devices that could be far more dangerous financially, socially or psychologically (and yes, sometimes physically) due to their connection with the outside world. People who parents would shield their children from in the physical world are frequently given no restrictions in the virtual one.  On the subject of those linked "smart" devices, people apparently have no idea the danger and intrusion they can be by their mere existence. Before getting one, the consideration should be made that there will be a permanent recording device present automatically gathering all kinds of personal data for unauthorized dissemination. *All sound* is recorded and much of it is dedicated to long-term storage. Are you discussing medical information with your spouse? Your smart device is recording that discussion with disregard to HIPAA regulations. Are you listing your credit card information aloud to someone on the phone in listening range of your smart device? The agent on the phone is (usually) prohibited by law from making a long-term note of your credit card data without your consent but your smart device has just saved it for posterity. Are you and your significant other alone in the house for some "personal" time? Actually you're not truly alone because your smart device is pulling down the play-by-play of your wicked yum-yum night like the voyeur it truly is. All of this is irrelevant and I am an idiot because I didn't know that you can put your device to sleep? Short of unplugging it and letting the battery run down, these are voice-activated devices and will still record data, even on standby.	1640882648.0	hqkb5io	t3_rrek19	t1_hqg1waf	/r/Conservative/comments/rrek19/alexa_tells_10yearold_girl_to_touch_live_plug/hqkb5io/

It's very easy to believe both that the Democrats won on blatant lies and also that it doesn't justify Republicans doing the same. Also, keep in mind the Republican base is much less tolerant of mendacious politicians due to the extreme nature by which Democrats frame literally everything. For Republicans the nation is in danger, but for Democrats the world is literally ending. That's how they justify the "for the greater good" attitude.	1640882926.0	hqkbvrl	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqjhfut	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqkbvrl/

15u0lp	I guess ill just speak a bit here instead.   A vaccine is effectively a blue print for your immune system to learn a virus and how to beat it. This is done in different ways. Quite simply, Moderna, which is what shot I have, uses a mRNA method. The vaccine gives your immune cells the instructions on how to fight the Covid virus.   Now Covid is constantly evolving, this Omicron bullshit came about because its desperately trying to stay alive and an evolution happened to be more transmissible. But every virus isnt the same, billions of micro-mutations mean that no vaccine of any disease can ever possibly be completely 100% effective. There's always a chance of infection.   But. And a big but. Vaccines do a great job of preparing your cells to fight those mutations, think of it as a head start. Imagine if you're a football coach, what do you do to prepare against an opponent? You watch footage of them to get a feel of how to beat them. And while your actual encounter with them might be different from their footage you have, you are atleast prepared for some aspects of their play.   Same thing with the vaccines. While originally they had incredible efficacy, as the virus has mutated it has lost some of that. BUT, your immune system still has a head start. Its familiar with the covid virus and knows in broad strokes how to combat it, though it may attack your body in different ways.   So. With Vaccines covered, the next part is understanding breakthroughs. No Vaccine is truly ever designed to prevent infection. Infection prevention isnt really the goal, the goal is to keep you alive. Vaccines inherently are NOT preventative, they ARE responsive.  If you look at what i mentioned earlier, a football coach studying film on his opponents doesn't prevent his opponent from doing anything on the field, it just prepares your team to fight them. Same thing with a vaccine. **Vaccines dont block the door to a virus getting in your system.**  If you look at hospitalization stats they support this as well. ["Staggering 98-99% of deaths are unvaccinated"](https://medicalpartnership.usg.edu/covid-19-staggering-statistic-98-to-99-of-americans-dying-are-unvaccinated/). This is evidence of the vaccine working as intended. **Save lives, not prevent infection.**  While I grant you, messaging from the CDC and others had made it seem like vaccines are a miracle infection prevention invention. That is incorrect, but if you took that at its face value I can understand why you'd look at the infection rates and say "hol up, this is all a farce!". But I posit to you that our public health officials are idiots, but fortunately they didnt make the vaccine, they're just morons when it comes to marketing it. The real geniuses and heroes are those who spent months in labs developing the vaccine. We can spend our time thanking the vaccine developers AND tar-and-feathering our public health officials without conflating the two.   Side note, disease =/= infection. Disease constitutes conditions like pneumonia, which the vaccine is extremely helpful in reducing occurrance of. So to re-answer your question, it does help to prevent disease, but there's a lot of context i needed to toss in as well.	1640883208.0	hqkcm79	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqjvk4b	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqkcm79/

Saying a certain line won't be crossed when they have every intention of crossing the line. It wasn't all that long ago that gay people claimed they didn't specifically want marriage and just wanted the same benefits of marriage. Within 20 years, you are now a homphobe if you aren't willing to get intimate with the sane sex or don't want to watch a pair of dudes stick their tongues down each other's throats.

69esf	While unconstitutional she is at least attempting to solve a real problem. I live in Washington State which was liveable about 10 years ago. Then Californians started moving here to escape all of their bad policies. I hear them complain about how bad California is and how glad they are to be in Washington. Then they go and mess Washington up by voting for politician that are just like the ones that screwed up California. Then they go on and complain about how messed up Washington is becoming.   Now they are moving to Idaho and messing up Idaho. I don't know this the answer to the problem or what but it's clear that the Californians escaping California don't intend to mess up every state they move to but for some reason they just can't help it and we need to help them. If they need a cooling off period then so be it.  And as far as constitutionality is concerned they skirt and sometimes outright ignore the constitution. If we aren't going to hold them to the constitution then we shouldn't bind ourselves to the constitution either.

80w74qh9	He understood perfectly fine what the risks were, particularly in that doing the inoculations too quickly among the army regulars would leave them vulnerable to the British if they found out what was going on. Something to note is that most British regulars were already immune from Variola/SP, while it reeked havoc on the populace of the colonies(including Canada, as reported by Ben Franklin & Benedict Arnold long before he turned cloak).   When it came to the procedure's fatality rate, it was more or less related to the fact that contamination of the "culture" was not uncommon(germ theory was basically embryonic at this point in history).   This was so widely known that Congress at one point issued directives to army surgeons not to inoculate, but Washington pushed back that not making the attempt would only lead to greater manpower shortages, whether by the disease itself, or by dissuading potential recruits who showed up to the camps full of men dying of the pox(men basically just showed up to local camps to enlist at that time).   Was it a plan without it's risks and costs? No. Was it worth it in the grand-scheme of things, yes. Good leadership is making the best decisions you can with incomplete information.	1640883542.0	hqkdhla	t3_rr74ul	t1_hqhdih4	/r/Conservative/comments/rr74ul/marines_say_theyre_being_crushed_over_vaccine/hqkdhla/

g4qjl	I thought that deaths weren't the concern, though? If that was the case we'd all be back to normal by now *because* really only those that are unvaccinated are dying or being hospitalized. All these efforts have been to stamp out the spread.  Listing out states like that is fallacious as it gives the improper impression that vast geographic swaths of the population are completely unvaccinated. In reality, it's mostly young people that are completely apathetic. The people actually dying from COVID are almost entirely from higher age brackets that are >90% vaccinated. Note that me pointing this out is not saying the vaccine isn't effective just that the population is exceptionally skewed. The death is pretty concentrated the ~2-4% of the population >65 that is unvaccinated.	1640883810.0	hqke6o8	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqjkubb	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqke6o8/

How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	1640883951.0	hqkek1y	t3_rs5386	t3_rs5386	/r/Conservative/comments/rs5386/is_the_covid_vaccine_causing_the_virus_to_mutate/hqkek1y/

3g3gi	Yes, I understand that there are some additional factors that push the needle a little towards the vaccines being somewhat efficacious. A handful of percent it seems. I believe I saw a Harvard study in Oct that found no correlation between US counties vax rates and death/hospitalization rates. Obviously once people are vaccinated perhaps they lower their guard, for example.   That said, it's pretty miserable that the ringing endorsement of vaccination is "Well, they're in the hospital the same % of the time, but it's because of age differentials..."    And yes, 100% cosign on the last paragraph. The CDC has admitted that it barely slows spread at all, doesn't prevent infection and in fact may increase viral load. Highly vaccinated areas are spreading it like wildfire. And yet we're supposed to be firing people because they refuse to help prevent transmission... when it doesn't prevent transmission?

I don’t want my kids being around theirs anyway. We already know to watch out for what they’re learning at school, so they can’t indoctrination our kids if we don’t let them. Watching people get torn down for getting married and having more than 3 kids is getting extremely old.	1640884019.0	hqkeqj5	t3_rrszg3	t3_rrszg3	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqkeqj5/

450uli1q	To me and to you, cannibalism is completely wrong. In our country, it’s illegal. That is our belief, and our law. But it is not that tribes belief, and in their culture it’s acceptable. (Also they don’t just like kill people and eat them they eat their elders when they die, it’s a spiritual thing… even more gross but whatever 😂)  To me and you, a kid shouldn’t be taken to an event to see shit like that. It could raise too many questions at an early age, in my opinion, and probably in yours. But In that kids household, maybe it’s ok. Maybe they are a sex positive household. Maybe that’s better? Maybe it’s not. Choices, consequences. There is no central human rule book that says which is better.  The extreme examples aside, I’m alluding to the same central idea, which is that most of right and wrong can be subjective. It’s up to you, your morals, how you were brought up, the laws in place, and the society you live in.   Do whatever you believe is right. Teach your kids whatever you believe is right. Live your life how you want. But also understand that it’s not the only thing to believe, or live. Love each other, don’t steal each others shit, don’t kill or hurt each other, and help one another and everything is good.	1640884245.0	hqkfbtn	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqkcgbn	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqkfbtn/

4deig	Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	1640884421.0	hqkfsmx	t3_rs2a6g	t1_hqkdmd7	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2a6g/teachers_school_permanently_cancelled_after_wolf/hqkfsmx/

Ontario is really messed up, but NB wanted to bar people from entering grocery stores unless they were vaccinated. They protested it and I believe its dropped now.   The gov blames unvaccinated for all thes breakthrus yet only the vaccinated can go and attend events and such.

g4qjl	The US vaccination rate has absolutely nothing to do with the rate of viral mutation. If the US were 100% vaxxed we'd still have had both delta and omicron. Considering the rate of spread is not measurably slowed within more highly vaccinated populations in comparison to less vaccinated populations, you're ignoring   > I lived in Missouri most of this year and NO ONE was wearing a mask, EVER. The state is deep red and talking about the vaccine, or worse that you had taken it, was as taboo as saying you banged horses.  And yet Missouri outperforms when it comes to COVID. Most of the state lives in the St. Louis and KC suburbs which are 60% vaccinated.  > masks  There is absolutely zero evidence anything short of an N95 has any impact whatsoever on spread within a population. The second you put that mask in your pocket you've ruined the efficacy of the surgical mask to <10% for *droplet* spread diseases. COVID is airborne. >99% of mask use in the US is theater.  > distancing  They made up 6' out of whole cloth. You can and will catch COVID from more than 6' away.  Also, >90% of spread happens within the home among friends and family where no masks are worn and where distancing is non-existent. Face it. You're not following the science. The science says you can reduce your personal risk by being vaccinated. That's literally the only thing you can do and the only thing you really should be doing. And if you're young it's not a big deal either way.	1640884711.0	hqkgkku	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqk7514	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqkgkku/

Rape is always wrong. All those things infringe on your human rights.  Bringing a kid to a pride festival, is not infringing on that kids human rights. Some people believe violent games are bad for child development, some think it’s not. Some people think that being gay is wrong, some don’t. It can go in and on.   Now Bringing that kid to a room full of people having sex would be super fucked up. But no one is fucking on the street, that’s illegal.

Furthermore, don’t confuse freedoms and rights with your preferences. There is no right not to get sick. There is no right to not get your child sick. There is no right to force others to medicate themselves. These are all your preferences. And if you can’t deal with other more reasonable and stable people, then stay at home and wait until this pandemic is over.

They rarely will do anything to hurt anyone with a (D) during a general election. They know that getting any (D) elected is better than any (R).  Not us. We got Bill Clinton because the religious right took their ball and went home in '92 because they were mad at the first Bush. They did nothing to support Romney who could have taken down a weak Barry in his 2nd election. And of course, we've now got Brandon in the WH because we lost so many people over mean tweets and feelings.  We lose elections over it. Democrats get mad and will work to get the ones they want but know come general election time, the (D) matters more than the person.	1640884923.0	hqkh52j	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqk6sqv	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqkh52j/

g4qjl	Why are you looking at county or state level statistics instead of at the actual population? Those are supposed to be proxies for when we lack more meaningful data. Data we have. Given that you are vaccinated and given you are infected, you are over ten times less likely to die from COVID. That's going to vary by age, but I picked the most relevant (most deaths are old) and smallest difference. I don't know what other scenario you'd use to measure the efficacy of the vaccine. It's certainly much better than "Given a county with a high vaccination rate vs a low vaccination rate."  In general, unvaccinated people are over represented in hospitalization statistics. In every demographic, a vaccinated individual is far, far less likely to be hospitalized or die. It's really only useful for people >30 and really only important for people >50.	1640885532.0	hqkis0m	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqkeq1g	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqkis0m/

Using YouTube vids and Facebook posts to argue about something that literal scientist all over the world have proved with hard factual data is completely mind boggling. And the antivaxers on here want to throw around the word “science” like it’s on their side?? I don’t understand where we feel safe smoking cigarettes and eating cheeseburgers at mcdonalds but we’re all of the sudden fearful of a proven save and effective vaccine, all because people have doubt. Not using statistical analysis of hundreds of millions of Covid cases and vaccines safely given, but based on Fear alone. I’d be more doubtful of the ingredients in that quarter pounder than I am the vax, but I guess having a sibling who makes the vaccines for a living makes me biased huh.. if only my big brother could dumb it down for the entire world.

9rkjz	100% agree with the article, on most parts. But there are some issues that I don't think are being accurately explored when discussing the current malaise of the current world. For example, the ever growing monoploization of pretty much everything. Corporations, without any real checks and balances in place to stop them, have grown into ever larger entities, with quite often more power than is just. Media conglomeration, and it's stranglehold over objectivity, the revolving doors between the private, and public. Which often appears to benefit the private. Not to mention the very real subversion of democracy by outside actors. Whether that be, by way of troll farms in China, or Russia, or bankrolled politicians for large corporate interests.  The mess we are in, and it seems to have infected the western world, is part and parcel to much more that's been ignored.

While we could not include the universe of texts in this review, we highlight articles post-2005-2006,1which we found to be representative of emergent themes we encountered in the literature. ***In the area of K-12, we found that articles generally address the following themes: (a) curriculum and pedagogy, (b) teaching and learning,*** (c) schooling, and (d) policy/finance and community engagement....  >we examine the practical developments within Critical Race Pedagogy (CRP; Lynn, 1999, 2004; Solorzano & Delgado Bernal, 2001; Solorzano & Yosso, 2001, 2002; Yosso, Parker, Solorzano, & Lynn, 2004). ***In addition, we acknowledge that much of this pedagogical work is indebted to the pioneering work of Derrick Bell*** (2008a) whose pedagogical use of race hypos in legal education underscores much of this work...  >How do educators enact, perform, or use CRP? Following feminists of color work that maintains our insights must be achieved (Calderón, Delgado Bernal, Pérez Huber, Malagón, & Vélez, 2012), CRP must likewise engage experiential knowledge in a critical manner. That is, experiential knowledge cannot be used without a pedagogical framing of the racialized contexts that give rise to experience. ***This work has developed from teaching in the classroom and a sustained engagement with both the scholarship produced by Critical Race Theorists in education and epistemological engagements in education (Cajete, 1994; Delgado Bernal, 1998; Deloria & Wildcat, 2001). It relies both on case method and Derrick Bell’s race hypos to explore the role of race and racism across a spectrum of curriculums to encourage students to reflect on what is in CRT counterstorytelling***...  >***Both student and teacher counternarratives are contextualized within particular experiences that critically examine what it means to bring nondominant voices into classrooms, an essential component of CRT.*** In a sense, this work echoes James Banks’ caution in employing multicultural approaches: It is simply not enough to use diverse counternarratives to disrupt dominant pedagogies. These diverse counternarratives must begin with the lives of the oppressed as these are the voices traditionally excluded from dominant pedagogies...  >***Alternatively, CRP is also useful for White students***. Matias’ (2013) work offers us tools as CR educators  working with majority White students or students of color that might embody majoritarian narratives regarding their own communities and other communities of color. For Matias, ***this demands a “process of re-educating Whites via raced curriculum from which they begin a renewed process of identity development” (p. 6). Drawing from Cross’ (1971) concept of Nigrescence, she proposes “colorscence” of White racial identity***   And this is from the [AAPF](https://44bbdc6e-01a4-4a9a-88bc-731c6524888e.filesusr.com/ugd/0813a9_6b0ea3c8b15a48cab92db4f0fd7991b7.pdf), who's executive director is none other than critical race theories founder Kimberly Crenshaw:  >1. QUESTION: Is Critical Race Theory currently  being taught in K-12 schools? ANSWER: Critical race theory originated in law schools, but over time, professional educators and activists in a host of settings--K-12 teachers, DEI advocates, racial justice and democracy activists, among others–applied CRT to help recognize and eliminate systemic racism.  There is also a ton of evidence out there of it being taught in schools. Most recently, California just passed the California Ethnic studies Curriculum, which is heavily influenced by critical race theory. I am happy to show you how if you want.  Here is a [quote](https://edsource.org/2021/a-final-vote-after-many-rewrites-for-californias-controversial-ethnic-studies-curriculum/651338) from one of the people who created this curriculum:  >“Ethnic studies without critical race theory is not ethnic studies. It would be like a science class without the scientific method then. There is no critical analysis of systems of power and experiences of these marginalized groups without critical race theory.”  Here is a quote from a superintendent of a [district in Michigan](https://detroit.chalkbeat.org/2021/11/15/22784151/detroit-school-district-pushes-back-against-anti-crt-bills-black-history), which uses CRT:  >“Our curriculum is deeply using critical race theory especially in social studies, but you’ll find it in English language arts and the other disciplines,” said Superintendent Nikolai Vitti during a school board meeting Tuesday.  Here is an example of 3rd graders in California basically being taught intersectionality: https://defendinged.org/incidents/cupertino-schools-vice-mayor-raises-concern-over-proposed-ethic-studies-curriculum/  Here is an example of CRT's concept of whiteness and white supremacy being taught in Illinois:   https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/should-black-lives-matter-agenda-be-taught-school/618277/  Here is an example from maryland:  https://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/thomas-pyle-mcps-2021/  Here's is a Nevada school district currently being sued due to the content of a critical race curriculum:  https://defendinged.org/incidents/mother-and-son-file-lawsuit-against-democracy-prep-in-las-vegas/	1640885767.0	hqkjeh6	t3_rrt4sb	t1_hqjerzy	/r/Conservative/comments/rrt4sb/desantis_critical_race_theory_is_crap_vows_to/hqkjeh6/

Carrying a gun after having a prior felony conviction, by the way a prior felony conviction for a violent crime, ought to fall into that category. In those circumstances judges ought to be incredibly reticent to let a person out on their own recognizance. That does seem strange and it requires a change not only in the legislation, but also in the judicial attitude toward these kinds of crimes.”	1640886089.0	hqkk9au	t3_rs1uxl	t3_rs1uxl	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1uxl/where_is_the_outrage_over_the_killing_of/hqkk9au/

jp2crl3	If she ran against Trump in 2024, she would likely win. If it was Obama vs. Trump in 2012, its very likely Obama would have won as well. Obama was really a star candidate for the Dems. I don't think a Obama-like figure will be there for Dems for a long time. He was able to keep minorities, do okay with suburbanites, and chipped in to white working class support. The Dems have gone significantly to the left on cultural issues so they will never be able to get the white working class support that they had in the upper Midwest. It makes them basically dependent on white educated voters and minorities.    A Michelle Obama in '24 run would be a bunch of platitudes about hope and change and basically arguing that she wouldn't rock the boat too much in terms of taxes/spending. That would be enough to get Biden's coalition plus overperform with women and minority voters.   Ultimately, none of this matter since she is not running in 2024. Its likely Biden or Kamala Harris (or a primary challenger such as Buttigieg or Warren to Harris). Biden has the best chance to keep the white house, but Harris or any other challenger would likely lose as they don't have the incumbency advantage.	1640886633.0	hqklova	t3_rs3fok	t3_rs3fok	/r/Conservative/comments/rs3fok/joe_rogan_says_he_thinks_michelle_obama_would_win/hqklova/

Something to be born upon a person lest they be denied the ability to buy or sell.  6 being the number of incomplete or imperfection (1 short of the perfect/complete 7).  So the Number of the Beast is incomplete, and 10 times incomplete and 100 times incomplete.  Fit's neatly in with the other symbolic numbers surrounding the Beast and it's attempts to mimic God, the Lamb that was Slain, and the Sevenfold Spirits of God.	1640887194.0	hqkn6lr	t3_rs5u7h	t1_hqkihss	/r/Conservative/comments/rs5u7h/watch_bill_gates_orgasms_when_anderson_cooper/hqkn6lr/

qamff	>Listing out states like that is fallacious as it gives the improper impression that vast geographic swaths of the population are completely unvaccinated.  ...Large swaths of the population **ARE** completely unvaccinated.  It's not improper if it's true.  \~66% of Texas has at least 1 dose.  That means \~33% of Texas has no doses.  That's not a couple of people in Alabama which was part of the guy's point I responded to... that's 10 million people.  That's more than the population of many  states. And Texas' percentages are not the exception.  Wyoming?  \~53%.  Oklahoma?  About 58%.     > thought that deaths weren't the concern, though? If that was the case we'd all be back to normal by now because really only those that are unvaccinated are dying or being hospitalized. All these efforts have been to stamp out the spread.  If deaths aren't the concern, why is the point of the meme saying "So many more people died under Biden than Trump"?  If you weren't worried about deaths, then don't worry about it when there are more.  Accept people dying as the price of business.  If you were worried about deaths, then why fight mandates?  You can't both say "LGB, your covid numbers suck" and then in the next breath say "I refuse to do anything that Brandon wants to do to curb the virus".  I mean you can, but it's hypocritical.     And before you say "Well why did you care about deaths back then but not now", I would say I do care about deaths now. I wish we could come together and do stuff to stop it from being as deadly as it is.  But as much as I can lead a horse to water, I can't make it drink.     Back when Trump was the POTUS I said frequently that we should have had lockdowns, the gov't should have waived mortgages/rent for a period of time and people should have just stayed home. That only essential businesses should be open (and I mean actually essential like grocery stores, not "essential" like Golf courses, and churches). Sure folks who earn a lifestyle by only having property would have suffered, but I've never been a fan of folks that make 20k a month by charging people exorbitant fees to not be homeless.       What happened?  Folks refused to stay home.  Members of congress /governors insisted on getting folks back to work by cutting off federal supply early. And when I go out today, I see that for the most part life is back to normal.  Sure, they have a sign that asks you to wear a mask if you're unvaccinated.  But people ignore those signs all the time.  It's not like businesses check the vaccination status of folks that enter.  And with life returning to normal we're noticing an uptick in cases.     And sure, nowadays we have a vaccine which is a huge bonus that Biden has. And the majority of folks dying are the folks without the vaccine.

cnn8z2i	"Bells on bobtails ring..."  Okay, let's look up what a bobtail is, and why it is ringing.  Oh, it means a tail that has been clipped. A bobtail is a horse's tail that has been clipped, similar to a bob haircut is a short haircut. Even dogs can have a bobbed tail.  Why would the horse need to have bells?  Well, back in the day people would ride horses to go places, or in a sleigh, because cars were not around.  And the bells would let people know where the horse was to avoid crashes, especially at intersections because a sleigh makes no noise gliding over the snow.  , So why is the song racist?  Well apparently when it very first debuted, it was done on a minstrels stage.  Racist!!

Instead they attacked.   They have no desire for the truth. Only a desire to be threatened or offended by it.

m23d1	Fun fact. In 2004/05 I was in Iraq. In 2006 I was in college. At one point, another student, a white male dressed up in hadji attire and a hijab/burka came up behind me and prodded me in the lower back/kidney area. I turned around and went off ... Threw him on the ground, established a kimura armbar and ripped the head wrap off...at which point I went fucking ballistic (yelling) at the guy because we had a class together and he knew exactly what he was doing. At no point did I strike him though, just established body control.   Smash cut to turning myself in for the physical confrontation and the punishment stage. We both had to write letters of apology or face expulsion. His letter was basically "im sorry you're a frightened bigot who thinks it's okay to blah blah blah..." And no expulsion for him.

The Cold War ended a long time ago, the US is a few years away from complete energy independence, and the US has a massively growing and young market of consumers in Mexico to sell goods to. The US spends way too much money on providing free military and protection to Europe and global trade routes that hardly benefit us. I’m glad the rest of the world is finally deciding to stop free loading and actually start building up their own militaries.	1640888300.0	hqkq3yv	t3_rs4094	t1_hqk3h3s	/r/Conservative/comments/rs4094/what_would_happen_if_russia_invades_ukraine_if/hqkq3yv/

4j8no8w5	Always has been pal. Teddy Roosevelt was the youngest president at inauguration at 42 with Clinton (46) and Obama(47) being the youngest in the last half century. With the age requirement to run for office being 40 that makes any presidential candidate at the youngest they could be still 2 years older then the median age of the people they represent (currently 38.) Meaning that statistically any president is going to be much older then the majority of people. Personally I agree with you, I'd like a president that I don't have to worry about having a stroke mid presidency.	1640888494.0	hqkqm7x	t3_rs3om0	t1_hqk370f	/r/Conservative/comments/rs3om0/lauren_boebert_tricks_the_left_into_exposing/hqkqm7x/

682ifs1h	It is an interesting proposal in which we have never seen a portion of a state join another in this manner, you wouldn't need congress to approve it, it would basically be between states and i doubt they would allow it but what is to say they do it anyway as the legislature of Idaho has approved it, to hell with Oregon? Another parts of the country have suggested doing the same.  In all honesty, more states need to be created, just like California is essentially 6 states could be almost 8 states but no one has any political will to do what needs to be done, instead of a national divorce perhaps it is time to create new states out of some of the old, to creating new borders.... why not!

g4qjl	> Large swaths of the population ARE completely unvaccinated  But they're very widely distributed. Visualizing it geographically is mendacious as hell. Just give the data you're giving a proxy for. There's a material difference if they were all concentrated in one play instead of it being extremely spread out like in reality.  > That means ~33% of Texas has no doses. That's not a couple of people in Alabama which was part of the guy's point I responded to... that's 10 million people.  Yeah, and 30% of Minnesota. And 30% of Wisconsin. That's my point. Are you trying to tell me that having 70% of a state vaccinated isn't enough to prevent the hospital system from being overwhelmed? Or are you pivoting back to say we need 100% to eradicate the spread of COVID? Both of those are stupid.  > why is the point of the meme saying "So many more people died under Biden than Trump"  Because the Democrats incorrectly threw a tantrum all 2020 about how Trump had blood on his hands and campaigned on how if a Democrat were in charge things would be much, much better. Pointing out their hypocrisy is funny and apt. You've missed the entire point if you think Republicans disagree with Biden saying "there is no federal solution for COVID." That's what we've been trying to tell you the whole time.  > But as much as I can lead a horse to water, I can't make it drink.   Then stop fucking trying. Nobody wants your mandates. It's literally making the problem worse. Get the fuck out of my life. Quit trying to fire my friends and family that don't give a shit. Literally every policy you advocate for has failed everywhere. Lockdowns, masks, distancing, mandates. COVID beat them in each and every country. The most masked countries, the most locked down countries, I don't know how you couldn't be looking at all the data and think more doubling down on ineffective measures isn't going to continue to ruin people's lives for little to no benefit.  > And with life returning to normal we're noticing an uptick in cases.   Pivot back to cases. Pivot to deaths. Back to cases again. Fuck off. Stop caring if people catch cold. Take responsibility for your own damn actions like the rest of us for one god damn minute and quit trying to rely on the state to protect you. It can't. You pretended we can eradicate a disease substantially more transmissible *and* more mutable than the flu. This is how respiratory retroviruses work. If you can't handle being an adult in the real world lock *yourself* down and quit trying to make the rest of us live by your unreasonable, anti-science standards.	1640890429.0	hqkvplu	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqknuv7	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqkvplu/

By American standards, she'd be a liberal rather than a leftist, though a bit more of a modern liberal rather than classical liberalism.   Remember that "left/right" aren't the same in Europe as in America.  You have the AOC wingnuts trying to change that, but that's really only < 1/3 of the actual party at this point.  Europe doesn't have anything that matches the libertarian roots of both our parties and is,an ingrained part of American culture.  That's why it's being so heavily assaulted by the actual leftists.

3g3gi	> Given that you are vaccinated and given you are infected, you are over ten times less likely to die from COVID.  The problem with assertions such as these are that the numbers are constantly changing. It's a point in time declaration. I could also say that the Pfizer vaccine prevents transmission, and I'd be "right". Because Pfizer and the FDA declared it at one point. Of course since then it's become clear that it's not true.   What's the efficacy? 100%? 95%? 90%? 30%? I can find news articles and studies declaring each of these things.    But no, at the moment there's absolutely not a 10x increase in death rate among the unvaccinated. Not by a long shot.    In any case, unvaccinated people presumably are less worried about COVID. I'd say that's likely the case. So they likely mask less? Social distance less?

By 2024, there will be no voter id but I won't be surprised if there is a vaccine passport required for voting in person. Also some new 'variants' will suddenly appear and mail-in voting will be made the only option. And we all know what happens with mail-in ballots, especially in the middle of the night at vote counting stations.

It’s not as if women can die if they improperly use a tampon or anything, or instructing people in genital hygiene would be in societies best interest, right? But no, because *you, personally* have never needed any help, not even from your parents, obviously, that means that no one ever could possibly benefit from science based instruction in such topics. Or perhaps you didn’t consider that genital hygiene includes such things as menstrual cycle management and proper post-ejaculation procedures?	1640892209.0	hql0clm	t3_rs1kvl	t1_hqkzeoz	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1kvl/joy_reid_asks_for_proof_porn_is_in_high_school/hql0clm/
vfjp3	>The vaers system reports deaths related to vaccines.   If you don't believe me, go look at the actual VAERS site. The actual people that designed and manage the dataset specifically say:  >[VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html)  There's also an [FAQ section](https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html) which addressed the question:  >Are all adverse events reported to VAERS caused by vaccines?:   >   >No. Some adverse events might be caused by vaccination and others might be coincidental and not related to vaccination. Just because an adverse event happened after a person received a vaccine does not mean the vaccine caused the adverse event.  Also, on the same FAQ pages under the limitations of the VAERS, it says:  >Limitation: It is generally not possible to find out from VAERS data if a vaccine caused the adverse event  So you apparently trust the people that put VAERS together enough to rely on their dataset. Perhaps you should also trust them when they specifically say that VAERS data can't be used to establish cause.  >50,000 people have died from this vaccine at the very least in the USA alone. This is verified by many sources, studies, doctors etc.   If this is true, please share some high quality, peer reviewed studies from established scientific journals that support this claim.

c9bcz2bc	Im not doubting the studies (that i havent yet seen you cite). Id speculate they are, like most all scientific studies, competed in a controlled environment with defined variables.  But there's the issue...We dont live in controlled settings; We live in the real world with infinite variable.  These are my real world experiences.   Are the result of avoiding covid for an unvaxxed person entirely due to an increased natural.immunity?  ..i dont know for sure.. I'm sure there are multiple variables unaccounted for.but with 3 adult living in the same house, Its not unreasonable to believe so.(its an 2 middle aged adults and adult child...the child and one of the middle.saged adult are both double vaxxed and both had covid while the other middle.aged adult never had it)  And this isnt the only incident.either.  I've seen it with co workers working shoulder to shoulder most of the day, classmates eating lunch and sitting together, church members sitting in the same pew and singing together, the most compelling before this I knew of was a truck driving team...both invaded, one got it, the other never did...living together in  box less than 100 sq ft. (9 sq meters for out Canadian friends :) )   I think of people.want the vax, then by all means they should get it. No one should be disparaged for doing what they feel is best for themselves and their families. On the other side of the same coin, no one should be disparaged for choosing not to get it either.	1640892242.0	hql0fnw	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hqkxuuo	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hql0fnw/

The immune system is perhaps one of the most complicated systems humans have ever studied.   It’s crazy intense and many many variables can change a response to a virus today or tomorrow.   So all we can do is theorize and do blood tests of individuals after vaccine and natural immunity and see how well antibodies are holding up on their blood stream in terms of quality months or many months later (I don’t think they even can test for antibodies directly  but markers of them).   The point is- could all this be wrong- of course. Is there any evidence that natural immunity beats vaccine- not that I have seen in reading studies. So yes, it is possible natural immunity is better but there is no evidence of so   We will start to see deaths in natural immunity vs vaccines soon.  Just too bad those fools had to die to “prove” once again that natural immunity is worse.	1640892980.0	hql2czb	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hql1d3j	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hql2czb/

4x9uv	“Trust the science” is one of the stupidest lines ever devised.  Anyone who says you must “trust” science does not understand what science is.  In fact, renowned physicist, Richard Feynman, utterly despised that idea.  **“Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts. When someone says ‘science teaches such and such’, he is using the word incorrectly. Science doesn’t teach it; experience teaches it.” - Richard Feynman**  The left has completely hijacked and inverted the concept of science. The entire Enlightenment and the modern age is based on the democratization of science. Contrary to the ancient world, where so many societies like Ancient Greece believed that science could only be practiced by a group of ‘experts’, the Enlightenment spread the idea that anyone could observe the world around him, record his findings, and come to realizations about the nature of the world.   That’s science. Wearing a lab coat and having a fancy degree does not make you a scientist. A 3 year-old who pushes over a Jenga tower and observes where all the blocks fall is more of a scientist than Anthony Fauci is.  The point is that science is an activity you engage in. It’s an act of observation. The idea that there’s a class of ‘experts’ who bring down “The Science™️” to all of us like Moses bringing the tablets down from the mountain - is the precise *opposite* of what science is.  But that’s what leftists do. They want to preserve and grow their oligarchy, so they’ve hijacked the language of science and use that language as a weapon to attack anyone who pushes back against their oligarchic rule.	1640893226.0	hql300j	t3_rrmoud	t3_rrmoud	/r/Conservative/comments/rrmoud/aaron_rodgers_science_that_cant_be_questioned_is/hql300j/

They’ve just instituted 50% capacity for restaurants and other businesses and you still need to show proof of vaccination.   Curiously though, the health secretary already said they wouldn’t adopt the reduced quarantine period from the CDC, which if you know a bit about Puerto Rico’s political standing is quite ironic. The current administration sucks it up constantly to the US federal government and we got some time in the limelight when some outlets reported that PR was one of the most vaccinated US territories.

6fido	They were based on science just really bad dishonest science. Anyone who works with statistics knows if you choose the variables and conditions of the scenarios you can get data to say almost whatever you want it to.  A good example is on the science subreddit there was a peer reviewed study that said people with natural immunity were more likely to get the coronavirus then those that never had Covid and had the vaccine. Based on this they have deduced natural immunity is weaker.   However people that have had Covid are likely to live life styles or have careers that give them higher odds of contracting the virus than people that have avoided it this whole time. The study failed to account for this factor and not one "peer" that reviewed it pointed out such an obvious variable's importance?	1640893452.0	hql3l5c	t3_rs4qfg	t1_hqkeit4	/r/Conservative/comments/rs4qfg/twitter_has_fun_with_the_cdc_following_latest/hql3l5c/

Let me be clear, anything and everything coming out of Washington, regardless of who’s commander and chief, is very much political and not always in the best interest of the general public. Not that those politicians are always trying to screw the people all of the time, but I don’t believe half of the reasons they give for passing most legislation. In this situation however, I do genuinely believe that the President (or any President for that matter) is going to try his best to end this pandemic since it’s obviously such a bane on everything else. It takes up too much air in the room to talk about much else, especially when numbers are like they are today. I think someone said it well when they said, the virus controls us, we don’t control it. Anyone in politics who doesn’t agree with that is too clouded by their own agenda to realize the big picture.	1640893538.0	hql3tbp	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hql1yox	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hql3tbp/

av79gtaa	Though you seem to miss the parts where they pointed out that there are conversations about trying to separate children, and kink during pride.  Some places have set up 2 parades, one family friendly, the other adults only, which seems like an overall good idea. But it doesn't mean gay kids should have to shut up and stay home because "you're not allowed to be at your own events if you're a kid" isn't really a good excuse. I agree, kids and sexual content should stay separate, but that doesn't mean you can just ban LGBTQ+ content from existing because "well kids *could* see it".  Just because kinks are inappropriate in certain times or places, *doesn't* mean being part of the LGBTQ+ is inappropriate.	1640893701.0	hql48f9	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqk3ysi	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hql48f9/

co9r5n9f	>since it’s now the clearly dominate strain  40% of cases are still Delta according to the CDC.  Hard to find numbers, but I am under the impression that Regeneron is by far the biggest supply of monoclonal antibodies.  Delta cases are also on average more severe than Omicron.  There is no logical reason to pull treatment for that.  >the virus controls us, we don’t control it. Anyone in politics who doesn’t agree with that is too clouded by their own agenda to realize the big picture.  Anyone who believes this greatly overestimates the virus and doesnt understand why any of our Covid numbers are the way they are.  For example: deaths early on were very high because an assortment of Democrat governors pushed covid patients into nursing homes killing tens of thousands early on.  If they didnt intentionally kill our most vulnerable in a huge spike we probably wouldnt have locked down.  "Hospitalizations" of non vaccinated people includes any non vaccinated patient in the hospital that tests positive for Covid, does not mean they were hospitalized because of Covid.  This makes the much more infectious but less severe Omicron varient look like more people are being hospitalized because of it, while also inflating the percentage of nonvaccinated vs vaccinated hospitalizations.	1640894603.0	hql6j51	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hql3tbp	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hql6j51/

I'd say that the law is usually good about protecting citizens against vague laws when charges to get filed, but they'll probably send all the people being charged to highly corrupt leftist judges like Emmit Sullivan and his ilk.	1640895178.0	hql7z26	t3_rs8yxq	t1_hqkxepl	/r/Conservative/comments/rs8yxq/ilhan_omar_islamophobia_bill_passed_by_house/hql7z26/

g4qjl	The numbers I'm giving you are directly from census level datasets gathered from Texas hospitals. From two to three months ago. The vaccinated actually have have a 10x lower per capita death rate than the unvaccinated for the age group. 324 fully vaccinated deaths vs 793. In a state where >75% of 65 and ups are vaccinated.  https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/state/texas Just to give a rough estimate of the demographic vaccination rate. It's actually higher for all 65 and ups, but I figured I'd just take the lower of the two combined populations to be safe.  https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/covid19/data/Cases-and-Deaths-by-Vaccination-Status-11082021.pdf page 9 is important.  You cannot deny that you are orders of magnitude less likely to die from COVID after you're vaccinated. I have no idea how you can come to any other conclusion after looking at this data. If that weren't the case we'd expect a 3:1 ratio of vaxxed to unvaxxed deaths but we're seeing a 3:7 ratio. Stupidly rough napkin math where I'm super conservative is putting it at a relative risk factor of 7x. The actual number is higher because I'm rounding down the vaccination rate and rounding down unvaccinated deaths more than vaccinated deaths.  > mask less? Social distance less?  Masking is utterly ineffective. COVID is too small and isn't primarily spread on droplets that can be blocked by cloth/surgical masks especially if they're reused. Also, >90% of spread happens within the household between friends and family where mitigation efforts are rarely if ever implemented. We don't see much correlation between masking rates and rates of spread within populations. On top of that, the 6' social distancing rule was pulled out of someone's ass. You're just as likely to infect someone at 6' as you are at 2'. The airflow of the space matters a lot more.	1640895892.0	hql9skf	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqkzz15	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hql9skf/

I read Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and didn’t murder people. I don’t see why this specific book deserves more outrage than any of the other outrage culture witch hunts we’ve seen in the last 50 years. “D&D is devil worship” “Magic the gathering is pagan” “Rock music is corrupting our youth” “violent video games are making children bad!” “This book is exposing my children to *gay* blowjobs!”   Moral outrage isn’t a *conservative* thing, it’s an *authoritarian* thing, and Democrats are just as guilty of it as Republicans, liberals as much as conservative.

You just linked the first Google search result that said what you wanted to see, which was a run down of the Cdcs study that was before all the breakthrough cases and had a sample size 10 times smaller than the Israel study which was done after their breakthrough cases started happening.  You linked to an opinion on quora, which was sherlock themed. I actually have a degree in this shit, I don't do quora or wikipedia. Source the studies debunking this study or admit you were incorrect in your claim.  No study pre 2018 will claim what you're claiming. Not to mention all your studies happened before all these breakthrough cases with double vaxxed individuals.  It's you providing the bunk 'science'.

3g3gi	It's true we can look at micro stats all day long and especially if we're for whatever reason picking individual hospital systems (?) then yeah, we can find stats to support everything. Vitamin C. HCQ. Whatever. I can find studies saying masking works just as easily as ones saying it doesn't.    The fact is that New York is heavily vaccinated - specifically NYC - and it's currently smashing records for everything. Idaho is a measly 50% jabbed and still has a vastly lower death rate.  And I'm not just cherry-picking. There's little rhyme or reason. Vermont is highly jabbed, and is in good shape. But New Jersey is a dumpster fire.  *It's almost like population density is vastly more important than if people are vaccinated or not.*  Imagine this. It's mid 2020. I come from the future and tell you that we finally have a vaccine. You're relieved. Overjoyed. "A vaccine? Amazing! So the pandemic is over!"   "No."   "Why not?"   "Well, lots of reasons."   "But the people who take the shot are safe?"   "Well, no. In fact the most vaccinated places seem to be hotspots."    You'd be a little confuzzled I imagine.    PS. I think it works a little. Just not a lot. And apparently not much at all on Omnicorn.	1640898232.0	hqlfq3c	t3_rrrhih	t1_hql9skf	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqlfq3c/

Second tell that to people who have lost loved ones to myocarditis, blood clots or anything else. So far VAERS has close to 20,000 deaths and innumerable serious vaccine injuries. I don't doubt that the vaccines help reduce deaths from covid but for some people, especially covid recovered, the risk far outweighs the benefit.	1640898348.0	hqlg0rh	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqleibd	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqlg0rh/

I reacted the way I did because a "masked" person snuck up behind me and inflicted physical pain on me and I did the absolute minimum to gain control of the situation. That I was a veteran and this white dude was dressed as a hadji were tangential to the fact at the time, I didn't freak out on him because he was dressed that way, I freaked out because I was high strung and felt threatened. After I realized who it was, I was just pissed because he was looking for a reaction out of me and didn't like the one he got. I don't know that I'd call it a flashback as much as someone trying to aggravate a maybe not as stable as I could have been version of myself, but I don't know what the fuck he expected was gonna happen.	1640899316.0	hqlihfu	t3_rs1469	t1_hqlhcvg	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1469/angry_women_who_harassed_male_students_at_asu/hqlihfu/

The manager contacted police to have these people trespassed off the property, because they refused to provide mandatory proof of vaccination.    The manager of the restaurant stands to get fired if they don't enforce the mandate, because the restaurant stands to lose their business license if they don't enforce the mandate.

b5qc1plh	Cops are allowed to strike?  That's news to me.  As far as I was aware, collective bargaining agreements for police typically forbid striking, such that officers who go on strike forfeit their union representation and their job immediately.    The only way for patrol officers to stand up to this stuff is if they have the backing of their superiors.  But even if they do, should they really refuse to enforce trespassing laws simply because they don't like the reason for people being trespassed?  In this case, a manager called police to have people removed.  I don't know about you, but I don't want the cops deciding to stop trespassing people off my property simply because they don't like my reason for doing so.	1640900053.0	hqlkcps	t3_rr8jzy	t1_hqfqltj	/r/Conservative/comments/rr8jzy/this_is_gross_swarm_of_nypd_officers_harass_a/hqlkcps/

11nxd5a	Why are you so concerned if anti Vax people die. It's been proven thbe vaccine isn't great at preventing transmission of the virus. It's great however at reducing symptoms and the chances of a severe case or death.  So, if you're just as like to transmit or catch covid whether you're vaccinated or not, then why the sudden aggressive concern about the health and well being of the unvaccinated.  Is it because early on we were misled to believe that being vaccinated could slow and potentially stop the spread? Then, suddenly when that was determined to be bullshit you idiots continued to grasp the narrative that being unvaccinated is a danger to everyone. When in reality it's a danger to the person who is unvaccinated.  Why do you suddenly and aggressively care if they get vaccinated when it can't prevent transmission. If you are THAT afraid of a serious case of this virus, then go get vaccinated and fuck off with shit talking those who don't. Befause being vaccinated helps YOU AND ONLY YOU. Not anyone else, the faster you idiots can grasp this the faster you can just shut up.	1640900570.0	hqllo5r	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqkv79d	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqllo5r/

4csdwh86	You are misinformed.   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report on Oct. 29, 2021, that says getting vaccinated for the coronavirus when you’ve already had COVID-19 significantly enhances your immune protection and **further reduces your risk of reinfection**. Link below.  A study published in August 2021 in the national library of medicine indicates that if you had COVID-19 before and are not vaccinated, your risk of getting re-infected is **more than two times higher** than for those who got vaccinated after having COVID-19. Link below.  Another study published on Nov. 5, 2021, by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked at adults hospitalized for COVID-like sickness between January and September 2021. This study found that the chances of these adults testing positive for COVID-19 were 5.49 times higher in unvaccinated people who had COVID-19 in the past than they were for those who had been vaccinated for COVID and had not had an infection before.

41zh15ba	If they want to kill the remaining value of public education, this is probably the way to do it.   Conversely, I teach regular ed classes. I don’t grade homework and I accept work basically all quarter because I have realized that way too many students won’t do the assignment on time due to more factors than I care to go into and they won’t learn it if they won’t do the work. This is just the population I teach. It isn’t ideal. It is just what I am working with. The kids need to pass the class and their end of the year test to graduate, so I try to make as many opportunities available to them as I can so they can do that.  I absolutely would not teach an honors, elective, or advanced class with this many accommodations. Many still would argue I shouldn’t. I do have good pass rates, and I know my students learn the material and are prepared for the next level. I don’t know if I am doing them more of a disservice by accepting late work and not requiring homework or not. I do know I am doing them a disservice if they don’t pass that test. If they haven’t learned to turn in work on time yet, I don’t know that creating harsh penalties in my class would do it.   If my school required a late policy, I would abide, and if the school took a harder stance overall about commitments, I would be on board.  As it stands, all the powers that be only want to know what it will take to get them to the next level. Fortunately, I have a test where I can say, they need to do the work to understand and pass.   This is the benefit of standardized testing. I think we should have less of it, but we need it. ESPECIALLY, if as a system we are going to start letting kids every life circumstance dictate every teaching decision.	1640900775.0	hqlm6vj	t3_rsc4sc	t3_rsc4sc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsc4sc/in_the_name_of_equity_virginia_county_wants_to/hqlm6vj/

I think the problem with many of those schools is they are with their peers and they are in the same socioeconomic situation. I don’t necessarily disagree with vouchers because it would mix kids up a bit, but I don’t think that magically those kids are necessarily going to just start performing due to their education. It would just allow them to access their education in a different environment away from their peers.	1640901330.0	hqlnlyr	t3_rsc4sc	t1_hqlm67j	/r/Conservative/comments/rsc4sc/in_the_name_of_equity_virginia_county_wants_to/hqlnlyr/

I understand your perspective and depending on the circumstances I can agree with it. But in some cases, like exposing children to anything remotely sexual like those kinks depicted, I would have to disagree.   Just because we arent directly affected by something doesnt mean we shouldnt care.  Those kids could be feeling incredibly uncomfortable for all we know. We should care about such things even if it doesnt directly affect us.	1640901426.0	hqlnurt	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqjnbqu	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqlnurt/

But I believe what I see, and what I saw was the mainstream media and social media moguls running a smear and defamation campaign on Trump for 4 long years, from the instant he stepped in they did everything they could to sway public opinion about him and drive as many people as they could to believing he was evil and to hate him.  I don't believe it changed every single persons mind but it definitely worked in swaying public opinion enough to garner Biden the votes he needed to win.  That much you can see without even having to try, unless you lived under a rock you were hearing negative publicity about Trump for four long years pretty much round the clock. He cheated, he worked with Russia, he hates women, he's a racist. His integrity was pummeled around every single corner and that man couldn't breathe without it being taken out of context to be used against him.	1640901566.0	hqlo7cs	t3_rsb7fw	t3_rsb7fw	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqlo7cs/
10gww4z9	The path to a Greater Idaho is clear, the likelihood is low, even if both Legislatures and Congress were to agree.     As a resident, I generally support the idea, but the details will be messy.  As a single example, Idaho lawmakers are mostly radically opposed to any kind of marijuana legalization; will the growers in Jackson and Siskiyou counties be willing to give up on their produce for better political representation?  I am dubious.	1640901585.0	hqlo92o	t3_rs3r7j	t3_rs3r7j	/r/Conservative/comments/rs3r7j/will_disgust_with_portland_lead_to_the_creation/hqlo92o/

x8qkk	The definition was directly from the CDC, but you keep shilling for big pharma and government overreach as much as you like. These shots are a flu shot at best, something you get once a year. Oh wait they are not as effective as the flu shot as you need what now 2 or 3 boosters in a year for it to remain effective? Yet thanks to changing the definition flu shots are now also considered vaccines as well as that stupid hiv/aids pill that does nothing to prevent hiv/aids LOL!   And yes I have received the covid shot, spent 6 days in the hospital 4hrs after receiving the shot, but according to you science deniers and big pharma shills people like me don't exist and no one has been hurt by these shots and continue to push the big lie they are 100% safe, but hey, maybe I am just still a bit bitter from the experience.	1640901635.0	hqlodp4	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqjz98t	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqlodp4/

3m74uvkf	"Getting sick" and "not getting the virus" are two completely different things. The public was told that they "would not get COVID" if they got the vaccine. Not only are the vaccinated getting COVID, they're spreading it to others. That's completely different from what we were told.  In my case: I'm young (36), health, and physically fit. I already got COVID and recovered at home without an issue. As a concerned citizen, the moment I felt ill, I took appropriate precautions (wore a mask and distanced) until I was diagnosed, then masked and distance home so I could quarantine for the prescribed period of time, which I did.  It's possible that, in my case, the vaccine would present just as much a risk to my health than it would protect me from COVID.

6beu26xa	It's interesting to me. Personally I don't really have any problem with trans people, you can do whatever you want to at the end of the day. But it's a bit ridiculous to insist that everyone has to think it's always a good thing and that we're expected to just believe that there is no difference between men and women because that's what the activists say.  That being said it seems like a mental disorder as much as anything else. Is it really a great idea to be encouraging people to do all these things while they're not necessarily in their right mind? The majority of trans & 'non binary' people I've met in real life will openly admit to having issues like borderline personality disorder, bipolar or depression. It would seem that we should encourage people to go to therapy and really think critically about what they're doing before taking such drastic medical action. I truly hope people don't regret their transition in 10/20 years, that would be pretty fucked. Especially kids who are getting these treatments.	1640902700.0	hqlr0rg	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqjvvru	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqlr0rg/

No opinion of either candidate being offered here, just penned the original comment to try and make the point that neither side seems to hold "being the bigger person" in high regard anymore. When Trump came into office, the conservative mantra was anywhere between "Respect the office, even if you don't respect the individual" to "He's the President, DEAL WITH IT!".  Fast forward to 2020 and our Political Memory Loss Syndrome has reduced to us to no better than the other side.

c87yy	Can you explain why the death toll score board disappeared from all major media when Biden took office?  Shouldn't it still be there considering more people died under Biden than Trump?  Shouldn't that cause a critical thinker to question the governments response as a failure?  Would it cause a critical thinker to wonder what else the government has been dishonest about?  How many of Trump's other predictions have come true?  Did he make this assessment before the evidence of this being a bioweapon became available?    Did Trump's prediction that Bidens economic policies would be a disaster come true?  Did Trump's prediction that Bidens shut down the virus bloviation would fail miserably?  Pretty much all of Trump's predictions of the failure that would be a Biden presidency have come true in less than a year.

1239va	 I was taught about childbirth and using protection in middle school by my science teacher, in those cases I think it's fine to discuss that kind of stuff. Some might also prefer if parents were the ones who explicitly discussed that stuff with their kids, but I dont think either of my parents wanted to. The point is, I think those topics should be discussed eventually when they reach a certain age, since being too protective can negatively impact them as well. So I agree with what youve said to some extent.   But in the cases of having highly sexualized parades or people openly displaying their kinks around kids, I dont think those things should be acceptable. I wouldnt want to see other people's kinks in public generally, but whatever people do in private is none of my business. Of course, if they were committing acts of rape or murder on other people in private, that would be different.   The bottom line is that I dont care what people get off to behind closed doors, I just dont want to see it in public or around kids.	1640902860.0	hqlrf39	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqlohg4	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqlrf39/

And unlike other things that divide people in the United States that are essentially petty differences, this one is pretty clearly demarcated along a good and evil axis. So long as the type of person that is pro-mandate exists, it's pointless to make any "both sides are bad, bro" comparisons. I could've agreed pre-vaccine (although I was getting suspicious during "the summer of love") but at this point you have to be willfully ignorant to think there is any overcoming the divide without utterly destroying the people who think they can exclude vast swaths of people from living their lives because it would make them happy to do so.	1640902951.0	hqlrnbx	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqlmar0	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqlrnbx/

g4qjl	 I'm not picking individual hospital systems. I'm picking census level data from one of the most populous states in the US during the peak period of hospitalizations.  > Africa is a success story, and people are scratching their heads as to how they managed without jabs.   We're really not. This is an old and sick person's disease. Africa isn't known for it's great medical care.  > Idaho is a measly 50% jabbed and still has a vastly lower death rate.  Which is a great example of why county/county state/state comparisons aren't useful. You need to look at one population -- Texas -- and one age group -- old people -- and compare like to like. How are the vaccinated group in that population doing? How are the unvaccinated? Is the distinction contributing to measurable differences? Yes. Is it significant? Yes. Is it the case in other populations or is there a specific bias that would make the examined population an outlier? Turns out this is pretty much the same results hospitals are seeing across the country. Rather, across all western countries.  For every demographic in the US above the age of 30-35, the vaccine lowers your overall risk. Maybe you'd rather face COVID than the potential unknown unknowns of the vaccine and I get that. I'm not getting boosted and I wouldn't have gotten the original if I knew how ineffective it would have been at preventing me from giving it to my grandmother. Especially for people under 50, the chances of COVID hurting you are pretty damn negligible. It doesn't really matter how much you lower your risk of it's already not worth considering. But for those at or over retirement age you're almost certainly making the wrong choice if you don't get vaccinated because COVID is uncomfortably dangerous to them and the risk reduction gained from vaccination is massive.	1640903094.0	hqlrzxo	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqlfq3c	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqlrzxo/

4j5lv	All true. I sias the same thing after Obama’s run. The Dems didn’t want to work with Trump the same way the tea party GOP at the time didn’t want to work with Obama. They even got Boehner kicked out because he was working with the president l. Fast forward to now, and both sides know that the Dems and Reps among the general population are fighting over what seems like sports teams. All while getting away with the bullshit they do. Look at Pelosi’s melted face. She has the Gaul to say she’s part of the solution when she’s just a career politician that is milking her stocks. If we look at the progressives like AOC, it’s too far to one side. It’s polarization at its finest. Meanwhile, the majority of people will usually get along in real life. My neighbors are die hard trump supporters. They have a trump 2024 sign up right now. They’re wonderful people. It’s crazy how years ago, most people didn’t give a shit about politics but now, it’s like sports teams and it’s gross. The ones getting fucked are people like you and I.

ub31w	Easy: over the past 2 years, people have been conditioned to think that the government should have the power to do whatever it takes to "protect public health." Seriously, when it the last time you saw anyone on the left say aby type of restriction was too much. All they have done is dismiss more extreme measures as "conspiracy theories." Last year, the idea of vaccine passports was just far-right paranoia, but no one ever said it was an outright objectionable idea.  So now that people widely accept virtually unrestricted government power in the name of public health, the next task is broadening what constitutes public health.   This quote has been repeated since long befire covid and it remains true: if you allow the government to use emergencies to restrict freedom, they will create new emergencies to restrict freedom.

When they are read, more often than not, they are usually a constitutional over reach, or completely the opposite of the namesake given to them in order to "feel good" about their intentions rather than their proven results, and thus warm the hearts of the unread sheep like masses to state they accomplished something, when in reality, they did nothing of the sort.  They most certainly end in utter failure, but at the cost of everyone.

I’m citing the Virginia governor’s race as to why. I saw some shady activity from the northern counties outside DC while tracking the race online that night. Examples include Fairfax stopped their count just 15 minutes after the polls closed, went dark for an hour, and then reset their vote count; and Loudoun County went 35% red and 65% blue after Daily Wire broke that major school system scandal with the trans raping a 15-year-old girl. A lot of people here were also pissed with CRT and McAullife saying parents aren’t entitled to have input on their kids’ educations.

5hut1de9	I couldn't care if they made a character a different race, sex, or sexual orientation. What makes it annoying is that they can't just be gay, the writers have to make sure that audience knows they're gay and they center the plot around the fact that a character is gay or what ever. Alot of Netflix shows and movies will add a diverse character and weirdly center the plot around that character, even if it doesn't affect the main story. An example of this is in the show "Designated Survivor", Netflix took over the show for it's 3rd season and added a gay, black, milenial charachter to the show, and that addition contributed nothing to the main plot. Only relevant thing about the character was that he was good with social media and had aids.	1640905004.0	hqlwqv7	t3_rsdr6w	t1_hqltfjn	/r/Conservative/comments/rsdr6w/spiderman_star_marisa_tomei_says_she_wanted_her/hqlwqv7/

In fact, staffing in the districts had increased by only 78. *  In another crime-fighting first this autumn, Smith invited her constituents to purchase their very own CPD “blue light” surveillance camera — for $25,000 each.    * After a shooting near the lakefront in the summer of 2019, police banned overnight parking along Cannon Drive near the Lincoln Park Zoo. Three weeks later, Smith boasted of “great results” and said the parking ban resulted in a drop in “serious crime.” But the city’s own data showed no such improvement. *  Faced with community concerns about police staffing levels in 2014, Smith told constituents that her ward was enjoying increased police patrols, “you don’t always see it.” We dubbed them the “invisible police.”	1640906285.0	hqlzv6y	t3_rs4q4t	t3_rs4q4t	/r/Conservative/comments/rs4q4t/chicago_see_a_robbery_happening_this_alderman/hqlzv6y/

4dbsove2	Your reading comprehension skills are not my problem.    I will break points down very concisely for you-if people are willing to post their negative views of this presidency on their lawns to be judged by people they have to interact with IRL they must really fucking hate this guy.  I did not see that with Trump.  The conclusion which takes two brain cells to reach being that the hatred of trump is likely mostly media generated and your average Joe Shmo American, which I’ve seen a lot across the country in person in the last 5 years, is anti-Biden.  That’s the point I think you missed?  My own experience is that I walk with a sign that says “God Save Our Country”.  I have pulled my children from public school to homeschool because I believe the public schools, like all government agencies, are now fundamentally broken.   Whatever.

Trump is probably the most polarizing candidate to run for President ever, which lead to a record voter turnout in the 2020 election for both Republicans and Democrats. The basic fact is that more people were motivated to vote against him than for him. I know people feel very passionately about Donald Trump, but passion is a two way street.	1640906954.0	hqm1hql	t3_rs3pzs	t1_hqlqvk6	/r/Conservative/comments/rs3pzs/this_is_big_wisconsin_committee_on_campaigns_and/hqm1hql/

If I had a controversial agenda to pass, and I needed near-unanimous consent from my party, you know what I'd do?  I'd tell people to ride with me, and I'd take care of them afterwards.    And if polling showed that these actions would diminish that Rep's chance at re-election, I'd cover them more and ask them to bow out before the next election.   That way the Republican isn't going up against an incumbent with a terrible voting record.  They are going up against someone with clean hands.  And if I'm a Democrat who was mad at the incumbent, but still hated Republicans, a fresh face would keep me from voting against the incumbent.

3g3gi	Okay, perhaps we misunderstood each other (or more likely I misunderstood you) at the outset. Because your 2nd graph aligns relatively well my thinking on the matter. The massive stream of incoming data is too much to consume as an individual, but the direction of the sentiment appears to be stepping down further and further the efficacy. It's annoying that I would have to look at informational inertia, but here we are. Is it going to stop? Probably not. The needle is moving south. My guess is the efficacy, at the end of the day, ends up being in the 20-30% range as far as prevention of death which IMO is the important metric. I'm including Omicron and any following (presumably weaker) variants that seem to largely bypass vaccines, bringing the vaxxed and unvaxxed closer together as far as that goes.    One thing I think is crazy, and overlooked at this point is that we're at 55M~ cases in the US, and with ridiculous number of false positives out there I bet it's closer to 45M~ cases. That means that only 13% of the country's actually been infected. Just as an example, I tested positive twice in August, and more recently got a blood-drawn antigen test and have no antibodies. It was likely a summer cold. We still have 75-85% of the country to go potentially.    I'm honestly curious how this will all be viewed in a few years or decades. If we can track down where variants mutated, for example. Would it be a boon to the legacy of the vaccines if they came from the vaccinated? Or the unvaxxed? I bet 10,000 doctorate theses are going to be based on this last 2 years. The amount of data being produced is just phenomenal and unprecendented.	1640908194.0	hqm4hnu	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqlrzxo	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqm4hnu/

It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from *that* strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	1640908745.0	hqm5uos	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hqk47a1	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hqm5uos/

y8nrv	Twice as many jobs were added in the 9 months prior to Biden taking office than the 11 months since.   In the 9 months prior to Biden taking office, the unemployment rate fell from 14.8% to 6.3%, an 8.5% drop. In the 11 months that followed, it fell from 6.2% to 4.2%, a 2% drop.  In the two quarters prior to Biden taking office, GDP posted 33.8% and 4.3% gains, respectively.  Inflation was relatively flat in the last bit of 2020, following small increases in the middle of that year compensating for equal amounts of deflation at the height of the early pandemic period. Since March 2021, the lowest monthly  gain was 0.3%, with an average of 0.7 - x3 times what it was in the several months prior.  After a quick glance at this data from the BEA and BLS, it seems no president in modern history has ever inherited this favorable of economic conditions. Second place is not even close.   Given that Biden’s “analysts” looked over this same data (I would hope) surely they noticed all these numbers before twisting them around.	1640909338.0	hqm7ajm	t3_rsdx7y	t3_rsdx7y	/r/Conservative/comments/rsdx7y/joe_biden_i_have_the_strongest_firstyear_economic/hqm7ajm/

g4qjl	I think it'll probably hold up in terms of prevention of death which remains extremely significant. But the background risk will move from "very little" to "none" and likely make it not necessary for people under 50 to get an annual COVID shot like how we get the flu shot.  > That means that only 13% of the country's actually been infected  I think the opposite. Too many asymptomatic and colds that are COVID but nobody notices let alone tests for. I bet >60% of us have had it at this point. My guess was 5x as many infections as there are test found cases which would actually line up pretty well. Omicron is going to exacerbate this since it's even more mild. This guess isn't data driven unlike the rest of what I was talking about.	1640909562.0	hqm7tol	t3_rrrhih	t1_hqm4hnu	/r/Conservative/comments/rrrhih/seems_like_a_solid_meme/hqm7tol/

gu62f	So I'll just use my own situation as an example. I spent Christmas Eve with family members, and then 2 of them started to feel sick and tested positive on Sunday, they are still pretty sick but getting better. I started feeling sick Monday and went and got a rapid test at a local testing place, the results came back negative later that evening, but I was still pretty sick for a few days, missed work Mon and Tue. It was confusing as to why I would be exposed, feel sick, but still test negative. Especially since I really never really get sick in general, it's been many years since I had any type of cold or anything. So I would have liked to have a couple of those rapid test kits on hand to use over the last day or so, just to confirm my negative or know what is really going on.    Overall, I think having a quick easy way to just confirm that you do or don't have COVID would be helpful for a number of reasons. Not the intrusive "tickle the brain" test, just rubbing the swab around your schnozz a few times and dropping it in the vial thing. If they could be made cheaply and anybody who wanted them could have them on hand, I think it might help people decide for themselves. to maybe go somewhere or be around certain people or to stay home. Less mandates, more control in the hands of people.	1640909793.0	hqm8dld	t3_rs79qh	t1_hqm3mrq	/r/Conservative/comments/rs79qh/covid_test_lines_backed_up_for_miles_as_biden/hqm8dld/

fslhnyd	As per the article posted:   “(A) acts of physical violence against, or harassment of, Muslim people, and acts of violence against, or vandalism of, Muslim community institutions, including schools, mosques, and cemeteries;  “(B) instances of propaganda in government and nongovernment media that attempt to justify or promote racial hatred or incite acts of violence against Muslim people;  “(C) the actions, if any, taken by the government of the country to respond to such violence and attacks or to eliminate such propaganda or incitement;  “(D) the actions taken by such government to enact and enforce laws relating to the protection of the right to religious freedom of Muslim people;  “(E) the efforts of such government to promote anti-bias and tolerance education.  Assuming that this article correctly posted what was in the bill. I don’t think that these statements say you can’t critique Islam/Muslims, nor does it seem like it this is violating someone’s first amendment. You can argue that this might be favoring Islam, and I would argue that this is allowing Islam to be on the same level as Christianity. I’d understand the outrage if this bill was randomly passed, but it wasn’t randomly passed, there is context. It was put up to to vote because there was an active member of Congress spewing anti Muslim statements. I could be wrong, but I am not aware of an acting member of Congress spewing anti Christian statements.   I’m Christian, and if anything the United States favors Christianity over any religion, which in return should violate the first amendment. Christmas is a perfect example. Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, and it also happens to be a federal holiday. If we wanted equal religions, then shouldn’t there be a federal holiday for every religion? Hanukkah, Ramadan, etc.	1640910660.0	hqmafuf	t3_rs8yxq	t1_hqkxepl	/r/Conservative/comments/rs8yxq/ilhan_omar_islamophobia_bill_passed_by_house/hqmafuf/
1wrj7zb	I’m biased? I don’t care for the tens of thousands of elderly who have died at hands of Democrats??? Wow! Listen to yourself man! Seriously..that sounds absolutely sideways. Why would you even say something like that. Sounds like your blaming some democrats for killing old ppl in nursing homes? I thought Covid killed old people in nursing homes.. Aren’t Republicans generally against requiring precautions to protect those elderly? Not sure what you’re referring to.. Back to my point….  I’m just trying to figure out how so many people can completely disregard the straight up data and statistics that are generated by the CDC’s Covid 19 database.. sure there’s situational loop holes that ppl are going to argue about, but the numbers are what they are. They’re real and they tell a truth that many people would rather ignore than accept. I’m going to copy paste some straight up facts about the hospitalization rates of vaxed / unvaxed.. these are published on the below linked CDC webpage. Note that this data is not from any media company , but from the CDC..   https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination  “Summary - For all adults aged 18 years and older, the cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate was about 8 times higher in unvaccinated persons. - Although weekly rates can vary, the cumulative rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in unvaccinated adolescents ages 12-17 years was about 10 times higher than fully vaccinated adolescents aged 12-17 years. - Although weekly rates can vary, the cumulative rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in unvaccinated adults ages 18-49 years was about 12 times higher than fully vaccinated adults aged 18-49 years. - Although weekly rates can vary widely, the cumulative rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in unvaccinated adults ages 50-64 years was about 10 times higher than fully vaccinated adults aged 50-64 years. - Although weekly rates can vary widely, the cumulative rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in unvaccinated adults ages 65 years and older was about 6 times higher than fully vaccinated adults ages 65 years and older.”  Case in point - this is reliable accurate information that cannot be called fake because it’s very much based on real data. You can Argue the process all you want to. Argue how the case counts are skewed bc Hillary still has the emails., tell me how the numbers are off bc of all the missed cases that people don’t report.. there’s a million different ways to try and skew this, but no one can deny the fact that this data and these statistics are collectively based off real world documented cases. Through math and science, we can prove that not being vaccinated directly corresponds to a higher chance of being hospitalized and/or death. I would ask if y’all agree but it doesn’t matter if anyone agrees. It’s the facts and that’s what they are. Just  Information based on real true data. Bury your head in the sand if you want to, but if you do, please stop complaining about how Biden still hasn’t eradicated Covid while you are deliberately trying to ignore the most plausible proven methods to move past it.

x4392	The Israeli government has approved a second COVID-19 vaccine booster shot for people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients.  It comes after the country’s Pandemic Expert Committee last week recommended the fourth shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for immunocompromised people, people older than 60, and health care workers.  “Today, I approved giving the fourth vaccine to the immunosuppressed, sick people with diseases and treatments that are hurting the immune system,” Nachman Ash, director general of the Israeli Health Ministry, told a news conference on Thursday.  “I did this based on research that is showing the benefits of the vaccine, including the fourth vaccine, for that population, and in light of the concerns that they are more vulnerable to the outburst of [the Omicron variant]. We will continue to track the data on a daily basis and we will see if we need to broaden this recommendation to an additional population,” he added.  The Israeli government has yet to announce an approval of a 4th COVID-19 vaccine dose for those over age 60 and health care workers.  “In light of the existing gaps in knowledge in the world about the effectiveness of a fourth dose, in the present situation, we are acting cautiously and responsibly,” Ash said on Thursday. “If we see signs showing severe illness is expected to rise among the older populations then we will make that decision. The challenge is to make it early enough to vaccinate them in time.”  On Monday, an Israeli hospital—the Sheba Medical Center—administered the second booster shots—the fourth COVID-19 vaccine shots—to a test group of health workers, in what it called the first major study into whether another round of boosters will aid against the Omicron coronavirus variant. Results are expected within two weeks. The “second booster” trial involves 150 people with low antibody levels.  Israel was among the first countries in the world to introduce a COVID-19 vaccine for the public, and began freely offering boosters last summer after research suggested that immunity waned over time.  The country was also among the first in the world to introduce vaccine passports and mandatory vaccinations.  Despite widespread vaccination, Israel experienced a wave of COVID-19 cases attributed to the Delta variant. Officials are warning of another wave, this time driven by the Omicron variant.  Israel has largely relied on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in its public rollout, until about August, when it largely pivoted to the Moderna vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine is still being administered to those under 18 because the Moderna vaccine has not yet been approved for them. The Pfizer vaccine is also being administered to people waiting on their second COVID-19 dose.  Israeli authorities previously announced on Nov. 15 that children aged 5–11 would be eligible for the weaker dosing of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine—coming just a week after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the pediatric shot for broad use in that age group.  Earlier Thursday, Israel received its first shipment of Pfizer’s anti-COVID-19 pills, Paxlovid. The pills are intended to be used at home to decrease hospitalization and death, and they will be available in the country for free to those in high-risk groups.	1640910932.0	hqmb2r1	t3_rsgt16	t3_rsgt16	/r/Conservative/comments/rsgt16/israel_approves_4th_covid19_vaccine_dose_to/hqmb2r1/

fslhnyd	I agree mostly with this statement, and I think it should be added as amendment. I think this should apply for the executive office, and the line of succession (vice, speaker, etc). As well as the judicial branch, and for the senate. However, I don’t think it should apply to the House. I view the house as a representative of the people, whereas the senate is more a representative of the state as a whole. I’m sure there are districts in the United States where the vast majority of its population are immigrants. I think they should be entitled to vote for someone who they believe would accurately represent them, regardless of where they were born.	1640911267.0	hqmbw4h	t3_rs8yxq	t1_hql3ghv	/r/Conservative/comments/rs8yxq/ilhan_omar_islamophobia_bill_passed_by_house/hqmbw4h/

It has been going on as long as I can remember, and has only gotten worse over the decades.

15s2jz	We can be honest about disliking people or legislation on their face without making things up. This bill established an office under the State Department like the one we already have for antisemitism, with the purpose of studying the listed "wrongs" against Islam “(1) Monitoring and combating acts of Islamophobia and Islamophobic incitement that occur in foreign countries" is the first duty of the department.  If you look at the one for Antisemitism, I guess you can see what her goal is. I don't support the bad parts of Islam that are well established, but I'm also not one to hate people because of their religion. I don't see the need for outrage her, we should be in favor of not supporting any country that does things against our core values, be it religious freedom, freedom of speech, democracy, etc. Here's the antisemitism office link for reference. https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-civilian-security-democracy-and-human-rights/office-of-the-special-envoy-to-monitor-and-combat-antisemitism/  It's annoying to get down voted for actually reading source material and not any news outlets.	1640911625.0	hqmcqpa	t3_rs8yxq	t1_hqmb2du	/r/Conservative/comments/rs8yxq/ilhan_omar_islamophobia_bill_passed_by_house/hqmcqpa/

You ignore everything we say, group us in with sex criminals, and then act like you never did anything wrong!  Maybe instead of just grouping marginalized people in with perverts and trying to knock them both off, work with the marginalized people and help them separate themselves from that gross shit! You see, it's not hard to use common sense and actually work with people regardless of political opinion  It's like when you conservatives try to use the excuse "well if we accept them, then we'd have to accept pedophiles!", no, you wouldnt!!

Also, when viruses mutate they don’t become a completely different virus. They are still very similar to the original virus, with a few subtle differences. Your body is absolutely able to identify it.   That’s why if you get sick, but have a vaccine for that virus, your symptoms are much less severe. The vaccination didn’t work, because you got sick, but it works well enough for your body to recognize, and attack the virus. Even if the virus is slightly different than the vaccine you received.	1640912931.0	hqmfr8o	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hqm5uos	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hqmfr8o/

b4z0doo2	At the root it's about sex.  No one would care if two men or two women lived together platonically, it's when they want to have sex outside the bounds of what is biologically normal that the issues arise.    Homosexuality literally has it in the word.  It's about sex and the fact that it's different.  You want to be able to celebrate that you have sex different than everyone else.  You may add on other themes and elements but without the man/man woman/woman sex there would be no pride movement.	1640913232.0	hqmgfu4	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqm7bco	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqmgfu4/

9b236nyx	It was far from this intense, but even then, the principle reason for the divide remains the same - the left's inability to live and let live. For example, if a red state makes a democratic vote to ban abortion (which I think is stupid, but that's not the point), anyone who disagrees is free to leave, right? Yet for the left, this is intolerable. They *must* absolutely crush any way of living that they disagree with, even if they are in another area of the country and it doesn't have any impact on them. Its main manifestation now is over vaccine mandates, but it has been abortion, guns, marijuana, policing, etc. Literally anything you can think of, they believe in using the force of the government to make people comply nationwide to their view. They're moral crusaders who believe they have the absolute authority to decide what is moral and what is not and then force everyone to agree, *or else*.

It seems highly improbable that they would create a whole new system of monitoring when there is already an antisemitism equivalent.

That is, if Facebook were in charge of surveillance, and not beaurocrats, we'd be in a world of shit!

1pki	That's basically it. Look, I understand the quasi-academic stances that place layers and layers of defense around crime in Chicago. We all understand the realities of systemic racism, and the horrific snowball of kids growing up in a violent home and then having kids of their own. But, simply academically understanding the problem isn't a solution. Solutions require adhering to reality. And reality is messy, and often unfair. If someone violently breaks into my home, academic understanding goes out the fucking window no matter how liberal/idealistic I may or may not be. Do you know the biggest driver that makes liberals like myself less idealistic? Having children of your own. You quickly start thinking about the innocent in your care and have less time to be an arm chair revolutionary.	1640914929.0	hqmk7ov	t3_rs4q4t	t1_hqkck79	/r/Conservative/comments/rs4q4t/chicago_see_a_robbery_happening_this_alderman/hqmk7ov/

17922t5s	Parts of American society just spent an election year making massive changes to our election system with complete disregard for other people’s confidence in it. What else did anyone expect would happen? It’s not like it is going to get better, either, not with how little some people still care about having a system that inspires broad confidence. Sadly, the GOP did not actually help here, not by refusing to make popular and safe adjustments to the system, not by failing to fight the narrative that the GOP is a white party, and not by claiming up and down that Trump won.   The GOP is too tied to the wants and feelings of its base and it could actually win if it would just focus on the important stuff that more people agree with. Republicans keep chasing the way they want things to be and keeps failing to deal with things as they are. That’s not very conservative, and that makes it hard to sell itself as the more mature and pragmatic party. The republicans were not flexible enough last year.	1640915044.0	hqmkgub	t3_rsb7fw	t3_rsb7fw	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqmkgub/

8o9oxey1	Heterosexual and heterosexuality are the formal terms for straight relationships, and also has the word sexual in it lol.  You have a biased opinion, and ultimately a wrong stance on this because the first thing most people think about when they see a married couple isn’t (or it shouldn’t be, anyways) about the sex this couple must be having as a result of their coupling. Society’s view on marriage is usually just an overall acknowledgement of a couple’s commitment to each other and recognition of their relationship with regards to financial and familial matters.  If you automatically start thinking about all the sex a homosexual/homosexual couple is having off of first glance, that says a lot more about you than it does about their simply existing in your presence lol. Pride need not be intertwined in one’s mind as being a celebration that is inherently sexual in nature, as it is moreso a vehicle to further public awareness of LGBT history in the US, and to increase acceptance of LGBT individuals and gay rights.  Yes, Pride *could* be diminished to being about homosexual sexual behavior at its core, but you’d look pedantic and overly interested in “deviant” sexual behavior at that point.	1640915564.0	hqmlmk6	t3_rrszg3	t1_hqmgfu4	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqmlmk6/

41zh15ba	There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	1640915594.0	hqmloyy	t3_rsb7fw	t1_hqmjhlc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqmloyy/
cibaa9mt	Absolutely.   My argument is that I bet it would fucking hurt for everyone to be making this about her transgender identity and she didn't do that. Other people are doing that to her.  When a trans person thrusts themselves into a situation (like dominating weight lifting or swimming or cycling) where they have an advantage due to their trans identity, it is fair for people to critique it. I think those trans women are awful fucking human beings when they ruin those sports. Genuinely. I think they deserve MORE scorn because they are selfish pieces of shit for doing what the do.   A trans person who loves to swim, deciding to stand on a podium to be a champion "female" swimmer when they biologically are not deserves the flack that comes from discussing their "achievement." Fuck them.  A trans person who is good at trivia, winning some money on an even playing field, does not deserve flack because the achievement is legit. No scare quotes around this person's accomplishment due to their trans identity.	1640915605.0	hqmlps5	t3_rsfan4	t1_hqmhpt6	/r/Conservative/comments/rsfan4/not_woman_breaks_jeopardy_record_proving_once_and/hqmlps5/

It's not a personality trait you dipshit, furthermore there's more than just LGB, if you are part of the community then you're literally a hypocritical sellout.   Being part of the LGBTQ isn't a personality trait, it's being part of a community and banding together to help one another. But I guess you wouldn't know that since you'd rather sell out everyone else to "fit in" with people you agree with. Maybe if you actually spent time working with, getting to know, and helping others in the community you wouldn't just assume they're all perverts and treat them like shit you conceited asshat.  We may disagree politically, but unlike you I'm willing to set aside policy issues to deal with and find solutions to real problems like these. Meanwhile you're sitting here throwing everyone under the bus and calling them all pedophiles for the actions of a few perverted people.

But...As a white, Jewish, 49yo heterosexual male who only has been married to one woman, i feel like I epitomize everything that is wrong with this world from Omar's point of view.   As a former refugee and now an American citizen i am eternally grateful to a country that gave me and my family a chance for a prosperous future. A chance that my wife and i eagerly took. I worked a few jobs while in college, she worked a few jobs and graduated law school. I think we did ok for ourselves and now our oldest is about to graduate law school so believe our kids will be ok too. Omar also did great for herself, by doing what she did (whatever the fck it was) and becoming a member of the House. So why do we see the US so differently? Why do we see it as a country that didn't have to do anything for us and yet gave us so much and she looks at it as a cow that should be milked for more and more benefits without a shred of loyalty on her part?

The election was not legitimate due to election rules changes done by democratic governors and bureaucrats that were illegal and done months before a major election. And to further compound the unethical action their mega donors, as if planned, launched a massive campaign with the new changes sanitizing ballots in Democratic voting areas *only*.  Yes the number of ballots sanitized greatly exceed Biden's margins of victory in every single swing state that he won. Everyone. Democrats defense for this? "Well Republicans could have done it too!"

You would climb out of the uncontrollable semi while it was moving while scaling along the side of it after which you would make your way using under the truck and fix the brakes using only duct tape and gum and then climb back into the semi and pull over safely after which a crowd will be their to cheer for you and the governor of Colorado would then hand you a golden key to the state and a statue off marble will be made in your image.

16jfj3	So the vaccinated can catch and spread covid yet somehow its only the unvaccianated who are at fault, which by your logic would include those "at risk" groups you referenced. Although young children are by far the least at risk group on the planet. Just look at the numbers. The hilarious part is you're blaming me under the assumption that I'm unvaccinated. So when you're blaming me you're actually blaming the vaccinated, but i guess not technically fully vaccinated because of the whole goalpost moving situation. I said what I'm experiencing is no cause for a vaccine mandate. You've taken that and spun it in your head into I'm OK so covid isn't real, which I've never said. By the way you communicate its clear you've been brainwashed and radicalized by the covid nazis on the left.

I think everyone would agree that if the world's mouths stayed far away from each other for 2 weeks, the virus would disappear. But that's not possible, so they are trying to simulate that with masks and social distancing. Makes sense. Masks have been used for this purpose for long work days in hospitals for centuries. Long before n95s.  But mandates? In theory it would help, if it helped. But I'm not 100% convinced that it's helping.  We'll know more when we have larger samples of data. Right now comparing 2 states that have drastically different mandates, density, and weather, with a virus that has massive geographical epps and flows - I personally wouldn't use it as reliable data.

bcwsh	As a first-generation immigrant who was born and raised in a Muslim country and who became a refugee leaving behind everything my family owned I feel like I should be a rabid Omars supporter and should be supported by her 100%. But...As a white, Jewish, 49yo heterosexual male who only has been married to one woman, I feel like I epitomize everything that is wrong with this world from Omar's point of view.        As a former refugee and now an American citizen i am eternally grateful to a country that gave me and my family a chance for a prosperous future. A chance that my wife and i eagerly took. I worked a few jobs while in college, she worked a few jobs and graduated law school. I think we did ok for ourselves and now our oldest is about to graduate law school so I believe our kids will be ok too. Omar also did great for herself, by doing what she did (whatever the fck it was) and becoming a member of the House. So why do we see the US so differently? Why do we see it as a country that didn't have to do anything for us and yet gave us so much and she looks at it as a cow that should be milked for more and more benefits without a shred of loyalty on her part?

Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies.

1wrj7zb	You’re literally regurgitating far right conspiracy theories and unproven facts about all sorts of stuff, frankly, it’s hard to keep straight which right wing extremist imitation Alex Jones Qtubers said what and when. I mean they keep moving the goalposts. I never heard what ultimately happened to the Pillow Guys holiday massacre. Didn’t he have a big announcement or something?. Wasn’t there suppose to be a new president by now, and why hasn’t trump reclaimed the iron throne yet? Why isn’t Hillary and Obama locked up in Guantanamo bay yet?  Where are the emails? Where’s Brandon!? These crazy crazy ideas! Like blaming biden for alll the missing children who were smuggled to underground lairs where dems sell them into sex slavery and harvest their adrenachrome?  Ive always disregarded these points as fiction so i haven’t been following the latest drama all that well..  any updates would be much appreciated.   Back to the point though.. I look forward to the day that everyone, recognizes this problem as a global issue void of political party or affiliation. It really shouldn’t be this way! We all should be doing everything in our power to move past this as quickly as possible, but for a long list of reasons people are convinced it’s a political issue when it’s absolutely not that at all! The vax push is not political because it’s proven to save lives. the fact that people are dying of Covid against their will is not political, it’s a fact with actual faces and people behind the numbers. The fact that news and entertainment companies within our own country, deliberately feed each of us more and more curated content via social media, this is a truth that no one knows what to do with. It’s not healthy that’s for sure, and it’s further reason why I fear for the future. Because we don’t go searching for news anymore, the news finds us.    You can talk about all the hypotheticals you want. Claim the dems are trying to destroy the world, but at the end of the day, someone’s got to get it thru to the people at fox that the virus, the vaccines, and the insistence on using safety measures to end the pandemic as soon as possible, this is the single most important responsibility of our generation. If you want to use this turning point to look up conspiracies and join the right wing extremist resistance, than that’s how you will be remembered. People change, but facts don’t. Put down the info wars and subscribe to reality. If you believe in God, then do what Jesus would do. Get a shot and wear a mask. If you don’t, then do what’s right for the stranger you may encounter tomorrow or the next day. get a shot and wear a mask. And if you just believe in yourself and no one else, then please just stop commenting bc your holding up a return to normal otherwise.	1640917067.0	hqmoy4r	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqlrc0q	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqmoy4r/

It over simplifies the allegory they're trying to portray (climate change).  They're acting like reversing climate change is risk free and can have no negative effects. However anyone with half a brain knows that's not true.   A more accurate allegory would be scientist says we're all going to die in 6 months. 6 months  comes and goes yet nothing happens. Scientist says actuallyyy it's 6 months from NOW. Right wingers ask if she actually knows what she's talking about. Left wingers lose their shit and cancel/silence any right winger who criticizes her, because you have to TrUsT ThE sCiEnCe.  It also doesn't address the issue of over reacting to the issue at hand and ruining the world, where not acting at all would have been a better outcome.

a26mvghj	At this point I think that base just simply doesn’t care. They are brain dead MSM followers. I know people who are far left and I’ll post info/articles that disprove older MSM headlines. They don’t care. They refuse to read them and stick to their guns. A perfect example is that Comey is on record saying they knew the Russian collusion narrative was a hoax the whole time and funded by the Clinton campaign. He said this in front of a judiciary committee. The left clung to Russian collusion for 4 years. Many of the articles have since been redacted but done so quietly. I’ve directly challenged people I know with this info and they deny it and still spew Russian collusion nonsense. Trump said Puerto Rican officials were corrupt and not doing what they were supposed to after a big storm a couple years ago. Remember the outrage and wall to wall coverage bashing Trump for those words? Well those same Puerto Rican officials later fell under federal indictment for taking bribes and fraud. The list is endless and the willful ignorance is sad and pathetic. These people on the left know they have been lied to. But instead of standing up for it and admitting fault they just double down on stupidity.	1640917661.0	hqmq9pu	t3_rsgi4h	t1_hqmp8b5	/r/Conservative/comments/rsgi4h/flashback_desantis_got_factchecked_for_predicting/hqmq9pu/

94t8u	You miss my point on the injection. Injecting into muscle is far different into a vein. Injecting into the muscle ensures little gets into bloodstream.   Nothing of the vaccine remains in your system. Therefore, risks for long term side effects are extremely low. Vaccines historically have side effects front loaded. Switching to instructions to make one protein should be no different.   If damage had already happened due to just spike, it would have been observed by now. Proteins are not heavy metals.   If you already had the virus, you have already been exposed to spike. Being exposed to spike again is not a totally new toxic. The vaccine for people who already had covid the vaccine acts as a booster.   With as inflectious Omicron is, odds are extremely good you will be exposed to the virus. If you want to minimize your risk of hospitalized and long form covid, the best thing to do is get vaccinated.   Even if the vaccines were 10x risker than they are, I would still tell everyone get vaccinated.	1640919062.0	hqmtc8k	t3_rpyxr6	t1_hqlmf4m	/r/Conservative/comments/rpyxr6/49yearold_ny_times_editor_dies_less_than_a_day/hqmtc8k/

22stnpor	The hysterical fear that does not line up with their actions is the thing that really gets me.  My mom likes to travel around the area going to concerts which she has been doing freely since she got vaccinated. Which is think is great! What is not great is that once my Dad got it from her and now I have to quarantine from them(which considering the situation I think is an appropriate way to isolate ourselves) she tells me that they are taking it very seriously. Why is it serious now? Why wasn't it being taken seriously when you were traveling around going to concerts?  At the very least all of the reasons that I gave her as to why I didn't think I needed to take whatever the risk of a booster shot has proven to be true.  I'm kinda pissed about how this is being handled at the moment. I have to miss ten days of work when I only would have missed one day of work of COVID wasn't a thing. Both of my parents also got over covid in a couple of days.  I have basically been watching TV for the last four days and I am going to go insane.	1640919181.0	hqmtle7	t3_rsgxe5	t1_hqmqp0z	/r/Conservative/comments/rsgxe5/james_bovard_airtravel_vax_mandate_will_not_do/hqmtle7/

3g3gi	> I think the opposite. Too many asymptomatic and colds that are COVID but nobody notices let alone tests for.  Distinct possibility.    I just know so many damned people who've gotten positives because they test like 1-2 times a week and had no symptoms, so who knows what that was. I myself had two positive tests (asymptomatic) because I have to for work, and then 2 months later had nothing on a blood antigen test. Anecdotal for sure, but my 3 housemates also tested positive at the same time. That's six likely false positives in one single household.    >the background risk will move from "very little" to "none" and likely make it not necessary for people under 50 to get an annual COVID shot like how we get the flu shot.

5jfgw8wb	Isreal was established by the British who were charged with Syrian-Palestine rule after WW1. Due to growing antisemitism across Europe zionists approached the Rothschild family and began pushing for a Jewish ethno-state to be established. The British parliament agreed and a plan was put into motion to divide Syrian-Palestine among the Jews and Muslims establishing two separate ethno-states.    Ultimately the Jews agreed to territorial plans but the Muslims feeling like they were being pushed out of their homes to make room for the Jews didn’t go over well…. You’d have to think about what it would feel like if the government enacted eminent domain on a large swath of land in your area to establish an ethnically homogeneous state and destroyed your community without so much as notice.   The British then backed it with military force pushing Muslims from their homes which started upheaval among other Muslim nations over what they viewed as human rights violations and ethnic cleansing of Syrian-Palestine.   The British eventually realizing that they had screwed the pooch on the situation ceded control of the region to the UN. After a bit of time and territorial disputes going nowhere the USA pushed for the National recognition of Israel…. The recognition of Palestine as a Nation didn’t happen with it and it sparked an invasion of Israel by 7 Muslim nations which was quelled by the USA and Britain.   The war of 7 nations only worked as a catalyst to push Muslims out of Israel and Jews into it, displacing over 100,000 people.   Palestine has yet to be recognized as an individual nation and Muslims in the area are living in horrific conditions under the Israeli control of the region.   They’ve been practically living under lockdown since the 30s….   That’s partially their own fault for putting themselves in a Mexican standoff over territory, but both sides are extremely racist towards each other pushing ethnicity based propaganda and historical education.   Both sides would like nothing more than to go full Holocaust on each other…	1640919650.0	hqmul6r	t3_rscxqv	t1_hqmpdzi	/r/Conservative/comments/rscxqv/ocasiocortez_staffer_calls_israel_a_racist/hqmul6r/

x5d3h	When you had 6+ months to change voting laws for an election you knew was coming up and a virus you knew wasn't going away, but didn't do it and unilaterally decided to change them without going through the legislature, that's not a legitimate election.  It's not even a question, and the Supreme Court should have taken the case and disenfranchised voters, because the voters elected someone who did that to them. Unfortunate but how it should have been.

5xpfs	I think that is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the political parties represent. Both Democrats and Republicans are *coalitions* of a wide range of ideologies and beliefs. Those who are "Republican" are likely not supporting a number of positions that the coalition states as a part of its party platform.  You will never find a politician or political party that 100% matches you on your political positions. It just won't happen. So every voter must decide what political priorities they find the most important, and then join the coalition that best represents those positions. So for instance maybe you are on the left when it comes to abortion, but you truly don't care about the topic at all. While at the same time you want to see a smaller federal government with lower taxes. You would have a no brainer choice to register as a Republican. As the issue you align with the left on is not something you care about.	1640919988.0	hqmvao0	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hql5tze	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqmvao0/

b9epe	Listen, you seem like a nice guy, so I’ll let you know how things work around here. You’re going to get absolutely downvoted into oblivion for trying to push the way you feel about covid 19 vaccination in this sub. I can tell by reading your comments that you don’t normally comment here, and are probably going to be banned with the way you comment. This isn’t like the liberal echo chambers. We will call you out for being off key with the way you say things. Presentation is key a lot of the time, and when you come off angry, accusatory, and just overall pompous by gazing down your nose and saying things like “people like you” with such hate and purpose in your rhetoric, you’re going to get the kind of shit storm you’ve got in your inbox now.  Now, thats a real sad story you’ve brought up. It’s a shame most of us have had covid or know someone who’s had covid, and our experiences are mostly drastically different. For most people, this is a cold and nothing more. Your fear is manufactured by the media and you need to focus on something else for sometime. And direct your anger to something productive. It’s arguable that commenting the way you have in oppositional subreddits for the sake of sparking an argument is destructive behavior, and you should take a step back and consider seeking professional help if you continue to feel the deep emotions of rage and hate you seem to harbor at this moment in time.

If we define safe as low risk of the people having to combat an oppressive federal government, I'd say no, it is not safer. The current administration is assaulting the country with bad policy that has led to unnecessarily high inflation, increased crime, supply shortages, etc. They have demonstrated more interest in assisting illegal immigrants than American citizens.

1wrj7zb	Man I gotta argue that you’re wrong on a few points, but I’ll just stick with one. The vaccine is not about you and you only. It’s about improving your body’s chance to fend off infection so that you can reduce or possibly avoid infecting others. That’s the problem is that everyone thinks about me Me me when it’s not about that at all. It takes a collective effort by majority of society to get vaccinated and choke out viable host for the virus to spread, at least that is my understanding about the epidemiology of pandemics. If you think it’s a choice about yourself then you need to keep reading the CDC’s promotional arguments for getting vaxed bc it’s actually the most unselfish thing to do for your family, friends, co workers, or other ppl you encounter. I got the virus and did my ten days in the hole. It sucked but I was fine. It’s not about me at all.   Your Horse blinders are working well, but I recommend genuinely looking at it from a vaccinated persons point of view. It’s not all about individual protections as much as it is about protecting people you could unintentionally infect against their own will. How is a vaccinated person responsible for their own death when they get accidentally infected by an unvaxed coworker? No one chooses to get the virus. But we all have been or will be exposed to it until this thing ends - never on purpose, and always by accident. The vax is a just a measure, it’s not a cure all. I find it hard that you sit there and act like I’m being offensive for talking about this stuff. Protecting your friends, your loved ones, by getting a shot that, may not keep you from getting it, but will undoubtedly reduce your symptoms and chances of infecting others.. it’s the least selfish thing you could do.. I don’t understand your points about me, my, mine… Either way, don’t get so offended bc I’m trying to argue for protecting others, not for myself.	1640920849.0	hqmx44b	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqllo5r	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqmx44b/

7uziljmd	Noone here is anti-vaccine. We are against this shot that can only be called a vaccine because they changed the definition of vaccine. It has the lowest efficacy of any vaccine ever made and by far the most deaths of any vaccine ever produced. It makes zero sense to get it if you are younger and in good shape. The average age of death in the U.S. is 78. Average age of U.S. citizen that has died from Covid? 78. Allowing kids under 17 to get it should be a crime. They have a .0008% chance of becoming critically ill from Covid and a 8%(mostly boys) of having ill effects from the vax. Even the Mrna creator said it was only designed for the high risk and shouldn't be used widely. You can't say the unvaxxed are putting people at any more risk when EVERYONE gets covid and everyone can transmit it. The only difference has been in the period of 2-5 weeks after you get the vaxx, if you get Covid, the symptoms are lessened. That affects you only. Now we literally have a strain that is not even deadly. Shut up about an ineffective vaccine and do your part and get the Omicron variant so you can get real immunity. If everyone would do that, we actually could have herd immunity. Not some pipe dream herd immunity that a vaccine with 40% efficacy could NEVER deliver.	1640920975.0	hqmxdkr	t3_rsfnqu	t1_hqmibp1	/r/Conservative/comments/rsfnqu/lets_go_brandon_now_primary_sponsor_for_nascar/hqmxdkr/

You can't have any influence on how the country is run unless you can work with people you disagree with to achieve your political aims.  Polling has shown that people who "identify" as conservative only make up 40% of the country. And many of those conservatives would consider other people who call themselves conservatives, not conservatives. You need 51% to attain a majority. You are guaranteed going to be working with people you disagree with.	1640921131.0	hqmxpch	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqmx2xl	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqmxpch/

5xpfs	Rowling literally supports 99% of leftists positions. She also supports the vast majority of the trans agenda. Not even an exaggeration. Her position is still espoused by most leftists arguing for transgenderism being real. Which is that gender and sex are not the same thing. She was cancelled for saying that a trans woman (AKA a gender) is not the same thing as a biological woman (AKA sex). And when she was attacked she responded in kind.  There is a recent push within the last year to somehow ignore this was the argument used all along. Thus we have things as "Birthing Persons" being invented to literally reduce a sex down to biological functions. Which is demeaning and insulting to that group.	1640922135.0	hqmzu9s	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqkouwl	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqmzu9s/

Look at how many veterans (most of them Trump supporters) joined an insurrection to overthrow an ELECTED government (Joe Biden) earlier this year.        I see far far more conservatives lecturing people and generally being unwavering assholes than "liberal arts college students." It's a tired trope they like to trot out in response to comments that literally have nothing to do with politics. Are some liberal arts students assholes? Sure. Are most conservatives authoritarian assholes? Hell yeah.        If you're talking about the radical Right Trump supporting terrorist idiots that stormed the Capitol and killed people (and I'm pretty sure you are), yeah they were definitely wrong. Trump is the least popular president in modern history. His approval rating never got higher than 50%. No one came to his inauguration. Trump lost.

4ubs6dtw	Okay I don’t like the idea of parents displaying their link to kids, but let’s take a moment here. Posts like these promote the stereotype that all conservatives are anti-LGBTQ bigots. I know gay people at work, in my town, and have a few in my extended family. Some wear gay pride shirts, some are religious, some are atheist, and some are in the closet. None display their kink in public and I don’t believe many gay couples do, especially those with children. Suggesting this is the default for that population is no better than a liberal suggesting every conservative is a White Supremecist.	1640923594.0	hqn2uzn	t3_rrszg3	t3_rrszg3	/r/Conservative/comments/rrszg3/it_may_sound_counterintuitive_but_we_need_to_go/hqn2uzn/

1wrj7zb	Man.. Unless your a doctorate of food science, I wouldn’t expect you to fully comprehend how food you eat turns into energy for your body, or how prescription drugs interact to make you better..It’s science, and a lot of smarter people than me have figured out how to prove that common foods and drugs we take every day are safe for consumption. I don’t need to know exactly how that works in a molecular level but I’m really glad someone else took the time to do the leg worm for society as a whole. Now unless you’re a PHD in biomedical engineering, I wouldn’t expect you, or myself, to be able to explain how this whole vaccine things works.. I am fortunate however to have an older brother, who ended up getting his 4 yr degree, then eventually his Doctorate of Biomedical Engineering from UT Knoxville.. one day he had a good business idea about patenting a disposable type of sample prep tool they used in research every day, and a few months before he gave his dissertation, him and a friend started their own company. Named it T&T Scientific inc. out of Knoxville. You can look them up if you’d like. They patented the world first disposable, ready to use out of box liposome extrusion device (think a size filter for fluids within a syringe). This was the basis for thier companys beginnings. They won startup competitions and ultimately began to grow. Fast forward to feb 2020. I had been helping my brother (graham) and his business partner (Nima) relocate their office to a new bigger facility. They even asked me to help the assemble thier first Clean Room (modular parts, like a giant lego set). We had finished it a few months prior and now, it’s February. The pandemic is just in its early stages, and my brother admits one day that they had just recieved back a authorization letter from the FDA allowing their company to start making pharmaceutical drugs! My mind was blown. My big bro had literally made a business shift that put them in a great spot. They got authorized to make drugs and were able to avoid lockdowns as an essential business.. guess what the first drug they started making was.. MRNA Covid Vaccines for some companies FDA trials. My mind was even more blown. I was so proud of them then and still am today. He’s always been tight lipped about their ongoing work, but he is very quick to talk about the science behind the vaccine because, we’ll, he makes that stuff for a living. I could regurgitate enough to sound stupid (imagine that), but the confidence and faith I have in that type of drug, from the way my brother has explained it to me, is that this technology is the way of the future. Lipid Nano Particle drug delivery systems, very similar to the way MRNA vaccines are delivered, these technologies will be the basis for curing cancers in the future. They are being used now to deliver Covid vaccines and the technology has been around much longer than it’s been in use in the pharma industry.  I guess knowing and being close with a family member who is now a chief partner in a pharmaceutical company that makes Covid vaccines, i can say that I am very confident in the tech behind the vaccines because we have talked many times about how exactly it works. The problem is I don’t know the details enough to make sense of it, but my conviction is still the same. I wish everyone had the chance to speak one on one with my brother and hear his dumbed down technical talk to fully grasp what’s happening with these medical technologies, before they all jump to the conclusion that they’re unsafe and a secret ploy to make more money. My brothers company is small, like 15 people on a good week small. But they’re part of the system now. So yes, anyone who bucks the science behind the vaccines is wrong in my opinion. You can back the mandates all day as even I have reservations about the gvnt rights to take away ours.. but since I’m pro vax, I guess I’ve stopped caring about the constitutionality of the mandates and just encourage all to get the shot..   Sorry to ramble and I’m finally tired of thinking about this shit for the night.. peace out	1640924986.0	hqn5mqz	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqn1er7	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqn5mqz/

m2acj	Doesn't it basically have to be malice or recklessness to justify a criminal conviction at all? Under the common law, accidents aren't criminal. Criminality comes from taking actions that a reasonable person would know introduces unreasonable risk of harm - like operating a vehicle while intoxicated or drag racing (criminal negligence IE - "recklessness") vs. a normal accident (civil) vs. vehicular homicide (criminal malice).  If it was just negligence, the criminal conviction is not valid application of the law.  If it was recklessness or malice, then you have mens rea and you convict him of 4 counts of manslaughter and sentence him appropriately. Seems like he did something reckless and then possibly panicked and missed all his opportunities to correct that risk.	1640925509.0	hqn6nlv	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqn0ce6	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqn6nlv/

You are using a subjective metric, that is your opinion, on what is and isnt acceptable. I have a much more universal and objective positon. Mind ya own damn business. If i want to rent out the public park for my basketweaving class, why would that concern you and less than if someone had a furry convention there?

drgisppp	How it’s applied is on the judges. If there’s a sentencing gap it’s bc we have judges not judging without bias. The law itself has nothing inherently racist about it regardless of the reasons it was implemented. (Example) If DUI was made illegal bc at the time more black folks were driving drunk and they needed to stop, does that mean today DUI should go away? I don’t think so. The intent back then was to stop people from driving drunk and it would hold true today regardless of skin color. (Not true example, just a way of illustrating my point).   Sentencing disparities are on the judges to be unbiased. If they aren’t, then the judge is the problem.	1640926404.0	hqn8dlc	t3_rsd9yr	t1_hqn3gj9	/r/Conservative/comments/rsd9yr/washington_state_looks_to_reduce_sentences_for/hqn8dlc/

As a pilot, if my engine fails on takeoff, I am expected to know exactly how to deal with it. I don't need to be experienced, nor do I need to have been in the situation before to know what to do. It's a foreseeable situation for which the procedure can be taught and trained on.

This is true of many old-school blue team people more generally: they have no idea what policies blue team actually supports these days, and they vehemently disagree with them when they find out.

7n9t0	You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	1640928277.0	hqnbu85	t3_rsb7fw	t1_hqmaz7p	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqnbu85/

7yasek1e	I got my mom to wake up, but it was an effort. What finally made a dent was explaining to her that *every single* core value/principle I hold, I learned directly from her … yet somehow she votes blue team and I despise blue team. Exact same values, yet we support different ends of the political spectrum. From there, with a few demonstrations on how what she believes is objectively wrong (eg blue team supports Israel) and how her values are now deemed wrong and racist (eg judge people based on their actions/character, not on their skin color), she’s coming around to the understanding that she is definitely NOT blue team.	1640928395.0	hqnc1q9	t3_rsgi4h	t1_hqmq9pu	/r/Conservative/comments/rsgi4h/flashback_desantis_got_factchecked_for_predicting/hqnc1q9/
2sp9bld9	There’s a shortage - there isn’t nearly enough for everyone, and monoclonals aren’t the type of treatment that can be easily scaled up. (Production is challenging, to put it mildly.) So my understanding is that they’re trying to reallocate regeneron and the other one that doesn’t work against omicron to the states where omicron isn’t yet dominant, saving a larger percentage of the one that still works against omicron for the states that need it more.   I’m not sure how much that will help though. Omicron is surging everywhere so it’s just a matter of time. In my area, omicron went from 3% of total cases two weeks ago, to 40% last week, to over 80% in the most recent report. And we aren’t a hard hit area (yet?). The virus is moving faster than the shipping schedule.   IMO they should be saving the monoclonal supply for the elderly and the immune compromised.

1j1en0iv	The European way of life is to pay lots of taxes and have the government provide a generous welfare system from cradle to grave. Your neither poor nor wealthy. Even when the unemployment rate for young italian men is far beyond US unemployment, its not seen as a problem because they are living at home and not on the street.   But that kind of society comes at a cost. Far fewer innovators, entrepreneurs, people striving to one up each other. Most of all people in Europe have no great mission or purpose which is why many are latching on to defending crack downs because 'fighting covid' is now almost a cult like religion for many.   Europe is a dying continent that has far less influence than it thinks it does. Its aging faster than many others but perhaps not as rapidly as China, so its primary concern isn't its youth or middle aged but elderly voters. The State provides everything for them so why shouldn't it also keep them safe?

To me vaccine mandates are more racist than, say, voter ID.  How do you maintain the cognitive dissonance required to view voter ID as racist but vaccine mandates as perfectly acceptable? There’s a reason many black people don’t want to get vaxxed and I suspect you’re fully aware of that reason.	1640928865.0	hqncvn5	t3_rs5u7h	t1_hql29se	/r/Conservative/comments/rs5u7h/watch_bill_gates_orgasms_when_anderson_cooper/hqncvn5/

My buddy worked bar and before that was a server, he explained that the club charged for a month what he made in a year.   I think its about a certain type of person having power over others and feeling like they can get away with anything.   &#x200B;  After the catholic church of France was found to have covered up 400k molestations, nothing would surprise me and we should all refrain from 'libs are pedos' or 'conservatives are pedos'.  pedos are bad no matter if they wear the elephant or the Jackass.	1640929080.0	hqnd9bm	t3_rsi0du	t3_rsi0du	/r/Conservative/comments/rsi0du/hypothetically/hqnd9bm/

2sp9bld9	That isn’t correct. Antibodies are not long lived; you can only get a permanent antibody supply from antibody producing cells (memory B cells). The monoclonal infusion cannot replenish itself, it’s just an antibody. Single use; sticking to a virus uses it up, and any not used up will disappear.   Nor can mRNA alter DNA.

c87yy	I think you might be missing the shift in messaging (which would be easy considering the potato admin is so over the board with messaging, they changed positions on air travel since Monday).  The CDC reason r for the five day quarantine was not because science changed on infectiousness, but in what people will tolerate according to walensky at the CDC. She said almost no one did the ten day and so that's why they changed it so maybe people would comply with the new requirements.  Also the admission that one can test positive for 12 weeks after initial positive test even though not infectious.  Did potato slip when he said no federal solution, it's up to the states?  Couple media talking heads now taking a "we have to learn to live with it" tone.  Deface the nation had one member speak about how devastating this has been for children. Never made it on the air, but it's on the website.  SG Murthy speaking about the huge rise in suicides in kids.  There's definitely a shift in messaging.  Not saying you are wrong, could go either way, but the 5 day quarantine thing has to do with economic impact as well so if that's any indication perhaps not.	1640931882.0	hqnhzle	t3_rsgi4h	t1_hqn7veh	/r/Conservative/comments/rsgi4h/flashback_desantis_got_factchecked_for_predicting/hqnhzle/

So there he is barreling down the mountain at about 85 mph, PASSES a runaway truck ramp, sees stopped traffic, then steers left INTO the traffic instead of the ditch on the right. There's even video of this dip shit killing people instead of running off the road into a shallow ditch on the right.   This guy fucked up multiple times in such egregious and negligent ways that he certainly deserves the original sentence. Even if you excuse away his faulty brakes, he still continued after noticing an issue, he still passed multiple runaway truck ramps that would have safely stopped him, and he still steered into the stopped cars instead of just wrecking his truck into the intestate safety ditch.	1640933347.0	hqnka48	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqndu3b	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqnka48/

Apart from, you know, the internet.  As for the superiority thing, I do often get that feeling from coworkers in Canada--especially some of the French Canadians I have worked with.

4x9uv	The thing about this is that there are several different tiers of what it means to be rigged.  There are four levels of assertions being made around the 2020 election:  * **Tier 1:** Election machines were hacked, millions of fake votes were added/removed/changed, and Dominion colluded to steal the election.  * **Tier 2:** Tons of individual cases of fraud occurred, including double scanning ballots, election laws were ignored (ie. Pennsylvania), dead people voted, illegal immigrants voted, people who left the state voted, ballot boxes were stuffed, maiden names were used to cast multiple votes, PO Boxes were illegally used as home addresses, etc…  * **Tier 3:** Immoral grey area actions occurred, including Zuckerberg spending $400 million on COVID offices which were transformed into Democrat election field offices, ‘ballot curing’ being allowed in Democrat areas but not Republican areas, tons of ballot harvesting all over the place, including nursing homes, and so on.  * **Tier 4:** The media colluded to hand Biden the election by acting like one giant Super PAC, hiding stories that would damage Biden, spreading fake stories to damage Trump, and colluding with social media to deplatform any opinions that were harmful to Biden and the Democrats.   Tiers 1 and 2 are illegal, Tier 3 is borderline, and Tier 4 is more of a grey area, where the legality can be debated (ie. regarding campaign contribution laws), but generally speaking, it’s more a case of immense bias of the major institutions, rather than actual laws being broken.   **Tier 1** is the Lin Wood stuff and I have not seen any evidence to support it. It appears to be baseless.  **Tiers 3 and 4** are undeniable. Those things happened. There’s no debating it. The facts are there for all to see.  The questions are regarding **Tier 2**. There’s a ton of evidence supporting the Tier 2 claims, but that stuff never had its day in court because it was never even admitted due to judges making their “lack of standing” decrees because they didn’t want courts to get involved, regardless of the merit of the claims.    So with that said, if the question is “Was the election rigged?”, the answer is yes. Tier 3 and 4 easily meet the definition of “rigged”. It was a rigged election. However, if the question is “Was the election stolen?”, that’s trickier because “stolen” means something different than “rigged”. And as far as whether or not it was stolen, there’s a lot of compelling evidence that it was (Tier 2), but because that stuff never had its day in court, it hasn’t been proven in a court of law that this theft occurred. But the election WAS rigged. That’s undeniable.	1640934310.0	hqnlpda	t3_rsb7fw	t3_rsb7fw	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqnlpda/

The article itself takes it a step further, presumably under the assumption that the lack of appropriate products would also affect other people who menstruate (who do not identify as women). Even though the official article looked generally at women, the issue it discusses obviously effects everyone who menstruates. So the article makes a distinction, but when quoting the report, they specified women, since it’s important not to misrepresent information	1640935498.0	hqnnerv	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqmdeo0	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqnnerv/

If you don't know about CHOP and what made it possible or the city council member and her followers that stormed city hall and nothing was done about I suggest educating yourself. While you are at it you can educate yourself about the current winter storm and challenges that the governor has created by firing unvaccinated employees including employees with exemptions because reasonable accommodations weren't allowed. And locking members of Congress out of the State house who are unvaccinated. It's a liberal's dream of wanting to be ordered around and have every aspect of their lives controlled by the government.

83vb4y0k	I am unsure any do say anything at all. Pretty much absolute silence. And honestly, I don't think every illegal immigrant is some criminal, many work their asses off multiple jobs and really did come for a better life -- and outside the obvious offence of illegal passage and entry, they're good people. But when you have thousands if not tens of thousands of people crossing across from the border during a pandemic, I am very scrupulous on the situation just adding people when there is an issue at had (not so much at the moment in regards to COVID -- COVID cases are very high but as evolution kind of does its thing to viruses, their evolutionary trajectory tends towards higher transmissibility but dampened infectious effects on the hosts it infects -- I'm the only one in my house who didn't get it and I'm out a lot working 2 jobs, I got vaccinated and have a robust daily vitamin regiment while I have a health complication making me at risk) but this has been going on when COVID was doing a damaging number on people (infected and killed two family members of mine, one old (grandpa) one young (29 y/o cousin).  So its ridiculous when you have them (the Dem party -- not like every Liberal or Democrat citizen) be silent on this, promote or cheer on protests which serve their interests but virtue signal about how its awful people wanna go out and party -- their motives are of monstrous bullshit.	1640938882.0	hqnrzz0	t3_rrt91n	t1_hqk0sn4	/r/Conservative/comments/rrt91n/douglas_murray_the_left_never_wants_to_return_to/hqnrzz0/

511if72i	BLUF: Germany should really think twice when they disparage American freedom given their history.   The west didn’t hold Germany all that accountable to begin with after WWII. Other than a few hundred charged with war crimes at Nuremberg resulting in an even smaller number of executions, there wasn’t much backlash.  After the war we worked our hardest to build up West Germany and West Berlin because we hoped it to be a contrast to the Soviet controlled areas agreed to at the Yalta Conference.  That allowed their to be a lot of German revisionism and downplaying just how wide spread nazism was and how complacent their own parents/grandparents/ great grandparents were. The companies that made Zyklon B which was one of the gasses the Germans used during the Holocaust. Or the company that used slave labor make luxury cars. They just changed their name form IG Farben to Bayer and Auto Union to Audi. (Just 2 examples)  Many Germans to this day will obfuscate how much support the nazi party had in Germany with irrelevant tidbits like “Hitler was Austrian” (yes and he became German and Germany supported him) or “many Germans weren’t officially Nazis” (neither was Eva Braun, Germany still supported Hitler)   Although it’s important to look to the future and not live in the past.  But if they want to talk down on American freedoms like our 2nd amendment, I’ll hold the mirror right to them as to why we need that freedom	1640939122.0	hqnsbd9	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqnile8	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqnsbd9/

But we absolutely do know that mRNA does not alter DNA and we have known that for decades.  Monoclonals do not provide any immunity at all, natural or otherwise (and nobody would consider this “natural”). These are each just a single (or two individual) isolated antibody, disconnected from the immune system. Pour it into your veins and it will stick to any virus particle it recognizes. But this is an immunologic dead end - it can’t make you immune, and it can’t teach your immune system to better defend itself.	1640939879.0	hqntaxc	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqnh48f	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqntaxc/

Which is *exactly* why there could have been a rejection of Electors in the 2020 election for those states which were still being legally contested.  All that had to happen was for each state's Legislators to confirm who their electors were casting their votes for and there would be absolutely no one that would be able to deny the legitimacy of the current President.

ve5qq	> No evidence  A lack of evidence doesn't mean that it didn't happen. It is pretty difficult to find the evidence you want when you don't have access to the ballots, envelopes, voter registration, and chain of custody documents that the election boards have locked up since the election and won't let anyone examine.  The example that I always which none of you have been able to refute (or simply have no answer for because you know that I am right) is it is like a murder happened in a house next door to you. You saw blood on the windows, heard screams, and saw the perp come out of the house covered in blood. Then the cops show up and cordon off the house. Over the next few days the windows are cleaned. Nothing is ever in the news or the paper about any incidents at that house. And when you ask the police about it, they deny that anything ever happened there.  You can't get into the house to verify that anything happened there. Yet you know that *something* did. Did a murder actually not happen there? There's no evidence of it....  Or is there a phrase for times when something happens and the powers that be don't want that "something" coming to light? I think the phrase is **cover up**. Don't be naive in thinking that this isn't something that could happen.  > rigged , moron.   Also, if I were you, I wouldn't call someone a moron when you don't know how to use punctuation correctly.

ve5qq	That's either a strawman argument you are pushing there or it is that you really don't know how elections work, do you? You make it sound like they can control the entire election process in every State across the nation. However, not every Senator is up for election in each State each election cycle and not every State has poll workers that can be compromised.  The Democrats didn't need to control every precinct in the U.S. to get a Presidential win. Just a few key heavily-Democratic areas to push their State results over the edge for the Electoral College votes. But that doesn't affect Texas or Oklahoma's Senators. And the Senators in the contested States were already Democrat to begin with, their rigging couldn't have changed that outcome except to keep the Democrat seated there rather than having it flip the other way.

Neither of those are racist because they are equal.   Voting laws restricting black or women from voting is racist because they are not equal and allow only certain people to vote or restrict explicitly one persons ability.   This law CANT be racist (bc it’s a law for ALL to follow or be charged equally). Intent behind it cannot make the law racist when EVERYONE has to equally follow it.

dvm4pb8f	Whether he wants her to win or not, it is a fact that she would win. Democrats would come out in droves to vote for Michelle.   I do think she's intelligent and articulate, just like Obama was. Obama's policy sucked, and he got progressively worse (ironically, by becoming more progressive). But you can't deny Obama was 'presidential'.   But I mean, George Bush (Senior) was also presidential. Even George Bush Jr. was presidential, albeit at times he was a ditz.   Based on how the Convo was going, I'm pretty sure the context of Rogan was 'i like Michelle Obama as a person, and I think many people do too'.   Policy-wise, ugh. She'd be worse than Biden. Her stories on her podcast are laughably bad, as she tries to spin everything towards racism.

drgisppp	I am unaware of any law that is equal in wording but intentionally penalizes another group more than another. The fact is the population of black Americans is approximately 11% and commit the majority of gun related violent crimes. It is an impossibility to make any crime that penalizes gun crime that doesn’t disproportionately affect black Americans. That does not make ALL gun laws a racial equality problem.   Also- the initial wording of this law explicitly says it was created to promote racial equity.   >>AN ACT Relating to promoting racial equity in the criminal legal system by eliminating drive-by shooting as a basis for elevating murder in the first degree to aggravated murder in the first degree  The intent of the legislator was that this law is racist, not based on some dudes racism.	1640946803.0	hqo1uho	t3_rsd9yr	t1_hqo14ze	/r/Conservative/comments/rsd9yr/washington_state_looks_to_reduce_sentences_for/hqo1uho/

biavjujv	Have you ever tried to manufacture here? It’s very expensive. Healthcare costs that have to be assigned on a fixed per policy cost per employee cost in budgeting make up a huge part of labor expenditure in manufacturing compared to for example social taxes we the corporation paid in Germany, Japan, Belgium or Mexico for the employees.   Why would American corporations - that have become conglomerates and oligopolies in many of there industries over the past 50 years - make things of high quality? The relationship that Corporate America wants to have with the American Consumer is one of recurring revenue through forced obsolescence. Make things cheap, make them break often, and make them unrepairable is the Corporate America way.  Being fed blind nationalism and nostalgia of the “good ol’ days” that if only we manufactured at home, we’d get great quality products is a false narrative in my experience as there is every counter-incentive to not do that and make things cheap.  If we did, my bonus/stock units would decrease as a management employee and we’d have less sales over time and that would lead to less profits and anything that leads to less profits is always labeled as “unAmerican”.	1640947197.0	hqo2bqt	t3_rsg3l3	t1_hqo031l	/r/Conservative/comments/rsg3l3/china_claims_us_will_pay_unbearable_cost_for/hqo2bqt/

drgisppp	I suppose I can repeat myself again- I was never hear to argue whether or not it should be removed, it was the fact race has been injected into an objectively non-racist topic. You ignored my point, which is factual and follows your logical line, yet disproves you with regard to laws that disproportionately affect a certain group could be maybe possibly kinda sorta racially motivated.   However, since you persist, no. Indiscriminately shooting in the general direction of a person/group and in fact killing someone is absolutely aggravating and more dangerous than a targeted attack inside a home with kids.   Killing more than one person (if they kill a second person) is also, separately an aggravating factor.   So no, why on gods green earth would you want to, in any way, protect someone from a worse criminal sentence when they are willing to show such a clear and obvious disregard for the life of others.	1640949647.0	hqo5ejb	t3_rsd9yr	t1_hqo3i21	/r/Conservative/comments/rsd9yr/washington_state_looks_to_reduce_sentences_for/hqo5ejb/

1dy1hbqx	In order to turn this all around the country really needs to come together. Hand in hand.   We are all in this together.   Vaccines needs to be mandated. For everyone just like measles. Babies born should be given vaccines for COVID just like they do for Polio.   Kids under 18 that don’t get vaccinated should be barred from returning to school. We need to get this pandemic under control. The spread is literally a straight arrow up.   Vaccines really should be mandated for every adult. With fines and/or imprisonment if they do not comply. Annual boosters need to be included if it doesn’t go away.   I also think we are far too relaxed on masking. Masking needs to be required in every public space for all ages. N95 mask quality if you are not inside your home.   All the money we wasted on the vaccine development is going to waste. We need to start making masks. Making them free. Making them required.   If we did that in under 5 years this would all be history. Eradicated.   People need to just be responsible. Accept the next 5 years will be hard but worth it.   With possible monthly stimulus checks such as the $2000 a month for every American until it’s over — that would also really make it easier for families who are struggling.   The Biden administration has had so many curve balls thrown at them it’s aweful.   I believe if he can step up, put his foot down, get vaxed or go to jail, mask up or be arrested, and provide a full income for every American we will be out of this nightmare by the next election.

7phd3	Sure, you can expect that… but then why do they give out cdls like candy? Cdl mills churn out holders in as little as 2-3 weeks with minimum time behind the wheel and instructors reading PowerPoint slides word for word. There’s very little given to understanding the mechanical side of operation. For pretrip inspection test it’s merely identifying if an object is not bent, not cracked, not broken, not leaking, or filled to the proper levels; for tires you can throw in the abcs.  How many hours/weeks were required to get a pilots license? Did you pay out of pocket or did a company pay for your training?

igsoj	why are they worthless? There needs to be same way of measuring differences in countries other than gdp per capita. If you dont believe them, go to those countries, talk to those people, see what its like. Many of those scores are made by American or American funded organizations and think tanks, not gov bureaucrats.   I wouldn’t call German salaries pitiful. They definitely make less than American on average however they still make a lot and can live very comfortably with most of the luxurys an American has. They also have much fewer people living in squander than the US. They also definitely have a lot more free time than you and don‘t have to kiss their employer‘s ass nearly as much. They also dont risk going into debt for getting cancer.   If you have a specific score you disagree with then just say that.	1640951301.0	hqo7id2	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqo2kij	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqo7id2/

Just being separated is actually a relative kindness.  Not familiar with Marine regs, but the Army reg on the topic of immunizations includes steps like formally making the immunization a lawful order (opening you up to the penalties for disregarding such an order) and for a general to be able to direct you to be forcibly immunized against your will if he/she seems it to be important enough in your specific case.    I argue against vaccine mandates in the general case, but specifically for those of us in the military, you really don't have any excuses.	1640951925.0	hqo8c3v	t3_rsr767	t3_rsr767	/r/Conservative/comments/rsr767/more_than_200_marines_have_been_discharged_from/hqo8c3v/

Being forced to endure all the weird looks and prejudice along with the increased risk of depression and suicide. Then having to jump through hoops for potentially years just so you can have massively invasive and permanently disfiguring surgery just so you can feel comfortable in your own skin. Then throw in a cocktail of poorly understood drugs with side effects that no one seems to care about that you have to keep taking for the rest of your life so you don't revert back to the thing you were before.  It's something I wouldn't wish on anyone and i can't understand why the trans activists are working so hard to push it on children.  Then there are the idiots that dye their hair, put on some shitty make-up and put made up pronouse in their twatter bio and pretend to be trans for attention.

Their largest corporations are still overwhelming closely held by private individuals. Germany until recently has been governed by the same coalition for 20 years. You hear policy discourse in the US for better or worse, dissecting proposals such as Build Back Better yet very little of this in the EU.

193322l6	Her and half of Congress.  I remember ol' Russ Feingold from Wisconsin.  Started off a typical guy living in a 3 bedroom ranch (albeit a Harvard educated lawyer) with a family in Madison.  Became a US senator for nearly 20yrs and became a multi muli millionaire, running his own super pack, and staying in lavish hotels.  (https://www.idolnetworth.com/russ-feingold-net-worth-220243)  Unfortunately the citizen government servant (who went back to his work after their term) our founders envisioned doesn't quite happen in Washington.  Look at Tom Daschle the minority leader in the 90s.  Since he left office, he has had a personal driver and car paid for by a lobbyist (which he didn't claim on his taxes).  20yrs someone is paying him for what he did in Washington!  What taxes or debt did he waste to get a lifetime payoff?!?!?  How many representatives are doing this to us?  If we had a fair balanced media which would hold our representatives accountable, we wouldn't be in this mess!  They are the watchdog that has turned into a government lapdog.  We have become Rome.	1640953407.0	hqoadiz	t3_rsqydk	t3_rsqydk	/r/Conservative/comments/rsqydk/theres_a_reason_pelosi_doesnt_want_stock/hqoadiz/

Financially they are fucked too, their largest employer is also their most valuable stock. It's a conglomerate of real estate companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, if that happens the Chinese will experience a recession like the one we had in the 30s. Not only would this have dire consequences for the CCP it would be a global catastrophe. China obtaining Taiwan isn't just some power play, it opens up the waters they can fish, gives a huge strategic position for navy bases and trade, and war is a great way to prop up an economy.	1640953480.0	hqoahb5	t3_rsg3l3	t1_hqmnmnk	/r/Conservative/comments/rsg3l3/china_claims_us_will_pay_unbearable_cost_for/hqoahb5/

3vekgz8i	Former military, you don't know what you're talking about. Maybe in 1940 that was the case but the Army has provided thousands of religious exemptions over the very things you describe and more. Muslims get time allocated for prayer and can wear their Hijab. Jews get kosher meals. Many religions can get vaccine accommodations however I have no doubt sneaky commanders got in a room with these soldiers and got them to make the mistake of even mentioning 1% distrust in the vaccine as to why they want an exemption. Mistake number 1, never trust your NCO or CO they are arms of their Battalion and Brigade Command looking to get everyone jabbed for their eval.   Ignorant people like you is why the left marches through institutions while the right sits back and lets our own get booted because "reasons'. During my six years, Ive seen the absolute craziest accomodations granted like personal quarters, trans folk taking a year off deployment for transitioning and being able to cross into the opposite gender's bathroom.   I bet you have a lot to say about jews being allowed to eat kosher meals in the field or muslims wearing hijabs right?

Since 2018 there has been 92 school shootings in the USA, that number would likely be higher too if a lot of learning wasn’t done remote due to covid.  We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children	1640954564.0	hqoc1da	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqnjdqq	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqoc1da/

Yup, it showed the nice big increase, but along with the increase in SSA payment also comes the usual annual increase in medicare costs. Usually they increase the cost of Medicare by the exact same as the SSA payment increase so elders don't really get any kind of increase.

It's more informative to look at gun homicides per number of guns, since you seem to think the guns themselves are the issue. At that number less than .0035% of guns are involved in a homicide in America. By comparison the UK is at ~.027% of their guns are used in homicides, nearly 9x the number of America.

There was really no other issue in that race that explains why an expected blowout was so close. Since then, I’m sure Dems have polled the issue more closely and learned that their ineffective Covid restrictions have angered a huge part of the population. So, they have to start laying the “let’s get back to normal groundwork” ahead of November’s elections.   People on this sub know they won’t actually ever give up any of these new powers. But if the Dems can convince the squishy suburban moderates that they *might* give them up, then maybe they can avoid destruction in November.	1640956148.0	hqoeigs	t3_rs8siq	t1_hqku3us	/r/Conservative/comments/rs8siq/msnbcs_chris_hayes_we_shouldnt_reorient_our_lives/hqoeigs/

12yxzk	Exactly.   If it’s Science, there should be data from tests where they are measuring the contagiousness of people  each day after day 1 of symptoms.    This would be dangerous to do as you wouldn’t want to knowingly expose people to the virus.  So, instead, it should be done by interviewing those infected to see how they were infected and when / if they infected anyone else.    There isn’t even a voluntary way for infected people to communicate this information to the CDC and no one I know has been asked Jack shit.    The CDC doesn’t have factual data to support any of this.   If they did, they would release it and we’d all be able to make better decisions off of that data.	1640956178.0	hqoek94	t3_rsqjoi	t1_hqo0vis	/r/Conservative/comments/rsqjoi/nbc_finally_asks_cdc_director_the_right_question/hqoek94/

However I have 2 major concerns against this bill:  1) Islamaphobia is not defined here, so how can you prosecute someone for islamaphobia without a knowing what it means?   2) If identical violent actions are taken against me (agnostic) and a Muslim, the violence against the Muslim would be a greater crime under the law purely because of their religion. There’s no definition here, and so anything can be considered a “hate crime” regardless of intent.

So if that could be measured, and a significant drop in viral load after X days were observed, that might be a way to set the duration of quarantine.

What the people above you say goes and you're not really expected to question it. Democracy in Europe was not brought by the masses rising up against thousands of years of oppression, but because the noble families got tired of the incompetence of the royal families.   Of course times have changed, but political institutions have long lasting effects. For example, even though it's been two generations since there were German parts of Poland, those regions still vote differently overall than the rest of the country.	1640957416.0	hqognvh	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqmy6o9	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqognvh/

The issue is the selective enforcement of these accomodations but thanks for citing the regulation that officers have discretion to selectively enforce which you completely gloss over.  If I had a nickel for each "at the commanders discretion" in our regs Id be a millionaire. Its milquetoast trash like you that made me get out with no hesitation and boy did I dodge that clot shot in time lol. You know damn well these are selectively enforced and the days of standards are dead in the Army.   Females failing the ACFT? Lets lower the requirements. Not enough bodies for the service?

14eywgy2	To be fair, Lightfoot is calling for federal prosecutors, ATF investigators, and Marshalls to help execute warrants to investigate/prosecute violent crime (murder). There's a lot of reasons to dislike Lightfoot, but when most people read "troops" they think military. What you said is accurate with "federal troops" since she's calling for Marshalls, but wanted to point that out to anyone skimming comments and too lazy to read the article. It's definitely out of the norm and criticism is expected.  The second comment doesn't match the article though. Parents are free to complain at PTA meetings (that's kind of the point of PTA meetings). It's when parents start issuing threats of violence against members that they are ending up on watch lists. Those people are elected officials, so that's not out of the norm. If you issue violent threats against a senator or the president, you'd be on a watchlist too. The number of violent threats increasing is what makes this uncommon, not the underlying mechanism.	1640959681.0	hqokuqp	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqnbb5i	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqokuqp/

igsoj	I am specifically talking about Germany in comparison to the US and not all of europe. The US currently has a higher youth as well as general unemployment rate than Germany. Germany tends to have some of the lowest unemployment rates among youths in the world. Germans are also more travelled than Americans with many more being passport holders.  With education I mean how well educated the average American is. The US does have the best universities however a minority of students are smart enough and can afford to go to those. Also, a significant amount of those students as well as professors are foreign or of foreign descent. Look at how man university students especially in stem areas at harvard and other ivys are chinese. Silicon valley could not exist without the h1-b visa and highly skilled asian workers. US primary as well as secondary education is lacking. Most Americans would be the first to admit it. According to a recent study 54% of Americans have a reading level below 7th grade.  I would argue that Germany and other European countries have stronger more trusted democratic institutions and transparency. There definitely is money in politics but mich less than in the US. Multiple parties allow for more nuance than in the US. The political culture in Germany is more productive with much less partisan bickering. There is less skepticism in Germany because people have more trust in their government.  The ECB definitely has problems and corruption but it also has the difficult balancing act of appeasing the interests of rich and poor countries such as keeping interest rates low for countries like Greece to pay back their massive debts. No one is arguing that Italy is the peak of democracy. The US has and is destroying the middle class by allowing wall street to operate untethered. The great recession caused by wall street banksters and sanctioned by bought politicians destroyed billions of dollars in wealth especially among the middle class. My friends dad is still working in his 80s because he lost his house during the recession.  I wasn’t saying that German people wouldn’t like more money however you said that wages were „pitiful“ implying people are struggling to live or are living at the brink of survival. Germany is a rich country and Germans are rich. It is naive to assume that high wages are the only thing people want or need. For their „pitiful“ wages Germans get to work fewer hours with more vacations, job security, social safety net, mostly guaranteed retirement at 65 and free healthcare.	1640959956.0	hqole2e	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqo8sj7	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqole2e/

exbsf	I find this topic interesting, so I am going to challenge your premise.  Not sure why you think we're enamoured with it. I'd say a lot of us are quite worried, and I'm probably in one of the less worrying countries for that trend (UK).  I should say I'm fairly conservative in my views, obviously, or I wouldn't be here, but this is one place I think I'd rather live under the European model.  But to you're point I often find this a bit odd. I know you guys think you have more freedom but if you stand back and look at it I'm not sure you do. You cite the 2nd Amendment as a reason why you have freedom but let's be realistic.  If you were ever forced to rise up against the government firstly, hate to tell ya, but they'd win. Secondly, I would posit and would love your perspective on it, but the vast majority of gun owners talk a good game, but if a couple hundred FBI agents came to your door wanting your guns, I'd say there wouldn't be many who'd come out firing.  The likelihood is it's too late. Too many people have and want guns, and that's fine. It's sad because they do cause a lot of pain in people's lives, but that's how it is.  I'd say the NRA has more power than the threat of the citizenry rebelling.  The reality is we have very different histories. Yours is short and born out of gun culture.   Ours is long and not really littered with guns. That shapes our perspectives. That's why you think we 'live in a police state' and why we're enamoured with it.  However, I think gun rights advocates should stop telling people they live under a 'police state' because 'Us Americans can rise up if we have to'. I just don't think you guys would.	1640960387.0	hqom8dm	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqmy6o9	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqom8dm/

ul0gx	I started to lose trust at the very start of the pandemic:  1) Their guideline to check a person's temperature as a golden standard is UNSCIENTIFIC especially in the adult and geriatric population where fever is an extremely late sign of an infection.  2) Their guideline to wear a face shield, gown, and gloves -- again UNSCIENTIFIC for infection control against an airborne virus.  Since their initial UNSCIENTIFIC guidelines on those measures, they've removed them though many nursing homes still follow those UNSCIENTIFIC measures of infection control.  N95 mask has been the evidence-based, time-proven, scientifically proven PPE for airborne viruses with gowns, gloves, and face shields being used case-by-case depending on PROCEDURES being done or the specific situation at hand.  Just these two items at the very start of the pandemic had a number of healthcare workers questioning the sanity of the people giving the directions.	1640960439.0	hqomc51	t3_rsqjoi	t3_rsqjoi	/r/Conservative/comments/rsqjoi/nbc_finally_asks_cdc_director_the_right_question/hqomc51/

awtaf	Thanks for the link. Yes, this was an interesting / odd statement:  "But, doctors say, that doesn’t always mean that those with the highest    viral loads are most contagious. For example, someone with a higher    viral load but no symptoms may be less contagious than someone with a    low viral load who gets very sick."  If comparing two individuals like that, it would help if all other contributing factors were known constant (age, health status, co-morbidities, etc.). But the statement is unsupported by such info...in any case I wouldn't think the cause would be *random*.	1640961085.0	hqonme0	t3_rsqjoi	t1_hqoky9t	/r/Conservative/comments/rsqjoi/nbc_finally_asks_cdc_director_the_right_question/hqonme0/

Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	1640962327.0	hqoq6vm	t3_rsr767	t1_hqongi0	/r/Conservative/comments/rsr767/more_than_200_marines_have_been_discharged_from/hqoq6vm/
4iiip	I have it right now. My 68 yr old dad got it and passed it on to my wife and sis on Christmas Eve. All 3 were fine within 2 days and had very minor symptoms. My dad had a pretty rough sore throat and his voice sounded like shit, but said he felt fine. My SIL and wife both just had bad headaches and body aches for a day. I didn’t get it originally but with a 3 year old and 2 month old, it was hard to keep my wife quarantined from all us in household. I have same symptoms she had ...pretty bad headache yesterday morning but by nighttime felt pretty good. I feel fine now, a little sore, weak, but pretty good otherwise.  Not my wife and I are unvaxxed.  Dad and SIL were both boosted. I’m thinking we all got omicron, and if so it seems really mild based on what I’ve seen personally. Honestly, if our experiences hold true, then I think we should just let this thing rip amongst the young and healthy.	1640962328.0	hqoq6y4	t3_rstg39	t1_hqoofen	/r/Conservative/comments/rstg39/south_africa_signals_end_to_omicron_peak_and/hqoq6y4/

o8z6o	You actually don't surrender any rights, which has been affirmed by Legislative action and Judicial rulings.  You do, however, agree to adhere to strict rules and regulations, equally backed by federal law.  Vaccine rules in the military can be compulsory, backed by the UCMJ.  But like many rules and regulations in the military, they can be misinterpreted, unethical but still enforced, or not enforced at all.  Military rules and regulations can often be subjective, which is strange when we're taught to strictly adhere to and obey military regulations.  Many Americans fail to realize this but leaders in the military toe a lot gray and ambiguous lines.  Officers, especially, belong to a cadre of bureaucrats that either must toe the 'official' party line or be shown the door.    Senior officers often lose touch with reality, becoming steeped in the political machinations of military bureaucracy.  Those that don't, won't get promoted past 2-stars... If that.  This whole vaccine hoopla was pushed by senior leaders who didn't want to lose their jobs but also wanted to be seen as compliant to civilian authority, no matter how distasteful.  Not taking the vaccines is seen by military leadership as more than a moral fight.  It's seen as a political statement, something the military absolutely preaches against while in uniform.  Really, it's a lose-lose situation for those of us in uniform.	1640962427.0	hqoqehm	t3_rsr767	t3_rsr767	/r/Conservative/comments/rsr767/more_than_200_marines_have_been_discharged_from/hqoqehm/

Does this mean airlines had active and planned flight crews get Covid and have to "call off" or, as a result of past layoffs due to Covid, did airlines over sell tickets relative to the active and available crews?  I'm curious how much of this was due to real and recent new covid spread or how much is due to airlines never getting back to previous number of crew members but selling tickets anyway.	1640964298.0	hqouh5b	t3_rsuez4	t3_rsuez4	/r/Conservative/comments/rsuez4/after_biden_claimed_he_would_end_crisis_one_year/hqouh5b/

a56o304n	Problem with your synopsis is that you make up an alternate reality and don’t mention the obvious point in the movie. You know of no accredited Scientists that have said the world is going to end and the far right base merely questioning the science. Instead people who have made it their life’s work to understanding science, who are the base of everything we enjoy today, from frozen foods, to heart transplants and cell phones, are questioned and often times with rage from politicians who have not study science since 8th grade Like Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma who has a degree in economics  bring a snowball on the Senate floor and ask “What global warming” or have law degrees from Ivy league schools like Kennedy from Louisiana who only became a republican when he couldn’t get elected as a democrat and knows better but plays up the southern Andy Griffin “ aw-shuckins “ draw so he can pander to his base or even worse a Lauren Boebert from Colorado who barely got her GED and all take Big Money ( as portrayed in the movie) from the fossil fuel industries to loudly put those doubts in the voters minds. Instead of acting like the base of the far right is “merely “ questioning the science, instead notice how our representatives on the right never bring in scientific data from any scientists from any part of the world that with numbers show that the 95 % + of scientists got it wrong whether its global warming, covid or even how old the dinosaurs are. We have changed from the party of advancements through science that got us to the moon, to the party of culture war driven by anger that was duped by greed.	1640964848.0	hqovppc	t3_rs9p2y	t1_hqmq48r	/r/Conservative/comments/rs9p2y/dont_look_up_director_adam_mckay_suggests_that_if/hqovppc/

It’s not supported anecdotally either given the increased covid numbers in states that are generally more restrictive like NY when compared to FL. I’m hard pressed to endorse oppressive measures that are backed up largely by a desire for beneficial political optics. Gelber has his eyes on higher office and beach residents shouldn’t have to sacrifice their quality of life so the mayor can score liberal brownie points. His heart isn’t entirely in the wrong place, for example it’s nice to see him attempt to address the spring break and Memorial Day crime spikes, but as far as outdoor mask mandates are concerned I am thankful Desantis put a quick end to that.	1640964875.0	hqovrxn	t3_rsmgo4	t1_hqou5ig	/r/Conservative/comments/rsmgo4/breaking_aoc_caught_in_miami_beach_as_new_york/hqovrxn/

Then hitler was appointed chancellor and a government was formed because they had so many seats. Then a crazy Dutch communist burned down the reichstag and the nazis were able to use that event as a Cassius belli to pass measures that suspended many civil liberties and protections eventually allowing the nazi party to imprison political opponents without due process and create a one party state. The lesson from This is how important our constitution and the checks and balances within our government.

8eetajxa	I’ve gone back and forth with liberals on Reddit on this topic. Every single time they say crime really isn’t that bad and is in fact going down. The weird thing is news agencies are reporting higher rates but if you look at city statistics, for example the NYPD, they claim crime is going down(for murders and shootings). Crime is up for thefts and stuff, so they admit.  My thing is this: these cities are lying about their crime rates. You can’t trust what they say, they want to make their city look good. We all know murders are up, shootings have gone wild, cops are scared to do their jobs. Hell, they’ve been blowing cops away.	1640966030.0	hqoyg5g	t3_rswn9w	t3_rswn9w	/r/Conservative/comments/rswn9w/thirteen_cities_broke_homicide_records_in_2021_as/hqoyg5g/

The military will have eaten itself alive and millions would have already died in whatever series of tragic events lead to it.    I believe you’re correct; today we’re neither more or less “free” because we have easy access to firearms.  From my perspective, I believe I am more safe.

The nomenclature behind the two political parties shifted some time back, but the geopolitical breakdown of the US has hardly budged. If you look at the electoral map of today, it's pretty consistent with the political distribution at the time of the civil war.   The idea that Abraham Lincoln would have aligned with the Republican party of today is silly. He was overwhelmingly in favor of centralizing and strengthening the federal government, and was even called by many noted conservatives of the time a tyrant.   To be clear, I'm a conservative.

Don't agree  Cheaper healthcare - true  Better healthcare outcomes - depends, wait lines are much longer, and more Germans are opting for private healthcare  Higher personal freedom scores - hahaaha, you got me here, maybe compared to Oregon, not compared to Florida  Better infrastructure - ok, that's true  Better labor laws - depends on what you mean by better, it's harder to both hire and fire someone  Less inequality - true, but also harder to succeed as an individual  Less crime - true, but again, so does Switzerland where guns are around  Better consumer protection - questionable  &#x200B;  The truth is - it is all relative, but freedom si definitely what they lack	1640966511.0	hqozkw9	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqnyx6s	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqozkw9/

exbsf	So you feeling safer in your country owning a gun is an argument I can get behind. Completely understand that.  And ironically if I did live in America it would be in a Red state because of their stance on less Government intervention. Hell, I'd probably even own a gun for the same reason as you.   You're a vet, which I should say thanks, by the way, I think all our countries owe a debt of gratitude to our defenders.  I grew up with both parents in the Army. Dad was an instructor and I went to work with him more than once and got to learn firearm safety, loading and even fired an SLR a couple of times. Mum wasn't happy but looking back at it it was a great thing to learn.  But you with your history probably understand my point even better than I do, if it comes to rising up, something has gone horribly wrong. The government would probably be the victors depending on how many service people revolt, but no one would win.	1640966980.0	hqp0oos	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqoymew	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqp0oos/

If he was an honorable man, he would have sent his truck over a cliff, instead he decided to run over innocent people.   Additionally I heard that he tried to flee the scene of the crash, and asked for a translator when talking to police. Oh yea he turned down countless plea deals and thought his reckless actions only warranted traffic violations.

Like, I understand the premise, i would love for all the weapons of war, nukes, guns to be melted down. If we lived in a perfect world.   But that’s a fairy tale, for now.   Germany decided that they would rather have nannies for some reason.  And these nannies, you don’t know the real them. People who pursue power, are very likely to be the worst to give it to.   It’s like you believe everyone is inherently good, and in real life, there are evil people. And a evil person, who’s clever in hiding it, can win support and then perform the evil deeds.  You say the USA has a high crime rate and I say that’s a city problem for the whole world. I’m pretty sure I could get robbed in Berlin, or Baltimore.   No hard feelings, I know you personally didn’t make any decision for your country.   I’m like mostly german,  ancestry wise.

jnab5	The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.

The result was published yesterday. see this and JK Rowling is mentioned: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/guardian-readers-nominate-their-person-of-the-year  Unless there is some clear evidence that it was an actual poll and that there was bar chart or something that showed JK Rowling in the lead, then we shouldn't make an assumption that there some kind of left wing conspiracy.  If there was, why would they mention JK Rowling in the recent article above.  And if they have a person of the year feature - who was the person of the year in 2020, 2019, 2018.	1640967631.0	hqp28kp	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqmbeqt	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqp28kp/

5c9rslgy	The worst part is that many search engines will even show it to you if you're *not* looking for it.  I remember about fifteen years ago I was very interested in photoshop because I wanted to make fake news articles that could completely distort people's sense of reality (so that a new societal narrative could form to take out our evil narcissistic elites).  While I was performing this heroic act of altruism, I got into some celebrity photoshop nudes - because hey, even nerds get horny.  The scary thing is that I'm pretty sure that while I was doing my search for "fake nudes" Google splashed some child porn right on the front page of their search results.  I have no way of knowing for *sure* (because it's impossible to tell just from a picture whether somebody is 17 or 21, especially when Photoshop is involved) but if that turns out to be the case, shouldn't we hold these social media companies accountable and punish them for it?  It bothers me that people could be exposed to child porn without even looking for it, and that there's zero accountability for the evil technology companies who do these things.	1640967647.0	hqp2a1w	t3_rsi0du	t1_hqnaigv	/r/Conservative/comments/rsi0du/hypothetically/hqp2a1w/

Trucking is listed as unskilled labor because of deregulation in the 70s/80s and it allowed them to put any Tom dick or Harry behind the wheel, regardless of how fit they were for the job.  The whole reason trucking is a lower end middle class job is because of scum bags like the guy in the video.  No clue what he’s doing, hauling cheap freight and is a danger to himself and others.

6uj6y	I kinda feel like both narratives are a little off on this one. There was no switch, but there was a significant change.   After the Democrats lost the civil rights movement, the presidential election was a landslide for the Republican Party. In 1972, Nixon won the presidency with an electoral college vote of 520 to 17. The next 2 elections had a Republican president win by 300 electoral college votes or more. So the democrats focused on major population centers. They needed voters and fast. So Democrats started appealing to city dwellers and did a good job of it. And because there is more rural land in the south, it looks like the parties switched. But if you look at a county level, Atlanta has always been Democrat and didn’t change. Rural New York has always been Republican. But there was a major shift from Southern Democrats vs Norther Republicans to Urban Democrats vs Rural Republicans.	1640968284.0	hqp3t0b	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqoufxv	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqp3t0b/

I'm glad that the people from Germany and the Netherlands treat each other like good friends and don't hold onto the past. We should be happy that we can actually step out of our home and not worry about some lunatic with a gun whenever we enter a store, bring our kids to school or being stopped on the road by a police officer.  I don't care whatever kind of response I get by an American by typing this, not if you're fine with the current situation in the USA and not passing gun laws. First work on lowering the amount of school shootings, armed robberies, police brutality, gang violence, gun misshaps (children getting their hands on a gun) by at least taking away guns from people, or by improving living conditions so that people don't feel forced to steal  and getting cops an actual education so they won't act like some damn triggerhappy gunman.	1640968980.0	hqp5itl	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqopt9z	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqp5itl/

My personal measure in whole is "how many people die through an unnormal death in connection with a crime" (not car crashes or sth. like that)  And a big part is homicide and death though guns   I want to walk through a country without worrying about getting killed / mugged or any harm.

h5i3x	Eh, the title makes it sound a lot worse than it actually is. Father has been working on the implementation for Ford where he works as an engineer.  They're called Event Data Recorders, and It's basically a black box recorder similar to those in aircraft.  The EU law specifically made it illegal for these data recorders to record conversations, or transmit information to an external source (such as an insurance company).  It can only record 30 seconds of data at a time, and it is intended to be used by automobile manufacturers and law enforcement to help determine the cause of an accident. Some countries (such as France) decided to impose even stricter laws that the rest of the EU, and the data recorded can only be shared to specific law enforcement authorities.  Granted it still raises *some* privacy concerns. But compared to the connected vehicles that are sold in the United States today, this is nothing. We have vehicles sold in the US that collect WAY more information that what this law enables.	1640969121.0	hqp5vdv	t3_rsxf3z	t3_rsxf3z	/r/Conservative/comments/rsxf3z/always_watching_new_car_models_sold_in_the_eu/hqp5vdv/

The only way you would be able to make this work is if you were able to put all immigrants into some sort of bubble where they couldn’t experience any of the benefits or costs associated with living in the state until the end of their “cool-off” period, which would be unconstitutional for its own set of reasons and would defeat the purpose of a “cool-down” period because they wouldn’t be able to experience how a red state’s policies make it a better place to live and would just continue to vote blue as soon as they can.	1640969123.0	hqp5vli	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqp4qtk	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqp5vli/

96l0br0c	That first link was posted in August of 2021. Not to mention, the CDC is a political agency that is taking direction from the current administration.  Please explain why case counts are higher today than they were 1 year ago. There are less unvaccinated people today than there was a year ago so if the vaccine was effective there should be less chance of spread. Don’t over think this, this is basic common sense. More vaccine should equal less infection (if it’s actually effective at preventing spread)  The argument here was NOT that the vaccine doesn’t help prevent hospitalization or serious illness or death. The argument is that the vaccine is not preventing spread.  If the new goal post is “you need to get the vaccine to stop clogging up the hospital system”, then the government should immediately ban ALL smoking.	1640969264.0	hqp67xv	t3_rsx714	t1_hqp53g7	/r/Conservative/comments/rsx714/california_facing_huge_coronavirus_surge_despite/hqp67xv/

Also now with the EU we have one of the most stable government of all times and right now with the last ELECTION we have a MULTI PARTY government.

v4d0r	Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	1640969577.0	hqp6ztu	t3_rsx714	t1_hqp67xv	/r/Conservative/comments/rsx714/california_facing_huge_coronavirus_surge_despite/hqp6ztu/

I've seen Dr Monica Gandhi literally say that on the news.  https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9/status/1386391476108599298  Maybe a better example is when the messaging was "Get the vaccine, then you won't have to wear a mask".

If successful at that, will they be content, or just keep collecting countries once it's clear they won't be opposed?  Also China could then realize America won't do shit, and take Taiwan. And then whatever country is next.   It could easily spiral into a new world War. Probably would take decades though.   Taiwan and Ukraine have strategic importance.

There was a little tanker boat (little compared to the warships) that would connect to it and drain that water, then it had to sail out into the ocean to dump it. The Engineers that worked on it would tell him about how that was the cleanest water you'd ever find, after all the times it had been heated, evaporated, and condensed, but they had to treat it like toxic waste because of nuclear fear.	1640969914.0	hqp7tbn	t3_rsv5kg	t1_hqowp1d	/r/Conservative/comments/rsv5kg/germany_to_shut_down_all_remaining_nuclear_plants/hqp7tbn/

Someone could own multiple guns, but it only takes one to kill someone. By your logic, a person owning 50 guns who kills ten people is less significant than a person who owns one gun and kills one person. That's one of the dumbest arguments I've ever heard.   The fact that there are so many guns is a direct cause of the greater number of gun related homicides. Otherwise how can you explain why the USA rivals countries like Brazil and El Salvador in numbers of gun related homicide?	1640969923.0	hqp7u4f	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqoeew8	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqp7u4f/

opeqz	This argument always makes me suspicious of the poster.  You must be a troll or wildly ignorant of history.  The Democrats have defended and promulgated sexual deviancy since Andrew Jackson. Yes there’s an R now and then that is deviant, but this is about where the deviant trolls go to hide.  Cockroaches always prefer the darkness so you search the darkness to root them out.  You don’t say “I saw one in the light so we don’t need to find where they live.” unless you’re trying to protect them.  Subsequently your dissembling is precisely the kind of argument that hinders meaningful prosecution of those who are hiding and the victims never get relief.  We need to shine light on the moral darkness and we will find them there in large numbers.  If you can’t rationally identify which party openly supports sexual deviancy, defends their members against prosecution and even promulgates it as a social norm, then you are part of the problem.	1640970081.0	hqp882g	t3_rsi0du	t1_hqn1hgq	/r/Conservative/comments/rsi0du/hypothetically/hqp882g/

The (conservative) government has had 2 years to set something but, but they haven't yet. We already have facilities ready too, it's where we send illegal immigrants. The government has instead gaslighted the public saying it's up to them to deal with it and take personal responsibility, and then complain that no one is travelling. I can't make this shit up.

14kazd	I did click on it and read it (pasted the article below to make sure we are reading the same thing).  The way I read it is that The Guardian is asking their readership who their person of the year is. That's it. The Guardian doesn't have a Person of the Year feature like Time has. Otherwise who was Guardian's person of the year for the previous years?  They just asked folks who their person of the year was and then they published the most popular submissions (and why) here: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/guardian-readers-nominate-their-person-of-the-year  I don't think there is anything shifty going on in this instance.  ---- Original Article: https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/15/tell-us-who-is-your-2021-person-of-the-year  Time Magazine chose billionaire Tesla boss Elon Musk – but who would be your choice?  Time magazine has announced that Elon Musk will be their “2021 person of the year”, citing the billionaire Tesla boss’s influence “for good or ill” as a “clown, genius, edgelord, visionary, industrialist, showman”. The choice has been criticised for Musk’s attitude to tax, opposition to unions and playing down the dangers of Covid.  With this in mind, we would like to hear about your own choices. Who would be your 2021 person of the year, and why?  Share your choice  You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

oxfn4	This conspiracy has been debunked again and again, and can clearly be shown that the supposed party switch never actually happened; this video looks at each of the Dixiecrats and sees how many actually became Republicans. Spoiler alert: Only one. Your grand party switch consisted of ONE PERSON: https://youtu.be/I3LqPedoxSk  What actually switched was the meaning of the word "liberal". In the 1930s, the far left progressive movement began to co-op the use of the word for their own purposes, and over the course of thirty years or so, the meaning of the word did a complete reversal as it became synonymous with progressivism. If you actually read the works of John Locke, often referred to as the "father of liberalism", you'll find his ideals actually line up almost exactly with modern day American conservatives. To anyone that believes the parties switched at one point because Republicans were once considered "liberal": I strongly encourage you to read Two Treatises of Government to find out what liberal actually meant in centuries past.	1640970288.0	hqp8qdh	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqp3fg6	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqp8qdh/

96l0br0c	That is not slowing the spread though. I do agree with you that the current data suggests that the vaccines reduce the severity of the disease but all public policy has been predicated on case counts to which the vaccine is not doing anything to reduce.  Vaccines were never previously invented to reduce symptoms or seriously illness. Traditionally vaccines were for the prevention of transmission.  Treatments to include anti-viral and anti-bacterial therapies were created to reduce symptoms and serious illness.   It might be incompetence or for nefarious reasons, but the goal posts continue to move and stray from conventional infectious disease response.  Ebola made an appearance in the US in 2014 - a much more serious and transmissible disease than covid, and we didn’t see this public policy.	1640970308.0	hqp8s3q	t3_rsx714	t1_hqp6ztu	/r/Conservative/comments/rsx714/california_facing_huge_coronavirus_surge_despite/hqp8s3q/

c87yy	>Ive always disregarded these points as fiction  Su by my count we have two confirmed global pedophile rings, NXVIM, with two big Clinton donors and 12 convictions for trafficking children, and GMaxx guilty on 5 counts if trafficking children. Isn't it weird to know that the Clinton were connected to both?  Is it hard to admit that Jones and Q and Trump were right?  If you count Jimmy Saville that's three, but pizzagate was false im sure, no way the Clintons would be connected to three pedophile rings, right?  It's not healthy to be that delusional.  You might want to see someone about that.  >Like blaming biden for alll the missing children who were smuggled to underground lairs where dems sell them into sex slavery and harvest their adrenachrome?  Yeah, those two million people who came across the southern border this year were most certainly not being trafficked, you can trust sniffy Joe. Biggest human traffickers in history, but the pedos at CNN and Disney protect other pedos, su of course they kill any stories about human trafficking and pedophilia.  I mean it's not like Matt laurer had a rape button in his office and a women had to be carried out unconscious.  Who was that pedo producer at Niclodean?  You really that disconnect from reality. That's not healthy.  >The vax push is not political because it’s proven to save lives.  If that were true then why did more people die in 2021 than in 2020? 450k people died under Biden with three vaccines and therapeutics that weren't available last year.  If the vaccines save lives then why aren't they saving lives? Fauci politicized the virus from the beginning, and potato Joe told people not to trust the Trump vaccine and said no mandate would happen, so why is he forcing the Trump vaccine now?  More signs of delusion.  >It’s not healthy that’s for sure, and it’s further reason why I fear for the future. Because we don’t go searching for news anymore, the news finds us.   First same thing you've said so far.  What your missing is the fact that potato Joe has admitted to working with big tech to shape the narrative (that's a euphemism for creating propaganda and  censoring the truth).    >Claim the dems are trying to destroy the world  They are, potatos build back better slogan was taken from the WEF and if used to push the Great Reset to destroy capitalism around the globe.  He's telling his plan and he thinks you're too stupid to get it.  Looks like he is correct.  >someone’s got to get it thru to the people at fox that the virus, the vaccines, and the insistence on using safety measures to end the pandemic as soon as possible  All of those things have proven to be an abject failure in light of the number of deaths this year. Potato admitted this when he said there is no federal solution.  If you think those things work then explain why Florida with no restrictions is seeing less spread of omicron than New York where they set a record for new cases over triple the previous high this week and have passports, masks, etc?  Back to the delusion.  >Put down the info wars and subscribe to reality.  Didn't I just tell you that Jones was right about the global pedophile rings?  You seen to have a problem with facts.  >If you believe in God, then do what Jesus would do.  You mean go among the lepers without concern for one's own safety instead of hiding in the basement scared of your own shadow?  >If you don’t, then do what’s right for the stranger you may encounter tomorrow or the next day.  I'll never live my life for the collective no matter how much propaganda is produced to try to make it so.  The founders warned about this.  Trading liberty for temporary security is the act of cowards and tyrants.  >And if you just believe in yourself and no one else, then please just stop commenting bc your holding up a return to normal otherwise.   You keep telling yourself that as hundreds of fully vaccinated NFL and NBA players test positive, hundreds of fully vaccinated naval personnel test positive sidelining a critical national security resource. How many fully vaccinated congressman and senators tested positive? How many of the fully vaccinated Texas delegation tested positive after they ran away from their legislative duties to Washington where potato would not see them?  It's time for you to wake up and realize none of this is working, potato did and he's ya boy, right?  Did it hurt for Joe to admit that Trump was right again when he said the state should handle this?  Wake up, step out of the delusion. It's better here I promise.	1640970868.0	hqpa5lx	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqmoy4r	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqpa5lx/

Soleimani is a good example. There's a reason Iran did nothing to retaliate after we killed their general. Asian politics are not the same as western politics.

v4d0r	The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you’re less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It’s been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it’s a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar). You can still get sick, but you’ll get less sick, and you’re less likely to get sick.

Baseline, as you agreed: she took care of people when they needed it most.  That is what politicians should be doing, taking care of their constituents, esp when they need it most.  Skipping out to Cancun is cowardice.  You also agree with me that AOC went from 1 hotspot to another, so there's no 'vacay' here a la Cancun Cruz.  I don't know WHY she's there (this was the first article I read about it, and it didn't cover why she was there either.), but her reputation is one to help and give, not to vacay outside the US, so we'll find out why she's there.

2c130h91	Fair enough, wish we could get rid of our two party system.   I like your optimism. And dude, seriously, seriously, I hope we have moved onto a new age of society. That would be awesome.   Stable, trustworthy, transparent government.   But I’ll just be here, not paranoid. But wary and watchful.   “Today no war has been declared--and however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe. The survival of our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared, no borders have been crossed by marching troops, no missiles have been fired.  If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of "clear and present danger," then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.  It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.  Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.”     War has changed, it may not always mean physical confrontation. Good luck friend, I wish you the best.	1640971544.0	hqpbuna	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqp6rkm	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqpbuna/

Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	1640971562.0	hqpbw9o	t3_rsw2ko	t1_hqparwc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsw2ko/cdc_spreading_the_holiday_fear/hqpbw9o/

They bring in people who can’t read English don’t understand physics and make them sign a contract. They get stuck working for in some cases less than minimum wage, with very little and very poor training. They crash a few times the company fires them. Then the cycle starts again.  The companies self insure to keep from going bankrupt and even with the lawsuits having cheap drivers crash is more profitable than paying expensive drivers not to fuck up.	1640971584.0	hqpby75	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqowdaj	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqpby75/

If you're an educated individual in STEM, the US is way better country with better salaries. The US has better culture. The US has more friendly people.  Not OP but if you consider democracy by the Economist Democracy Index, Germany ranks higher.  According to the Cato Institute Germany and the United States both rank the same on their Human Freedom Index (15th).  In terms of inequality, and according to the Global Social Mobility Index, Germany has higher social mobility than the US ranking 11th vs 27th which would indicate its easier to make it as an individual in Germany than in the States.  In terms of crime I don't think the issue of gun ownership really comes into it that much. Switzerland is often pointed out as an example of a European country with gun ownership but I dont think Americans realise how restrictive gun laws are in that country with gun control legislation that would even make Californian Democrats blush.  However you're right that it is generally all subjective, especially when it comes to culture, and handpicking statistics doesn't necessarily give the you full picture. The US does have significantly higher salaries and per capita wealth.	1640971638.0	hqpc313	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqozkw9	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqpc313/

Even trump told everyone this!  You fucking people are as bad as the left wingers with your bullshit whining and making shit up.   If you're a fat ass who's having a heart attack and a young kid comes in who was hit by a car, you should come second. Your life choice has put you in a situation that has resulted in care being taken from an innocent person. Now if two fat ass people are having heart attacks you care for in order they arrive.  This is what happens when a system is stressed. You have to ration care and it goes to those more viable. Common sense. Not some conspiracy.  And about being infectious still with a vaccine. Yes this was known in 2020. Stop getting your news from the tv and go read actual studies and reports released by the government. The same one you're claiming is hiding shit. The CDC actually released a shit load of information on a continuous timeline.   Next you're going to post some shit about not knowing what's in the vaccine, or some other bullshit.	1640971760.0	hqpcdz1	t3_rswl23	t3_rswl23	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqpcdz1/

And as a boy growing up I remember a few times when American forces visited for joint exercises, they'd often put on family days at Enoggera barracks as a thank you. Huge BBQ's, Pies and games for all the kids.  My sister and I loved it they were always so hospitable and kind.

954a7xbf	No...here's the difference. I believe the federal government should be responsible for 2 things.  Security(military and the Po-Po) and roads.  The rest should be state funded.  Would be a great experiment to have conservative states that back the PO- PO with their federal dollars and liberal states like CA can defund the police. It might make you think that in liberal states/cities like SF, Chicago, Portland, Seattle, NYC, LA they might realize the error of their ways and start re-funding the police.  Oh wait, you mean they are already doing that?  Shocking that liberal shitholes are realizing the errors of their ways and that whole defund shit has pretty much got shut down.

This can both stop an infection before it gets severe, i.e. preventing sickness, or it can help end an infection while it’s going through the body, i.e. treating the sickness.  I mean it won’t prevent the virus from entering the body in the first place, but no medicine does or claims to do that.	1640972748.0	hqpeuio	t3_rswl23	t1_hqpctrw	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqpeuio/

nl1sf	Right, except analogies to the flu shot don’t apply, because each flu shot is for 3 different strains that they think are going to be the most prevalent in the next year, and they don’t repeat the same strain year after year. The booster is still the same alpha strain. And when it comes to the MRNA vaccines it is just the spike part, and does nothing to provide immunity to the other parts of the virus. Studies are showing that the booster only provides an additional 10 weeks of “protection” due to the immediate antibody response, that again wanes.	1640972950.0	hqpfchg	t3_rswl23	t1_hqpd5a0	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqpfchg/

If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past— 5 as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—he may flee to one of these cities and live, 6 lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past.	1640973325.0	hqpg9zg	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqopobj	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqpg9zg/

This is why boosters etc arent a guarantee to work. It's like having a fire extinguisher. Its not there to stop fires from starting. To put them out before they burn down the whole house once they start.  As of now vaccines and boosters only work as a fire extinguisher ever since delta. They help your own immune system to know what it's looking for without having to fight a real fire first. But just like with a fire extinguisher shit can still go bad and the house burns down.   But I'd rather have a fire extinguisher in my house. It's an aide.

awtaf	Agreed that if someone who isn't expectorating, will not likely spread. My point is (was) that given two individuals with comparable health / physical makeups, and a comparable viral loading, it would seem unlikely that one would exhibit symptoms and the other not. Said differently, there could be a fairly healthy individual with a high viral load who doesn't exhibit symptoms and therefore isn't likely to transmit. And the converse - a generally unwell person who is early in the course of the virus with a low viral load but does in fact show symptoms and can therefore likely transmit. The mechanism for transmission is the exhaled virus-containing aerosols (cf. the CDC website if not mistaken), so asymptomatic transmission is rare if ever the case, as I understand it. I *think* we can agree on that.  Regarding your points on the push for masks. I don't disagree as to your points . Further to that, I think the CDC has been disingenuous. They seem to have wanted everyone to *assume* that we are all infected (with no basis to say so), and therefore must mask up / lock down. And seem to have handled rollout of cheap, quick, safe and reliable self-testing *really* poorly, to maintain their authoritarian advantage. They do not want people to be able to confidently say (on the basis of such test) 'I'm not infected so I represent no threat to anyone" or "I'm not infected but I accept the risk to myself from others who might be", and therefore go maskless. The CDC has adopted the  mushroom principle: keep 'em in the dark and feed 'em BS.	1640973404.0	hqpggyr	t3_rsqjoi	t1_hqoq10s	/r/Conservative/comments/rsqjoi/nbc_finally_asks_cdc_director_the_right_question/hqpggyr/

It's real, get vaccinated for fuck sake, you wouldn't have sex with some who you know has STD, whould you now?     I don't get why U.S is so focused on their "freedom", I mean it's great and all but you shouldn't have freedom to endanger a mass of people by mass spreading.

Conspiracy theories are ideas that have little or no basis in facts.   It's possible a deadly asteroid is heading towards Earth and is going to kill us all. If I tell everyone that a deadly asteroid IS heading towards Earth and is going to kill us all, that's a conspiracy theory. If later astronomers discover tangible, reproducible evidence that it really is, THEN it ceases to be a conspiracy theory. Do you understand the difference?

9rie9u5y	To me the interesting part of this is what it says about history . Before the advent of nationalism, it was very difficult to get an army together. You essentially forced a bunch of peasants and serfs to join the army and then they ran away at the first opportunity. So at the time, the loss of 10% would’ve completely demoralized your army because a large portion would run away after such a defeat.   Also, the other word that has an interesting definition is debacle. Debacle is the breaking up of the ice in a river in the spring when it starts to thaw.	1640973930.0	hqphrb2	t3_rsmgo4	t1_hqnk25s	/r/Conservative/comments/rsmgo4/breaking_aoc_caught_in_miami_beach_as_new_york/hqphrb2/

874140hp	Liberalism has become a joke.  It used to be 'I don't agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.'. Which has become 'problematic'*.  It used to be, 'if we do not give fair justice to the guilty, we will not have fair justice for anyone.'. Now the ACLU (my favorite institution way back when) reserve the right for a fair defense for 'worthy' causes.   We've lost sight of the civics that gave rise to the greatest country I'm history.  And I fear that we will never get them back.     * Maybe the most damaging term in modern culture.  It allows someone to attack another's views without making any logical points.

I think people should be allowed to smoke crack and own machineguns, build whatever they want on their property, be unvaccinated etc. But what nobody has a right to do is infringe on the safety of others in public. If you want to smoke crack do it in your home. Want to own a machinegun great but you cant run around on the streets with it legally. Common sense.

dkr8rzcs	Half of those were *never* conspiracy theories. Some of it was unproven at the time, others everyone I knew totally expected.  * Booster shots/perpetual vaccines like the flu? Big fucking surprise. * Shots for children? Did anyone think that wouldn't happen? * Vaccines cause side effects? I don't think anyone said it could *never happen*, just that it is so exceedingly rare that anyeone using that as a reason not to get the vaccine while hospitals fill up with the disease was pretty dumb. * Harder access to care for the unvaccinated is a *lie* even if they deserve to sit in hallways * You listed "New shots" and "3rd and fourth shots" like it's not the same thing  The only one on here that has any legitimacy as both "not being bullshit" and "had significant pushback/mockery last year" is the efficacy of the vaccines and whether the vaccinated can still spread the virus. Of course, anti-vaxxers say that as if being 70% effective means 0% effective, which again, makes one look pretty foolish.	1640974316.0	hqpiozh	t3_rswl23	t3_rswl23	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqpiozh/

zol89	You missed the part where he said listen to the podcast because he explains it. His name is Dr. Peter McCullough and he explains that most people *think* they got it twice, but there’s no proof, especially with the inconsistency in tests. Dr. McCullough pressured the CDC to release information about if it’s possible to get it twice, and then the CDC backed off their messaging about being able to get it twice which is super suspicious. So while there’s no proof supporting being able to catch Covid twice, there’s proof supporting *not* being able to catch it twice, but obviously science always changes so it could be possible.

1lii5tgv	Now you’re splitting hairs. Most people would define “preventing a disease” as being either preventing the disease particle or cause from entering the body in the first place or as stopping said particle from causing any degree of illness. There are billions of bacteria in your body right now and probably a good number of viruses too. But your body responds to them by preventing them from entering your cells and damaging them. Yes, the virus is in your body, but if it doesn’t enter any of your cells, it cannot hurt you. Therefore, having antibodies at the ready to identify and neutralize those virus particles before they enter your cells would be effectively preventing the disease caused by the virus.  If you knew anything about virology, I wouldn’t need to explain this.

The fact that they are so blatant about it under Obama and Biden speaks volumes. How Democrats pretended to be strong on foreign policy during the Trump administration was astonishing. They haven't had a strong foreign policy stance since the 60's. I guess it was sufficient to fool neo conservatives who hated Trump to vote with them.

Over … anywhere? No.  I’d hope that Russia’s target would win. But Russia invading a neighbor poses no real threat to the US. It simply does not have the population, military, or economy to successfully take and hold significant territory.   That’s not “appeasement”.

2sp9bld9	Nothing I said above was opinion - all of that was just basic biology. There’s nothing there to agree or disagree with, and nothing controversial.   So I clicked on your link. His very first statement is that he is the original inventor of DNA and RNA vaccines. Big red flag since that isn’t remotely possible or plausible. Digging further it appears that claim is based on some work on RNA transfection in the 80s - an important piece of work in its own right, but just one experiment and nothing to do with vaccine development. For the record, I too was an mRNA researcher in the late 80s/early 90s. Lots of us were, it was a hot field.  He has a respectable background and pedigree (though there’s an unusual amount of exaggeration in his description) and did some good work 30-40 years ago. But more recently he’s gone in a different direction. He’s made many bizarre or unsupported claims, including a few simple ones that could be easily verified (for example that the FDA had not approved a vaccine when obviously they did).   So honestly I don’t know what this guy’s deal is. What you linked was a propaganda site, not a science site. But no matter why he is doing what he is doing now, I am confident that even he would agree that the basic biology I wrote above is accurate factually correct. That’s not where his agenda goes.	1640975131.0	hqpkpqx	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqokrm4	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqpkpqx/

kcje9	If you're blaming the guns (which is what you're doing), then you must do the correct statistical analysis. The post I was responding to said (essentially) America has a gun problem because it has so many guns. When 99.996% of guns are not used to murder people, then it's asinine to say America has a gun problem.  >The fact that there are so many guns is a direct cause of the greater number of gun related homicides. Otherwise how can you explain why the USA rivals countries like Brazil and El Salvador in numbers of gun related homicide?  Sorry I actually choked on my drink from laughter after reading that. Seriously? Because America has 55x the population of El Salvador and 1.5x the population of Brazil. The US homicide rate for guns is 4.46/100,000 people per year.

3k7lj	And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	1640975460.0	hqplir0	t3_rswl23	t1_hqp8ldp	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqplir0/

To Jews and other "undesirables" things weren't great, but to the average German citizen things were going well.  Schrier mentions it in his Rise and Fall in reference to when War came (September 39) there wasnt the fanfare and flowers of the start of the first world war, people were afraid of losing "the good times" as war footing makes rationing a certainty and luxuries such as vacations scarce.

We're already rapidly solving this very gradual long term concern. Actually, moderate global warming is fantastic. The Earth is colder than optimal for humans and life in general. The only thing we need to worry about is extreme runaway global warming, which looks unlikely with the world rapidly switching to renewables.	1640975861.0	hqpmhq8	t3_rsu0zq	t3_rsu0zq	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu0zq/this_dcarea_publication_warned_that_rising_sea/hqpmhq8/

24efetwj	Most voters aren't "party."  To them, the confederate flag represents *against federal government.*  Having grown up in Virginia and lived in Alabama, I've never seen the flag used to represent slavery.  It's always "southern pride."  The confederacy split because of plantation owners and the politicians that those plantation owners paid, both of whom were a small minority of people.  Think of it like Pfizer and politicians now: policy is formed from The pockets of politicians and the pocket books of their ~plantation~ pharmaceutical owners.   The only difference now is that social media has allowed those bad actors to consolidate the average persons opinion and amplify the extreme aspects of those opinions.  The confederacy split because of slave owners, not southern average people.  To the average person, they just knew the seccession as a response to the trampling of 'states rights' by the federal government in the north... 'war of northern aggression.'  The flag represented southerners, not democrats.  Modern, and especially left leaning, narratives have tied south, southerners, slavery, racism, and the flag all together when in reality there is a great amount of nuance.  Stop focusing on the flag... or consider anyone with a Mexican flag as a possible danger because they might restart the mexican-american war.	1640975880.0	hqpmjfu	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqpcmtc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqpmjfu/
5pddva73	lol, look at our history and you'll find your answer.  They (democrats) are repeatedly on the wrong side of it, however, over time they change the narrative with revisionist history (see racism). The problem is through their control of 24/7 media and social media, they are able to do this almost instantaneously now. I guarantee in 10 years, when kids learn about the covid response of 2020/21 the narrative will be a 180 to what it is now. I mean, look at when the virus first came out, the narrative was lockdowns are racist, vaccines are racist and rushed and cant be trusted, and that is almost 100% forgotten by the general public after a year, because they realized they could use the virus to their advantage.  As we learn more about how useless and detrimental their policies were, they will start changing the narrative, and its slowly but surely happening now, like clock work.	1640975883.0	hqpmjpr	t3_rsze7q	t1_hqpitrx	/r/Conservative/comments/rsze7q/welcome_to_reality_ben_shapiros_thread_on_what/hqpmjpr/

But I'm for the states rights to mandate where you can be in public. Just like I'm for the state being able to dictate to a business what they can and cant do. I like shit free food, and enjoy the luxury of health codes.  You should be allowed to own a grenade, but the state should also be allowed to restrict use and storage as to protect those around you who might not want anything to do with a grenade or the potential harm.  The problem is vaccines where sold as virus proof. It's like the misunderstanding behind less lethal munitions. Shit can still kill you. Just less likely. Same with the vaccine, you can still get sick, just far less likely. And a lot of this is the fault of the media and their constant need to make every issue a political one.

10l2gu	Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	1640976448.0	hqpnxin	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqpjcly	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqpnxin/

Simmons, who at the time was working as a registered nurse, said she started using drugs following the death of her father in 2010. To support her habit, Simmons said, she resorted to stealing and selling drugs.        After her release from prison, during which time she went through a drug treatment program, Simmons was admitted to Seattle University School of Law and graduated magna cum laude in 2017. But when she applied to sit for the bar exam, the Washington State Bar Association voted 6-3 against admitting her.        With the help of another convicted-felon-turned-lawyer, Shon Hopwood, who served time for bank robbery and now teaches at Georgetown Law, Simmons successfully challenged that decision before the Washington Supreme Court. She took the bar exam in February 2018 and was sworn in as an attorney in June of that year.	1640976497.0	hqpo1u1	t3_rsd9yr	t3_rsd9yr	/r/Conservative/comments/rsd9yr/washington_state_looks_to_reduce_sentences_for/hqpo1u1/

And in Buck Vs Bell, SCOTUS let the state of Virginia mandate sterilization for certain people they labeled "feeble minded."  There has been a lot of Jacobson Vs. Massachusetts themed cases in SCOTUS hands recently and of those the ruled that the vaccine mandate can stand even including one where places could deny the right to offer an religious exemption.   \*Do note that Jacobson Vs. Massachusetts was not just about vaccines but "the right of personal liberty is not allays guarantied" as with Buck Vs. Bell where SCOUTS ruled that Virginia could force someone to be sterilized agents their will.	1640976605.0	hqpobgb	t3_rsg5eb	t1_hqnavdo	/r/Conservative/comments/rsg5eb/congressional_republicans_tell_supreme_court_to/hqpobgb/

Science is meant to be questioned, but like I said earlier, those that do the questioning need to have a background of understanding in the subject matter or its not questioning science, its merely a bunch of 5 year olds asking “Why WhY Why” who don’t really want an answer but want to make noise.	1640977118.0	hqppkks	t3_rs9p2y	t1_hqp9vmf	/r/Conservative/comments/rs9p2y/dont_look_up_director_adam_mckay_suggests_that_if/hqppkks/

They can fee morally superior and feel like they are part of something because they lack in their personal lives.

16p6n0	As someone who is busy aggregating data for a few hospitals down here, as far as I can tell, the inpatient time for a majority of the people coming in who actually end up having omicron is only about 2 days at best on average for more than around 60%. Some remain a bit later for observation, but as you said, a surprising amount come in with minor symptoms, eg sporadic cough, dry throat, *oddly large number of head cold like symptoms*.   *Oddly enough the largest bed hog for long term inpatient we have now at some of the locations happens to be folks forgetting to get their flu shot and getting a bad case of this year's flu, with a surprising amount coming in thinking they got omicron, but having the flu to boot.* We also have a bunch of kids coming in with stuff like RSV which happens rather often around this time of year.  Once again though, maybe it's in different parts of Tarrant at large, but from what I can tell, we have a much lower bed load and ER time compared to what we had back when the previous variant was kicking off, I'd guess mainly due to the lack of this variant having large effects for most people.   I do wonder to what extent we have some RSV / Flu / other respiratory illnesses being chalked up as omicron too, we have had a few folks come in with omicron on their coattails with the flu, while some just don't seem to test well with the ER rapids at some locations, with a few outliers that just don't seem to generate a good test for reasons I can't find out.   The influx will increase as you say, however I'm currently a bit more worried about the flu and other respiratory illnesses hogging beds for extended amounts of time, as stated before, a vert large chunk of the folks coming in that have omicron have minor issues that recede after a very short time, most not even needing admission, while it is the season for a number of other bad respiratory illnesses to boot.	1640977567.0	hqpqnzh	t3_rsbitz	t1_hqoah4c	/r/Conservative/comments/rsbitz/overpanicked_new_yorkers_are_clogging_up_911/hqpqnzh/

fvccs	It's fine if you want to criticize these for what they are, but neither of these are camps for the unvaccinated. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike are treated the same by both of these. NY is looking into forced quarantine of infected people and Australia is forcing quarantine of travelers returning from abroad (and maybe also of infected people from what I could find).  This kind of stuff is likely why the top comment is asking for a source on camps for the unvaccinated. You can try to look it up yourself and find tons of articles about things like these where governments are forcing quarantines in camps/hotels/hospitals/wherever for one reason or another. But crucially, none of the reasons seem to ever actually have anything to do with being unvaccinated.	1640977615.0	hqpqs3x	t3_rswl23	t1_hqp9os6	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqpqs3x/

You are right it shouldn't be political, it isn't political but it was made political when they made it political. Everyone has the right to choose what is right for them without the govt forcing it on them.  Our country is not similar to any other country. We were created on the basis of personal freedom and fighting against tyrannical govt, our constitution is the product of that. It is in our blood to have a reasonable distrust for the govt esp after they seem to be turning the country more and more into a European country.

9yyyacap	hippy "drank acid by the gallon" trash.  Very different breed.  The Grateful Dead built something to last.  They created something that can be productively, perpetually maintained if willing maintainers are willing to step up to the plate, and they have so far.  Their live performances with tapes freely traded and frequent free performances in their heyday make them feel like early Twitch streamers to me.  They were early on exploiting merchandising at live shows (band t-shirts have not always been a thing!) to break free of reliance on excessive industry control of the artistic process.  Their outlaw attitude spoke to the American craving for freedom and autonomy, not of rioting and destruction.  They promoted peace, but not submission or communism.  Their lyrics are deep, poetic, and meaningful.  Their influences are diverse, but then the psychedelic element added to the creative process was original.  To me they are like the "Ghostbusters" of music.  The fun is that they take the supernatural and absurd and make it look like just another blue collar day at work.  No big deal.  They were relentless workers and they had fun doing it. That's one of the sounds of America at its best.	1640978431.0	hqpsqfh	t3_rsw260	t1_hqp4dvv	/r/Conservative/comments/rsw260/i_wasnt_prepared_for_this_level_of_based_this/hqpsqfh/

2sp9bld9	Note that I said nothing about what I think people should do with their own bodies. I am anti mandate for most things though I believe there are legitimate exceptions (healthcare, military). I’d really rather not need monoclonals myself. I’d take them in a life or death situation (unlikely) but my chronically ill kid is dependent on a similar infused biological, so I’m very aware of the downsides. However I wasn’t warning against it or even expressing an opinion on monoclonals, just pointing out that it cannot make you immune.   I don’t think I will look further - too many red flags in what I’ve seen already. There are so many better sources of information. But what I wrote was sufficiently basic and uncontroversial that Dr Malone would not disagree. I seriously doubt he claims monoclonals confer immunity. It just isn’t possible and he would know that.	1640978515.0	hqpsxnu	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqpp3tx	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqpsxnu/

oxfn4	No. Slowly and gradually the demographics shifted- by time the "deep south" was voting solidly red, segregation wasn't even a talking point anymore. This is also addressed in the video as it looks at how long after the Civil Rights Act it took for the constituents in question to finally elect Republicans- since you refuse to watch the short video, I'll save you a click: The average was 23.5 years. Enough time for an entire generation of new voters to come in with very different ideals.  Also, if there was a party switch, why do we still have the same players on each side? Why didn't the progressives switch to being Republicans? Why didn't the NRA flip over to the Democrats? Why didn't Planned Parenthood become Republicans? Why didn't the "religious right" start voting Democrat?	1640978645.0	hqpt94a	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqppy06	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqpt94a/

Conservatives made it political fyi  you think your country was the only one born out of tyrannical government? you realise Britain controlled half the world at one point. a lot of those countries also fought for their freedom. in many cases for a lot longer than America. ireland for example fought for 800 years because we are a much smaller country.   Eastern European countries that used to be in the Soviet Union or neighbouring it, are also well known to have a distrust of their government. but at least they can say it was in the last 50 years they gained their freedom and still have dictatorships or such corruption to have it in all but name.

a3wbdvta	> The FDA Approves Biogen's Dubious Alzheimer's Drug. In what Science Magazine's pharmaceutical expert Derek Lowe called "one of the worst FDA decisions I have ever seen", in June, the Food and Drug Administration approved Biogen's antibody drug Aducanumab to treat Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that the agency's science advisory committee reviewed the drug's evidence for efficacy and unanimously voted against its approval. Biogen's own studies found that the drug didn't seem to have any salubrious effect on patients' Alzheimer's symptoms, though it did appear to clear amyloid plaques in their brains. For a long time, these plaques were thought to trigger Alzheimer's, but now scientists are moving away from the theory after numerous failed drug trials.  >Biogen set the price of Aducanumab, now under the brand name Aduhelm, at $56,000 per year, an outlandish cost for the unproven drug. Preparing for its widespread use, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced the largest ever Medicare price hike. It remains to be seen if Aduhelm will be broadly prescribed.   Sounds like the FDA is only considered infallible in regards to doctors wanting to treat COVID with anything other than Remdesivir.	1640979083.0	hqpubfe	t3_rt0wx2	t3_rt0wx2	/r/Conservative/comments/rt0wx2/the_biggest_junk_science_of_2021/hqpubfe/

b5wj4	Well, that was just straight up sarcasm.  But personally, I think Ted Cruz did not have a need to be there. The power outage was a state problem and there was no request for federal assistance. He didn't need to get involved.  As for AOC -- not much she can do, so I don't think she particularly needs to be there either. But I do think it sends a shitty message that her district is in the middle of a "COVID emergency" (whatever that is) and she just hops a plane to Florida.	1640979151.0	hqpuhcc	t3_rsz1on	t1_hqpqz9i	/r/Conservative/comments/rsz1on/leftist_hypocrisy_never_fails_to_disappoint/hqpuhcc/

Help shelters, hand out supplies, give updates on the situation.  Another difference, covid doesn’t necessarily hit kids/young people hard. Unlike freezing/no food/no gas/no water/no electricity that put people into and kids at risk. Some even dying.  I get where the argument is coming from, but yes.

Trying to impart mandates that go against that document is. You wouldn't say that freedom of speech is political until someone tries to make legislation to stop it.

In philosophy it's called "proving a negative" and a person demanding such a thing is intellectually bankrupt. This is why in our justice system we have "innocent until proven guilty". It means a position must be substantiated based on the evidence. Democrats and democrat allies have a serious moral problem when it comes to rapists and pedophiles. Saying "What about Republicans" where there is no such evidence is deflection and nonsensical.   Major institutions have a bias towards Republicans. If you don't like the FBI example.

9b236nyx	Ironically, probably not a bad idea. Nuclear power is a fragile system, and as worldwide IQ trends down (the trend is sharpest in Western countries), it's unlikely that in, say, 100 years we will be capable of maintaining a nuclear powered society. Catastrophic nuclear accidents are a near certainty.   I mean, just think about - these things cannot co-exist.  1) Standards of education and employment that focus entirely on equity rather than achievement or competence  2) Massive immigration from third-world populations  2) Safe, nuclear powered societies  And, however much you hate it, the first two do not seem to be going away any time soon. Even if we abolished #1 (and we should), #2 is considered by almost all decision makers to be a question of morality rather than practicality. Overall, it's forward-thinking to ban nuclear power with that in mind.	1640981190.0	hqpzfff	t3_rsv5kg	t3_rsv5kg	/r/Conservative/comments/rsv5kg/germany_to_shut_down_all_remaining_nuclear_plants/hqpzfff/

Get out of here with that mess you know good and well you or no one has ever thought about the unvaccinated until now and the spin on severe illness only came AFTER the transmission and infection part was shown to be a failure.  Also with the bullet proof vest while they can fail it is almost unheard of as long as it is going against the rated calibre.

2sp9bld9	We pretty much know the downsides for both. The problem with monoclonals is that pouring protein directly into veins is something the body will never be happy about. The immune system tends to assume the source is a parasite or viral infection, and tries to fight back. Repeated exposure makes it worse. For my son’s, the peak reaction onset is the 4th infusion but he had to have his first 12 treatments in the pediatric ICU. (Imo his doc was overly cautious though. I spent way too much time in the PICU which is such a tragic place we were delighted to be promoted to the pediatric cancer center.) So this really is not suitable as an ordinary treatment. I’m hopeful for some of the others.   The biggest downside to biologicals is the manufacturing and production, which is complicated and massively expensive, and requires a specialized plant (you can’t just repurpose another facility). That’s presumably why we have an unsolvable shortage. But they’re also high margin. People concerns about vaccine profits need to look closer at that. My son’s treatment costs have run into the millions and our health insurance costs are extreme.   My son is doing well. Some people have manageable reactions, some severe, and some have to discontinue treatment, but we got lucky and he has remained on the low end.	1640981266.0	hqpzlu8	t3_rrzbwy	t1_hqpurh7	/r/Conservative/comments/rrzbwy/doctors_outraged_after_biden_regime_shuts_down/hqpzlu8/

14pfgz	I do get it, they are completely different examples. If a president threatens a country’s sovereignty of an ally presumably, how is that the same as a foreign country threatening invasion?  Evacuating non-essential people does not compromise the strength of a country’s sovereignty. Risking peoples’ lives over the minimal benefit of keeping them there does not threaten the integrity/sovereignty.  Those people are not there to fight a war or support a war effort, they non-essential staff that are basically to keep a relationship with a country open. They aren’t the people supporting that relationship, they are related to the people supporting that relationship.

Also some of the more extreme right wingers often like to talk about violent revolution.   you should see where the idea of "fake news" came from.  just pointing out similarities. not saying you go for the same ideals or anything more.  In terms of the masks, health experts are the only people who should be listened to. Trump, DeSantis, Cruz, Jordan etc made it political by trying to change it from health advice to something else and play it to their base. Pretty sure the founding fathers didn't envisage needing masks or vaccines etc.   Also who gives a sh!t about wearing a mask. It's a mask. it's nothing invasive. it's like complaining to a restaurant that says you need to wear shirt and shoes. would you go claiming freedoms for that?

4fxxyr7c	I'm conservative when it comes to economic issues and government waste. But more left leaning when it comes to social issues. We are a rich country, nobody should be without, but nobody deserves luxury without earning it either, but we can easily afford to meet the basic needs of all people of this country. And already spend the money, we just need to remove the waste.   Everyone deserves the freedom to live how they want as long as they arent unnecessarily infringing on the rights of another.   To a degree we all have to have a little infringing done on us to live in a functioning society. But it shouldnt remove our rights to still be free, and should only take place when it's to prevent us from harming another person or our country, within reason.   This is why I support the EPA. But if tomorrow the government outlawed combustible engines because of the pollution, I'd be against it, as it would cause unnecessary hardships on those who couldnt afford to transition to an electric vehicle.   If the government wanted to push companies with tax incentives to make my air better, I'm for it.   I'm against vaccine mandates, but I'm all for the government saying during a public health crisis that you cant be involved in certain public functions because of your choice to not get vaccinated.  I also think the government is responsible for supplying masks etc if they're going to make it a requirement. This is why we pay our taxes, not to support another nations efforts to provide masks for their people etc. Charity at home first and after that we fix the world. Dont get me wrong, supporting other countries is great and helps to prevent countries like china from getting a foothold. But anyhow rant over lol	1640982355.0	hqq265r	t3_rswl23	t1_hqpzg07	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqq265r/

n293u	The guns themselves aren't the problem. The incredibly easy access to guns is the problem - that's what gun control laws are supposed to address.  Do you not understand that? I'll break it down - a gun is an inanimate object. You can't make a law and expect a gun to follow it. People are not inaminate objects so what you can do is make laws that people follow. Gun control laws are directed at how people use and access guns, not the guns themselves. Take away the easy access to guns and you get less gun related deaths...as can be seen in every other developed country in the world.   How is this not a problem to care about? Are you saying that having the highest rate of gun related deaths of all developed countries isn't something that matters? Five year olds having to do active shooter drills at school isn't a problem?

In the US it seems like a whole other issue - guns are already widespread, and the crime rates are so high. I don't like guns - but USA is kind of already committed - banning guns would just result in the "good guys" giving the up, those who actually intend to use them in a criminal fashion wouldn't really care about breaking another law.	1640982912.0	hqq3gba	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqnoa8n	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqq3gba/

And now you are trying to cover for being wrong by pretending to not know what you are talking about. Well, maybe you aren't pretending.  > Did i say he strictly worked for texas?  Yes you did, by calling him a state senator. Texas is one of a number of states that has a state senate, and the term used to reference them is state senators. The reason I bring it up is that state senators are part of the Texas Legislature, which is responsible for running the state of Texas. If Cruz had actually been a state senator, as you claimed, then the criticism would have been pretty reasonable, since he would have been part of the body that was directly responsible for the policies that led to the power failure.  As for AOC, I don't care that she fled the shithole that is New York, I care that she went to the state she has endlessly shit talked. Also, given that she was one of the loudest voices calling out Cruz, she absolutely deserves the same treatment herself.	1640982962.0	hqq3kki	t3_rsz1on	t1_hqpzt4x	/r/Conservative/comments/rsz1on/leftist_hypocrisy_never_fails_to_disappoint/hqq3kki/

Who do you think like Calvin Coolidge? Modern Republicans do. Many conservatives see him as one of the best presidents. Democrats hate him and often blame him for the Great Depression. Who do you think likes FDR? Modern Democrats do, they see him as a hero. Conservatives hate him and think he did irreputable damage to this country.  If the "parties switched" somewhere between the 1960 to the 1990's, this wouldn't be possible. How could people who switched parties like politicians 100 years ago from their same party?

wl1wg	Then why are the majority of cases now vaccinated (in places like Israel and the UK the percentage of hospitalizations is weighted more towards vaccinated than the actual vaccination rate among the population). It’s not making them spread the virus, but it’s showing to offer zero reduction in transmissibility.   I can agree with you here.   Nope, not gonna agree with you on this point. Safe storage laws are just a way to restrict law abiding citizens ability to protect themselves. My owning a firearms, as long as I’m safe and responsible with it, has zero to do with my neighbors. If I start firing it without cause, that’s a different story.   The vaccines were touted as reducing transmission by 94% when first released (its why I got one, to protect my wife who was pregnant at the time). Turns out that’s for like all of two weeks, and the new variants are showing the original vaccines as doing nothing for transmission (maybe cause our bodies are only thought to fight one tiny piece of the virus, who would have thought that’s a bad idea). Now with omicron this is all pointless. This shit will continue to get more transmissible, and less deadly (which is what happens with literally every other virus). But what won’t happen is politicians relenting control if they can stop it, and the pharmaceutical companies giving up that booster gravy train. Which is why they continue to push the “infection rate” which is a bullshit stat, instead of hospitalization rate (which has been dropping steadily). The only two numbers we should have ever cared about are hospitalizations, and death rate. Everything else is meaningless.	1640983171.0	hqq421u	t3_rswl23	t1_hqpnh28	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqq421u/

Boosters only reduce your chance of infection rather than your chance of hospitalization/death, which are mostly conferred by just one shot of anything. And are low even if you're unvaccinated unless you are old and sick. So, yeah. Getting boosted is delusional. You're going to get COVID. Likely many times throughout your life.	1640983989.0	hqq5zk1	t3_rsuqll	t3_rsuqll	/r/Conservative/comments/rsuqll/cdc_now_treats_unvaccinated_the_same_as_unboosted/hqq5zk1/

I think it's mostly because I see more Dems trying to do some of the things I want to happen. I feel like the left is a lot less culty right now too.   For air quality I think it should be a split between raising taxes on the largest polluters and giving other incentives to the companies who are trying to do better.   There is definitely a bit too much of us putting our money to other countries when we have some major issues at home, like you I can see the benefits but we have to take care of our own.	1640984097.0	hqq68qu	t3_rswl23	t1_hqq265r	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqq68qu/

But I stuck around for a minute here to see if there were any just plain old middle of the road folks.  And it all  started by looking at how to cook pork shoulder sousvide.  There are plenty of people out there that are getting bent out of shape for X reason, and just as many people getting  bent out of shape for anti-X reason.  I guess my point is that there are plenty of people on both side of the fence that act like idiots.    As far as my own energy.  I'm fine.

I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that.

He doesn’t have to conform to any one thought as long as he treats people in school with respect.  Right?

It was 'who is your person of the year' My person of the year is different to your person of the year. So they just listed a selection of the submissions. So essentially it was - "send in your nominations" and not "vote on who should be person of the year"  I agree that they shouldn't be so biased against JKR, but in this instance there is nothing shady going on. They did mention JKR in the results. They could have easily left her out.

14eywgy2	What am I missing? That article intentionally pulls pieces of the quote instead of the full quote to try and make some completely fabricated perjury claim. " I can’t imagine any circumstance in which the PATRIOT Act would be used in the circumstances of parents complaining about their children, nor can I imagine a circumstance where they would be labeled as domestic terrorism." Which basically means the policy is complain away all you want and draw attention to any issues you would like as a parent. Nobody will label/track this comments under the terrorism label.  It's when those parents threaten physical harm against elected officials that they have the potential to end up on a domestic terrorism watch list. Parents aren't being targeted. People who threaten elected school board officials are being targeted. Some happen to be parents. The alternative would be to not label those threatening attacks as potential domestic terrorists solely because they are a parent. That scenario would make no sense as it has no bearing on the threat itself.  The full quote makes complete sense. The first amendment is being respected. Nobody appears to be labeled due to their views.  I don't really understand the controversy of tracking those who make threats of harm against elected officials over lawful decisions made as an elected official.	1640986157.0	hqqb013	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqq9lyx	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqqb013/

6wjjn	Huh? She made an entire statement that was wholly transphobic to the point where practically.. well.. everyone not right leaning condemned her for it.  My point was obviously not that she's transphobic. It was that if the left is somehow "wrong" for ostracizing Rowling from the left for being a transphobe, that's not much different from e.g. the right being "wrong" for ostracizing a white supremacist. Or are you telling me white supremacists belong on the right?  anyway, my point was meant to be a jab at how ridiculous the hard political lines in the US are and that garbage human beings should be criticized by all  sides, and that it isn't wrong for the left *or* the right to criticize people for their fucked up views.	1640986724.0	hqqcaog	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqq53mj	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqqcaog/

Intelligence: 4 Smart enough to graduate from Boston College. Not smart enough to think critically about things her professors said. Mixes a mean cocktail.   Character: 3 Thinks she's morally better than everyone else. Still wants others to pay for her student loans even though she makes $175,000/yr. Is basic as fuck.   Average: 4.16/10 Summary: Looks are the best thing about her, and even that's being generous.

AOC is worse because she's a hypocrite but Cruz shouldn't have left. Also, Ted Cruz is loaded. He could afford to cancel all of it but you can cancel hotels and get a refund anyway, and flights you can usually transfer to another date or turn it into an open ticket which is like store credit.  Ted Cruz is a two faced POS RINO. He trashed Trump during the 2016 primaries and you can tell he's just being two faced and doesn't like our true president. He's a liar and I don't trust anything he says.

Yes, having zero state income taxes is awesome, but that is not the reason people are moving here. We've had no state income taxes forever. So why are people moving here?  Taxes.  Where do you think our tax money comes from?  We have a 6% bed tax (hotel tax) here. Our public services are paid for by the generous folks that visit our beaches and theme parks. When you plop $500 for a week at the days inn, our government takes their cut.  Tourists pay our state taxes for us!!  Yes, Florida has other industries outside of tourism.... But only one of them literally pays the bills.  Florida stayed opened because government paychecks literally depended on it.  Could you imagine how much money Tampa would have lost last year if they had a fanless Superbowl.  "Can't drink a beer with a mask on" - Ron DeSantis  In conclusion, people are moving here because the risk of any coronavirus restrictions are zero because tourism not only effects the local economy....

It is not my fault you are okay with state control of media or your life, but others are not okay with it, and it is a fact that the Democratic Party is the main, and quite frankly only one at this time partaking in such activities, while using racist ideologies to perpetuate their agenda.   But, since you are socialist, it can be inferred that these are all things you support, so what is the use in even pointing it out?   You enjoy it, that much is obvious.

It is easy to not offer a contract to a teacher in years 1-3, after that it becomes much more difficult requiring much more documentation.   Lastly, there is a nationwide teacher shortage so replacing them will be very difficult.   I teach in GA, we do not have strong unions but most teachers are members of one union or another.

Just speak your mind (on here and irl) and they will come forward. You can also be friends with people that have a difference of view points. Most liberals I know are perfectly fine with me and I fit in with them. We just don't agree on politics.

At this point in the pandemic, we should care about the hospital system, because they care for everyone- my neighbor with diabetes, my grocer with cancer, whatever (all hypothetical)… covid still puts people in the hospital, and the hospitals are stretched thin. If you know someone that needs care, you have experienced this.   We’re not out of this. We might be in the next year.

So he was speeding and realized the brakes were not working. Even after realizing they were not working he didn't take any opportunity to stop himself.  "In Colorado multiple sentences are required to be served concurrently, it’s the law. He got 20 years for each person he killed who burned alive trapped in their cars. I have no pity for him and no one else should either."  So it was state law he be sentenced to this long.  "He tried to claim he couldn’t read the traffic signs because they were in English, but he passed the written CDL test which requires that you be able to read all traffic signs and directions in English. Sorry, but he’s got no excuse."  [Article this is from](https://theloadstar.com/truckers-in-colorado-protest-drivers-110-year-sentence-for-fatal-pile-up/)  I don't know why people are defending him.

l8d2d	Most of this involved opinions, which weren't verified yet. That's been the "conspiracy" problem this whole pandemic. Lots of opinions flying around without proof, then a lot of chest beating when science proved that opinion or science dictated a response from the government.  Science isn't exact, especially when data and details are still being discovered. New details and data can and will change scientific opinion. No one is lying to you, they are just informing you about what the current data supports. That can and will change, which is why you hear about it.  Recent example, the quarantine recommendation changed. Not some deep state conspiracy, they've just had two years of data to look at and determined the current recommendation was too long, and announced the change in stance.

But on the opposite end, I've also worked in non-union factories, and not all, but some bosses downright take advantage of their hard workers, and never give them any breaks or push them too hard to the point they have permanent bodily damage.

The new tests (which begin in 2022) are sensitive to covid and the flu, while existing tests (developed in February 2021) are only sensitive to covid.  This makes it very easy to see that a statement such as "the tests didn't discriminate between the flu and covid" is a false statement, because we know that the tests that have been available to date are not sensitive to the flu.	1640988711.0	hqqgs7b	t3_rswl23	t1_hqqemuy	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqqgs7b/

4x9uv	It’s worse than hypocrisy.  In AOC’s case, she engaged in actions that sit directly in opposition to her policy views and her opinions regarding Florida and DeSantis.  With Cruz, him going on vacation with his family was not some contradictory or hypocritical thing. He wasn’t undermining any of his own views or positions.   So AOC attacked Cruz even though he did nothing wrong, and now she was found guilty of committing the act that Cruz didn’t even commit.  Hypocrisy would mean that Cruz did something wrong, AOC attacked him for it, and then she committed the same wrong action. But Cruz did not do anything wrong, whereas AOC did, so that’s worse than hypocrisy.	1640989191.0	hqqhvgx	t3_rsz1on	t3_rsz1on	/r/Conservative/comments/rsz1on/leftist_hypocrisy_never_fails_to_disappoint/hqqhvgx/

The guy honestly sounds guilty as hell and doesn't appear to me a mere mistake. Now, is that 110 year mistake? Probably not but 10 years sounds way too light given he killed four people and injured many dozen more.  There is also something to say about mandatory minimums seeing how they can result in something as kinda ridiculous of a sentence as that albeit some may disagree with that and say he should get those 110 years.  > If the trucking company he worked for had been negligent in their maintenance I am sure they would have been the one in a court room not him  No idea what is going on with that either but it seems if there was something there that was criminal they would have. They may have felt it was merely Civil and that will be up to the victims to take that up.	1640989536.0	hqqinh4	t3_rsxj3z	t1_hqpxnlf	/r/Conservative/comments/rsxj3z/governor_steps_in_to_cut_truckers_prison_term_by/hqqinh4/

h5i3x	They can file for appeal, but they would have to convince the court the case is worthy of an appeal.  Typically you cannot simply “redo” a trial, you can’t file an appeal simply because you disagree with the verdict. BUT, if appropriate process was not followed or some legal error was made during the course of the original trail you can appeal the decision.  I wasn’t on the jury and I won’t pretend to know what Minnesota law is. But from what it sounds like at least some of the jury did think that Officer Potter made a mistake and she was remorseful of that mistake. But making a mistake doesn’t mean the law doesn’t apply—I can be ticketed for speeding even though I honestly just didn’t see the speed limit sign, for example.  But if the court did feel like she made a honest mistake, that (typically) helps when it comes to sentencing.	1640989587.0	hqqirkq	t3_rt4b2e	t1_hqqfiv7	/r/Conservative/comments/rt4b2e/juror_kim_potter_made_mistake_but_was_still/hqqirkq/

p72ep	The New Jersey Governor just beat it to Costa Rica for 9 days during a HUGE Christmas covid outbreak in his state (still not back). That is arguably worse for the leader of a state to split, someone who (according to him) can really do something. What does that say to an already fragile population when their leader takes off to another country during a pandemic resurgence. "I'm heading to the jungles of Costa Rica for 9 days.....Good luck everyone!". That's a good look for the states top official, way to lead. Like when the last governor here shut down the shore for budget reasons then brings his family and friends to sit on on the beach while another certain poor sap took his one week vacation that year to spend time with his family at the shore but could not even go to the beach. Its sad but none of these "leaders" really care about the regular people (on either side of the aisle). They are all of the protected class and don't need to worry anymore about paying rent or buying groceries.

h74cf7a9	There is no bullshit but you're 21 and stupid. Things change. The experts were wrong. In many countries they predicted no 2nd wave and then no 3rd wave. But that's okay, because you live and you learn. Don't stop learning now though. You need the extra shots simply because of the mutations. It's not complicated. If the experts had been really really really pessimistic in their predictions, they might have told you last year that you would need to get 3 or 4 shots. You hope for the best and plan for the worst. The reason you will likely need more shots in the future is because idiots aren't getting their shots. It's really that simple. So keep your head down and follow the instructions. No one is trying to control you, no one is trying to fool you. This isn't the dystopian nightmare like the idiots that have already replied to you will claim. Take the shots for yourself and everyone else, even the idiots that couldn't graduate grammar school. YOU should be too smart to deny it.	1640990803.0	hqqlgq7	t3_rswl23	t1_hqozj3p	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqqlgq7/

No scientist has EVER said anything like "this is how it is and there is no other possible explanation" - because that isn't science. That's literally why they call theories theories. A theory is simply a set of conditions that have YET to be DISproven.

1g1c51jq	We're not talking about opinions, we are talking about scientific facts.  There is not yet a strong scientific consensus on this topic yet.  The CDC has not circulated a strong stance on this topic, and that is very likely due to this simple fact.  If you are privy to a peer-reviewed study on many cases with conclusive results, and another study that has independently confirmed those results, I am very keen to see it.  But as far as I am aware, those do not yet exist.  Here is a list of the papers I am aware of on this topic:  - [August 13 2021 - Cavanaugh et al. found that vaccinated people were less likely to be reinfected than unvaccinated.  However, the study was only 246 case-patients and 492 controls.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm)  - [November 11 2021 - Pulliam et al. posted this to medRXiv, so it is not yet peer reviewed.  They had 35,670 reinfections among nearly 2.8 million participants and found that Omicron was associated with increased reinfection rates, but they also note that the data is also consistent with no change in chance of reinfection.  Far from conclusive.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.21266068v2#disqus_thread)  - [November 16 2021 - Sheehan et al. found that reinfection chance was very low, but the study size is quite small -- 68 reinfections out of 1278 that had been previously infected.  Far from conclusive, but it is peer reviewed at least.  - [November 24 2021 - Abu-Raddad's correspondence with NEJM, which found 1304 reinfections out of 353,326 infections.  Of those 1304, none resulted in severe illness or death.  This is a markedly different reinfection rate than the Pulliam et al. preprint despite having a similar order of magnitude of cases.  And that's it, as far as I know.  There is no consensus on this topic for the CDC to write extensively about it.  So yes, I will call you willfully ignorant if you expect the CDC to write extensively about a topic that is being actively studied.  That only serves to confuse lay people, as we have seen happen multiple times since the beginning of the pandemic.	1640991060.0	hqqm120	t3_rswl23	t1_hqqhpf8	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqqm120/

However Blue politicians can do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whoever they want without anyone batting an eye anymore and never be seen as anything less than a savior to the mindless Lib's. Hell, AOC and Pelosi could literally gun down an entire BLM protest themselves and Left wing supporters and the media would STILL find a way to glorify and justify their actions, jerk them off, AND make it the right wing's fault, " Well it's Trump's fault because, uh..., uhm...well...it just is because I say it is!"	1640991101.0	hqqm49c	t3_rsxxft	t1_hqqkykg	/r/Conservative/comments/rsxxft/after_maxwell_verdict_people_wonder_how_is_bill/hqqm49c/

9g39tb18	Absolutely correct.  To me the question is gross negligence on the part of the driver and the truck owner.    Part of the problem is a heavy truck is you guess at which low gear to use.  If he doesn't know that traffic is stopped at the bottom of the hill he will guess wrong.  Once that happens your brakes wont save you.  They will over heat and fail.    100% agree he should have taken the ramp.  But, the ramp destroys your truck and gets you fired to so one want the ramp until they know they are out of control.  I think, that he knew he was beyond stopping and missed the ramp, because he was freaking out.	1640994285.0	hqqt1eu	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqq0y6l	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqqt1eu/

5xpfs	Gender since it's use of as a word was interchangeable to sex. It was an invention in the last 20 years to claim it had a separate meaning. It's effectively redefining a term to suit an agenda (which is what the left does across the board). The new definition of gender is effectively what "personality" is. Except they try to pretend they can classify personalities into 63 genders (hint there are way more than that).  It's effectively a position the left took to cover their bases so they weren't denying basic biology on the subject while trying to remain correct on their argument. Similar thing they do for abortion. A fetus is not a "person", yet they can't deny it is human and alive (at least the intelligent ones). For some reason the movement has decided that recognizing scientific facts is now hateful. So now they are attempting to redefine sex itself. Or in case of Rowling, they are claiming that declaring biological sex has any value in a discussion is evil. Which is funny as the entire Feminist movement is based on that exact premise.  So what you are seeing is one of the pillars of the left, feminism, is being gutted by this new movement. And a few feminists are intellectually honest to understand that all that they have fought for is being destroyed. This movement is doing infinitely more damage to women than any misogynist had ever dreamed of doing.	1640995918.0	hqqwjef	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqqqj30	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqqwjef/

1ijqxzo1	Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	1640996485.0	hqqxq4v	t3_rsz1on	t3_rsz1on	/r/Conservative/comments/rsz1on/leftist_hypocrisy_never_fails_to_disappoint/hqqxq4v/

97sysua4	Your first mistake In this argument was saying that gender is interchangeable to sex. As you pointed out, gender was essentially sex until relatively recently. However, until relatively recently, pretty much every person who didn’t identify as a man/woman was not recognized as legitimate. Doing this would certainly allow such a definition to be accepted, but it would also be disregarding everyone that flatly disproves it, such as NBs and trans people. The new definition of gender is simply a way to allow people previously viewed as degenerate to exist more easily within society, and the idea that it’s a conspiracy from “Da lEfT!!” Is pretty laughable to me.	1640997257.0	hqqzcyb	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqqwjef	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqqzcyb/

The polio vaccine is a real vaccine that actually stops polio… You don’t read of any breakthrough cases!  Compare this to the experimental Covid vaccines that were tested in less than six months unless than 50,000 people… Are not FDA approved at least once on the market and are the leak is vaccines ever developed a vaccine history! Thousands of breakthrough cases per day for vaccines that do not prevent you from getting infected, do not stop you from infecting others, do not stop hospitalization or death!

3jqem3t6	I can fully understand that. Personally im not so worried about that because from the get-go the judge had said he felt the sentencing was excessively harsh. I think much of the political commotion around the event had more to do with the excessively extreme sentence than the crime itself. Personally I think 10 years is on the shorter side of what I’m okay with, I think 10-15 was deserved, as a penalty for his negligence and to deter further similar behavior.   I sometimes find myself in a minority among conservatives with my position on desiring lower prison sentences. Certainly not for every crime, and not the leftist insanity of no-bail releases, but I don’t think putting someone in jail for the majority of their living life really accomplishes much of anything aside from spending tax dollars. I think this man can serve his time and be a productive member of society again one day, I think he’s remorseful, albeit the incredible negligence of his actions.	1640997717.0	hqr0ca5	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqqyjjz	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqr0ca5/

They want him to take down everything that they disagree with from his social media account, not post as much because they don’t like his politics, and they want to send him to a re-education camp.  My goodness, the left is psychotic.  Not only do they not live in reality they have no decency at all.	1640997773.0	hqr0gmq	t3_rsxd1m	t3_rsxd1m	/r/Conservative/comments/rsxd1m/i_will_not_be_silenced_ny_student_declares/hqr0gmq/

In Puerto Rico right now, the test panic is so much that the authorities have had to publicly ask people “test only if you have symptoms”. I recently got sick and I’ve been having a hard time finding a test so I can go back to work.

I once made a mistake as well, and I too had to pay for it.  If you want to just let her mistake slide, you have to let mine slide as well, and mine was far less consequential in that nobody died as a result of my mistake, severely injured yes, but no deaths resulted.  So make a decision, it is a binary decision too, so it should be easy.  Let people be free of their mistakes with no consequences, or hold people accountable for their mistakes.

Bribed. Replaced the father with government money, made large swathes of the population dependent on taxpayer dollars. Your dumbass daughter votes for Democrat because she wants handouts. You vote Democrat because you don't want to have to pay for your dumbass daughter, and so on.

That's because you have been programed. No critical thinking necessary. No individual thought necessary. Group think will take care of the heavy lifting for you.  "Make everyone feel included". You were just excluded. You are not included. You are no longer in sync with the latest definitions and terminology. According to the latest messaging you are a bigot. You should feel horrible about yourself and stop messaging on platforms. That is what the left is saying.  Do you want to know what Rowling actually stated? Do you actually care?

It's supposedly good for 3 days and it's completely useless. If covid is so scary then why do the next couple of days not count, as if I cannot possibly catch it then. Also, if people still spread it with the vaccine and it's only purpose is to lesson the effects, than you should be OK with yours, and it should not matter if I have one.

2ul6ji2y	I’m sure they’ll include the part about ignoring genuine concerns about election tampering for two months straight, causing conspiracy theories to run rampant and making a whole bunch of stressed out people even more stressed out until it reached a boiling point.  Oh, and they’ll remember to mention that Pelosi turned down an offer to have more National Guard troops in DC, just in case things got out of hand.  Sure, rioting is bad, and what happened in the Capitol that day is bad. That said, it could have been avoided. You do not mess around with elections, and you certainly don’t equate legitimate concerns with conspiracy theories. We know now that some odd things have gone down in Wisconsin regarding illegitimate voting that happened there.   Also, you knew *damn* well that Trump was going to have a rally that day, Pelosi, and that you’d have a lot of his supporters near the place where the Electoral College was meeting. Either you were too stupid to not support the Capitol police with the National Guard, or you baited Trump and his audience into a trap, which they suckered into.  That part better be in the official narrative.	1641004681.0	hqrevfa	t3_rt4q0x	t3_rt4q0x	/r/Conservative/comments/rt4q0x/nancy_pelosi_sets_jan_6_commemoration_schedule/hqrevfa/
d7imd	Sure, here are a few things:  Trump signed a law to make cruelty to animals a federal felony so that animal abusers face tougher consequences.    Violent crime fell every year he was in office although it had been on the rise in the last two years of Obama’s presidency.    He signed a bill making CBD and hemp legal.    America gained 7 million new jobs – more than three times government experts’ projections.  Middle-Class family income increased nearly $6,000 – more than five times the gains during the entire previous administration.  The unemployment rate reached 3.5 percent, the lowest in a half-century.  More Americans reported being employed than ever before – nearly 160 million.  Jobless claims hit a nearly 50-year low.  The number of people claiming unemployment insurance as a share of the population hit its lowest on record.  Incomes rose in every single metro area in the United States for the first time in nearly 3 decades.  Unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and those without a high school diploma all reached record lows.  Unemployment for women hit its lowest rate in nearly 70 years.  Lifted nearly 7 million people off of food stamps.  Poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans reached record lows.  Income inequality fell for two straight years, and by the largest amount in over a decade . The bottom 50 percent of American households saw a 40 percent increase in net worth. Wages rose fastest for low-income and blue collar workers – a 16 percent pay increase.  African American homeownership increased from 41.7 percent to 46.4 percent.  Brought jobs, factories, and industries back to the USA.  Created more than 1.2 million manufacturing and construction jobs.  Put in place policies to bring back supply chains from overseas.  Rebuilding and investing in rural America.  Signed an Executive Order on Modernizing the Regulatory Framework for Agricultural Biotechnology Products, which is bringing innovative new technologies to market in American farming and agriculture.  Strengthened America’s rural economy by investing over $1.3 billion through the Agriculture Department’s ReConnect Program to bring high-speed broadband infrastructure to rural America.  Achieved a record-setting economic comeback by rejecting blanket lockdowns.  An October 2020 Gallup survey found 56 percent of Americans said they were better off during a pandemic than four years prior.  During the third quarter of 2020, the economy grew at a rate of 33.1 percent – the most rapid GDP growth ever recorded. Since coronavirus lockdowns ended, the economy has added back over 12 million jobs, more than half the jobs lost. Jobs have been recovered 23 times faster than the previous administration’s recovery.  Unemployment fell to 6.7 percent in December, from a pandemic peak of 14.7 percent in April – beating expectations of well over 10 percent unemployment through the end of 2020.  Under the previous administration, it took 49 months for the unemployment rate to fall from 10 percent to under 7 percent compared to just 3 months for the Trump Administration.  Since April, the Hispanic unemployment rate has fallen by 9.6 percent, Asian-American unemployment by 8.6 percent, and Black American unemployment by 6.8 percent. 80 percent of small businesses are now open, up from just 53 percent in April.   Homebuilder confidence reached an all-time high, and home sales hit their highest reading since December 2006. Manufacturing optimism nearly doubled.  Household net worth rose $7.4 trillion in Q2 2020 to $112 trillion, an all-time high.  Home prices hit an all-time record high.   Stabilized America’s financial markets with the establishment of a number of Treasury Department supported facilities at the Federal Reserve. Tax Relief for the Middle Class  Signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – the largest tax reform package in history.  More than 6 million American workers received wage increases, bonuses, and increased benefits thanks to the tax cuts.  A typical family of four earning $75,000 received an income tax cut of more than $2,000 – slashing their tax bill in half.  Doubled the standard deduction – making the first $24,000 earned by a married couple completely tax-free. Doubled the child tax credit. Virtually eliminated the unfair Estate Tax, or Death Tax. Cut the business tax rate from 35 percent – the highest in the developed world – all the way down to 21 percent. Small businesses can now deduct 20 percent of their business income. Businesses can now deduct 100 percent of the cost of their capital investments in the year the investment is made. Since the passage of tax cuts, the share of total wealth held by the bottom half of households has increased, while the share held by the top 1 percent has decreased.  Over 400 companies have announced bonuses, wage increases, new hires, or new investments in the United States.  Over $1.5 trillion was repatriated into the United States from overseas.  Lower investment cost and higher capital returns led to faster growth in the middle class, real wages, and international competitiveness. Jobs and investments are pouring into Opportunity Zones.  Created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones where capital gains on long-term investments are taxed at zero. Opportunity Zone designations have increased property values within them by 1.1 percent, creating an estimated $11 billion in wealth for the nearly half of Opportunity Zone residents who own their own home. Opportunity Zones have attracted $75 billion in funds and driven $52 billion of new investment in economically distressed communities, creating at least 500,000 new jobs.  Approximately 1 million Americans will be lifted from poverty as a result of these new investments. Private equity investments into businesses in Opportunity Zones were nearly 30 percent higher than investments into businesses in similar areas that were not designated Opportunity Zones. Massive Deregulation  Ended the regulatory assault on American Businesses and Workers.  Instead of 2-for-1, we eliminated 8 old regulations for every 1 new regulation adopted.  Provided the average American household an extra $3,100 every year.  Reduced the direct cost of regulatory compliance by $50 billion, and will reduce costs by an additional $50 billion in FY 2020 alone.  Removed nearly 25,000 pages from the Federal Register – more than any other president. The previous administration added over 16,000 pages. Established the Governors’ Initiative on Regulatory Innovation to reduce outdated regulations at the state, local, and tribal levels.  Signed an executive order to make it easier for businesses to offer retirement plans.  Signed two executive orders to increase transparency in Federal agencies and protect Americans and their small businesses from administrative abuse.  Modernized the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the first time in over 40 years.  There is plenty more, including lowering prescription drug prices, helping veterans and legislation for Native Americans.	1641004729.0	hqreyur	t3_rsi0du	t1_hqphvoz	/r/Conservative/comments/rsi0du/hypothetically/hqreyur/

I would also expect someone in Florida to think eating outside in the winter is draconian, while people in New York wouldn’t bat an eye. I also do not think the choice to have kids eat lunch outside is unreasonable. Kids can be expected to walk to school, but not be outside for lunch and recreation during a raging surge of Covid? If it keeps kids from spreading the virus and allows them so extra time to play and Kees them in school, that is not a bad choice at all.	1641004880.0	hqrf9lw	t3_rt6evq	t1_hqra30s	/r/Conservative/comments/rt6evq/desantis_team_responds_to_aoc_in_fl_school_kids/hqrf9lw/

5xpfs	Rowling released an essay on her positions due to the relative limitation of twitter.  In her essay she made it clear she has been sexually assaulted before. Millions of women are raped every year across the globe. It's a unfortunate aspect of human sexuality. Thus women are what we call a "vulnerable" group. As in they are prone to being victims of particular violence and crime.   A policy that allows *anyone* to claim they are trans women and utilizes private spaces for women increases sexual assault. There is no denying this. Meaning a rapist can claim they are a woman, while not being an actual trans person, and go to prisons meant for women (like California) and then proceed to do their vile deed. This is happening as we speak.  The policy becomes even more offending to a feminist like Rowling, as then the man who was pretending to be trans is now labeled a "woman", thus the crime is prescribed to the fairer sex. It's kind of sexist on her part, but feminists typically are.  That was her stance. Your tik'tok group think intentionally twisted it because she opposed their policies. Her essay makes it clear she 100% supports the trans agenda and everything involved with that up to allowing them into spaces where it increases the chance of sexual assault.	1641005983.0	hqrhgc5	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqrdm09	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqrhgc5/

7cnrg	Again, that study was done on delta, the more it mutates the less rare reinfection gets, but rare, doesn't mean never. Even with delta it was proven that over time antibodies fade, I had covid the first time in June 2020 and the second time last week as originally stated. That's 16 months apart and the virus had mutated millions, if not billions of times. So my body caught a very mild version of covid the second time. My wife got it first and I didn't get it right away, she had a positive test with symptoms for 3 or 4 days then I started to feel the sore throat. And confirmed with positive test and symptoms. So as I have already explained it's endemic i will catch it again and again like a cold probably every few years and so will you. Rare doesn't mean impossible, 20% out of 100 is rare, 10% is rare and .001 percent is rare. So just because one line in the article (which sources a study you didn't read) says that reinfection is rare, doesn't mean it can't happen or that it didn't happen. It's happening all over the country right now. Eventually no one will care. I'm sorry you ha e been so misinformed by your Facebook conspiracy groups but viruses can mutate and reinfect. If they didn't no one would get sick more than once. You know you're wrong so you hurl insults. You argue like a Democrat. Not one shred of evidence to support your beliefs, blind to reality and kind of an asshole to people that don't blindly follow you.    The best part is, you'll get covid again and again and it's not a big deal.

I'm now staunchly anti-abortion and consider it one of the greatest tragedies of the modern era.  People need to take responsibility. If you have sex and don't want a child then take all the protective measures you can. It is absolutely disgusting to take a human life because it's inconvenient to you. If you aren't ready to take responsibility for your actions then you aren't ready to have sex.  The sexual revolution was a mistake. Divorcing sex from procreation has led to a cheapening of human life in many ways.

7e3072ph	Here are some of the key numbers from the study:  Pfizer shot 1: about 17 million people, 94 cases of Myocarditis within 28 days. (1 in 180,851)  Pfizer shot 2: 12 million people, 59 cases (1 in 203,389)  Moderna shot 1: 1 million people, 9 cases (1 in 111,111)  Moderna shot 2: 368k people, 0 cases. (n/a)  AstraZenica shot 1: 20.6 million people, 142 cases (1 in 145,070)  AstraZenica shot 2: 19.75 million people, 102 cases (1 in 193,627)  Unvaccinated: 3 million people, 134 cases. (1 in 22,388)  But there is definitely an interesting discrepancy when it comes to ages.   It's NYE and I've done enough math for one night, but suffice to say if you're over 40, your risk of myocarditis from Covid is much higher than the vaccines - but for younger people, it's about 1 in 100,000 (vaccinated) rather than 1 in 67,000 (unvaccinated). So OP's title is accurate, but the overall risk may still be relatively quite low - judge for yourself.  There is also the issue of severity; you can recover from myocarditis over a few weeks. Which group recovers better? Once again, I'm tired of reading and going to go party, but if anyone knows that detail I'd be interested.

The amount of certificates I have I had to buy a whole separate accordion wallet.  No way non union plumbers receive as much training as we do. Im not talking about change ur toilet bowl plumbers I'm talking about reading 70 stories building print and able to pipe it our right and why you doing it.  Not sure about teamsters (truck drivers) but union work is the way to go.  I'll break it down for you a little better. If a job with a union work cost 1000$, labor cost 300 material 400 other misc 100 and boss makes 200. Non union would be 800, labor cost 150 material cost 300 misc 100 and boss makes 250...  so don't get confused. Just because the building in Manhattan  built by a Non union shop doesn't mean the price per square foot will be cheaper.

The poll says "nationally representative," hopefully meaning there were proportional amounts per state, economic background, etc. I can take a poll of 1000 people or 100 people, but the later could be much more meaningful if it 1000 people at the Michigan State vs 100 people proportionally distributed by state (12 from California, and 1 representing North Dakota, Alaska, DC, and Wyoming, so obviously more than 100 is good since 1 person can't really represent all of those places).

97sysua4	Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

a9fysz6o	There is a colony of 30 to 40 Afghans living in a hotel about one mile from me.  Most seem to be families with multiple children.  The hotel is within a large office park and I routinely see the kids playing soccer in one of the parking lots while the mothers sit nearby with babies and toddlers.  The women all wear headscarves and the men often dress in those super long shirts that you always see them in on TV.    I have sympathy for all of these people and believe we have a duty to anyone who actually worked for the US military over there and would be in legitimate danger if left in Afghanistan.  That said, even the Biden administration acknowledges most of these folks were just random people who managed to get on evacuation planes.  The number I heard was on 10% of them have a confirmed connection to the US military, though I don't know how accurate that is.  Between the invasion across our southern border and random people from Afghanistan, Iraq, etc being flown here, what is the future for our country?  At some point you just have to say STOP.	1641009877.0	hqroxs7	t3_rtalu2	t3_rtalu2	/r/Conservative/comments/rtalu2/biden_with_help_from_gop_resettles_over_52000/hqroxs7/

5xpfs	It's called increasing the risk. I literally gave you an example of prisons where this is a current problem. As in a biological man pretends to be trans to go to a women's prison. Now there are cases of rape and women getting pregnant in a "all women" prison.  Even if a person is not a rapist. They are going to abuse this policy to avoid the much more harsh men's prison system. Which could also lead to physical violence against women among other things.  As for the bathroom situation. In a state/area where biological sex is the limitation for entering bathrooms, and clear and obvious man enters a woman's bathroom. Guess what? They are reported to the cops. As in a rapist looking to find his "right target" will be outed significantly sooner. Be it their "type" of woman or looking for one alone.  But in leftist la la land of ignoring actual threats to vulnerable populations. We just have to pretend there is no problem. Especially when said rapist can just claim to be a woman and we are just supposed to ignore the obvious threat they pose.  Since you seem to completely ignore the actual threat and abuse women face. Let's spell it out in a way you can understand.  Say there is a person who is TransAge, or specifically Trans Kindergartener (yes there are such people). We now adopt laws and policies that any person who identifies as a Kindergartener should have the "right" to attend school at such a level. We have no restrictions, because it's their literal identity. That is *who* they are. Here comes along Mr. Pedo who decides this is a great opportunity.  Children who are an obvious vulnerable group. You implement a policy that gives them an easy in to abuse or get close to children. Then you pretend as if pedos would always have that type of access anyways, so it's not really a problem. All that matters is the rights of the Transage person, not the other people.  You are literally promoting violence against women and think you are enlightened. There isn't even a half way point for you to say, "Well perhaps only trans women who have undergone surgery should be gaining access to such spaces without any comment." No, you are perfectly fine with a loop whole that allows women to get raped, assaulted, and potentially murdered (as in some cases of rape, the women are killed as part of the violent act). Not even the bare minimum concern for the horrible acts that occur.	1641010245.0	hqrploh	t3_rs1lcc	t1_hqro032	/r/Conservative/comments/rs1lcc/british_newspaper_cancels_person_of_the_year_poll/hqrploh/

7cnrg	I'm not defensive, I'm explaining common knowledge to a child. There's a difference. You're wrong, you will get covid if you haven't already and you will get it again. It was rare, it's less rare now, considering this variant is 70 times more transmissible. If you're right covid will disappear.  If I'm right it will become endemic like the cold or flu. Your beliefs are based on fiction and distrust. My belief is backed by generations of science not just covid science.   I was an advocate for reinfection being rare which is why I'm not vaccinated because I had it already, I don't wear a mask,  i wasnt afraid to get it again, and I was right the second time I had it, was more mild, as expected.  The comment above mine claimed, everyone he knew that had it twice was vaccinated. It's simply not rare anymore, once every few years is Normal for any virus. I don't know what to tell you. Good luck in your Fantasy world. Covid isn't going to kill us all, it's going to be harmless to pretty much everyone and life goes on. It's a Corona virus. Stop acting like you know what you're talking about.   BTW, calling names in a debate, refusing to provide sources or prove you're beliefs is the definition of being "defensive" which by your own admission makes you a liar.	1641010368.0	hqrpthu	t3_rrjv1z	t1_hqrjznc	/r/Conservative/comments/rrjv1z/i_cant_deal_with_this_covid_sht_anymore_french/hqrpthu/

If you are looking for a good, solid career or someone you know is wondering what to do then being a plumber is something to consider.  There is great continuing education, free college for your spouse, kids and grandkids, excellent medical insurance, retirement benefits.

It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals."	1641011202.0	hqrra0m	t3_rt8da8	t3_rt8da8	/r/Conservative/comments/rt8da8/cs_lewis_of_all_tyrannies_a_tyranny_sincerely/hqrra0m/

"From the very beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2014, NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The Allies strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation"  Russia may feel the "buildup" of NATO forces in Ukraine, including US forces, is akin to how the US viewed the Cuban missile crisis.   NATO, at this time, rejects Russian requests for Ukraine to not be allowed to join NATO stating that it is a sovereign country and should have some "say".   Of course Putin's bargaining position was already weak having begun the Ukraine invasion 7 years ago.	1641013480.0	hqrv2n6	t3_rstrbu	t1_hqoj4nd	/r/Conservative/comments/rstrbu/biden_vows_decisive_response_to_potential_ukraine/hqrv2n6/

Now she has a child and one more on the way with a loving husband.  I have a baby boy myself, and we have cherished him since he was conceived. After experiencing that, there is no way I could ever again fall for the lie that he was just a 'clump of cells'.

Then conveniently despite affidavits by election workers witnessing fraud in every metropolitan city, challenges of the 2020 election where all dismissed by the courts.   It’s funny how Black Lives Matter can encircle the White House, actually charge the capital building and vandalize it, and not one mention of domestic terrorism or insurrection made by this current regime. Most of the pro Trump protestors who entered the capital building where peaceful. Ashli Babbitt was a veteran and did more for this country than the little Antifa bitches ever have done. She was allowed into the capital building, was unarmed, and was shot by some goon cop all of the sudden the libs are praising after bitching about the cops in every controversial police shooting.	1641016364.0	hqrzp1e	t3_rta54r	t1_hqrjuuv	/r/Conservative/comments/rta54r/documentary_drops_inconvenient_truths_on_the_jan/hqrzp1e/

If you bought a smart phone, YOU chose that. If you got on social media, YOU chose that. If you opened up a free bank account, YOU chose that. They told you they would collect data about YOU, YOU just didn't read the fine print.   We live in the digital age. Catch up and stop complaining, no one forced you to do anything. They just made it more compelling for you to give up your most valuable asset, your identity.   Just wait till all money goes digital.

Women they have a real connection with and gladly have sex with.  2.  Women that they just meet, really know nothing about, yet are still willing to have sex with.  3.  Women that are so annoying, toxic, and crazy that you would not have sex with no matter what she looks like.

6z9vr07t	It is past time for race to be used for many things. Personally, I think it’s wrong to have to declare race for many things-college applications, job applications, etc. Why should race matter?   There are a couple of areas where identifying race is useful. When describing the perpetrator of a crime, it could be useful. If I committed a crime, describing me as an old white woman would eliminate people of other races or other sexes. Also, race does sometimes matter medically. I remember a medical show, probably forty years ago, that dealt with sickle cell anemia. Other than areas where it is actually helpful, why should people be asked about their race? Qualifications should count and qualifications don’t depend on race.	1641018787.0	hqs3dkd	t3_rt8sw1	t3_rt8sw1	/r/Conservative/comments/rt8sw1/ny_state_announces_racially_discriminatory/hqs3dkd/

am35y	>surely the same applies for Trump in 2020 and 2016  I'm not sure how 2016 applies. Did many states in 2016 waive previously legislated procedures for mail-in ballots, and reject those mail-in ballots at a rate an order of magnitude less than "normal?" I don't believe so.  Did the states that changed their voting laws not via the legislative process but via executive actions in response to lawsuits do so to make the integrity of the voting process more secure, or do so to make it easier to cast a ballot, and easier to fraudulently vote?   And once mail-in ballots are accepted, and separated from the process that helps determine that acceptance (i.e. the envelope in which it came), how does one go back and do anything other than merely re-count the ballot? The post mark and other items that help determine a properly cast ballot are discarded, making an actual audit (did person A actually cast the ballot that was counted in the name of person A?) remarkably problematic.  It's certainly possible that both "sides" cheated and took advantage of the lowered bar to get a ballot counted, which argues strongly for better election integrity. But it is odd that a media which is not particularly neutral had far more concerning reports (mail-in ballots that had never been folded, and had only one race marked, for example) favoring one candidate much more than the other.   But as noted, Mr. Biden is the legally elected President, regardless of how much fraud occurred in the various states, and regardless of the direction in which the fraud occurred. The fact that quite a few folks are disinterested in the integrity of elections speaks volumes, and is not an issue that will disappear merely by banning talk of the issue.	1641018867.0	hqs3ht0	t3_rsc959	t1_hqrldmi	/r/Conservative/comments/rsc959/poll_shows_that_only_6_of_republicans_believe/hqs3ht0/

b2mnz	Even if the US had the welfare state system of Finland, abortion should still be a right. Women should have the right to decide when they have children, how many children they have, and who they have children with. People have sex for fun. They aren’t always trying to have children when pregnancies occur.  Limit it in the third trimester if you want, so that women have plenty of time to consider the decision, but even then I’d still make it the woman’s right to decide. If someone wants to terminate a pregnancy in the thirs trimester, either there is a good reason, or they aren’t fit to be a parent yet.	1641021688.0	hqs7f1a	t3_rt81tm	t1_hqs5bg8	/r/Conservative/comments/rt81tm/abortion_leading_global_cause_of_death_in_2021/hqs7f1a/

If the child is born to a parent that doesn't want them or simply can't take care of them at best they end up in a corrupt foster system which will hopefully lead to adoption. The other option? Ending a human being's life before it begins.	1641022120.0	hqs7zq0	t3_rt81tm	t1_hqs7f1a	/r/Conservative/comments/rt81tm/abortion_leading_global_cause_of_death_in_2021/hqs7zq0/

So why wouldn't previous elections apply? You seem to be focused on mail-in voting, a process which existed long before 2020 and was even common in several states. So why only 2020?   >waive previously legislated procedures for mail-in ballots  Now we're getting into the part where you Gish gallop a little bit. What are you talking about here?

Most people seem to be interested, but have different concerns. Even when the concerns are the same, they approach and solutions are different.   I think the fact so many think there is fraud where there isn't is more significant and speaks more to the media they consume that spreads falsehoods. The claims in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Georgia, and Pennsylvania were often baseless. Some were misunderstandings of the election process, others were easily explainable but people used it to fuel rumors like 74k votes in AZ, and some seemed to be outright fabrications. Even the technically correct things were often skewed statistics or using patterns as some indication even though Ohio doesn't solely determine our elections. A lot of people who responded "definitely," probably believe in some things that just aren't true. Even those who responded "probably not," likely simply don't understand some of the processes or had some misunderstandings about some of the numbers. Same with the "I'm not sure," crowd - they likely don't know some of the answers to their questions, even though most of their questions have been answered.	1641022247.0	hqs85qz	t3_rsc959	t1_hqs3ht0	/r/Conservative/comments/rsc959/poll_shows_that_only_6_of_republicans_believe/hqs85qz/

2n8f01jo	>Killing babies means nothing more than taking out the trash to them  Something that I think we need to keep in mind and that's often overlooked, is that many people who are pro-abortion do not consider them babies. That's why this type of discussion often goes nowhere. One group doesn't consider them babies, and thereby does not consider it murder or immoral. No amount of saying "killing babies is wrong" will convince those types of people, because *they don't disagree* with that basic idea. What people disagree on is *what* is a baby.  It's easy to just paint everyone who is pro-abortion as an evil baby killer, but I think it does way more harm than good if the actual end goal is to reduce or eliminate abortion.	1641022967.0	hqs93bp	t3_rt81tm	t1_hqr9a2u	/r/Conservative/comments/rt81tm/abortion_leading_global_cause_of_death_in_2021/hqs93bp/

My mother thought it was to ‘old’ for me and got rid of the book. When she got a copy of ‘Valley of the Dolls’ , she hid it. I found it and read it while my mother was working.   I don’t think banning books is ever a good thing. Why not put these books on a shelf that requires parental approval for children to access these books?   While I think we should respect parent’s rights, I don’t think that any parent should be allowed to supersede the rights of other parents.

56l6k402	>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead.

56l6k402	Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	1641025880.0	hqscmti	t3_rt81tm	t1_hqsbtm8	/r/Conservative/comments/rt81tm/abortion_leading_global_cause_of_death_in_2021/hqscmti/

And he has taken a lot of flack from the liberal elites over it. But damn, he didn't make his money sitting in congress for 35 years.  Her net worth is reported somewhere between $106 million last year and maybe $114 million this year. If someone were to make what a congressperson has made(not counting extra for being speaker of the house) and invested 25% of their gross(because they are a high earner) and gotten 10%(historic S&P500 growth) then they would have about $9.42 million. That's midnight back of the napkin math. But it just gives an idea of how much extra her position of power has provided for her.

They put out pretty definitive statements regarding a vaccine which you just said is not able to be 100% safe nor 100% effective.	1641030215.0	hqshn2i	t3_rswl23	t1_hqp6abp	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqshn2i/

ve5qq	Why am I not mandated to be forced to get the flu shot each year? Why is it my choice to get that versus why I am being told that I have to get the Covid one? What's the difference there?  They (those pushing the shots) have *never* convinced me that it is advantageous for me to get either the flu or Covid shots. And the biggest reason is because they are not effective!  Every year I hear, "Well, the flu shot doesn't actually target the strain that is out there like they thought. But go ahead and take it anyway again this year!" And now it is the same with Covid. "Well, there is a new strain and the old shots you got don't protect you as much as they did, so go ahead and get your new shot again!"

Outside of NY schools is one of the dirtiest and least sanitary places in the entire state. As you are obviously not from NYC, we call the schoolyards "dungeons" due to being lined with school windows with cages on them. In most cases these areas aren't visible from the street, and are used for drugs and prostitution while the schools are closed.

40tuixyd	You guys should have seen the judge's face when they read the verdict.  She was surprised, because that's not the law.  I'm sure she got some calls from the appeals judges and they told her that she fucked up by not explaining the law to the jury and allowing the prosecution a second closing.    In Potter's case, she didn't know she had a gun.  The defense and prosecution agreed on that fact.  The law of recklessness in the State says that you must "knowingly" act negligent to be criminally liable and the prosecution lied to the jury and the judge didn't correct them despite numerous objections from the defense.  I think it's highly likely that it's overturned on appeal as it criminalizes honest mistakes.  You get restitution for mistakes in civil court, not criminal court, and that's the way it is in every State in the US.	1641032739.0	hqskh5i	t3_rt4b2e	t3_rt4b2e	/r/Conservative/comments/rt4b2e/juror_kim_potter_made_mistake_but_was_still/hqskh5i/

bgxnoz2u	This is exactly it. Chances are, the vast majority of children cannot walk alone to their local public library — they must have a parent drive them. So it’s a self-regulating system and any parent who cares to oversee their children’s reading habits will know what’s being borrowed. They are physically there to see the exchange occur.  A school library is a completely different animal. In my district, at least, you never know what your kid has checked out unless they haven’t returned it. So if they are otherwise responsible kids, you’ll never know what they’ve been reading. It shouldn’t even matter, though, because kids can’t watch PG-13 movies at school or show more than three inches of knee or wear sleeveless tops. PDA that is more than hand-holding or quick pecks is forbidden so what do we have to worry about?

Just Biden, Fauci, and the leftist mob telling me to get it or I’m a bad person isn’t going to work.

hvobp	In the UK, the Health Security Agency (a government department with a somewhat sinister name) puts out weekly Vaccine Surveillance Reports, and these include a table with positive test rates per 100,000 people broken down into age brackets and vaccination status (see page 40 of the bottom link).  In every age bracket between 18-29 right up to 60-69, vaccinated people are testing positive at higher rates (and to be clear, these are rates, rather than absolute numbers). That has been the case for the last couple of months of data.  Obviously there will be confounding factors at play, although that would apply both ways (for instance, it's a reasonable assumption that people who choose to be vaccinated are more likely to test themselves, whilst people who choose not to be vaccinated are likely less afraid of the 'ro in the first place so don't curb their interactions with others so much).

bgxnoz2u	I remember that town that welcomed all poor families and single mothers to come to live (*especially* black ones) because the current American system was so bad and racist toward them, where those living there who had any amount of money gladly gave it all away to the town to help provide for those who didn’t have as much. All childcare was provided, all food was provided. You name it, you got it. Housing, medical, daycare… Only 1/3 of the population worked because the other 2/3 didn’t exactly qualify (too young or too old), so chances were you didn’t have the responsibility to contribute to the pot keeping everyone afloat.

Once you convince people that the other group isn’t human, “normal” people can do terrible things.

There's a lot of COVID misinformation here, "They don't test for flu!", "The PCR cycles are too high!", "The tests can't tell the difference!"  It's like people just make this shit up. I am trying my fucking hardest in the lab to provide rapid, accurate results to help people.  COVID is still the big one, we hit 25% positivity this week.    Everybody--please get vaccinated.  The vaccines do work.  They reduce severity of disease, shorten viral shedding duration by over half, lower viral load, and reduce transmission. Running 100+ PCR tests/day on top of my normal workflow is ruining us.  Morale is at an all-time low.  We had mandatory overtime and cancelled holiday leave.  People are calling out sick just to lay in bed and decompress so they can come back to work the next day which is putting even more strain on us.	1641042754.0	hqsw7mm	t3_rq5ik8	t1_hqc3e6y	/r/Conservative/comments/rq5ik8/flu_is_making_a_comeback_in_us_after_an_unusual/hqsw7mm/

I’m not a fan of abortions and would love to see a robust childcare/foster system that allows unwanted children to be matched with families that want them, but women should still have the choice of carrying to term. If they don’t want to, no one should be forcing them to.   Plus, conservatives also cringe at the thought of gay couples adopting a child.	1641042794.0	hqsw9i0	t3_rt81tm	t1_hqsn5l5	/r/Conservative/comments/rt81tm/abortion_leading_global_cause_of_death_in_2021/hqsw9i0/

Funny how that works. So what, are her own people not good enough? AOC can’t even stick her neck out in her own neighborhood without security, and she calls herself a leader? The only thing she is good at is brow beating Republicans over meme tweets.

The audacity to order us to follow this directive.  Its dangerous.  Anyone that believes they have the power to do this won't hesitate to make further demands.
