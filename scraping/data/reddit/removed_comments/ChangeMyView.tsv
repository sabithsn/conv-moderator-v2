21e2hoaw	I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	1641146376.0	hqyk8oo	t3_ru9qs8	t3_ru9qs8	/r/changemyview/comments/ru9qs8/cmv_most_new_genders_and_gender_labels_are_not/hqyk8oo/

sq12l	The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	1641149998.0	hqyu7bc	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqyu7bc/

g754f	I think that the people who are offended by the use of the word cracker are frail. But the word cracker is self-evidently a racial slur. And if a service is banning people for the use of racial slurs, then a person should be banned for using the word cracker.

g2dfg4d5	> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	1641152475.0	hqz0z3c	t3_ruby2u	t1_hqyz29g	/r/changemyview/comments/ruby2u/cmv_if_we_wanna_solve_racism_we_should_be_colour/hqz0z3c/

1mntp	>The oldest attested -phobia compound of these kinds in any language is hydrophobia, attested in the Latin works of [Celsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus). It referred to the rabies symptom where rabid people/animals become dehydrated, but unwilling or unable to drink liquids.   That sounds like exactly what I said. The medical use is the original. Last time I checked, rabies is a medical condition.    >We're talking etymology, where there's no such thing as original meaning. We can trace terms back to the boundary of written language, beyond which linguists develop hypothetical proto-languages as models of the sort of next stage back that might have existed but was never written. That gives us the oldest knowable meaning of the term, at least. Here, it's the Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to run".  Nice straw man. It's crazy the lengths you will go to to avoid admitting the definition of a word that can be found to be some variation of "irrational fear", in any dictionary. I bet you can't find a reference that doesn't use the word "fear" or some synonym to define it. Go ahead, I'll wait.  Proto Indo European? I want to see your sources on that claim. What is the derived root?   Because I think you just made that up.   [A quick Google tells us](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/%E1%B8%B1ers-) that the PIE root for "run" is "ḱers-" while the [root of "phobia" is from the Greek word "phóbos"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=-phobia), meaning “fear”.	1641165118.0	hqzy0bk	t3_rtj1jh	t1_hqz6vjz	/r/changemyview/comments/rtj1jh/cmv_trans_men_and_cis_women_should_be_just_women/hqzy0bk/

ifay1wyl	Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options. [Here's](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) a page (with a link to the original study) that shows 90% of women would reject a 5'4" guy for his height. [This study]((https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) found that only 4% of women would accept a relationship where the woman is taller as opposed to 23% of men.  That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	1642535296.0	ht7vqep	t3_s6m0bo	t1_ht7i03z	/r/changemyview/comments/s6m0bo/cmv_the_black_pill_is_an_overly_cynical_view_of/ht7vqep/

inxw8btp	I didn’t mean art per say, but arts degrees (could be bachelor of dance, or bachelor of music, or gender studies). Undoubtedly some of these are needed but when you look at the demand for jobs in these areas and contrast it to degrees, many people taking these degrees never get a graduate job and are usually rich young girls studying something they find interesting or someone with a clearly unrealistic view of their skills/talents and/or the job market.  Our taxes should NOT be used to support these people so if we do cancel student debts it should have some sort of criteria that includes familial asset checks, degree type etc.   But people signed up for uni knowing the debt etc and I don’t think they should be bailed out as people going to uni are already privileged ON AVERAGE.

5p2ewidb	>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having racial biases can and do exist but making it illegal to make laws that discriminate did end systematic racism. Now a system showing racial bias can exist but that is a separate concept even if that concept is called systematic racism. The CRT use of systematic racism simply reflects that there is a correlation of race and outcome. The reasons for this are not part of the CRT evaluation bc CRT assumes it's bc of racism and not factors such as individual choice. Point is it is illegal for any system to discriminate racially so the system is actively against racism. Society also completely demonizes anyone who judges people based on race so society itself is actively against racism. What system with any power is actively FOR racism as in encouraging people to discriminate based on race? Literally the only systems pushing for racism is the democrats, the CRT praxis supporters, and the neo Nazis/white supremacists.   >The system is like a vehicle. Ask yourself who's driving it. Historically its the white male elite.  So all white males are intrinsically racist and think exactly alike? Or do you mean that minorities are so different to white males that they cannot compete in the same meritocracy? Either way that's a really racist statement.   >And it is still based on merit, although I don't think we are living in this ideal meritocracy you think we do, it's just merit that would've been passed up on because they have a black name.  You literally are more likely to get into college, get promoted, or get hired with a black name. Being white is literally detrimental to your career in today's society. A white person would need to score 150 points higher on the SATs than a non Asian minority and Asians would need to score 200+ higher. This discrimination you state just doesn't exist in reality, it's a false narrative based on outcomes not on actions.   >Affirmative action notwithstanding because I agree with that policy and see the merit in it.  Sure but it's still racist policy regardless if you see the merit in it.   >From the right it happens that its a kind of fearmongering to white nationalists that's been going on a while.  I wasn't aware the 1300 white nationalists in the states (the prison gangs can't vote) was such a big lobby. As far as fearnongering goes, when policy literally discriminates against white people is it fear mongering or just calling out unconstitutional racial discrimination?  >Charles Darwin was no genius, neither was Einstein. They were specialized in their field and at the right place at the right time. Their work benefited greatly from names you've never heard of.   They literally had 150+ IQs. To claim they weren't genius level intellects is complete idiocy. That's literally the dumbest statement I've ever heard. Everyone's work benefitted from other people and that in no way invalidates genius. I'm really struggling to justify even responding to someone idiotic enough to think this bc it shows your complete ignorance to not only basic complexity but also the complete lack of understanding the difference in ability. Oh yea anyone could come up with relativity or evolution it's no big deal. E=mc2 is a simple equation if you don't understand the gravity of what it actually means. Pun intended.   >The only problem with that sentiment is that we've built our systems in a way that makes each person a cost to their environment. It doesn't have to be that way.  You have established you know nothing about systems so your opinion is useless.   >Also, right libertarianism is just the hunger games, and the IO games we have today.  The hunger games had an authoritarian government that killed dissenters so no that's facism or authoritarian left bc they redistributed wealth...mainly to capital city bc that's what the authoritarian redistribution system traditionally does.   >And without physical violence or professional gatekeeping at play, people would be invested in maintaining that central structure because it's based on finding and distributing knowledge everyone can use to make their lives better, rather than an imaginary fear of the other that demands you give up your rights for your own good.  Dumbest statement ever. I'm a libertarian. I'm for individual rights even if they counteract the will of the majority. So your whole system required that humankind be reasonable, rational, selfless, and put the benefit of others over themselves to work? That's your system? That's retarded. That has never worked and will never work bc that is not humanity. What kind of privileged upbringing did you have to think that is in any way not complete idiocy? Your whole system requires perfect people or else it fails so it will fail and then the people will authorize force to save it from failure which is exactly what happens in every attempt at socialism. You can't redesign humanity, you have to redesign a system to work with the reality of humanity aka humans are greedy so base a system on that aka capitalism.    I'd love to continue this but you want to preach not have your mind changed. That's fine but the more I hear the more idiotic and clueless you sound. Half the stuff you say is in direct opposition to the other half. It's completely obvious you have zero real world experience and read a few socialist books and think you understand the world and all it's problems when literally you just succumbed to propaganda. I hate resorting to name calling but the level of both ignorance, hubris, and confirmation bias in your rational is mind blowing. I like libertarianism but I am aware of it's flaws. I am not ignorant enough to think it is perfect, I simply think that the cost benefit analysis for it is better than other systems. You, on the other hand, think your system is flawless even though your system requires human perfection to be realized. I can only hope that you can scrape together enough sanity to understand the gravity of that analysis. Quite frankly you are also a racist and an advocate of systematic racism but in complete denial of that fact. Sorry but not sorry.	1642562983.0	ht9s6j9	t3_s0sd37	t1_ht9hxpv	/r/changemyview/comments/s0sd37/cmv_its_long_past_time_to_stop_contributing_to/ht9s6j9/

hqoxcdkx	No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	1642566056.0	ht9ymba	t3_s6tbo3	t3_s6tbo3	/r/changemyview/comments/s6tbo3/cmv_transgender_women_shouldnt_be_allowed_to/ht9ymba/

e1wrt	So you had a car, which many people don’t have. Thanks for agreeing with my point.  It also sounds like you didn’t have kids, since forcing children to live in a car and relying on the slim chance that you get a job that deals with food and lets you have that food in advance of getting paid so you can put food in your children’s mouths is not a realistic path to take. It also sounds like you didn’t have any elderly relatives who relied on you for their wellbeing, who you’d have to abandon if you just took off.  I’m not asking you to feel bad for me. I have a very comfortable life and have no need or desire to get out of my situation.

5uen2ihn	I agree with you completely, but as a white guy when I get asked about race on an application that spends more time talking about efforts at diversity than the job requirements… it’s clear I’m not the type of applicant they’re looking for.  Honestly though this is just a symptom of a bigger problem. As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.  The sooner we start focusing on giving everybody an equal opportunity in life instead of measuring equality by outcomes, the better.	1642604211.0	htbodyl	t3_s7rqxm	t3_s7rqxm	/r/changemyview/comments/s7rqxm/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_to_ask_job_school/htbodyl/

i2dnwiin	> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion? I had to take a stance, and rather, I had to be on the opposite extreme of the other if you will.   Seems like text book reactionary thinking and argumentation. "I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.

The definition of words doesn’t change because of who’s in power. That’s some “alternate facts” bullshit.   Racism is something in your heart. It’s something you believe. Prejudice just refers to any kind of vague preconceived notion about an out group. Racism refers to a preconceived notion specifically about people based on their race.   OPPRESSION is power + prejudice. Racism just means you believe people are inferior based on race.   And don’t gaslight us, I remember reading this definition for racism in like 2014.

8mxqt4id	To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.

d6qz3i4o	I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing.

8ws9injb	You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	1642723696.0	htj32kc	t3_s8lfzu	t3_s8lfzu	/r/changemyview/comments/s8lfzu/cmv_wealth_gain_should_have_diminishing_returns/htj32kc/

I would much rather have a free service from the government in which where I'm guaranteed health care than the piecemeal system we currently have.	1642728542.0	htjee46	t3_s8yd6n	t3_s8yd6n	/r/changemyview/comments/s8yd6n/cmv_the_government_shouldnt_be_able_to_call_its/htjee46/

It is actually difficult to find the EXACT studies you're looking for. The fact I have some and you have none that you can cite is exactly why people like you are completely full of shit. All the effort and onus of winning a stupid internet argument against some trogolodyte hell-bent on defending the worst humanity has to offer is put on the person making  statement that's obvious. But again, what about the rest of the post or do you want to laser-focus on one section?  Face it, you're wrong. You're either sticking up for this to an unreasonable degree because you, personally, are into some extremely deviant stuff, or because you think you're 'sticking up for the little guy' either for some perceived personal moral high ground, or because you have some friend that's mixed up in it.

wssbc	>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids. I'm ready to bet, you not gonna help him, you not gonna network with him, you will tell him to fuck off.  One of my best friends turned out to be a pedophile just a couple years ago. I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.	1642752382.0	htko8tt	t3_s7r2vr	t1_hthne5o	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htko8tt/

For those of you who don't know, this is a burger joint just above a typical fast food restaurant, but not even as "fancy" as an outback steakhouse. It's like a lower mid range burger chain, but the food was actually good for what it was.   Anyways.   Because this place had a small arcade, claw games, and was a common location for parties, this made parents believe that they could just let their little bundle of shit run around like they own the place. Kids literally screaming at the top of their lungs while running between guests and tables not even associated with the kids. Can't tell you how many times I dome checked kids while bussing tables. They ran in my direction while not paying attention, and I stood my ground. Nothing could be done about it, oh well. I'd ask these little shit constantly to stop running around, but I'm not their fucking parent and I didn't get paid enough to care beyond that.

7qe6iuic	I have maxed DL, and to reveal my bias here I was an Olympic style lifter all through HS. I found that sensation of your body tearing apart at the when doing most any max, but nothing quite compared to the bottom of a clean during a tournament winning C&J.  For HS Football, the coaches loved the traditional power lifting lifts (BS, Bench, DL) and they always seemed static, slow twitch and boring to me.  With the olympic style coach, we would do straight leg DLs, or Romanian DLs, where the idea was to actually improve your overall lifting ability by adding flexibility to the strength.  I do see what you’re saying overall though, but maybe this was a poor choice of CMV for me because my view is mostly unchanged.  Yes, I get that a heavy DL is a pure expression of the ability to move the most possible weight, how ever short the eventual distance.  But that still just seems boring overall to me.

3i7xyy5a	This is exhausting! You are asking a first year college philosophy question. And it's an ancient apologetics arguement. By (supposedly) clever wordplay, setting up  logically opposite parameters, you attempt to make your strawman God-concept impossible.  It's the equivilent of asking if God can make a rock so heavy that He can't lift it.   The scenario is so sophmoric and naive, it's the type of a question that needs more than an answer. Please come back after you pass your third year philosophy classes.	1642872494.0	htrkscq	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrkscq/
pon3b	I would actually like to add that even the free will argument is invalid. Suppose humans do have "free will" and that's why god doesn't intervene to stop things like genocide. First of all, that's still a shitty argument. Why not just program humans to not want to commit genocide? But more importantly, God clearly has no problem taking away free will from humans, or, creating ones that don't have any.   Think about people with mental illnesses, people who have brain injury, psychopaths etc. They all lack free will. Many of them were born that way or have had things happen to them that were completely out of their control. So God has no problem taking away free will from people when it's a tragic incident happening to them, but, when he would actually need to intervene with something like genocide or rape or murder, his followers conveniently claim that he can't, because then he would be removing free will.   Fact is, there is no way to apply the word "good" to God, because our definition of good doesn't include viruses, diseases, cancer and natural disasters.   The only thing a religious person can say is that we will find out when we die, which again, how convenient and also, how pathetic. Imagine believing your entire life that suffering is okay on earth because once you die you'll find out why it happened.	1642873062.0	htrm9eg	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrm9eg/

4ax34vrc	To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.  An "all powerful" God would have the power to keep people from unnecessary suffering, and yet millions of children still die per year needlessly, and Earth itself is on a massive decline that God isn't helping with in any way. Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	1642875841.0	htrtetx	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrtetx/

3avjbpji	I’m not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it “the problem of evil”, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world. Therefore, since there is undeniably evil in this world, god can’t exist as defined by the major monotheistic religions.

I have a sorta friend who has autism and he argues with me over every single little details.	1642934654.0	htv7fvt	t3_saq1rb	t1_htv6yy8	/r/changemyview/comments/saq1rb/cmv_reddit_should_allow_users_to_choose_not_to/htv7fvt/

It's like cognitive dissonance so thick and concentrated you could eat it with a spoon.      You want to argue that   >it should be made free to all citizens and be easily obtainable.      Yet are literally forming bullshit arguments that make no sense in order to justify saying the exact opposite.      You can't even make this shit up, it's so stupid it could only be a reddit comment someone actually believes.

de5yqhp1	Funny how you interpret someone thinking you're dumb as a brick as anger. Might want to think about why you do that, could learn something.      >therefor believe that blanket statements applying racist motives to voters is morally wrong.      Cool, keep arguing for the side of racists for their racist and power hungry agendas. It's actually even more sad that you don't even realize it, you're in blissful ignorance, at least most of the other ones are smart enough to realize what agenda they're pushing.      >Can you not grasp someone wanting to have a state election verified by state agency issued id's      No, I can not.

4yobbyhj	Anarcho capitalism is a fundamentally unworkable system. It would at best lead to fuedalism and at worst lead to some sort of plutocratic anarchy hellscape. We've seen the US's original government being scrapped in favor of the current one because it's failure to raise unified forces and others protections offered by tax revenue of the government. The US got libertarianism instead until the 1920s, which is a life version of Anarcho capitalism which failed because even the lite version, libertarianism, is unsustainable due to the fact that people are selfish. However, radical idealists will suspend belief and willfully overlook the fallacies to claim that anything short of mixture of ideas is truly workable.	1642954023.0	htw5ssn	t3_salk6y	t3_salk6y	/r/changemyview/comments/salk6y/cmv_anarchocapitalism_is_a_fundamentally/htw5ssn/

fvwm9ero	Everything you're saying stands on the laughable idea that misgendering someone is bigoted or immoral in any way. A man calling himself a woman is no different than a schizophrenic saying there's radios in the walls. You're really trying to argue that people who don't smile and play along to delusions are no different than racists? Please tell me you're just acting dense as bait.	1642978078.0	htxw69m	t3_sb1i9b	t1_htxbwr9	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/htxw69m/

fvwm9ero	I knew you'd be one of those "but muh DSM 5, gotcha!!" types. You probably don't even know what the DSM-5 is past what you've read in the Wikipedia intro. Even the director of the National Institute of Mental Health publicly shat all over it and its direction.   Regardless, I would love to see you explain how it's any different for a man to call himself a woman versus calling himself a duck. Both are obviously factually false, and easily disprovable scientifically. If you can offer literally anything I will applaud you.

10prgq	> It's *your* side that doesn't give any sort of clear answer, no characteristics for what makes someone a "man" or a "woman."  Yea, that's the fucking point you idiot.  Society has strictly dictated for millenia that men act this way and do this and women act that way and do that. When since time began we've all just been people doing our own damn shit and all your idiotic comments about the biological argument are 1. Cringe. 2. Irrelevant to a conversation about gender. And 3. Largely wrong lmao. You fail to recognize the middle ground that exists between male and female sex because you can **only** imagine a binary of male and female.  There aren't clear characteristics for what makes a man or a woman, that's the entirety of the point. When you have single moms who are the metaphoric father with a firm hand and you have stay at home dads who take care of the kids all day, your gender norms are fucked to death and left bleeding in a ditch but you idiots **SCREAM** about how this doesn't make sense! There are men! And women! And if you're trans you're really just a man who's confused! Showing how horribly and willfully blind you are to the calm reality of people living their lives without being bound to the strict ideals of male and female concepts which itself is fluid and cultural. Women went from flower-print stay at home moms to Rosie the riveter during the war because the public perception **needed** to change for the good of the country. So women wouldn't be shamed for working and because there was a shortage of labor.  No one can give a definition of what it means to be a man or a woman because that's an individualistic thing. I can say what being a man is to me but another man would disagree, claiming it's the polar opposite concepts that make him a man, and those reasons are just as valid.  The host, and argumentative individuals like yourself, are trying to box us into a strict definition so they can argue those definitions from a logical/scientific place, they don't actually have any interest in what these people think a woman is, they just want them to define it so they can argue against them with the full spectrum of hypocrisy and contradiction. "Oh? A woman is delicate? Well 'x' was a woman who stood up for her values and took charge, I'd say that was womanly of her, and not delicate, don't you think!?" For infinity.  But no natural woman or man, etc. Can say what makes one that thing. This has been debated by those within the rigid gender form for millenia as well. Hemingway and Wilde contributed on opposing ends of what makes a man, delicacy or vigor, etc. No one can say, so it's a stupid fucking question to try to pin on them and then say "haha, you can't even define what makes you that in a fashion everyone agrees with which NO ONE has been able to do! Time to invalidate your sense of identity!"  Every single argument with trans people and trans identity is just a rehash of the arguer not recognizing their identity and trying to find logical/mathematic/scientific basis for doing so that they can then hold up and say "see? I wasn't really a bigot, it's just science." And to eeeeeveryone who is with the shit you literally just sound like old school doctors who "proved race is genetic and that there is a hierarchy of species based on these clearly identifiable traits, see you have big lips so you must be inferior." "See, you can't define a woman so you must be a man."  "See you don't have x so you aren't equal to others" is the fundamental ideological basis. You're equivalent to racists in this regard.  Get, the fuck, over it.  There isn't a logical or mathematic or scientific or whatever basis for gender because it is a mental construct created by those within the culture. Recognizing the same genders as indigenous tribes have is a pretty low fucking bar and none of you elitist academic types can bend your bricked out brains around that one and it would (really) be so goddamn funny (genuinely) if it wasn't so horrifically exhausting and depressing to be invalidated for who you are, every single day, because idiots like you can't just let shit be that you don't understand.

It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	1643015022.0	htzyznj	t3_q2w16l	t3_q2w16l	/r/changemyview/comments/q2w16l/cmv_the_symmetrical_analog_stick_placement_on/htzyznj/

24rn8lua	>The only side driving children to suicide is yours.  If you believe gender dysphoric people have higher rates of suicide then you should agree increasing the number of people with gender dysphoria increases suicides.   Normalization and encouragement of children questioning their sex will increase suicides.  &#x200B;  >if people spent less time telling them they're attention seeking, pervert, liars they wouldn't have so much self loathing  The self-loathing is primarily from their physical body not matching their desires; no one says anything to them, people are too afraid to be shamed, judged, and fired.   Evidence that it is more than society causing the suicide rates can be seen by comparing transgender suicide rates to Jews in the Holocaust. The Jews had literally the worst societal impact, yet they had lower suicide rates?  >Nobody is forcing pronouns on you. They're...a part of speech? Do you not know what pronouns are?  Now suddenly no one is forcing them! Be consistent please.

I don't have "pronouns in my bio" and last I checked the cops aren't swatting down my door.  There is a social capital in the real world, and since DEI centers are part of companies and schools, if you act according to what the DEI centers support you get social brownie points. So yes, there is a social coercion in place.  Notice how you must take it to an absurd extreme of swatting so you can ignore reality.  >Oh, so you admit it is a power game. You're not fighting hard for the truth, you're fighting hard to obfuscate the truth because someone is lying to you to make you angry.  You brought up the power game first.

dosijqw	Vaccinated people can still contract and spread covid. There will be a ton of uninformed people in these comments arguing that if you get vaccinated, there’s less of a chance of that. They’re wrong. There are no covid studies that have a legitimate control group, so the results say what they want them to say, “get vaccinated so we can make more money”. The numbers of covid hospitalizations are wildly misrepresented because of the financial benefit hospitals have by coding someone as a covid pt, rather than some dude that was seen in the ER for a broken arm that happened to test positive for covid. Covid deaths are also being misrepresented for the same reason… pt brought in by EMS with a gunshot wound to the head? Covid positive? Yep, you guessed it, covid death. The reality is that covid is not the same virus that it was 2 years ago. The current variant is closer to a regular cold than it was when it was shutting down people’s lung function.  The pandemic is over. It’s the politicians and media that want to keep it going for personal gain.	1643039658.0	hu1524z	t3_sboy1e	t3_sboy1e	/r/changemyview/comments/sboy1e/cmv_i_do_not_intend_to_get_the_vaccine/hu1524z/

kmy0n	In my 30s, unvaccinated. I just recovered a few days ago after roughly 3 days of actually feeling sick.   I don't intend to vaccinate, and I'm open to having my mind changed, but I see the same talking points over and over, and I still don't see the value. I suppose I'm stuck in my way of thinking that we're all personally responsible for our own health, and that it's not my responsibility to vaccinate because of your grandma. (Ironically, my 80+ y/o, emphysema-diagnosed grandma just recovered from covid)  The talking point I see the most is that it's selfish to not vaccinate because it puts others at risk, but I have an issue with that... I see no reason to believe that I'm less likely to transmit the virus if I'm vaccinated. Based on my current understanding, it spreads by airborne germs and masking/washing my hands frequently is doing *significantly* more to reduce transmission than a vaccine would accomplish. Not to mention, having recovered, I now have antibodies to eradicate any exposure I have in the future.	1643040517.0	hu17a08	t3_sboy1e	t3_sboy1e	/r/changemyview/comments/sboy1e/cmv_i_do_not_intend_to_get_the_vaccine/hu17a08/

ggw5fsyd	mate that's because you're suggesting an idiotic thing in "Muhammad isn't idolised".  are you really trying to suggest me that a Jefferson or Gandhi statue is just attacked because people don't like that statue. or is it because people don't like the person whom the statue represent.  and i wasn't talking about metaphorical statues. i was talking about putting someone at a pedestal, idolising someone and to take you word at its face value, I'll have to go against the word of all four schools of Islam that covers all Muslims.   and no shit different things means different to different people. That still doesn't change the fact that Islam declares Muhammad as an ideal man. you're challenging me on my knowledge of Islam but it seems like you know nothing about it.	1643048505.0	hu1sqxe	t3_sblxcw	t1_hu1rfs3	/r/changemyview/comments/sblxcw/cmv_if_the_society_has_decided_that_were_to_pull/hu1sqxe/

If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here?

ipf00fhk	First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	1643053325.0	hu25mg6	t3_sb1i9b	t3_sb1i9b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/hu25mg6/

3xhaculn	That’s the bandwagoning fallacy - “everyone agrees with me, so I must be right”.    Science isn’t based on majority opinion. Objective facts don’t change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You’re as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the “scientific consensus” by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever’s in power?

e2rwy77z	So you're against killing animals, but arent vegan?  This makes you nothing more than a hypocrite.  Why would anyone place any weight whatsoever in any opinion you hold?  You've made it entirely clear you're against killing animals, but not against animals being killed for you (but you've said factory farming is bad, but also that it isnt?).  And you also have no understanding of supply/demand and fully believe that the meat industry kills animals purely for fun, and then people happen to buy it. Because people reducing demand would have no impact whatsoever on the number of animals killed?   You literally are incapable of logical thought.  Like I truly, genuinely doubt you are capable of following the most basic of cause and effects.  When you played catch as a kid did you plan to hold your hand out and try to catch something at a specific time and place irrelevant of if a ball was thrown?

Did you read carefully and with comprehension?  >The reason UFC isn't as big as boxing is because boxing has been around longer and there's more money in it.   There’s more money in it because it generates more money. That’s how business works. The conversation is that it will never be as big as boxing not why UFC isn’t as big as boxing.   >They are completely different combat sports, where boxing favors endurance and striking, and UFC favors wrestling techniques & grappling (thus a different body type is favored), generally top heavy guys with thigh strength.   A non-sequitor that can in no way be mistaken as a real response. Besides, strikers are dominant in the UFC. This right here doesn’t make sense for so many reasons but I’m not going to spend time on it since, again, it’s a non-sequitor.   >But that doesn't always mean 'non-black' as you stated Francis is built like a wrestler. In the lighter divisions, Nurmagomedov was utterly dominant for a long time, and is proficient at wrestling, he isn't a good boxer at all. This entire post is just wrong on all levels.

3p631	With all due respect, I think you are deeply ignorant.  Look at your language: you consider yourself a member of the "fact based community"--i.e., your beliefs are **fact**.  It logically follows that anyone who disagrees with you is, *ipso facto*, "factually" wrong.  You and your tribe have exclusive access to the Truth and that Truth is being threatened by ... shall we call them Blasphemers?  Or is that a little too on the nose?  Accusing your ideological opponents of being children is no idle threat.  Children, after all, do not enjoy access to all the civil rights of adults.  It sounds like you are enthusiastically in favor of stripping your fellow citizens of their essential liberties.  I hope you are simply ignorant of what lies around that bend.

Are you really just going to accept tyranny and oppression as okay staples in society, without looking deeper into the issues because you are so afraid of being ostracized for accepting what is on the news is fake? Are you really going to try to claim that people shouldn't be skeptical and speak out about a coalition of conglomerates, that have histories of seeking profits by using unethical sweat shops and slave and child labor for cheaper production costs of their products, trying to control the decision making process of every country in the world?

69ku6	The whole point of the term is for Americans, Jews, and Muslims to distinguish the male circumcision/genital mutilation they do from the female circumcision/genital mutilation that Africans do. You're trying to say that they are similar/equal by using the same term to describe both. Your view isn't about the best term to describe things, but a debate about religion and politics. From the perspective of atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, South Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc., it's all genital mutilation. Also, the next layer to this global culture war is trans surgery, which is often described as genital mutilation by conservative Americans, Jews, and Muslims who practice male circumcision/mutilation.  The interesting thing to the debate is that genital circumcision/mutilation is largely an African concept. The countries in the northern parts practice male genital mutilation (which are often described as Muslim and Jewish countries in the US). And countries in southern parts practice female genital mutilation (and they are often Christian/Muslim countries). The US is the exception. Because of the masturbation beliefs of the founder of Kellogg's, circumcision spread around the US.	1644179756.0	hvutdy8	t3_sm2hlm	t3_sm2hlm	/r/changemyview/comments/sm2hlm/cmv_female_genital_mutilation_day_should_be/hvutdy8/

The mods should actually remove his post or ask him to specify what he is talking about instead of making vague and general claims like he is doing.  &#x200B;  OP, just remember, you called him right wing but did not provide proof. If you are doing that simply because the MSM is telling you that he is right wing, then you already lose your own argument here.   &#x200B;  I am not a Joe Rogan fan, I just hate MSM and will always go on duckduckgo or bing and do research on the things MSM claims, which quite often reveals that MSM is lying about things they say. You can also google it, but google will always try and link you to the MSM websites, it is often quite difficult to get info that is not from CNN, Fox News, WaPo etc on google.  &#x200B;  As for his podcast, MSM is trying to cancel him because he had actual medical professionals on his show talking about MRNA vaccines etc.. The medical professionals from MSM was also on his show, that medical professional admitted that they lied about Joe Rogan on CNN. Then a day later, he went on CNN and said that he was afraid that Joe would climb over the table and attack him.... That's the type of misinformation they are spreading about Joe. There is a video from CNN where they literally manipulated a video of Joe Rogan to make him appear more green and sick than he actually was.   [https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30](https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30)  &#x200B;  Joe has never once claimed his podcast should be used for medical advice, but the media is smearing him for it. He made a video of when he had covid and said that he used Ivermectin, the media LIED and smeared him and said that he used horse medicine, despite Ivermectin being FDA approved for use in humans years ago already. This is called pushing a narrative, which is what MSM does, and they literally lied about ivermectin because they want to push that narrative.   &#x200B;  Now, months later, pharmaceutical companies are saying that in the trials, ivermectin seems to be effective against multiple corona strains, but you don't see the MSM reporting on this because that would go against their narrative.   https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japans-kowa-says-ivermectin-effective-against-omicron-phase-iii-trial-2022-01-31/  Even before this, there was a few studies that showed that ivermectin had decent effectiveness in treating covid symptoms, but the media refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to admit that they lied.  &#x200B;  Then there is the one where he had Jordan Peterson on. The MSM has always hated JP and if you watch the podcast, and then watch how the MSM reported on it, you will clearly see that the MSM is lying about it. Even if you don't like Joe, you can see that MSM is lying  &#x200B;  Now OP, my question to you is, are you going to actually provide proper reasons for the things you are saying so that people can dispute it, or will you leave your post as vague as possible in an attempt not to provide any deltas?	1644179969.0	hvutx9o	t3_sls5ch	t3_sls5ch	/r/changemyview/comments/sls5ch/cmv_rogan_was_always_problematic_the_only/hvutx9o/

hae7dast	It’s been pretty well accepted at this point in time that this is a problem in the African American community. Here I’ll throw you a bone if a racist system throws black dads in prison it’s going to be hard for them to take care of their kids that being said it’s still an issue for their kids. Another question you do not think their is a disparity in a black kids experience with fathers and a white/Asian etc kids experience?

hae7dast	There is a large body of evidence that points to broken family units in the African American community. If I provide said evidence would you even accept it? Do me a favor right now at random look up a black celebrity or any kind of influential black person on Wikipedia I would bet money their father was not in the picture. I would argue that children without fathers is a systemic issue in the African American community that is way easier to prove than systemic racism the latter is so hard t define and quantify while the former is simply a matter of correcting the right data in the right way.

jguxb	Duty, Responsibility, Defend, Protect, Serve.  Those are all words that come to mind when I think of what it means to love your country and patriotism.  I also believe a country is more than just a piece of dirt, the country is the people.  To me if you love your country you are suppose to do your part to prevent harm. This means wearing a mask and getting vaccinated!  Here is another thought. Picture an invading military attacking your country. What are the goals of this invading force? Perhaps to harm as many as possible, overwhelm the countries hospitals, and to kill as many as possible. People that help this invading force would be guilty of aiding & abetting, basically reason.  Not getting vaccinated is helping that invading covid force do more harm to the country.  In the US there are now over 900,000 deaths.  Hospitals have been overwhelmed multiple times. Seems to me that the invading force has done quite a bit of harm with the help of those that are anti vax and anti mask!	1644189227.0	hvvgdue	t3_sm8kwd	t3_sm8kwd	/r/changemyview/comments/sm8kwd/cmv_vaccination_is_a_patriotic_duty/hvvgdue/

526pt	That's non sequitur. I'm not talking about music reviews or opinion. I'm talking about white nationalists espousing debunked "race science" to push white supremacist policies. But yes, any media program should vet its guests to make sure they're not absolute cranks who spread racist bullshit.   And yes, I am saying we shouldn't let white supremacists speak in public to spread their message. You seem to be running head first into the [paradox of tolerance.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) One of the ways around it is to simply not tolerate bigotry. Again, I recommend doing the reading here. Why are you so adamant that they be able to share their hate?   Frankly, your second paragraph didn't even make grammatical sense. But yes, as stated above I do want to censor bigots. I do support "science facts" as you put it. I'd love for you to provide an example of "experiential designs" that were rapidly disproven. Do you mean phlebotomy and the other "race science" fields? Because yeah, we threw those out when they were disproven.   And no, not everything had scientific consensus* (you can't spell) but everything we've discussed today does. The only people disagreeing are bigots.

3l0mm7s2	My view is if you say yes in any state that is a green light. Condom or no. If you commit a crime while drunk you can’t claim you didn’t know what you were doing in court. “I was drunk so didn’t know the implications of drunk driving”. Why should that be acceptable here. Sober you chose to get drunk in that situation and so knew the risks involved. If you are aware of what is around you and can communicate that that is enough even if you are drunk off your ass. The only case this doesn’t apply is if the person is so far gone they can’t register what is around them. So long as they are awake and able to interact intentionally with their environment that counts as consent in my book.   Take for example if a man and woman are both drunk. Did the man rape the woman? Did the woman rape the man? Did they rape each other? After all if you rape someone while drunk it is still rape. The answer is it is just two drunk horny people. Pass them a rubber and leave the room.	1644199819.0	hvw3rg6	t3_sme8kj	t3_sme8kj	/r/changemyview/comments/sme8kj/cmv_i_disagree_with_the_notion_that_drunk_consent/hvw3rg6/

9zmnvmd	>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.

Saying your violence is justified because you think the right things, are support the right ideas or look the right way doesn't change that you are simply making an excuse to attack people who you think don't deserve to live their life as they see fit. How any of you can sit here and say you absolutely feel justified in attacking someone who has done you no harm is sick and disgusting. You are no better than those you claim are evil; you are literally doing the thing you say they are doing. See h isn't violence. Ideas are not violence. Action is violence, and if you attack someone because of who they are or what they think, it is you, not the one who you deplore, that are to blame.	1644201903.0	hvw87kh	t3_smb4z1	t3_smb4z1	/r/changemyview/comments/smb4z1/cmv_we_shouldnt_normalize_attacking_racists_such/hvw87kh/

8iskmbxm	The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don’t hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.

I mean that's what almost happened in 2021.   Russian trolls on Facebook spreading misinformation about how the election was stolen. Trump being so self-absorbed and an ego-maniac played right into Putin's hands. Culminated to retarded Trump supporters invading their own capitol, chanting "hang Mike Pence".  What unfolded in 2021 showed the world how fragile the US really is. It was a national embarrassment.

I personally would think your character is more than just an argument on reddit but if that's what you want to water it down to by all means. For me an ad hominem would be more akin to "you like chocolate ice cream therefore your opinion is invalid". Citing a separate argument you made to question your motives is not ad hominem, but i'll drop it regardless.   I apologize for attacking your unrelated argument/character in another thread.   However I don't think it's that wrong to question whether you're arguing honestly when in another thread you're making the claim humans can't rape animals.

She begged us to let her die and asked the doctors nurses to end it. We had no recourse and seeing her like that destroyed all of us who had to take care of her until her last breath. I think this case was an ideal situation for euthanasia because there is no treatment no remedies for what she has gone through. It was a slow and painful journey for her and all of my family.

oueps	I've had this conversation recently and I fully agree with you. People here are trying to argue that power is a broad term, but I say it isn't, because you are particularly referring to the power they have to permanently ruin lives on a whim. The power to send someone to prison is something society takes too lightly.   Others argue that you can counter them with money (equally powerful lawyers) just proves the point. The majority of people doesn't have the kind of money you would need to very technically argue your case. The fact that you have to navigate the law with money just shows that even if justice is blind, it is effected by the smell of money.   Judges do not serve justice, they serve their own whims when they decide someone needs to serve a harsh sentence if they're having a bad day. I am deeply disturbed by this fact.  The solution I came up with is to have multiple judges independently decide if a sentence is just. People will argue that it will be expensive and cumbersome. I argue that if you were in a position where you wanted a fair outcome, you would want the best possible practice.  I have zero faith in the justice system as it currently stands.	1644236013.0	hvxpf0j	t3_slzyfs	t3_slzyfs	/r/changemyview/comments/slzyfs/cmv_judges_have_too_much_power/hvxpf0j/

It’s just another reason for people to remain divided under the guise of freedom and choice.   Because there is no actual choice. Not in any society. It’s all the same shit with varied marketing and price points to give the illusion of choice.   This applies to consumer goods, infrastructure and our government. And we do it to ourselves.

oaaz2zi	What do you think antibodies do? They fight virus ALREADY IN your system. You've already caught the virus. Vaccine generated antibodies or t cells are preventing you from getting seriously ill from it, dumbass. It gives your immune system a head start. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult...     I've heard several other idiots make this argument before. "If someone who was vaccinated tests positive, the vaccine didn't work."      Antigen and PCR tests test for the presence of the virus in your system, which nothing can prevent (except maybe wearing a mask, but i'm pretty sure I know where you stand on that too). Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.      It's incredible to me that it's been public knowledge for over a year that 90+% of people in the hospital with covid are unvaccinated and people like you still can't put two and two together.	1644251316.0	hvym7k9	t3_slxs0c	t1_hvygumx	/r/changemyview/comments/slxs0c/cmv_healthy_people_under_65_should_not_get_covid/hvym7k9/

Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?  America is overreaching and attempting to extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, all the way to Russia's border, trying to drink Russia's milkshake, and retards like you think everything is going to be kumbaya and Putin is just going to let this fly.	1644253036.0	hvyqids	t3_si2zhl	t1_hvynrxa	/r/changemyview/comments/si2zhl/cmv_the_usnato_made_the_ukraine_situation_a_crisis/hvyqids/

1guci2fy	>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat.

1guci2fy	That's not how rational discourse works, that's not how debate works, and that's not how CMV works.   If you make an argument in your OP, it is up for debate. When someone comes along and disagrees with that point in your argument that you can no longer counter, you don't get to say "no no no, I just mentioned that, it isn't actually what I want to talk about."  That is a bad faith argument and you are no longer able to be debated against when you refuse to concede even an INCH of ground from your original topic against someone who makes a rational argument against your initial topic.   You brought up the mandate protests. That makes them a topic that is on the table for conversation. Then, when you ran out of arguments about that point, you just said "no no no, I don't wish to discuss mandate protests any more."   If you want to change the conversation that is allowed to be debated in this topic, then that is a VIEW CHANGE. otherwise, you're just making bad faith arguments that any time you hit a wall against you can then just change the topic of conversation again to steer it away from a point you brought into the debate to begin with.	1644256466.0	hvyzccd	t3_sm8kwd	t1_hvyxqmx	/r/changemyview/comments/sm8kwd/cmv_vaccination_is_a_patriotic_duty/hvyzccd/

Hence the primary reason in listing them in the first place.    Beyond that, its an article about how a few people feel.    Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....

Christian conservatives(maybe not as hostile generally but very oppressive   3. laws that don't protect us around the world(many laws of oppression still exist)   .. after that i think it gets a bit more confusing as to where the source is.. but there sure are a lot of assholes out there.	1645038163.0	hx7hxs1	t3_stwkkf	t3_stwkkf	/r/changemyview/comments/stwkkf/cmv_political_islam_is_the_most_antilgbt_force_on/hx7hxs1/

96lyxge9	Good post mate 😁✌🏻 You aren’t Islamaophobic, you are simply stating the reality of life for countless LGBT living in constant fear under the theocracy that helps govern almost all of the countries you listed. You will of course get non stop “whataboutism” from over emotional hacks, but that being said it doesn’t change the facts. Also, the hypocrisy of these defenders is often times astounding as they will decry China’s treatment of the Uyghurs who are placed in “re-education” camps to curb what they view are extremist beliefs which can (and has) lead to terrorism.. all the while supporting or at least defending throwing gays off buildings and/or stoning them. I agree with neither of those for the record since it has to be said in todays cringe world. There are Muslims like Maajid Nawaz who I respect a great deal as he and many others are attempting to reform Islam and its more extreme beliefs and practices. Also, for the idiots who say “[insert other religion here] used to do XYZ” - yes and they have already undergone their reforms in the past to the point they’ve reached today. Ffs even the Catholic Church, which has had some of the strongest anti-LGBT beliefs, their leader Pope Francis has holds more conciliatory views on LGBT as opposed to the past.  Oh and prior to him they weren’t throwing gays off buildings so there’s that as well.	1645041722.0	hx7r9pf	t3_stwkkf	t3_stwkkf	/r/changemyview/comments/stwkkf/cmv_political_islam_is_the_most_antilgbt_force_on/hx7r9pf/
h27rq98j	You are technically correct but the average voter doesn’t understand how this works.  God love ‘em but most people are Joe Six Pack dipshits who perceive national debt like the credit card debt which is currently choking their personal finances. This causes them additional economic anxiety and fuels division and radicalism which fights against spending and causes damage to society.   In this way, you could say national debt is not dangerous but if the people are ignorant about it then it can turn dangerous in the end.	1645041801.0	hx7rh33	t3_su4tk4	t3_su4tk4	/r/changemyview/comments/su4tk4/cmv_the_national_debt_does_not_matter_and_worry/hx7rh33/

f9bhd	You are focusing on something I have already clarified, many times, and are both acting Hostile and accusing me of acting in bad faith. Clarification is not gaslighting, and by conflating the two you are degrading actual examples of actual gaslighting, and convincing others that it's a term that can be used to just shut down discussion.

78nru9bn	True, I agree with your opinion, particularly as fundamentalist Islam carries so much weight in the countries you’ve highlighted, in addition to quite a few others, such as Brunei. I remember when the sultan of Brunei proposed a law to stone homosexuals to death when it introduced a new set of regulations that were based on sharia law. However, he backtracked after global boycotts of Bruneian businesses and protests outside of embassies, showing that perhaps political pressure can work in certain circumstances. However, homosexuals are still incredibly oppressed in Brunei, and I have to agree that fundamentalist Islam is the greatest oppressor of the LGBT community.	1645048297.0	hx886rj	t3_stwkkf	t3_stwkkf	/r/changemyview/comments/stwkkf/cmv_political_islam_is_the_most_antilgbt_force_on/hx886rj/

4dhvghpd	What argument? I replied because you said  "lots of Muslim countries don't jail you for being gay either" and "There are many Muslim countries above non-Muslim countries on the LGBTQ+ safety rating"     23 out of the 26 Islamic countries would jail you or worse for being gay. So, you're wrong.     Admittingly, I think the other point is trash. Yes, technically all Muslim countries are above Nigeria--which itself is a primarily Muslim country by population. But none of the primarily Muslim countries are above the bottom third, most are in the bottom 20. Whatever statement about safety you're trying to make is meaningless what you're comparing is danger to danger     You've provided no examples.

You very blatantly have read my comment in a line by line way, where you tried to find a way to disagree with each line, instead of taking my whole argument as it was. It's pretty discouraging to write a comment you think is thoughtful, and to have the other person try to dissect it instead of understand it.  I'll make it simple for you.  1)There is a claim: "you can't be racist against Muslims because Islam is not a race".  2) Being 'racialised' is when your differences are treated as innate, important, and as a reason to treat you differently to others. That's just what the word means. We look at people with different skin colours and say that's a 'different race' but we don't do the same with hair colour, even though both have a visual genetic component.  3) People who are 'visibily' Muslim (women who were headgear) are treated in much the same way as a hated racial group. Islam is being 'racialised'.  >Muslims and Jewish are not religions, these are members of religions. Islam and Judaism are religions, and these religions can never turn into races. They have scriptures, rituals, and a set of beliefs. All of which has nothing to do with the definition of a human race.  None of this matters. Not a word of this is relevant.   >What do you mean by "systematic shitty deal"? And do you have any proof to support this claim?  Do you really think that an equitable society is the null hypothesis? Seems like I'm arguing with a useful idiot. Probably best to end it here; you demonstrably would rather disagree with someone line by line then try to understand what they're saying.	1645058251.0	hx8vuyx	t3_stkq6y	t1_hx7xl2w	/r/changemyview/comments/stkq6y/cmv_if_joe_biden_wanted_to_pick_a_black_woman_as/hx8vuyx/

7xtu3	Can I tell you exactly what The Left does that damages Women, and completely devalues SA and Rape as crimes(specifically Feminism, but you could apply it to The Left in general)...  Remove the meaning of everything, and conflate everything together...  You know the stat which says "97% of Women will be SA'd in their life? That comes from a study which defined SA as anything from Rape to "A guy said I looked pretty". Now whether this was intentional or not, Feminism/The Left absolutely RAN with this. Speaking to someone is SA. Making an inappropriate joke, is SA. Touching a Womans shoulder, is SA. In fact, an autistic teen was CONVICTED of SEXUAL Assault for doing exactly that. Shoulders are Sexual now?  On the flip side is the Feminist idea that Boobs ARENT Sexual, and are just normal and should be allowed out in public. Now thats fine if you believe that, but you HAVE to keep consistency. If boobs arent Sexual, then touching without consent ISNT SA. Sounds pretty dangerous to Women there, but what do I know, I cant stand Feminism...  All this is moot btw. Forget all this "Telling Women that SA ruins their lives" and take it back a step: Telling Women that theyve been raped when LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENED is probably going to fuck with them more, psychologically speaking. Reverse gaslighting, is that a thing? Because thats whats happening!  This is gonna sound really harsh, and is gonna get me downvoted to fuck, but every single time I hear a story about someone be "Abused" or "Assaulted" I have to ask if anything ACTUALLY HAPPENED. And that applies to both Sexual cases and normal Assault cases. This is partially why the conviction rates are so low. Not only is it a hard crime to prove, but you cant prove something when its not what you mean.  Youve also got Rape by Regret: ie "I was more than happy to have sex with him, till I woke up and realized hes an ugly dude, so I can just say he raped me to save face". Very extreme example yes, but also another example of Feminism/Leftists supporting the whole "Lets change the meaning of words for shits n giggs lol"  You want Women to be able to confidently come out and tell the world IF they get SA'd? Well start by putting consistent firm meanings on the actual terms involved. If you (Feminism or The Left) cant do that, then youve got no hope of un-fucking-up Women...	1645075320.0	hx9u1ux	t3_subcv8	t3_subcv8	/r/changemyview/comments/subcv8/cmv_the_way_we_discuss_sexual_assault_on_the_left/hx9u1ux/

The fact that every line of your comment had a flaw in it does not prove that I was trying to read your comment line by line or disagree with it line by line.

4axbe	In my county about 90% of ALL arrests are defended by the public defender's office which means they are below the poverty line.  Even small amounts of money are big barriers for these people. It is not unusual for a person to sit in jail for a month because they can't afford $100 bond and then see their case dropped for lack of evidence.  It's really shitty and needs to be fixed.  When arrested usually people get a bail amount set by the police unless there is a warrant (then it was set by judge) or if its a crime that gets no immediate bail like domestic violence. If you have money you can usually get out in a few hours but you rarely need to sit in jail more than 1 day.  If you don't have money, you will stay in the jail for 24-36 hrs until you get a first appearance with a judge and a random public defender to basically just check that on the surface there was probable cause and stuff and they'll adjust bail based on the crime and personal circumstances, like job, family, house, etc. that makes it less likely that you'd fail to appear in the future. This is not the time to discuss your innocence or explanation, just shut up and answer questions directly.  If you are arrested on the weekend you will usually get worse bail and conditions like gps monitors because felony level judges will see you instead of misdemeanor level judges.  Always get out ASAP if possible because it's rarely a better deal if you wait to see the judge.  Here's where the real shitty part happens. After your first appearance and your bail is set by a judge, if you can't pay you will just sit in jail until your paperwork gets processed, the states attorneys have time to review your case and maybe make a plea offer, and your public defender gets assigned to your case. This is usually about a week before the pd even knows who you are.  In my county each public defender has 100+ clients at any given time. If you are in jail you can't really just call them to talk because jail calls are recorded (and reviewed by states attorneys!) so you have them make an appointment with you which is done through a video conference setup that can only last about 15 minutes and often has horrible video and audio.  This meeting often can't even happen for several weeks after your first appearance because it takes time to get together stuff to really talk about.  If you are arrested call your pd to request an appt ASAP.  Have your friends and family call the pd to request an appt.  Write them letters to request an appt. DO NOT DISCUSS YOUR CASE on the phone or in letters.  Just say I'm here, I can't bail out, and I need help.  Squeaky wheel gets the grease. Maybe they can get a bond hearing and get you out or force the state to drop or lower charges faster than waiting for the system to work.  Life is sooo much easier with money and friends and family that care about you. In fact if you have money (nice car and don't drive in bad areas of town, also not being black helps) you probably won't even get stopped by the police in the first place!!  I'm not sure what the solution is but the current system really needs reform.	1645129543.0	hxcrpfo	t3_suwmr7	t3_suwmr7	/r/changemyview/comments/suwmr7/cmv_cash_bail_is_blatantly_discriminatory_it_does/hxcrpfo/

I have a sneaky suspicion that you dont want to change your mind, or have a healthy exchange of ideas, but are simply an old fashioned bored (and boring) sexist looking to stir crap up.

You will have to work longer days and retire later and pay more taxes. You won’t have time to research for yourself what’s going on. America’s army works for private interest, not yours. Giant corporations are the military and they want more taxes and distracted citizens. America’s empire and control over rival nations is stronger if you accept their narrative and you have to fund the nation more and you never have the time to question their easily digestible propaganda.	1645142903.0	hxdpjh8	t3_suyz0a	t3_suyz0a	/r/changemyview/comments/suyz0a/cmv_ultimately_the_extreme_increase_in_house/hxdpjh8/

5msglo9c	Nice try, but you've illustrated otherwise, in that you're pretty feminine on the spectrum and nurturing (nothing to do with sexuality). Furthermore for my arguments sake I did state ''on average'' so they're clearly exceptions.   Five year olds can hardly reason.  Please do not try to back peddle as if you're not naturally nurturing now. It's laughable that you'd attempt to for arguments sake. That emotional response to my logical conclusion states otherwise.  I can easily spin this to the fact that you're an anomaly who is very likely not going to pass on her genes so your arguments mean little to society.	1645172378.0	hxf8sqo	t3_sv2rgr	t1_hxf7p6d	/r/changemyview/comments/sv2rgr/cmv_gender_pay_gap_is_not_a_real_problem/hxf8sqo/
