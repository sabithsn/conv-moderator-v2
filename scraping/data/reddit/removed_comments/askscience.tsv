70hfuiy	Are you speaking about the pain of the tooth, before the root canal? Because the route is not dead then. The process of the root canal removes the root and the pulp. Thereby getting rid of the pain. The actual process of the root canal is done with Novacaine and is painless.	1642695579.0	hth35e4	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hth35e4/
d9g6t	Don't be ashamed for wanting to learn. No one is born knowing this stuff, we gotta learn somehow!   So, not direction, just speed. You just assume the particles are moving randomly at an average speed related to temperature, because that's really what temperature IS, it's just the average vibrational energy of particles in a substance.   I kind of glossed over R because it's a little harder to explain. For an ideal gas, it doesn't matter how heavy the particles are. Basically, you can always determine how many atoms are in a liter of gas from the temperature and pressure because of the ideal gas constant, as long as that gas behaves like an ideal gas.  As for WHY it is what it is, that's mostly beyond my own comprehension. But what I do know is that it took scientists many years and many experiments to settle on the value. It is made up of two components, Avogadro's number and Boltzmann's constant. Avogadro's number is 6.02 x 10^23 , and it is defined as the number of atoms or molecules in a mole. A mole is roughly 1 gram of protons or hydrogen atoms (it was defined using carbon so it's a little off for hydrogen, but very very close). Boltzmann's constant is a relation between the kinetic energy of a single particle in a gas and its temperature.	1642696601.0	hth5x9d	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth2u1w	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5x9d/
btm1a6we	Cause the nerve isn't dead but is not salvageable either.  There is a big hole in our immune system; the nerve endings. They are so delicate that immune system is basically told to stay away from there. Otherwise the immune system could do too much damage.  So, when the nerves in the root canal gets inflamed you can't just clean it, cover it up and wait the body to heal it. The infection can travel inside the nerve bundles and destroy more of the nerve endings. Due to the proximity to your brain we are looking at grave injury or possibly death from untreated infection. So, the best choice is to kill the nerve. Which is the pain you feel, they will deliberately destroy the nerve and insert medication in the canal that will take care of the infection.     This is why cavities that exposes the nerve are so dangerous, there is a "hole" in out defense hidden inside our teeth.	1642697805.0	hth97rs	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hth97rs/
btm1a6we	>The actual process of the root canal is done with Novacaine and is painless.  Umm... no. it isn't. There is usually one very sharp pain and to get there can also be painful, and Novocaine is not magical, it removes by far most of it but when it comes to drilling to a root, it WILL hurt unless it is already dead. I call the sharp pain "piercing blue" cause that is the best way to describe it. I've had 7 root canals (and yes, i take care of my teeth now...). The numbing agent will numb the pain very fast, so i can say it is tolerable, it is just a second and the pain is then gone forever.	1642698140.0	htha5d2	t3_s8mble	t1_hth35e4	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htha5d2/

ajweh	So similar to the standard for a gram being 1cuibc cm, a mole is a gram worth of single protons? I'm assuming hydrogen isn't important but works because it only has 1 proton? And this mole is a way to measure volume so if we know the volume we could calculate exactly how much gas is inside? Then Boltzmann's constant tells us how the particles will behave when a force is applied? And using both measurements is considered the constant for ideal gas?   So like time and distance can determine the speed, these two factors can determine the speed of gas?

d9g6t	Well it's not exactly the mass of protons, it's equal to 8 grams of carbon, and it was chosen for historical reasons. If scientists had waited until today to define a mole, it would probably be equal to a gram of protons or something less arbitrary. The exact specifics aren't super important for basic measurements, just that everyone agrees on them.   Boltzmann's constant is the basis for relating the entropy of a system on a macro, measurable scale to its statistical components. Even after taking multiple classes in thermodynamics I have a hard time understanding it, but for practical purposes you can just accept it as a constant and not worry too much about what it means. Just that it comes up a lot in chemistry and thermodynamics and you often need to use these constants when designing chemical processes or machines like engines. The actual derivations are pretty advanced physics and math and beyond my understanding.	1642700844.0	hthhomc	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hthatwf	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthhomc/
eb3o8	It sounds like your endodontist was being stingy with with your analgesic.

d02xq	I've had several root canals, and the only time I had pain during a procedure was a tooth that had a bad infection. I'd already lost the nerve on that particular tooth, but when they were performing the procedure the relief of pressure from the infection drainage felt painful.  Every other root canal I've had was completely pain free after the initial lidocaine injections.	1642703823.0	hthpvhu	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hthpvhu/

16hgtd	So… you posted a link about hotter air and higher speed of sound then in the next sentence talk about hotter air being less dense than cooler air. Click the link please. The top of it talks about how IF PRESSURE IS CONSTANT this occurs. Yes ADDING heat to air causes it to expand and generally be less dense and rise etc. HOWEVER, if you added heat to air in a fixed size container it would heat up but the DENSITY would remain the same. Instead the PRESSURE would rise. There are many situations where you could have air at different DENSITY but the same TEMPERATURE. DENSITY does not equal PRESSURE.  As to why it’s faster in hotter air I will leave that up to people with more knowledge than myself.	1642705373.0	hthu5dn	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthu5dn/

15v3y2	I've had a couple of root canals but they were recommended by my dentist before there was any pain or inflammation.  As long as you get the procedure done prior to an infection, it's really not a whole lot worse than getting a cavity filled.  When people refer to painful root canals what they're really referring to is the infection itself and then having the procedure done while the infection is still ongoing.	1642707780.0	hti0l3e	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hti0l3e/

t5bcq	Since you obviously know your stuff, I'd like to ask an additional question.  I live in western Canada, where -30C to -40C temperatures are a a given for at least a few weeks each year.  These low temps are usually associated with high barometric pressure, sunny weather, and still air.  As soon as one steps outside in these conditions, one notices that sounds carry much further and much more clearly.  You can immediately notice a strange delay factor in judging distances.  The person shovelling their sidewalk a block away sounds like they're right next door, yet you can hear the delay caused by the finite speed of sound as their body movements don't match, visually.  I gather that the colder, denser air transmits sound with greater range and fidelity, but at a somewhat lesser speed?	1642714476.0	htihpu9	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth02zq	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htihpu9/

At that depth, the weight of the water above, pushing downwards, is about 150 times normal atmospheric pressure (Source: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Ask the Van). Even with this much pressure, water only compresses less than one percent."

I never got anything but lidocaine,  and the dentist telling me I should only feel pressure used to make me so angry.

I never felt any pain, only pressure.  I was loopy for about 4 hours afterwards though.	1642722825.0	htj0z8t	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htj0z8t/
mmqz5	Have had 2 root canals. First one was hilariously painless......and also left the bottom half of my face on that side numb for 2 months as they actually hit the nerve dead on in my jaw, apparently.   The second one was the most excruciating pain I've ever had, and I literally walked three blocks to my car and drove home an hour and a half after tearing my ACL. That was far less pain than the 2nd root canal.	1642723331.0	htj273a	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htj273a/

f3vla	I had a root canal about six months ago. I was expecting it to be agony. The doctor injected anesthetic near the base of the tooth several times and the procedure was painless.  The follow-up to that was preparing the tooth for a crown at my usual dentist. They didn't bother to numb me up, since the tooth had no nerves to cause pain. I felt practically nothing, even as they ground it down.	1642724147.0	htj459b	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htj459b/

50onv	Gasses decrease in viscosity as their temperature decreases. Hotter air is more viscous, and absorbs more of the sound energy through internal viscous frictional forces. Cooler air absorbs less of this energy and allows sounds to travel further.   The relative stillness of the air also minimizes energy losses I imagine, but the viscous properties likely have a lot more to do with it.	1642725527.0	htj7eck	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htihpu9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htj7eck/

o1w3t	I think it would supercavitate first, which would form a wall of water vapour at extremely low pressures around the moving object. This is because water can transform state at low pressures, unlike air. This could happen in water at a few hundred metres per second - not slow, but within the range of high velocity torpedoes and high speed propellors. Given it supercavitates, we now seek the speed of sound in the gas rather than the liquid water.  This may be rusty, it's memories of a long past fluid mechanics course.	1642726277.0	htj95u1	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hti9hxn	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htj95u1/

qpexbmf	Oh, that's kind of boring but makes sense lol.

The morning of my MI I wasn't even sure I'd had a heart attack but felt odd and luckily due to my experience with my family's history I went to the hospital.  I'm sure my blood pressure was elevated before but I was unaware.  Then the blockages are treated - I had a couple of stents placed as a result and have since been on medication to control blood pressure and watching my diet to control cholesterol and such.	1642727871.0	htjcudp	t3_s88jeh	t3_s88jeh	/r/askscience/comments/s88jeh/do_arterial_blockages_get_diagnosed_regularly/htjcudp/

Assign that number as a distance, like cm or mm or in. Then draw a circle with that radius, you know the point you are looking for is on that circle. Repeat with a second point and now your location can only be one of two places on the paper, where those circles intersect. With a third point there is only one place on the paper your location can be (hence *tri*angulation).

zqjvy	Not a lot of people know, but there are nerve crossovers from your left and right jaw that cross in the front of the roots, so no matter how much they numb it, it can still be very sensitive. This can also be caused by high adrenaline causing blood to flow faster than usual, and medicine to have a lesser effect.  Speaking from a voice of experience, I got 5 shots of different numbing agent, and I still felt the whole process.	1642738752.0	htk1e4o	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htk1e4o/
rwbls	I've had lots of root canals due to my poor dental hygiene as a kid, I also drink lots of soda, and smoke cigarettes and marijuana so that doesn't help either. I consider myself a pretty good patient though, I don't complain much, try to stay completely still, raise my hand and wait for the dentist to be away from my mouth when I need a second. I also have a pretty high pain tolerance, mostly because of a tooth I got removed when I was kid and the dentist gave me a shot in the root/nerve or something. I don't know what she did but it's left me with this sense of "as long as the pain doesn't reach that level I'm fine"  The last two root canals I had were absolutely dreadful. I came in to get some teeth carved up to get crowns. Too much decay, so they said I needed root canals, which I kinda knew. They send the money lady in, I pay some more, they get back to work. He starts doing something and I'm immediately in some of the worse pain in my life. Nearly in tears, fluddering like a mad man, I'm trying to tell him to stop. He gets me some more anesthetics, and the rest went smooth.  I asked him what that was, and said he was just flushing my nerve out, but since I wasn't originally getting root canals, he forgot he didn't use as much anesthesia as he would normally use. It literally felt like I was have something pulled out of my tooth, like a string of my brain through the root of my tooth.	1642738965.0	htk1u7x	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htk1u7x/

The delay between the sun and the earth is about 8 minutes.

fep5k	Can confirm. Had root canal treatment a year ago. Went to a doc who specialized in it. 3 hours in the chair, no pain at all. I had to watch out to now fall asleep (seriously). All filmed with cam so I could watch every step. Was just there few days ago to check if everything is good on xray and it's perfectly fine.  There are a couple of things you can watch out for to know if your doc is qualified for root canal treatment:  - does he use a microscope for the treatment? If not: don't go there - how does he measure the exact length of the root canal? A professional will have a electronic device for that (not sure about the english name but basically it does use low voltage to make sure doc doesn't accidentally drill out of your tooth but also doesn't forget a tiny part of the root canal, which would result in the infection getting back (eventually after years)) - what materials does your doc use to fill the root canal and what methods? Afaik guttapercha is still considered the best since it's reasonably stable (what you want) but still a natural product used for decades now (so we know it's not toxic even after years). But there are different ways how to lay guttapercha. Most just insert sticks, which obviously don't seal tight, causing bacteria to get back in again over time from the bottom of your tooth. So my doc heated it somehow and then pushed the resulting  paste in there really tight. Maybe there are superior methods to this by now but from my research they all come with the issue that they use materials we don't know for long enough to be sure how they perform over time - how does your doc make sure all bacteria in your canal is killed and no new get in during the process of the treatment? A good doc will use a rubber cloth in your mouth around the tooth so only the tooth he's working on is visible and no spit cat get in. He'll take the time to clean the canal using some sort of bacteria killing liquid (can't recall what was used in my case) at least twice before closing it. - and also of course, a good doc will take the time when doing the anesthesia asking you for feedback and eventually doing more if needed. Mine explained very carefully what nerves he needs to tread for that specific tooth and how they run in my mouth. From that point i knew that he knew what he's doing. I never had less pain at a treatment even for minor treatments.   To be fair thought my root canal was still vital as opposed to dead which normally results is better anesthesia. Afaik once your root canal is dead the anesthetics can't get there. It will still hurt (obviously, that's why you're there) but there not much a doc can do about it in that case. You still have to treat it or the infection will get worse. So all you can do in that case is hope for the best. A good dentist knows that and will inform you about it before the treatment.	1642748415.0	htkioif	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkioif/

66f7e	Marcaine is the long lasting anesthetic you are thinking of.  The other alternatives of the anesthetic not working is: A) an active infection. An infection is acidic in nature. Anesthetics are basic in nature. The acid in the infection will neutralize the anesthetic, reducing its effectiveness. (Which is why many dentists will drain an abscess, or give antibiotics to reduce the infection prior to treatment.) B) too much swelling/infection around the area preventing the anesthetic from getting where it needs to be to work.  There is also often pressure associated with root canal treatments as well as micromovements of the ligaments and tendons surrounding the tooth, causing some irritation post-procedure which can cause discomfort and pain afterwards. (Think of soreness after you go to the gym.) This pressure can be quite uncomfortable depending on intensity and the location. If it is on a top tooth, this pressure can be against your sinus cavity as well. Anesthesics will not get rid of any pressure.  In regards to post-treatment discomfort and pain: each person and each tooth reacts differently to root canal treatments. (I know I've had five done.) How active and recent the infection is, how intense the pain is day of procedure and the technique done on the tooth, may dictate the body's reaction to the procedure.  (Some dentists use the two-appointment technique as it was popular as it provided a higher success rate as opposed to the one appointment technique. But with more recent equipment, materials, and more accurate x-rays the two step method is slowly being phased out.)  Root canal treatments are also lengthy, and requires the patient to be open wide for long periods of time, which can create jaw pain post treatment.  And last, but not least: the only good story is a bad one. Nobody wants to hear about how you had the most wonderful root canal and how you fell asleep in the chair. But everybody wants to hear how you writhed and screamed in the chair getting this horrifying procedure that is pulling the nerves out of your tooth.	1642752932.0	htkozqa	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkozqa/
oaj84	I have gotten into the habit of asking for articaine even for relatively minor stuff. It has a faster onset than lidocaine, is way more effective, so I feel safe and comfy through the entire procedure, and from what I understand, it decays exponentially so it takes much faster to wear off. For me, lidocaine sometimes takes 6 hours to be fully gone, and even then there is some residual tinglyness, with articaine, I can eat as soon as I get home.	1642753997.0	htkqevi	t3_s8mble	t1_htjta4p	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkqevi/

bv306	My understanding of this is that it's not the root canal that hurts but rather the infection in surrounding tissue (containing live nerves). I had an abscess (which is the worst pain I've personally experienced) but had the root canal done completely anaesthetic free. This was terrifying as you associate all dentistry with severe pain and the whole time I expected the dentist to hit a nerve. Was actually a drama free experience and was a novelty not to have my face numb for the rest of the day.	1642761301.0	htkzm63	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkzm63/

b1eq5	Speed of sound measures how fast a vibration on one side of an object can reach the other object.  For example, picture a tube 1m in length filled with some substance. If you push the substance inside at one end, how fast will the other side of the tube feel that movement? If you divide 1m by the time it took the movement to reach the other side you get that substance's speed of sound.  If the substance inside is, for example, solid steel, it's easy to figure that the other side moves almost instantaneously, and that speed of sound is incredibly high (approximately 3000 m/s, which might as well be infinite). This is true when we talk about an incompressible substance, and it also holds pretty well for water, for example. In fact, the speed of sound in water is approximately 1500 m/s, just about half of steel.  If the substance inside is air, instead, we don't expect the movement to be instantaneous. This is because air is compressible, so what happens when you push on one side is that some molecules of air just get closer to each other and form a wave (an acoustic wave, to be precise) which travels through the tube until it reaches the other side.  The speed of sound in air and in other gases is proportional to (the square root of) temperature. Why is that?  Temperature is a measurement of how fast, on average, the molecules of air are bouncing around and mixing with one another. This means that if you insert some floating color at one side of the tube, since air is moving so fast and is mixing with nearby particles, the color will spread much faster than if temperature was lower (and thus with lower mixing).  This is very similar in the case of an acoustic wave: if an acoustic wave forms, it can move much faster through the air if it is hotter because fast-moving particles are much better at transfering properties through the fluid.	1642764405.0	htl3ov3	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htl3ov3/

Two satellites intersects two spheres, giving you a planar circle that you could be anywhere on.  Adding a third satellite intersects another sphere with that circle, leaving two possible positions that you could be at, and a fourth satellite narrows down your location to which of those two positions is correct.

hljxc6c	As far as I understand, no, at least jot with opioids bc of the way that they change our brain chemistry. As I understand if we have specific opioid receptors in our brains (mu or something i believe?) And our brain actually creates more receptors to take in more opioids, which is why tolerance goes up so fast but doesnt come back down at the same rate, these receptors never go away. So while uou might be able to replace one addiction with another with any other substance i dont think the same rules apply to opioids. I am am addict and have known many other addicts over my time who have picked up a new addiction when trying to beat opioid addiction and just ended up with 2 addictions. Except maybe for weed. I know thar weed helps immensely with opioid withdrawal and detox, and pain management that leads many users to addiction in the first place. I personally have had a lot of luck using cannabis instead of opiates for my physical and mental issues.

yue6s	Barring the bizarre comment from the person who chews cannabis flowers, in general the "regular/chronic use" described in research is once per month or greater. That frequency, and greater frequency, is associated with memory impairment and all the other stuff hardcore stoners are in denial about. :)   If you want to look into it more, type the following into Google:  >site:ncbi.nlm.nih.gov chronic marijuana use systematic review  You'll find a number of review articles synthesized from credible, peer-reviewed literature. From those, you can follow the references to get more detail of each individual study's methodology and results/conclusions. I say regular use is generally defined as 1+/mo, but each study sets its own criteria. As these groups are often studying different aspects of marijuana use, it's best to look at each one individually to really get into the finer details.  Best of luck! Don't be afraid to try other treatments (assuming your use is for medical reasons) if you're put off by the potential harm marijuana can do to your ability to function agreeably in society (at work, with friends, etc.; that being said, it helps some people with those things). One of the more shocking side-effects associated with regular use is a predisposition to depression, so in that case especially it may be worthwhile to cut back and seek alternative means of treating whatever ails you.

Is this chemically induced anxiety somehow or is some kind of relaxation where I allow myself to feel anxiety that's somehow lurking subconsciously?	1642778991.0	htlwxqm	t3_s997hz	t1_htlal59	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlwxqm/

zbd59	Optimal dose response curves are titrated during clinical trials. Finding a effective and safe dose is part of the vaccine approval process. Any approval is tied to the previously determined dose.  If you were to give an arbitrary (smaller) dose would likely result in a reduced statistical vaccine efficacy.  Individually, you might find that some people (e.g. younger, female) would mount an effective immune response at lower dose already (most older people, people with high body mass, etc probably not)	1642787078.0	htmio03	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmio03/

snpmb7k	The goal of any vaccine is to elicit a strong immune response, so that next time your body is exposed to a live virus you get that strong immune response right away. If you don't get a full dose, then your body might not develop that response, and you will have reduced or no protection from the virus. Even if you do get a full dose, some people don't develop a strong immune response for various reasons, which is why herd immunity is an important concept for modern public health.   The appropriate dose level is somewhat of an unknown for any given vaccine. There are models and historical data that we can use to estimate what an appropriate dose will be, but this is one of the primary reasons for conducting clinical trials. The vaccine developers come up with a number they think will be effective, and then the clinical trials in the population will tell you whether or not it's actually effective. Then (in the USA) the FDA approves that specific dose as the authorized "full dose" because it's been clinically shown to be effective.	1642791909.0	htmvp4i	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmvp4i/
fxyckcfp	Is the full dose required to get the same result is like asking why do specific dosage amounts exist. Simply put, yes. If you don't get a full dose of the COVID vaccine is like not taking all of your prescribed antibiotics for something like strep throat. If you do follow as instructed for the antibiotic, the bacteria can mutate, reproduce, and let enough bacteria exist with the mutation of being resist or immune to the antibiotic used to treat it originally which would mean higher power antibiotics would be needed. Same applies to COVID vaccine but its your immune cells instead of the antibiotics.	1642793307.0	htmzild	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmzild/

fxyckcfp	Its a matter of pressure, concentration, temperature and the components. Its a matter that as temperature goes up, pressure goes down which causes concentration to go down which means it has less to bounce against. Like u/cuicocha mentioned it is also a matter of the Ideal Gas Law, or PV=nRT, or Pressure times Volume equals moles times R(or 0.08206 liters times atmspheric pressure divided by mole times K or Kelvin) times Kelvin. Basically Pressure(atmospheric pressure) times Volume(Liters) equals moles times 0.08206 times Kelvin to determine the amount of gas in accordance to ideal gas law, which is rarely applicable because ideal gases rarely exist naturally, but it would be best to use here since you will likely be assuming its ideal gases.	1642794131.0	htn1sv3	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htn1sv3/

8owik4ho	I was on very strong pain meds for well over 10 years. I mean they put me on anything and everything. The last thing I was put on was the fentanyl patch. After a few years it just wasn’t working so I stopped putting it on. My doctor was flabbergasted when I brought my unused patches to my next appointment. You have to bring all of your pain meds and do a urinalysis at each appointment to show you are the one taking the meds and you have the appropriate amount of meds remaining. I had zero withdrawals or anything. That was 6 years ago.   Now here’s what’s strange. I have a new dr and I told her I’ve really been struggling with pain again. We discussed different options and she suggested medical marijuana. She said she’d much prefer me to be on that. Marijuana just became legal in my state, so I gave it a try for the first time. I have been experimenting with it for the past month. There is no way I’m getting that card. I can easily see myself getting addicted to it.

bqg56lkz	To make electricity flow, we need to create an electrical *imbalance*. As long as there's an imbalance, electricity will flow through every available path.         One tactic is to create that imbalance, and then just let it equalise slowly as the electricity flows until the imbalance is gone.  Or you could keep on topping up the imbalance.  Either way, the electricity is only going to flow in one direction through the circuit.  This is DC, direct current.  A plainer name would have been The Electricity Only Ever Flows In One Direction Current.          DC is easy to use but it's a little hard to generate. Let's think back to the time of the Industrial Revolution.  They were really  *really* good at building machines which were driven by a turning wheel. They also figured out that moving a wire near a magnet would create an imbalance and cause electricity to flow in the wire.   Combine these two ideas and you have an easy way to generate electricity. Put a coil of wire on a wheel, put magnets next to the wheel, and *voila!*  Electricity.         BUT, something attached to a turning wheel is going to move away from you, then towards you, then away from you, then towards you. And the same happens with the electrical imbalance.  It goes one way, then the other way  then one way, then the other way.        So these are the two grand tactics of making electricity: (1) create an imbalance which might run down but which will never change direction, or (2) harness a spinny thing to create an imbalance which changes direction over and over again.	1642798751.0	htnelxp	t3_s9g9rr	t3_s9g9rr	/r/askscience/comments/s9g9rr/what_are_ac_and_dc_currents_and_are_there_other/htnelxp/

An Alternating Current is like when you whip a rope and the wave travels down to the other end of the rope. The electrons are shaking back and forth (like the rope), but they're not actually *traveling to* the other end of the wire; the *wave* is what's traveling.	1642800162.0	htnijo1	t3_s9g9rr	t3_s9g9rr	/r/askscience/comments/s9g9rr/what_are_ac_and_dc_currents_and_are_there_other/htnijo1/

13sdyu	I look around at some of the research, sales and health outcome statistics, and I see no evidence at all that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada and some US states is contributing to reduce pot use and abuse among the population. In fact, it has been found that cannabis-related hospitalizations of adolescents have been increasing disproportionately in the US states where the recreational use was legalized, even though the minimum legal age is set at 21.  [Trends in Adolescent Cannabis-Related Hospitalizations by State Legalization Laws, 2008–2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X21003852)  Furthermore, it's impossible to ignore the painfully obvious conflict of interest among many of those who make a point to highlight the "economic" benefits of legalizing recreational marijuana? Cannabis-related stocks have been pooping up in tandem with the growing pro-legal noise and it's impossible to dissociate the pro-legal propaganda/agenda from an ulterior financial motive that doesn't properly value or flat out disregards public health consequences.  1. Do you not think that the legalization of recreational use is a reckless mistake? Shouldn't it had be simply decriminalized instead?  2. Do you think that a responsible drug legislation should also restrict the economic freedom of recreational drug-related economic activities with heavier regulation? Are you willing to opine or discuss the possibility of legally forbidding the listing of businesses that profit from recreational drug sales in the stock market, for example? Wouldn't strategies like this be useful to discourage not only misleading propaganda, but also ultimately sales and use of recreational drugs to some extent?	1642814513.0	htojgqb	t3_s997hz	t1_htn82c2	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htojgqb/

gxotx	The treatment for opiate abuse is generally.more opiates but under controlled stigma. Suboxone is a very powerful opiate and while they say it doesnt cause the same effects, thats the marketing shit the companies made ip. Three years ago the FDA sactioned the sales of large quantities of loperdamide, which is even more powerful and sold otc. Loperdamide is said to not pass the BBB, but it's not a wall, and large amounts can push through, especially wheen they used to sell 400pills for $5 at Costco. Opiate and weed addiction are not the same, but from what I have seen, weed addiction seems to create worse people in the end.

br6js5	Centrifugal force is only an apparent force, but then again, gravity is more of an acceleration than a proper force, so it kind of adds up.   Another way of seeing it is through seeing gravity as a centripetal force, which every little fraction of a second will change the direction you're going just a little bit, making your trajectory become an orbit	1642870246.0	htreyp6	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htreyp6/
dj00u	For one, centrifugal force is a 'phantom' force - it's only our perception (i.e., when turning the corner in a car, what we feel as an outward 'force' is actually just our inertia trying to carry us in a straight line, opposed by the car pushing against us). The actual force is centripetal (pulling *toward* the rotational center). However, neither are applicable to an orbit as being distinct from gravity (which is acting as a centripetal force). Instead, an orbit is the object trying to move in a line, but also being pulled doen by gravity - it's constantly 'falling' toward the planet. If the object's inertia carries it away from the planet at exactly the same rate as it is falling, you get a circular orbit. This is why they say astronauts DO experience gravity, but they (and the space station) are in a perpetual state of freefall.	1642870591.0	htrfv73	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrfv73/
moqxn	Orbits are defined by centripetal force. Gravity is the component pulling towards the main body, where the orbiting body is trying to escape perpendicularly (more accurately:tangential) to that force with its own velocity. The resultant path the orbiting body takes is a continuous arc “falling” toward the main body’s center of mass until/unless the orbiting body’s velocity is sufficient to create a full circle, which can continue to expand to an ellipse or escape trajectory if velocity is sufficient.   One more note: technically the orbiting body is equally pulling on the main body proportionally to the two’s masses. I simplified here assuming the orbiting body’s mass is negligible relative the main body.	1642870716.0	htrg70s	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrg70s/
jd8sn	Robert Bakker (paleontologist) wrote a fiction book called Raptor Red. He made a story about a female raptor and her offspring, and about what a typical life might be like. He brought his knowledge of the animal to explain (or hypothesize) what was going on at any given moment. One of the things he describes is that the raptor mom's sister meets up with her and the little raptors "understand" that this is pack (family) based on scent. Such as; the baby raptor would surmise:"Not mom....but like mom. Safe". So it's not the family as we have classified it but likely based on the familiarity of the smells.	1642872131.0	htrju13	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htrju13/

14bptt	It's would be better to say that the centrifugal force is the force of gravity. Centrifugal force isn't an actual force, it's a type of net force that results in circular motion. You still need to have an actual force acting perpendicular to the direction of travel to provide this centrifugal force. In a simple circular orbit, this force is provided by gravity. Objects in orbit absolutely experience acceleration as their velocity is constantly changing, not in magnitude but in direction. If there was truly a zero net force, then the object would travel in a straight line.	1642873434.0	htrn7gm	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrn7gm/

14bptt	>Centrifugal force is however a convenient simplification of the continuous change in direction.  This is not actually true because a continuous change in direction doesn't necessarily mean that you experience a centrifugal force. For example, you will experience a centrifugal force on a cyclotron at a fair because the centripetal force spinning the cyclotron isn't also affecting you so the centripetal force comes from the normal force of the outside edge pushing you inwards and we interpret this normal force as a centrifugal force since it feels like something is pushing us into the outer edge despite that not actually being the case. However the gravitational force keeping a space station in orbit equally effects the people inside and so there is no need for a normal force to keep the inhabitants moving in the same circular path as the space station and so they don't experience the same centrifugal force that the riders on the cyclotron do. But in both cases, there is a centripetal force that is maintaining the circular motion.  Also the centripetal force is only equal to the gravitational force because it's a net force and there is only one force acting on it so that one force must be equal to the net force. This isn't universally true though, if you spin an object on a rope in a vertical circle, you have two forces acting on it, tension from the rope and gravity. It's the sum of these two forces that will equal the centripetal force at any point, even these forces change depending on what part of the circle the object is at.	1642877484.0	htrxnb0	t3_sa4s88	t1_htrvbpn	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrxnb0/

Let’s say the curvature of the Earth drops 9.81 meters vertically for every 9.81 meters you move horizontally. If you threw a rock horizontally at 9.81 m/s the rock would orbit this mini Earth (ignoring air resistance and stuff). The rock is traveling fast enough cover the drop in curvature with gravity (9.81 m/s^2) to never hit the ground.

By describing Debbie as my sister, I am bringing her under a general discursive framework that abstracts away from any particular sister. Dogs (probably) aren’t using a discursive framework, so we run the risk of anthropomorphizing a dog’s behavior when we ascribe a thought process like “it recognizes that other dog as sister” or “here’s a dog I remember” to them.   “What is it like to be a bat” is the big paper that dives into this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F	1642878219.0	htrzj2p	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htrxi4l	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htrzj2p/

kyx8g	Yes, certainly. But the centrifugal force is actually a 'fictitious' force in that it is not a force at all but arises from an object's inertia.  IMO a better way is to think that the object in orbit is constantly falling toward its attractor/planet, but moving so fast that it overshoots the ground. The gravitational pull of the planet is constantly accelerating the body so as to pull it's direction of motion toward the ground, but the direction of the ground relative to the body is constantly changing.

p6de8si	Stop thinking of centrifugal force as a real force! It’s a fictitious force and you have to be very careful about reference frames if you’re ever going to use the term.  First, let’s define velocity and acceleration. Velocity is a speed AND direction. Acceleration is the rate velocity is changing. You are accelerating if you’re changing the speed (gas pedal of a car) or the direction (steering wheel). Newton’s second law says F = ma, so if we know the forces we can calculate the acceleration (in 3 dimensions). Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, we can use this to calculate what the velocity will be a small time step in the future (integration to be more technical).  Now, picture someone holding a weight on the end of a string. They start to spin in circles and the weight moves in a circle with them. Ignore gravity for this thought experiment, it’s just a person and a weight rotating in a plane. You’re watching them spin, the weight is moving in an ‘orbit’ around them.  As you are watching this, you can measure the velocity (speed and direction of motion) at any time of the weight. If you measure a moment later, the speed is the same but the direction of motion has changed. The direction of motion is constantly changing because it is accelerating inwards (direction of motion is constantly changing, not speed) from the force the person is applying on the string (centripetal force). This checks out with F = ma, no need for centrifugal force.  Now picture that you place a camera on the wrist of the person holding the weight. The camera is focused on the weight, you can’t really see anything in the background. As the person is rotating, so is the camera and the weight. So there is no motion in this reference frame.   But the person is still applying force in the string being applied to the weight, and we know F = ma must be true, even in rotating reference frames. This appears to be the only force. So why doesn’t the weight come flying inward at the camera?   Because we are in a rotating reference frame (camera on the wrist), there appears to be a force that is acting exactly opposite of the centripetal force in the string. We call this centrifugal force. But it’s not a real force, it’s merely a byproduct of being in a rotating reference frame. Because of this, we call centrifugal force a ‘fictitious force.’   If you’re on a rotating reference frame, like earth, you have to account for it to predict the motion of objects you’re measuring. But that force is NOT what’s holding the object in orbit!  Imagine that you place yourself far away from the earth (a sun-earth Lagrange point would be a good spot to watch, like where JWST is headed). Now you watch a satellite in orbit around Earth. You see it traveling with a velocity (speed and direction), but as with the weight, it’s direction of travel is constantly being changed. It’s accelerating inwards towards Earth. Instead of the force in the string, the force is now gravity. F = ma still checks out, it is in fact constantly accelerating towards earth.   TLDR: no, centrifugal force is only a thing because of rotating reference frames. Objects can still be in orbit if you’re not on a rotating reference frame.	1642886772.0	htskn1b	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htskn1b/

p6de8si	No, this is wrong even for most circular orbits! They would only cancel out if you were rotating at the same rate as the orbiting body.   Since LEO orbits are ~90 minutes, if you sped up earths rotation so much that a day was only ~90 minutes you could say centrifugal force cancels out with gravity for LEO orbits. Days are clearly longer than 90 minutes, yet LEO satellites still orbit. So that’s clearly not all that’s happening.  The *only* time this is true is geostationary circular orbits. That’s just a very specific orbit that has a period of 24 hours. You can’t generally say that circular orbits are gravity and centrifugal force cancelling out from Earth.  I have a separate comment where I tried to dive deeper into explaining what centrifugal force is and how it works if you want to learn more.	1642888141.0	htso0ad	t3_sa4s88	t1_htr96sj	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htso0ad/
ceijrrd	Yes. Smell. Many species, including other apes, can too.  My pet theory is it has to do with the veromonasal organ, which does exist in humans, but has been disconnected from the nervous system. Humans are so oversexed and promiscuous that if human fathers could tell they were cuckolded they would murder even more women than they already do, to say nothing of murdering children. Gorillas for instance are facing extinction and still the alpha males murder children unrelated to them. The human ape not doing that has really helped us overpopulate and become an invasive species.  For an example of how horny humans are, consider the discovery of the heritability of blood types. A study was done using blood from mothers, fathers, and neonates in hospital. It found at least 30% of the neonates could not be the biological children of the men listed as their fathers on their birth certificate. This was in the US in the 1950's, when women were far more modest than today, and the price for immodesty was far higher.  Note this figure is "at least" 30%. It could not attest to the infidelity of women who cheated with men who had the same blood type as their husbands. Being there's only 8 common blood types, that means approximately 42.5% of the babies born in the 1950's US weren't the biological children of their legal fathers.  Imagine if you will a human species where femicide was 42.5% higher, comparable with the other apes, and the birthrate was 42.5% lower, again comparable with our closest relatives. That would be a miserable species to be born into. You can see why there would be evolutionary pressure to lose the ability to determine by smell which child is yours.	1642888402.0	htsonl5	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htsonl5/

But you should add that our rotating reference frame (Earth) is not corotating with *most* orbits (because our day is a different length than the orbital period)  Geostationary orbit is the only orbit we corotate with, so the only one you can say centrifugal force and gravity cancel out from earths reference frame.	1642888502.0	htsow9e	t3_sa4s88	t1_htru2u7	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htsow9e/

The longer you’re exposed, the longer your immune system will be actively causing fevers, etc to combat it.

6ru7m	I think that would be a very difficult question to answer. Certainly we can observe that a dog may be more interactive with familiar dogs than with unfamiliar ones. But how would you test whether a dog recognizes kinship, or whether that concept even means anything to a dog?    I think you'd need to design an experiment in which large numbers of dogs were exposed to:  \- Dogs with whom they are not familiar but to whom they are related  \- Dogs with whom they are familiar and to whom they are related  \- Dogs with whom they are familiar but to whom they are not related  \- Dogs with whom they are not familiar and to whom they are not related.  You would have to carefully observe the behaviors in each of these interactions, define specific aspects of behavior that can be consistently identified and quantified by multiple human observers, and then perform a statistical analysis to see if there are significant differences in how dogs behave in each situation. Such a study would be very difficult to get right.  This is just off the top of my head. If anyone has other ideas on how to test this I'd be interested in hearing them.	1642897689.0	httbg54	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/httbg54/

And like the other commenter said: equipment moving around or attaching/detaching/moving also cause energy loses that can be considered “friction”, and there’s also energy loses due to angular momentum changing. Not even to mention the energy changes that general relatively cause. None of these are “huge” energy losses by any means, but they are still things that definitely need to be accounted for unless you want a space station to deorbit uncontrollably within a few months/years or its creation.	1642908803.0	htu13r1	t3_sa535n	t1_httyyhj	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htu13r1/

So far the longest continuous time in space is 1.65yrs (a record set in 1995), and even that was unsafe. Compare that to Scott Kelly who set the American record of less than a year (340 days). Honestly I think keeping him up there that long specifically because he had an identical twin and to do some biological tests was at least a bit little unethical.  The research “energy” used to create such a system also wouldn’t really be all that much. The Saturn V and Space Shuttle were more intensive to create than any rotating space station could be. The most energy-intensive process of such a process would probably be the literally rocket energy required to launch and attach all the pieces together, not the engineering aspects themselves.	1642911320.0	htu71ho	t3_sa535n	t1_htu5jtm	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htu71ho/

ob2rk	Lol ok sure bb. Whatever you say. And the ideas have been around for over a century now. They’re not exactly that difficult to impliment. They would require a bit more energy to keep at continual spin with very little additional engineering. Like I’ve said: the biggest thing is additional rocket energy to ge them up there. Other than that, nothing much else. Why don’t you go ahead and give me your reasoning for why they aren’t good and their horribly impossible drawbacks since you probably read the word “aerospace” on Wikipedia one time several years ago?	1642914147.0	htud2sx	t3_sa535n	t1_htucq1v	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htud2sx/

I’m sure they can smell relation but probably aren’t thinking, “….grandpa?!”  For reference when our malamute passed we had a vet come over to our house to euthanize so he was comfortable at home. He passed on his favorite blanket. Our cat who was a kitten when he was an old man & grew up with him was downstairs for the whole day bc there was a stranger in the house. When she finally came upstairs, we let her smell the blanket and she looked up at us then immediately laid down on the blanket. It was very obvious to us that she knew that he had passed.	1642914193.0	htud5xn	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htud5xn/
qx12b	So how do you get it spinning? How do you keep it spinning? How do you correct for the energy and motion it imparts on the craft as a whole? How often? Where and how does it attach for maximum efficiency and minimum wear? How do you maintain the mechanical parts involved? Turning it off? Gotta expend the energy to get it up to speed again. How do you enter and exit from the stationary portion of the craft? What happens in case of structural damage or integrity loss? What's the procedure for mechanical failure that stops the section from spinning? How much friction is imparted by the pieces that connect it to the stationary portion of the craft? If there's not a stationary portion how do you keep the craft in orbit?   For someone who supposedly has an easy solution you're not offering any. Burden of proof is on the one who makes the argument. You say it's easy yet give no actual solutions and instead deflect. And then you have the AUDACITY to say the hardest part about making and maintaining a spinning space craft is getting it into space? That's literally JUST one step and by and large the one we have figured out.   So give your designs that I'm sure you developed through your time engineering at NASA and put this all to rest.   Go on, it's easy after all.  Or are you just going to deflect again? Because that's the only answer you've actually given.	1642914820.0	htueff2	t3_sa535n	t1_htud2sx	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htueff2/

1livu8w1	No, because "centrifugal force" isn't even a factor here. Actually, gravity and inertia canceling each other out are, in a sense, producing a "centrifugal force", but that's not the point.  The easiest way to think about it is this: gravity is pulling on you exactly as hard as you are trying to fly away. Normally, you'd fly off in a straight line, but the gravity of Earth (or another large body) is trying to yank you back down. If your inertia and the gravity are essentially in equilibrium, you don't get closer to the Earth, but you also don't get further away.  If you are moving at a right angle to the Earth, you enter a circular orbit. Elliptical orbits work by the same principle but are a bit more complicated, involving acceleration and deceleration.	1642933313.0	htv5ph9	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htv5ph9/

I can tell you for sure that the son will follow his dad around and do whatever he does for as long as he lives. He absolutely loves his dad and is still his shadow after 3 years. In some ways he never left the late puppy stages. He definitely acts younger than his parents did at the same age.

You're working against an energy gradient to put a bouyant object at the bottom of the ocean, right?

Might beat chemical propulsion, but I don't think it beats a balloon carrying you up to the stratosphere before launch.	1642942350.0	htvhv90	t3_samslf	t1_htvbf6t	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htvhv90/

2zun0c7z	I already read a lot of good answers here including non- inertial rotating frames of reference, which induce fictitious forces like centrifugal force.  Seen from an inertial, fixed frame there is no centrifugal force and nothing cancels out. The mass in motion reacts to the force of gravity. If the initial velocity is zero or pointing to the center of gravity, it will fall straight down. If the initial velocity is horizontal, it will (at least try to) go into an elliptical orbit, starting at aphelion with the center of the earth in the perigee. The initial radius of the curvature near earth's surface is r=v^2/g. It is the interplay between initial horizontal velocity and gravity, which defines the curvature. If this radius is smaller than the radius of the earth, it will hit the earth before it can complete an orbit. If you start with approx. 8 km/s, the curvature is equal to the earth's radius, so have an circular orbit. If you increase it further, the circle will turn into an ellipse, which is now wider etc.  It is just the gravity, which causes the acceleration according to F=ma. (F and a are vectors). If the force  is perpendicular to the velocity, it will only change the direction of the motion and will produce a circle with the radius given above. For larger distances from earth's surface you have to take into account, that g gets smaller with increasing distance.	1642947077.0	htvq4ed	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htvq4ed/
30qlnuag	He doesn't. I had two sister cats years ago that couldn't be separated, because they went through trauma together. I found them in a box on the side of the road, and their bond was strong, but I can't say they knew they were sisters, just that they had always been with each other. I helped raise them, before rehoming them *together*. When one fell down our balcony, the other meowed and meowed for me. I found her under the stairs, but couldn't get back behind them (plus it was an area definitely filled with widows and scorpions). I ran back upstairs, grabbed the one who told me, and used her to lure her sister out. She was like an emotional support cat, for her sister.    On the other hand, I had a boy and girl, raised together. I was unable to keep them, so took them to a very small and more attentive shelter. When I went back to go see them (was allowed), they were in the same enclosure, hissing and snapping at each other. The shelter staff was terrified of the two of them, despite them both being insanely sweet.    So I separated them. The girl had a nail stuck to her cheek, because they had been fighting overnight. As soon as they were separated, they were both back to being sweet as pie.    A new environment was all it took for the two of them, born and raised together, to forget they were ever even living together.	1642947504.0	htvqy2v	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htuncti	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htvqy2v/

298hed	I would say it is impossible, even with an object with zero drag as the buoyancy force doesn't make sense at supersonic speeds, which would be necessary for orbit velocity upon breaching the water surface.  The ideal case would be a vacuum filled tube from space to the bottom of the ocean, with the object at the bottom sealing the tube.  With no friction in the tube and the tube disappearing as the object goes by to ignore any effects from water having to flow through the tube, water just passed by the object would have to flow fast enough to catch up to the object to apply a force to it.  When the object is going faster than the speed of sound in water, the water would have to move at supersonic speeds, which I don't think the water will be able to do without nozzle shenanigans.	1642958664.0	htwhqxj	t3_samslf	t1_htv5gwc	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htwhqxj/

But the problem is that even today with everything they discover, it is not something solid on which to go, even though that is the way they always go when they diagnose any kind of medication.    I think a lot of people would argue that a more holistic and realistic approach would be to explain precisely why someone’s circumstances have led to that chemical reaction. That way they can remedy the persons own physical situation in order to Preserve as much as the integrity of the neural transmitters as possible	1642958810.0	htwi4cw	t3_sawfex	t1_htwh6au	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwi4cw/

Depression is a huge bucket to dump people into. Given my own experience, there are at least 2 different types of people in that bucket, and possibly a lot more when you consider that related conditions often co-occur with depression (e.g. being on the spectrum).  There is no reason to think any single approach will work for all of them.	1642960906.0	htwnm1u	t3_sawfex	t1_htwi4cw	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwnm1u/

Recent theories also include neurogenesis rates, different neurogenesis rates in different parts of the brain, and synaptic plasticity all play a role too. The "level of chemicals" hypothesis doesn't hold water if you look at thinks like Spravato, which can alleviate depression for weeks/months after it has left your system, and it is not known to impact any of the neurotranmitters you listed.

d79lh7f4	Strictly an observer…. No expertise at all in these topics beyond casual interest in some podcasts and observing some fascinating people around me.  My impression is that depression really comes down malfunctioning control of neurotransmitters or the lack of an appropriate balance for your environment … while the cause can be one of many… trauma, inflammation, dietary, genetic, environmental…. (Basically good luck figuring out every individual’s cause).   Considering that your main happiness comes from things working out better than expected, in particular a positive dopamine hit difference between plan and actual. Depression manifests itself as a lack of interest/interacting with your environment because your cognition is not getting reward for acting if things are not under its control and your sense making is malfunctioning. I’m particular you lose control over attention, and stimulus of the environment, your lambic system starts to autopilot and you may experience weight gain reduced activity and stimulation, as you are now spinning in just planning thoughts become more in your head and detached from reality. Tons of screen time becomes preferable to bench pressing those extra 5reps.  The way I understand it, cognition not responding with the right right stimulation of your brain can cause depression. So in result you can’t really learn how to respond to your environment… basically eat less sugar, exercise more and you are likely to feel “smarter”	1642962837.0	htwsocw	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwsocw/

ncxd6	The best way I know to explain this given my own limited understanding and the fact that this field is still being pioneered...  Your brain is a network of roads, or you can think of it as paths in a forest. The paths lead to many different destinations. A path may lead to a feeling of happiness, confidence, sadness, anger, etc.  Often times, paths lead to the same destination, with some being longer than others.  Like any path in the forest, the ones that are used frequently are clear and free of overgrowth. The ones not so recently traveled, overgrow and can be difficult to travel.  You have to walk these paths every day, but depression is like if you sprained your ankle. That sprain could be something that happened over time because you weren't watching your step and caused a repetitive strain injury. It could also be something abrupt, like the loss of a loved one. You still have to walk those paths, but you move slower, and it's more difficult. As a result, you may take the easier, shorter paths (instant gratification), leaving the longer ones (self care, work, exercise), to overgrow.  Your ankle will not heal unless you take proper steps towards that end. Mostly because you *have* to keep walking those paths daily. The longer it goes untreated, the worse it gets, and the longer it takes to travel even the easier paths all while the longer ones overgrow even more.  Eventually, you're just crawling at a snails pace through as few paths as possible. Sleeping. Sleeping is the shortest one, so you do that a lot. Eating isn't very long, but your ankle hurts a lot today, so maybe just travel down that one once and it's good enough. The laundry path has been too overgrown for weeks now. And you're pretty sure a storm blocked the leave-your-house path.  The suicide path isn't very long. You've thought of that one. There's a big boulder at the beginning that you have to climb over, but it's easy down-hill travel from there. Maybe tomorrow.  Then cue antidepressants. Suddenly, your ankle is healed. With a renewed sense of mobility, you may travel some of those paths you have not in a long time. They're overgrown, so the first few dozen times you travel them will be difficult, but after they're cleared again, they become easier.  But maybe instead of cleaning those difficult paths, you try a new one, the suicide path. Since your ankle is better, you can easily climb that boulder now.  (Side note, this is why some anti depressants say that they can increase suicide risk. They help you to regain your motivation often weeks before you actually start to get better. Meaning you might actually follow through before things improve)  On the other hand, there's a lot of nice sights you haven't visited down the other paths. Happiness, self fulfillment, generosity, you havnt seen those I'm a while. Maybe try to travel a couple of them and see.  Even better, now you have a friend, a therapist. They can't physically help you clear those paths, but they can help you prioritize which ones need clearing first. Maybe even give you some advice on traversing difficult terrain to make you more prepared for the hike.  Sorry if you're looking for more of a scientific response given that this is /r/askscience  I just don't have to knowledge to provide that. But maybe this explanation helps to illustrate things a bit.	1642966290.0	htx1h65	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx1h65/

u63ch	While this is true in the sense that a low A1C can be an indicator of episodes of dangerously low blood sugars - there's some information missing here and I don't think this answers OPs questions about RBC and A1C in normal bodies. To clarify your points about diabetics though (as I don't have answers for OP) an A1C of less than 7 in Type 2 diabetics is considered the goal of their medical treatment so I have to assume you mean type 1s. In Type 1 diabetics, it is no longer considered an immediate cause for alarm. While it can indicate lower overall blood sugars or repeated episodes of very low blood sugar, today's technology has allowed many type 1 diabetics to reach near normal glucose levels safely. Additionally, while the overall 'low kills fast/high kills slowly' is very true - there are some considerations. A low that requires medical intervention is extremely dangerous and can cause death, coma, or other severe medical conditions. The term low for diabetics means a lot of things, though. Lows into the 70m/dL range are often considered trivial. Below 70 many many type 1s can treat a low on their own without medical intervention and treatment of these lows does not cause permanent harm. Sustained high blood glucose levels does cause harm that is potentially permanent and increases risk for complications and comorbidities that decrease quality of life and chance of death. So a low A1C in type 1s is generally considered a reason for celebration and a high A1C is considered reason for medical intervention.

12bt9d	For me I was 'diagnosed' with depression first, spent the best part of a decade going on just about every anti-depressant under the sun with things not really improving overall, only to see someone much later and come to the conclusion that actually it was ADHD. I was depressed because my life was a disaster, I wasn't failing in jobs and in things because I was depressed, I was depressed because I was failing in jobs, projects, relationships and most everything with no solution in sight.     It was a real eye-opener when we found some old school records saying I had dyslexia but no trouble concentrating...followed by pages of reports saying I got no work done unless supervised in every single subject and that I had a 'daydreaming problem' along with my goals being to 'keep track of his possessions' because I was forgetting things on a daily basis. I also found out my parents were told by the then headteacher to not tell me or anyone else about the 'dyslexia' because I would be disadvantaged/labelled if they did, which explained why I got no extra help after primary school. Go figure :')     I often wonder how many people are out there on anti-depressants and other drugs when really they have ADHD because of bad attitudes from professionals back then.	1642973270.0	htxjmh6	t3_sawfex	t1_htx5z5b	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxjmh6/

6ntxk	Adding to this: The public understanding of ADHD is still developing. Even today, there is a large contingent of people who refuse to accept that ADHD exists and that by diagnosing and medicating children, we're pathologizing 'kids being kids.' And the different presentations of ADHD may make it appear that something else is happening instead.   I was diagnosed with depression early in my life, and also have ADHD-inattentive. Because the inattentive expression of ADHD was less commonly known, no one (parents, teachers, doctors) ever thought to get me checked for it. I wasn't bouncing off the walls hyper - I don't get hyperactive symptoms - but I'm a textbook case of inattentive ADHD if anyone had known to look for it.   Because I'd already been diagnosed with depression, and there's a lot of overlap in how ADHD-I and depression are expressed outwardly, I didn't even think to get tested until a couple of years ago.   Depression didn't cause my ADHD, but my ADHD looked like, and was often hidden by, my depression.	1642977163.0	htxtp2t	t3_sawfex	t1_htx1tei	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxtp2t/

95t0qc	I'm lactose intolerant but I got really into cheese when I was a teenager. Cheese aged 2+ years usually doesn't have any lactose left and is usually okay for lactose intolerance. Over about 5 years eating more and more dairy, I found I had effectively stopped being intolerant and was able to eat pretty much any dairy in any quantity. Later, I dated a vegan, and within about 6 months, I had gone back to complete intolerance. From what I've read and understand, I had built up enough lactose-eating gut bacteria and that was making things work out. Obviously, without lactose they all quickly died off.	1642994638.0	htz19fp	t3_saoemg	t3_saoemg	/r/askscience/comments/saoemg/what_are_the_long_term_effects_of_a_lactose/htz19fp/

SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved ineffective and in a couple of meds, even dangerous.  Treatment is now centered around Emsam (12mg selegiline patch), which mitigates both depression and hypnagogia. After problems with ADD drugs, I've returned to self-medicating with prodigious amounts of caffeine to concentrate and sleep, and consider ADD not a handicap but a superpower for creativity.

it7xmukc	Until the ADD diagnosis, I'd self-medicated with caffeine– I consume prodigious quantities of caffeine to concentrate and sleep. Unfortunately, Adderall made me drowsy and Ritalin made me jittery at unpredictable times, so I returned to large doses of caffeine.Similar to u/Ryan30z, I wasn't diagnosed with ADD until well into adulthood. (My physicians use 'ADD' because I do NOT have the hyperactive component.)Like others, I have a high IQ and am very creative in multiple fields. I began to think of ADD as a creative superpower, which helped me deal with it.Since childhood, I've been plagued with refractory atypical depression. SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved either ineffective or outright dangerous.• Effexor® venlafaxine (extreme splitting headaches and weird popping sounds)• Lexapro® escitalopram oxalate (severe suicide ideation)• Remeron® mirtazapine (red splotches over body, MD doubled dose resulting in full-blown gout)There was some thought a reverse-MAOI might work, but none were available in North America.The clinical trial of Emsam (12mg selegiline patch) worked wonders… until the trial ended. Without the medication, depression set in.And so did acting out in my sleep, a type of hypnagogia unrelated to sleepwalking. The muscle inhibition from REM atonia had broken down. I punched, kicked, and leaped in my sleep. I was afraid of hurting my girlfriend, but I actually injured myself my eye striking the corner of a table. I mention this for a reason…My insurance company helped locate a psychiatrist knowledgeable about Emsam and willing to prescribe it. The malaise of depression begin to lift… and the hypnagogia began to fade. Selegiline was treating both… or possibly the depression and hypnagogian were related.Forgive me if I hijacked the thread. I merely hope others may benefit.	1643017144.0	hu01jh7	t3_sawfex	t1_htzvyus	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu01jh7/

rk1og	Not on a wide scale, no.   There are a few types of tests:  Antigen and PCR tests used to specifically look for the presence of covid proteins or RNA, respectively.   Covid PCR based sequencing test used to specifically amplify up the covid genome, and sequence it to determine which variant it is.  Respiratory viral infection panel sequencing tests, used to sequence multiple viruses including covid. This can find presence/absence of a number of viruses, and determine variants. It is however not widely used compared to the ones above.  So there’s some data on other viruses coming from covid tests, but overall not much because the diagnostic tests are primarily the ones specifically looking at covid, not the panel.	1643017449.0	hu01weg	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu01weg/
y9ybd	Thanks for sharing friend! I’ll look up Emsam. I’ve tried around 10 different medications for depression, anxiety and anti-psychotic (my old psych thought I was going Schizo, due to my Depersonalization which is as wrong as it gets).  I’m really hoping, IF I am actually ADHD, that, first of all, I will get to try ADHD medication, and then that ADHD medication will actually help. It’s different for everybody.   As you said, ADHD is more of a weird superpower than an illness. It’s not confirmed, only theorised, but I somewhat believe in the hunter/gatherer hypothesis that ADHD was an advantage back then.

Have you never had days where everything went your way and life was good and you were definitely upbeat? And then a day when you couldn't do anything right and nothing turned out as you expected so you felt the world was closing in and you were all alone? What happens to your creativity and ability to find solutions if you are "in a funk" and just want to stay in bed? Some folks are born optimists and it's easier for them to stay on an even keel. Those who are the opposite have a tough time. They always see the thorns and the weeds in the garden and never the flowers. There are meds for those who are clinically depressed which help. I have a friend who was clinically depressed for years so that's how I know meds help. Why people are as they are is embedded in their DNA and they have their parents to curse or bless for it.

Hyperglycemia is a chronic issue (although if it gets high enough it can become an emergency if it doesn't come down or causes diabetic ketoacidosis.) Hypoglycemia is pretty much always an emergency.

From a1c charts the "average" blood sugar for 5.4 is 115, the average for 5.7 is 126, so while they're not the same, they're closer than I thought they were.    Prediabetes is kinda a sign that says "please try to turn back before this gets worse!"    My doctor would probably tell me to work on myself as if I had prediabetes with the info you have given even if he didn't note down "prediabetes" in his chart, but I have family history and a hormonal disorder that makes me more insulin resistant so we likely aren't the same.    What did your doctor say about it? This is something they can answer better than we can.    They could order one of those tests where you drink something sweet and they monitor you to have a more accurate look.

I have read and heard from multiple sources that the common complications from poorly managed hyperglycemia were from something to the effect of “glucose molecules clogging up small blood vessels”. Which always felt a little off based on the scale difference of a red blood cell that routinely passes through these areas and a singular glucose molecule (or thousands of glucose molecules for that matter).  That the glycation of proteins that weakens/prevents their normal function in the common problem areas is the reason for most diabetic complications was eye-opening and, strangely, motivating to keep working hard to maintain good levels.	1643039983.0	hu15wjw	t3_saxb1r	t1_hty46o7	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu15wjw/
4bzt1zdh	Yes there are a number of factors that affect sound propigation:  as a constant the speed of sound is calculated at 1500 meters per second. .   Temperature, pressure, and salinity are the 3 primary factors in relation to SONAR. And increas or decrease in any of these areas will affect the speed of sound up or down.   Depth is the primary constant and at a sertain point around  3000 meters below sea level. Surface Sound is curved back up. This  produced a cool affect called a convergence zone. A sound source can have multiple convergence zones at increasing and calculatable ranges . Allowing for extreme detection ranges to be achieved.	1643039985.0	hu15wqf	t3_sbhzwe	t3_sbhzwe	/r/askscience/comments/sbhzwe/do_sound_waves_move_faster_or_slower_depending_on/hu15wqf/
smbs4ln	It’s only in the last couple of years that there is any inkling of general tests being available.  You’ve heard of Theranos. Back before they were outed as a scam, what they were promising was science fiction come to life.  Any tests that we have no that are multipurpose are very limited. They’re 3 different tests that just happen to not interfere with one another and also are useful together. Sort of like MMR vaccines. 3 diseases that are common and the vaccines don’t mess with the others.   Now, there’s a company called Grail with a product going through trials, but is also so promising that the UK government has paid for over 100k people to participate, that can detect from a single blood test 50 of the most common types of cancers. The idea is that you get this done at your annual physical at the same time as the blood draw to test your cholesterol levels. This test uses DNA sequencing and can’t detect things like chemical imbalances or viral infection at the same time. It’s literally just doing a bunch of sequences of the same person’s blood at once and the comparing the results. Remember, cancer is your cells with your DNA. Illumina’s sequencers that they use can sequence several thousand different individual’s genomes in one go, so I’m pretty sure they just put one person’s DNA on the whole test slide and then compare it all.	1643040048.0	hu162ju	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu162ju/

One started shaving first, another got breasts first, and a third got her period first. What goes first, second, third for any woman is as individual as the woman herself. Family history will provide tendencies, but no absolutes.

16qcpz	Pressure versus temperature is much of a muchness, but one way of looking at it is that stellar core pressure is not really the direct cause of fusion -- it leads to high temperature and high temperature is the cause.  Basically, inasmuch as temperature is a way of talking about how fast particles are zooming around, high temperatures are what make atomic nucleii bonk together hard enough to fuse.  If it were "just" pressure (if that were somehow possible without also getting high termperatures), you would eventually end up with something like a neutron star -- super compacted atomic matter just sitting there, chilling.  So for us on Earth, trying to ignite nuclear fusion artificially, a high-pressure mechanism is just one of many possible ways to achieve the high temperatures we want.  And it turns out it's not very efficient compared to other ways of getting to a high temperature.  So we mostly focus on those other ways.	1643041998.0	hu1b42q	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu1b42q/

3hmuyesw	It's the other way around. You can imagine L4+5 as the (relatively) flat tops of gravitational hills while L1-3 are local valleys. The thing is, minor disturbances can kick something out of the L1-3 valleys and into the main bodies gravitational well, while objects can quite happily roll around the L4+5. https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange-Punkte#/media/Datei%3ALagrangian_points_equipotential.png	1643042446.0	hu1cams	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu19cl6	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1cams/

f0pjd	I'd really like a source on that.  I find it highly unlikely that any reputable IRB would allow research on hospital lab 'leftovers'.  Most of the time, hospitals dispose of all blood samples within 5-7 days of admission.  I know this because coroners and medical examiners have to subpoena those admission samples to test them for drugs/alcohol on people who have delayed deaths from ODs or trauma.  If somebody survives a week or more in the hospital before succumbing, we tend not to get any samples to test from their initial admission, meaning we can't tell *why* they suffered a cardiac arrest.  But our right to those blood samples is explicitly listed in our state's Revised Code.	1643042589.0	hu1co6v	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu0urxz	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1co6v/
o59yb	My understanding is that they are less like valleys and more like hills. They are "stable" like how you can balance a ball on another ball if you get it just right. But if it tips to either side, it won't roll to correct itself back to the center, it'll just keep tipping until it falls.  Think of it like a pyramid with a 1 meter flat table on the top. You can put a ball on the table. It's stable, it will stay, no force is drawing it in any direction strong enough to move it. But if force is applied and it rolls off the table, it'll hit the slope and keep going. Because now one of the gravities is strong enough to pull it away from the other thing.  From your question it seems like you're thinking about it like a hole in the ground with sloped sides. That if something is at the bottom of the hole, and you try to roll it up the sides, and let go, it'll naturally fall back towards the middle. In reality it's the other kind of equilibrium.	1643042732.0	hu1d246	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1d246/
dq8fz	I work for a company that collects a lot of the clinical data for some of the big pharmaceutical companies to run drug trials, including some of the new COVID vaccines. The answer is that yes, their is a ton of data collected about each patient as part of a clinical trial that looks at all sorts of data points. Things like biometric data, medical history, any new diagnosis or prognosis. I don't think a lot of respondents realize the amount of data that's required in order to get FDA approval. When it comes to drug trials these aren't a couple of small data points we're dealing with, we're talking extensive clinical data that in many cases contains decades of data on the same subject.   &#x200B;  To answer your question directly...yes our clients have teams of of data scientists who scour the data and are looking at anything that might be significant regardless of the intended purpose of the data collection. If you have this incredibly rich data set you would be incredibly stupid not to see if their are other significant findings you can get out of the data.	1643043082.0	hu1e05w	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1e05w/
4nkw6	I believe you have it wrong. If perturbations won't kick things out of L4+L5 then it's not the top, it's the bottom of a hill, in this analogy.

8t0pzwe	I’d say the main concern is the concept of informed consent, the form is secondary. Pretty sure you don’t need a consent form for something like taking a nasal swab or blood sample anyway. The important thing is that people are supposed to understand what’s being done to them and why, including what’s gonna be done to sampled taken from their body. A consent form like you described would do nothing in the spirit of this principle.  But yes, you could draw up a form with an exhaustive list of all the tests you intend to do and have people read and sign it (or more realistically, just explain to them what you’re going to do). However, you still have the (arguably more important) consideration: are these additional tests likely to benefit the person? If not, you shouldn’t even be asking for consent in the first place.	1643043303.0	hu1elrz	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu1870u	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1elrz/

5g4hw	My understanding of treatment isn't perfect, but my understanding is yes - in addition to alternative antidepressants above (psilocybin etc.), traditional antidepressants will also have a restorative effect on brain architecture/plasticity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739451/). These changes can take several weeks to occur from the initiation of therapy, however, and many patients will actually experience worsened acute effects during that "waiting period"   From my understanding, this is actually one of the stronger pieces of evidence backing up the trophic theory vs. the neurotransmitter model. The idea is that the antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs, and others - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25681575/) all take much more time to evoke structural changes compared to their acute effects on emotion.	1643053875.0	hu272ly	t3_sawfex	t1_htx0q3o	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu272ly/

akdzf	As you go higher the air gets thinner. Airplanes fly because the curvature of their wings causes air over the top surface of the wing to take a longer path than below; the longer path stretches out the air molecules = lower air pressure and this pressure differential is "lift".   But at some point the lower air density starts to eliminate the lift except at higher speeds. So in general the planes that are capable of flying super high like 60-80 thousand feet are either specially designed  wth super high lift to weight ratios (U-2 spy plane) or super duper fast (SR-71), i.e. so fast they still generate lift at lower air densities.  At lower altitudes you have weather effects caused by high/low pressure boundaries, storms, clouds, lightening. At cruising altitudes of 30-40k ft you still have winds which can be quite strong, but they're more consistent airstreams. And sometimes you can take advantage of their direction. Flights at one altitude get a nice tailwind in a certain direction, others at a different altitude get a headwind in the same direction. So taking advantage of these can save some fuel.   But outside of weather and windstream related reasons, planes flight at certain altitudes because they strike a sweet spot in terms of fuel efficiency and speed vs the air density. An airliner at 35,000 ft may be 95% fuel efficient at 500 mph. Same plane at 20,000 ft might be only 80% efficient cause it has to power through denser air.  To add to this, you can design wings and engines that are capable of pushing your airplane at whatever speed and altitude you like, but to be fuel efficient (which is a key goal of commercial air travel) you have to design for a sweet spot which will require compromises which make the plane less efficient in other spots; either it will require more fuel, or it will be slower or have less lift or whatever.	1643121492.0	hu5nujd	t3_sc7jz7	t3_sc7jz7	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu5nujd/

There’s also a lot of debate about the efficacy of SSRIs, because their success rate at treating depression isn’t that different from the placebo.

I got in a lot of fights, because losing didnt hurt... I did a lot of other drugs just to try and feel something different.. I ran away from home because I didnt care if my parents got worried, I didnt do school work or care about anything, because no matter what happened it was all just numbness... when I finally hit 17 or 18 and was able to get off of SSRIs (I was forced as a kid and young teen), it took at least 4 or 5 years to fully recover from their effects... getting off of them was a bit crazy... basically had to re-learn all emotions from scratch.. it was hard.

fhnz5ur9	So, something that hunters with thermal vision scopes have to deal with is the difference between how materials interact with light. Specifically, light beyond infrared that warm objects emit as a result of blackbody radiation, which is a core concept.    Opaque materials have a couple of properties like reflectivity and emissivity, and all materials are on a spectrum with those properties on either end representing perfect reflectors and perfect re-emitters. With a high reflectivity, a photon enters the domain of the electron cloud of the material's atoms and is immediately ejected at the angle of incidence, same color and all. This results in light with no new properties coming off the material. With a high emissivity, the photon is absorbed into the electron cloud, causing electrons to briefly become energized and elevating its orbital. But because this is not stable, they back down to the former orbitals and releases this energy as new light in keeping with black body radiation laws (below the visible spectrum for ordinary temperatures).     Any of this may be wrong so take note if someone contradicts me, they are probably right	1645034177.0	hx78ell	t3_su02pk	t3_su02pk	/r/askscience/comments/su02pk/what_is_the_science_behind_how_light_is_reflected/hx78ell/
agjbu	I’m a dancer and recently there’s been suggestions from physical therapists on the way we stretch. Static stretching doesn’t provide the best benefit and can very easily cause injury. It’s much better to ease into a stretch with soft, gentle pulsing pushing the distance a little bit at a time. That way the muscles get used the the full range of motion instead of just a position, making it safer and easier to move in and out of those hyper flexed positions.	1645038286.0	hx7i9e7	t3_stv0js	t1_hx6zg5i	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx7i9e7/

kolmi	I learned that gentle, pulsating approach to stretching in my ballet classes (California Ballet, 80s-90s), but this could vary so much depending on instructor. Some dance teachers had strange methods and could be almost bro-y with their sadism. Mine was a nice old lady.   The knowledge set currently available makes me really envious (e.g., I was a skinny dude—if I knew then what squats could do, I would have done better).	1645044822.0	hx7z8ln	t3_stv0js	t1_hx7i9e7	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx7z8ln/

s649f	Lots of good info in the comments. One key thing I learned through my years as an athlete and then as a coach is never to stretch a cold muscle. A couple people mentioned not to bounce and that's smart to avoid. I do breathe into a stretch and until reading the dancer's response herein, didn't realize that I'm likely pulsing the stretch a bit by breathing into it.

16yjgj	Depends on how hard you're going to push yourself. When your muscles are warm and the blood is flowing it's safer and easier to make gains and you're less likely to pull a muscle. Stretching while warmed up will let you peform deeper stretches without discomfort thus accelerating the progress. I gave 1 minute as an overexaggerated example but the principle still applies.	1645046714.0	hx8441b	t3_stv0js	t1_hx83buy	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx8441b/
z7ym3	If I remember correctly from physiology classes your brain contracts the muscle to prevent your limbs from moving too far and damaging something. But like a lot of things in life, you could actually move much farther before anything bad will actually happen. Repeated stretching trains your brain/nervous system to allow extended motion before contracting again.   Its sorta like how when exercising your body could go much harder/longer but your brain convinces its self that thats a bad idea :)	1645046796.0	hx84bq4	t3_stv0js	t1_hx6zg5i	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx84bq4/
16yjgj	It's actually pretty simple. Just break down the stretch you're going for into it's component parts. If you can do each part of it in isolation there's nothing physiologically impeding you from doing it properly through training.     For front split for example   1. can you get your chest down to your knee? (no matter how crunched up or ugly, can even do it while sitting down)  2. can you lift your leg up straight in 90 degree angle?  3. can you touch the floor with your feet while lying down on something elevated that's at your hip height.     If you can do all three than there's nothing stopping you.	1645047670.0	hx86kgc	t3_stv0js	t1_hx83zrv	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx86kgc/

d9sdz	I can't remember where I read it, but also the body only needs 5 mins of stretching per muscle group a day to optimize flexibility. It really isn't about intensity, as you say, it is about getting a good stretch in that slowly progresses you safely.  When you go gentle but keep progress pressure and days in a row consistent, it's sort of mind blowing how quickly one gains flexibility. Just 2 or 3 weeks into a new stretch routine to help with leg flexibility and I'm already doing things with my body I thought my muscles would outright prevent forever because I lift weights too much. I was wrong!	1645050114.0	hx8cqvn	t3_stv0js	t1_hx824mi	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx8cqvn/

jzghg	Don't perform any static stretch for more than 45 seconds. Don't perform a static stretch for less than 30 seconds. Anything less and you're not stretching the muscle filament connections, which is typically the goal of stretching.  Also important to note that there are other forms of stretching that should be used. Dumynamix stretching can be used once a muscle is "warmed up"  PNF stretching is one of my favorite ways to really increase flexibility in a short time. Can be performed with a partner or a towel/elastic band fairly easily solo.  Don't stretch between sets if you're lifting for strength, studies show that you actually reduce your maximum force output potential for several minutes when stretching.   Myofascial release techniques are also really great for increasing flexibility. Think foam rolling or some form of it. This helps your muscles spasm to the point of release, thereby increasing muscle length. Typically required for most of western civilization who sits for 12+ hours a day between driving/work/TV/eating. Focus on anterior chains.	1645051138.0	hx8f8vi	t3_stv0js	t1_hx824mi	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx8f8vi/

p4wdeqa	Honestly stretching and repeated exercises can have such a profound effect i find it very fascinating . I have been in physio for like 10 different things now and its honestly mind blowing how they have corrected so many issues with mostly just repetitive exercises and stretches. I have gained a real respect for a good physiotherapist. Some notable examples.     Torn tendon in elbow was pretty fascinating. Going from not able to hold a water bottle to back to normal just by repetitive activation and weight adjustment.      Knee acting up for months few times locking up and not really able to walk,  Within 5 minutes the physiotherapist  discerned it was in fact my lower back causing the issue . Blew my mind. Basically yoga lol.     Swollen shoulder with lots of pain through the rotator cuff? Regular doctors not sure. Physiotherapist within 20 minutes figures C5 Radiculopathy . Jelly in neck between vertebrae squished out and pinched the nerve that ran through my rotator cuff and down the inside of my arm. The solution was slow (nerves do not heal very fast) but effective. 1 neck exercise that graduates in technique . The exercise stretches and trains the neck to sit properly again while allowing everything to heal preventing re injure.	1645052893.0	hx8ji4m	t3_stv0js	t1_hx824mi	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx8ji4m/

z8hoo	Really interesting thank you! I have never been able to stretch to touch my toes. I can barely get my hands past my knees. I later found out I have messed up tendons in my knees so they’re “too short” to really let me stretch my hamstrings that way. Didn’t find out until I did PT, stretched for eight weeks and only gained maybe 0.5” of stretch. I thought maybe if i did it consistently eventually I’ll be able to stretch further but if it’s the tendons limiting me that doesn’t seem likely.	1645055201.0	hx8oybf	t3_stv0js	t1_hx824mi	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx8oybf/

Interestingly (and irritatingly) I often pull my lats and rhombiod muscles causing painful cramping for days, but it always happens when doing something completely innocuous, like picking up a branch or something stupid like that. Amazing to think when the muscles are warm they can pull a remarkable amount of weight, but when they're cold they're very prone to damage, or, at leas,t the body is very protective of prospective damage in that state.	1645055371.0	hx8pcqe	t3_stv0js	t1_hx8284s	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx8pcqe/

Had my first session with a physio last week and at the end of the session he told me I slouch a lot and have very tight hamstrings which forces my lower back to take a lot of strain to compensate.

896c237k	Being inflexible during anaesthesia is an acute, isolated circumstance with untrained individuals so not indicative of what can actually occur however.  Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF stretching) absolutely works in practice by addressing the mechanism poliver1988 outlined.

bkz16	I've had similar experiences.  For most of my life I've been pretty flexible doing some of the more common things. Like touching my toes (wrapping hands around the bottom of my feet) with knees extended sort of thing. Nothing particularly amazing, although I do know there are people who struggle with this one.  Over the past year, I took a recommendation from Kelly Starrett, DPT. He recommended doing this one stretch every night before bed. It's basically a pigeon stretch with the foot elevated on something, but really trying to maximize that hip flexion. So I did just that using my bed to elevate my foot. I would do 1 min each side, no dramas.   Now when I try the stretch as a warmup on the floor, I can get my shoulder to touch my opposite foot while touching one of my sit bones to the floor as well. To clarify by example: flex left hip, left foot in the pigeon position (right foot/leg reaching behind me), lay forward, right shoulder touches instep of left foot; meanwhile, left sit bone is touching the floor as well. It's not perfect (my spine could probably be straighter) but it's actually happening for me! As an older guy, this is a bit surreal.  To be clear: I didn't just start doing the pigeon stretch for the first time this past year. I've been doing them fairly frequently for the better part of a decade now. It's the nightly stretching which managed to improve my hip ROM even further.	1645058470.0	hx8wcaw	t3_stv0js	t1_hx8cqvn	/r/askscience/comments/stv0js/how_does_stretching_actually_make_the_body_more/hx8wcaw/

There’s all different kinds of depression - I think if you are someone who has previously had thoughts of self-harm to stay far away. I think most people who don’t have those thoughts can do fairly well on it but if you are someone who has previously contemplated end of life, the side effect should be taken more seriously.  I had a bad reaction to it and all I have to say is I’m glad I told my family before I went on it to watch me. I’m still here because I knew and I told them it was a possibility.

1j4jr0z1	Interesting. When I first took my ssri, I actually felt a direct change in my mood about 5 minutes after taking it.   For me, this drug has been life changing in the worst way, it actually made me much more depressed. I’m unsure if you’re aware of pssd, but I got that months after quitting ssris and I’m still dealing with it today. So for me personally, this drug is certainly the most depressing thing that happened to my life.  I agree they might work for some, but my question is “at what cost?” Really wish my doctor told me that by taking this drug I was running a chance at losing my sexuality forever. (I’m only 23, btw) Treating depression at the cost of sexual function (especially without warning) isn’t a fair trade-off in my eyes.	1645064805.0	hx9aekk	t3_stpd0a	t1_hx7hk92	/r/askscience/comments/stpd0a/what_are_ssris_really_does_anyone_really_know_how/hx9aekk/

4ad8pj3q	I could very easily be wrong, but this reminds me of my own readings where, instead of “grease,” they said the dynamite “sweats.” The liquid on the outside was nitroglycerin. It was dangerous because, Like it says in your quote, it varied in efficacy. Therefore, you couldn’t predict the explosion size.	1645070007.0	hx9l74d	t3_suefit	t3_suefit	/r/askscience/comments/suefit/what_does_cooking_dynamite_into_grease_mean/hx9l74d/

3d19s	No, dynamite breaks down overtime and the a liquid forms on the outside and collects in the bottom of the box. That liquid is nitroglycerin. It crystlazies and is extremely unstable.  I have never heard of it being called grease. Perhaps nitroglycerin crystals were mixed with grease to creste an explosive that would adhere to a safe?	1645075865.0	hx9uyhz	t3_suefit	t1_hx9m1mc	/r/askscience/comments/suefit/what_does_cooking_dynamite_into_grease_mean/hx9uyhz/
5nn8q2gg	Looks like something close to that.   https://kustomrama.com/wiki/Potvin\_Automotive#Extracting\_Nitroglycerin  >Otto Ryssman lived on an orange farm and was able to buy dynamite for land clearing purposes. Chuck would often have Otto buy a half-dozen cases of dynamite to extract nitroglycerin from. He would somehow safely heat up the dynamite, separating the nitro out of the dynamite sticks, he would then mix it together with alcohol and end up with a formula for a highly potent fuel. A life long friend of Chuck, Leslie Long recalls that in the early 1990's, the local news media reported that several cases of abandoned dynamite discovered in an old lady's garage in Anaheim, which was the same garage Chuck rented as a storage several years earlier.  Vincent J. Monteleone gives "grease" as slang for Nitroglycerin in his book *Criminal Slang* on page 106, published 1949.	1645076305.0	hx9vpu3	t3_suefit	t1_hx9m1mc	/r/askscience/comments/suefit/what_does_cooking_dynamite_into_grease_mean/hx9vpu3/

So cooking refers to heating up the dynamite to make the nitroglycerin + some additives more liquid so you could let it run out of the dynamite stick and collect it in the form of a "grease".  You could cook it over a fire if you wanted to, but generally speaking i would think they would do it in an oven with a tray beneath to collect whatever runs out of them with a fairly low heat, but im just guessing here.	1645110468.0	hxbd59g	t3_suefit	t3_suefit	/r/askscience/comments/suefit/what_does_cooking_dynamite_into_grease_mean/hxbd59g/

All the limescale buildup is from boiling the water.  Buy a kettle that you can easily access the inside and has a flat base with no exposed element. Empty it out once a week and you should be able to wipe away most of the limescale with a tissue.  If there is a larger build up use a weak acid to break it down (like how a coffee machine steam wand is cleaned). You can pour a bottle of vinegar into the kettle and leave for a period of time before pouring out and cleaning the remaining limescale.

The filters last about 6-8 years in that use.   We use filtered water for basic drinking, and for humidifiers and kettles, coffee maker, the cat's water-thing, some cooking - we get zero buildup, and there's a lot of rust in our water (tub drains areas slowly turn orange, etc.) so we know we're not drinking various crap. It's cool to break out the humidifier in the winter and it still looks like new, years in.   [I still do B&W darkroom printing](https://michaelcarter.photos/), and all my tests have shown the filtered water is essentially distilled water, as far as chemical interactions or sediment drying on my negatives.

They kept it in a box filled with sand, presumably to stabilize the dynamite and catch any nitro sweating out so that it didn't pool.	1645115547.0	hxbq7qs	t3_suefit	t1_hxb3dcb	/r/askscience/comments/suefit/what_does_cooking_dynamite_into_grease_mean/hxbq7qs/
6iyahx	Time of exposure is a definite factor in formation of any minerals.  It does take real time for ions to migrate and to join with existing solids.  It is not an instantaneous process.  Add in the evaporation aspect and you enhance concentration, increasing probabilities of appropriate chemical interactions and enhancing the energy drive to make solids (concentration-increase effect).  And while the inverse solubility of carbonate is beneficial when the water is hot (assuming the scale is carbonate, not always true), it is offset by enhancement of reaction rates while the water is above ambient temperatures (plus higher convection over diffusion), during the cooling-off period.  I always put cold water into the kettle or pot after use, myself.  I always want another cup soon anyway.  Is it better to empty? Almost certainly, I would think.  Can't make scale from nothing.	1645115605.0	hxbqd96	t3_sunx0p	t1_hxbf9ib	/r/askscience/comments/sunx0p/does_leaving_water_in_the_kettle_accelerate_the/hxbqd96/

b4g6c	I agree on the first part, without friction they won't be rolling. But if they are rolling, one needs to consider rotational inertia as well. Both balls have the same potential energy to start with, but the heavier one will need to exchange more of that for rotational energy, having less for the actual movement. Therefore the lighter ball is faster.   related [video](https://youtu.be/S6sG6pxMtsE?t=43) (in german)	1645117654.0	hxbvuf6	t3_sum3g4	t1_hxbd9xi	/r/askscience/comments/sum3g4/two_balls_rolling_down_a_hill_which_one_is_faster/hxbvuf6/

cn4j3jrz	In the case of dropping both balls off a cliff without any resistance from air or friction from the ground, they will hit the bottom at the same time as they both accelerate at the same rate. Once you add in friction and air resistance then you muddy the waters and will likely change the outcome. I could be totally wrong but I think I remember that lesson from years back when I was in school. If I remember correctly, if you do add in air resistance, a ball vs a sheet of paper it'd change but both objects will still reach the same speed if you provide enough distance as you reach terminal velocity ie the fastest an object can free fall. Once again I could be missing some info or could be completely wrong	1645118869.0	hxbz4dk	t3_sum3g4	t3_sum3g4	/r/askscience/comments/sum3g4/two_balls_rolling_down_a_hill_which_one_is_faster/hxbz4dk/

56yfb	The core question here - once the assumptions you put in are considered - is basically a version of the "which falls faster if two objects of different masses are dropped simultaneously" question that's demonstrated in every highschool physics class. Speed down a slope in a frictionless, airless scenario is only impacted by the vertical component of the slope, and the vertical component is the "which falls faster" question.   Might be an easier less math heavy way to imagine it for some folks.	1645119069.0	hxbznyc	t3_sum3g4	t1_hxbd9xi	/r/askscience/comments/sum3g4/two_balls_rolling_down_a_hill_which_one_is_faster/hxbznyc/

2g1y7qci	Imagine the heavier ball would roll faster or slower. Let's take faster, but the same argument will work. Then the lighter ball would roll slower.  Now imagine you "connect" these two balls (no pun intended).   On the one hand the connected ball object will be heavier, therefore it will roll faster.  On the other hand the slower ball will hold the faster ball back, therefore the connected ball object will roll slower.  These two things can not be true at the same time, therefore the assumption must be wrong, that one ball rolls faster than the other, based on its mass.	1645120729.0	hxc4647	t3_sum3g4	t3_sum3g4	/r/askscience/comments/sum3g4/two_balls_rolling_down_a_hill_which_one_is_faster/hxc4647/

gslxw	To begin with, they will not roll.   You specify a frictionless slope. What sets a ball to rolling (instead of sliding) as it goes downhill is friction between the ball and the slope. As the question stands, they'll go down the slope, sure, but you have to reframe the question. Watch carefully now.  Then there's the fact that a "race" is a volitional activity. People who engage in races can stand around waiting for the START pistol to go off; at that point they choose to use their muscles to... to race.  There is no way that one, two, 74, or any number of balls can "race" down a slope. No matter how much you encourage them or chide them for their laziness, they will not put more spirit into their activities and run... roll... slide down the slope faster than the others. It/they will simply move as predicted by various pretty damn smart guys more than three hundred years ago.  Next, I notice you are not doing this in a vacuum. That means that the balls must push air out of the way as they go downhill. So far, this fact is the only thing that will differentiate the way the balls slide. (I almost wrote "roll"!)  We now have to clarify two things: what is meant by "ball" and what is meant by "size."   If each ball is a solid sphere, then, being of the same mass, they will have to be the same size as one another. They cannot therefore be of the same "size" the way we initially think of size. Now, if there is/are internal voids in one or both balls, they can then be of different cross sections. As they slide, they will have to overcome air resistance. The ball with the larger cross section will be the slower ball as it must push more air out of the way as it slides down the slope.   This means one or both balls must have voids in them, whereby one or both will have (a) larger cross section(s) than will a solid sphere.  At this point I have approximately zero interest in pursuing this matter. You may accurately criticize me for discontinuing this discussion, but it's going nowhere, not even downhill!  I want you to notice something about this exercise. A question was asked, but it was a poor question. Starting with the idea of rolling, each detail of the question brought up a new issue that had to be defined in order to have an answerable question. And the closer we got to an answerable question, the more obvious the answer was.  I have found that the completely well-defined question usually contains the answer. A story, now:  An engineer has to solve a difficult issue. He works through the issues, then simply cannot proceed. He decides to ask his boss.  Now, his boss is a Nobel Laureate, and our guy does not want to ask a question that makes him look like he doesn't know what he's doing, only to have his boss say, "Well, what about this....?"   And on the way to ask his boss, he thinks of a thing that his boss might ask as a "what about this" reply. He turns, goes back to his desk, and figures out the answer to that rather glaring omission. Then he sets off to find his boss.  But along the way he realizes....  Our guy does this four or five times. Most of these times, the question becomes more complicated. Sometimes it becomes simpler.  And, in fact, once he has exhausted the possible stack of unanswered details... he realizes what the answer to his initial question is! And it's obvious!  The next time our guy sees Mr. Nobel Laureate in the hallway, as he passes he says, "Thanks!" Because, you see, it was the pressure of how the Laureate would see our guy that drove him to think of every detail he could, totally clarifying the question.  The Laureate, not having any idea why he was being thanked, simply said, "You're welcome!"  And now our guy knows how to ask a question.	1645124250.0	hxcdq2a	t3_sum3g4	t3_sum3g4	/r/askscience/comments/sum3g4/two_balls_rolling_down_a_hill_which_one_is_faster/hxcdq2a/

d9g6t	Food grade white vinegar, also called distilled vinegar or spirit vinegar, is just water with 5% acetic acid. It should be as pure as you would ever need for cleaning purposes.

ffqr9	A fat guy will coast faster than a skinny guy, if that’s what your question is.   To simplify as best as I can. There are two main forces: Gravity making you go fast, wind resistance slowing you down. Being heavier = more force from gravity = more speed. But a fat guy will have more wind resistance than a skinny guy and while true, it’s not an equivalent relationship so net result is a higher terminal velocity, or simply, more speed. This is assuming both people are as aerodynamic as they can possibly be.   Now, to complicate things a little bit, wind resistance increases exponentially with speed and force from gravity doesn’t with increased mass. So at some point you need a whole lot more mass to make small increases in speed. Dunno at what speed that happens in a real life cycling situation tho.	1645125731.0	hxchng0	t3_sum3g4	t3_sum3g4	/r/askscience/comments/sum3g4/two_balls_rolling_down_a_hill_which_one_is_faster/hxchng0/

tbcfa	My wife is a Montessori teacher so I’ve been exposed to a fair bit of the theory even though I’ve never studied it myself. My understanding is that ‘sensitive periods’ are times when a child becomes unusually interested in a particular thing, and in doing so they can learn about it very quickly. That doesn’t mean that they can’t learn about those things at other times, just that it may not be quite as easy.  For things like language and other basic skills the child would most likely be able to make up for any shortfall in time. In fact (and this is purely anecdotal so take it for what it’s worth) we haven’t seen any noticeable differences in the children who have started with us recently (who were born during the Corona years), presumably because their parents wouldn’t be wearing masks around them at home, as this would be the majority of this kind of stimulus that most children would receive, even those who go to a Montessori school.  Children are incredibly resilient and adaptable. I don’t think we need to worry too much about mask mandates.	1645130788.0	hxcuxpr	t3_suho7f	t3_suho7f	/r/askscience/comments/suho7f/is_montessoris_sensitive_phasesperiods_an/hxcuxpr/

u6a8z	And also doesn't damage seals, which vinegar apparently can do.   Citric acid is actually what's in the expensive sachets of "special" cleaner for coffee and espresso machines. If you read their manuals, there's usually a warning to not use vinegar, and a recommendation of using a/their cleaner for this purpose. If you look at the ingredients, it's plain citric acid at about a 20x mark-up.	1645135913.0	hxd8i1c	t3_sunx0p	t1_hxcmgsv	/r/askscience/comments/sunx0p/does_leaving_water_in_the_kettle_accelerate_the/hxd8i1c/
bsvy4	The info isn't wrong, in that vinegar can eat away at various types of rubber used in household appliances. However, in the type of kettle I described, and in most kettles, the water basin would not have any exposed rubber that can be eaten away.  Certainly if there is an exposed element or a level window you may find rubber seals where 2 different materials meet. In such cases, as others have pointed out, citric acid is a milder acid that most rubbers are resistant against.	1645136024.0	hxd8sfn	t3_sunx0p	t1_hxd6hdr	/r/askscience/comments/sunx0p/does_leaving_water_in_the_kettle_accelerate_the/hxd8sfn/
dhjgv	>The biggest effect on limescale crystals forming is going to be from evaporative crystallisation.  Also temporary hardness solids precipitate after boiling. I posted that somewhere before, it seems to have got lost.  Brewers boil water to reduce the carbonate content and sterilize it. I did this  once with a couple of gallons. After boiling and cooling, it looked just like a saucepan of water with the same hardness (I used a titration test kit). In the morning, after standing covered, there was a coating of fine powder on the bottom of the pot. It took 6 or 8 hours to settle out, so that same stuff would settle onto the bottom of your kettle after boiling,  if you don't empty it.	1645136213.0	hxd99z9	t3_sunx0p	t1_hxchec0	/r/askscience/comments/sunx0p/does_leaving_water_in_the_kettle_accelerate_the/hxd99z9/

el7si	BTW if as you suggest the case is one with static friction but not air resistance etc then there is a difference between the balls in that the one with larger moment of inertia will take more energy to increase its angular speed & thus it take longer to reach the bottom.  As the balls are of same size then the only differences left are the distribution of masses inside of each. If we assume both are made of the same stuff, but the lighter one has a central void them it will accelerate faster. If OTOH they are made of different materials, are hollow & with same shell thickness then the lower density ball wins.  In cases where we mix these two then it becomes a more difficult matter to calculate the overall moment of inertia.  If as the OP stated the slope is frictionless the the case reduces to that of partly mitigated freefall.	1645136502.0	hxda0n7	t3_sum3g4	t1_hxbd9xi	/r/askscience/comments/sum3g4/two_balls_rolling_down_a_hill_which_one_is_faster/hxda0n7/

I think you may be on to something, as with rising sea levels the pressure at the bottom increases, which will make more methane hydrate ice formations and help keep the existing hydrates locked up as ice.

3lyf62a9	One of the other problems I haven't seen mentioned is that the nature of eucalypts is that they produce oils that over time seep into the soil around the roots that prevents other plants/trees growing unless they are sympathetic. Which isn't that likely in non-native environments that haven't had the evolution time to develop tolerance to the oil. The oil is a well known anti-biotic useful for dry wounds in particular.  It would be interesting to see if there have been any studies on the effects of the koala and dropbears on eucalyptus growth and in particular whether or not the dropping numbers of koalas and the at least stable numbers of dropbears is having an effect. It's quite possible that the koala populations were keeping the dropbears in check. And the decline in koalas could be opening a niche for the dropbears to exploit.	1645167909.0	hxf2ufz	t3_sv4td2	t1_hxep9ts	/r/askscience/comments/sv4td2/are_there_any_invasive_species_that_originate/hxf2ufz/

5f9p5	Speaking of eucalyptus, another invasive species followed along much later, albeit for red gum eucalyptus instead of blue gum: lerp psyllid, an parasitic insect that feeds on the sap of the tree. Australian eucalyptus trees have lived with this parasite forever, and have built up resistance to its damaging effects - in the US, the red gums had never dealt with them, so once they established a foothold in the late 90s it had a pretty devastating effect on local eucalyptus groves.  Sauce: I grew up in a eucalyptus grove in southern California and watched the grove get devastated over the course of a couple years.  Also sauce: [https://cisr.ucr.edu/invasive-species/red-gum-lerp-psyllid](https://cisr.ucr.edu/invasive-species/red-gum-lerp-psyllid)	1645170030.0	hxf5r7m	t3_sv4td2	t1_hxejhsc	/r/askscience/comments/sv4td2/are_there_any_invasive_species_that_originate/hxf5r7m/

d5sb	> The eucalypt has evolved to be resilient to fire  And to increase its likelihood!  Eucalypt oil is a preservative, so when the leaves fall they don’t degrade until the oil has completely leached out, meaning there’s usually a significant amount of oily and partially dried up leaves to serve as timber.  And aside from the oil haze (which allows fire to quickly spread through the treetops) eucalypts have a tendency to violently explode, sending burning embers across firebreaks. In some rare cases the trunk blowing up can send the entire burning crown flying miles away.	1645184433.0	hxfnwpb	t3_sv4td2	t1_hxf5u4i	/r/askscience/comments/sv4td2/are_there_any_invasive_species_that_originate/hxfnwpb/

An explosion of palm tree planting occurred in the 1930s as Americans associated Southern California with a leisure-like, Mediterranean environment. As a part of the Los Angeles beautification program prior to the 1932 Olympics, 25,000 palm trees were planted all over the city putting many of the city’s unemployed back to work.	1645189700.0	hxfwhcf	t3_sv4td2	t1_hxfa18n	/r/askscience/comments/sv4td2/are_there_any_invasive_species_that_originate/hxfwhcf/

tcplr	Study relating to Black Saturday fires in Australia.    "The height of the plume at the fire at 7.24pm (two hours after the wind change) was estimated from a photograph of the pyrocumulus cloud to be 8,500 m high, with the smoke rising to around 5,200 m (Tolhurst 2009). This suggests a spotting distance of at least 20km would be expected during the heat of the afternoon."  "Hall et al (2015) report 40cm long rolled bark (Eucalyptus viminalis) weighing 10 – 15gm have maximum flame out times of 92 to 271 seconds) and burnout times (353 - 1300 seconds respectively. They theorise that a 2.7 m long cylinder of gum bark could burn with flame for almost 2000 sec and if it rose to 9,600m and fell at terminal velocity of 7 m/sec, it could theoretically remain flaming for 37 km downwind."  "Spot fire spread mechanisms It has been long known that there are three categories of spotting distance in eucalypt forest, short, medium and long (McArthur, 1967; Luke and McArthur , 1978). They can be characterised respectively as a few hundred metres ahead of the fire front (eg, up to 500m), a few km ahead (eg, 1 – 3 km) and several km ahead (5 to 25+)."  "Regarding these calculations as indicative estimates, the average distance per leap was initially 9 (= 18 / 2) and 10.5 km (= 31.5 / 3), and later 14 (= 42 / 3) and 15 km (= 60 / 4). The times per leap from Point Zero were between 0.75 (= 1.5 / 2) and 0.6 hours (= 2.5 / 4), ie, 36 to 45 minutes, or average 40 minutes."  http://www.redeagle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2-Spot-fire-direction-and-spread-in-a-severe-bushfire-attack-in-Australian-vegetation.pdf	1645192403.0	hxg1v0t	t3_sv4td2	t1_hxfuw48	/r/askscience/comments/sv4td2/are_there_any_invasive_species_that_originate/hxg1v0t/

kpt56	It's been a while since I did biology (6 or so years) so I may get some facts wrong or mixed but here goes. Some B/T cells can get out of the main blood stream as your capillaries, which diffuse nutrients into the surrounding area and waste out, can become 'leaky' meaning that these cells which usually stay in the bloodstream can migrate. This is usually caused by stress hormones from the cells in the area that are under attack and draws the immune response there. This is also why infected areas can sometimes swell, as water from the leaky capillaries seeps out. B/T cells that migrate out usually die after a few hours/days since they don't have an effective way to return into the body.	1645193123.0	hxg3eke	t3_svgb55	t3_svgb55	/r/askscience/comments/svgb55/how_does_the_immune_system_work_outside_the/hxg3eke/

6du8c	Thanks for the excellent solid source!  Worth noting though that this is a little less dramatic than the original suggestion upthread of “the entire burning crown flying miles away” — by a “cylinder of bark” I think the study means not a solid cylinder of trunk, but a light scroll of loose thin bark that’s separated from the main tree.  Dangerous because it spreads the fire, but not a big bulk crashing down out of the sky — it’s exactly because it’s light that it can be carried so far, like a kite in the hot winds.	1645195584.0	hxg8wbt	t3_sv4td2	t1_hxg1v0t	/r/askscience/comments/sv4td2/are_there_any_invasive_species_that_originate/hxg8wbt/

Unless you are engulfed inside the fireball itself (unlikely) you'll just suffer an agonizing 3rd degree burn over most of your body.

emjyz	Many years ago, I lived about 1 mile west of the Pentagon in Arlington, VA.  One night, about 2:15am, I was awoken by the sound of a helicopter screaming just barely over the top of my apartment building.   Now, I knew that ALL air traffic, helicopter or fixed wing, was required to follow the Potomac River to get to National Airport or the Pentagon, period.  And I had lived there for years, and never once saw or heard a helicopter go overhead.  So this was definitely unusual.   I figured that something really calamitous had just happened, and somebody was trying to get to (or out of) the Pentagon....rules be damned.  So I laid there waiting for the world to end, but it didn't.  For the next few days I scoured the news to see if I could see something that might have caused someone to say "I don't give a damn what the rules are....get me to the Pentagon NOW".   Never did.	1645213221.0	hxhia8m	t3_svgirt	t1_hxhekd9	/r/askscience/comments/svgirt/if_a_nuclear_payload_was_inbound_via_icbm_would_a/hxhia8m/

1v2ps	This depends a lot on the yield and type of the warhead, and it's not just the physical blast and pressure wave that does most of the damage.  Yes, the blast and pressure wave is overstated.  But if we're talking full strength Cold War era 1-5 megaton thermonuclear airburst it will basically light everything on fire within line of sight of the blast out to as much as a 100 miles from ground zero, with one of the main limitations being the curvature of the earth and horizon distance from the height of the airburst.  And then there's going to be a massive fire storm from that like you just carpet-bombed an entire metropolitan city with incendiary bombs non stop for a month, except it would happen almost instantly. Imagine a major city just suddenly bursting into flames everywhere there's an exposed flammable surface facing the blast. Even the paint on concrete will catch fire.  It's also going to destroy just about anything with a transistor in it at even farther ranges with the EMP.  And that's just one warhead. One warhead on a populated area would be a total catastrophe all by itself, but most ICBMs these days are MIRVs and there will be more than one warhead going with target spreads designed to cover a much wider area.  Repeat this with hundreds or possibly thousands of ICBMs each carrying MIRV payloads and it quickly adds up to capabilities that can wipe every major city in the US, Russia or even the entire planet right off the map with the combined effects and send us all right back to the stone age.  This is even before we start talking about fallout or nuclear winter from a large scale nuclear war.  Sure, it's not really possible to exterminate the human race, and life in general will go on with or without humans, but at this point even a relatively limited nuclear exchange would effectively end modern human civilization as we know it.	1645213897.0	hxhjz30	t3_svgirt	t1_hxhg8kx	/r/askscience/comments/svgirt/if_a_nuclear_payload_was_inbound_via_icbm_would_a/hxhjz30/

3e7bg	No, it's very unlikely that you could see it. While it is possible, if you know in advance the trajectory, to wait for it and see it through some camera or telescope optics, it is not really realistic that you would.  The MIRV is travelling at around Mach 20 and will be in the atmosphere for around 12 seconds before it hits. It has a cross-section (nose on) of less than a square metre. It's also pointing right at you, so has no spottable movement - it just gets very slightly bigger.   An Airbus A380 has a visible area, viewed from below, of around 500 square meters, and is generally flying at 10Km in the air, by way of comparison to something you'll have seen. So our MIRV is 500 times smaller and ten times (100Km) the distance and that is what it'll look like from the ground.   If we count down from the MIRV re-entering earth's atmosphere, to the point that it is at the same height as our Airbus, then it is 1 second from impact and still 500 times smaller than the aeroplane. The aeroplane being that tiny dot at the head end of the contrails in the summer sky.	1645215664.0	hxhoefy	t3_svgirt	t3_svgirt	/r/askscience/comments/svgirt/if_a_nuclear_payload_was_inbound_via_icbm_would_a/hxhoefy/

ee9qku7x	Here is an anecdote to add to the conversation others have been making.  I am partially deaf due to a brain tumor scare.  Basically the  vestibulocochlear nerve got choked and part of it starved of oxygen.  So I am deaf for frequencies over a certain point. (This is important to the aspect of communication with the larger system outside of the brain.)   Because of this I have extreme Tinnitus.  The brain needs info about the environment (Balance, spatialization, etc.) so it fills this space with sound.  Think about it as if they are integers within a really complex algorithm.  It's basically phantom limb syndrome for the brain.  It is literally a hallucination and it sounds just like it is outside of my body.  It literally cannot receive information from the larger system though.  The experience is very different than an inner voice.    However, the interesting thing is that we do have a sort of closed loop with our brain and our mechanical side of hearing.  When our brains fill in the blanks (think about a white picket fence illusion and how your brain can fill in the blanks of the background landscape) we actually send a signal out to the larger mechanism and create a physical stimuli which than returns to the brain to hear it.  With Tinnitus where there is dead nerve it literally doesn't do this.      Food for thought at least.  I'd like to hear someone add to this aspect of the topic.	1645217465.0	hxhsw8a	t3_svg9he	t3_svg9he	/r/askscience/comments/svg9he/does_the_auditory_nerves_activate_when_we_hear/hxhsw8a/

We’re talking literally dozens of warheads and multiple megatons of detonations over both DC itself and the surrounding area.  You would not survive the exchange where you live. No chance whatsoever.   If it makes you feel any better, no one else in your area would survive either. And thanks to fallout and neutron irradiation from the multitude of blasts, the entire region would be uninhabitable for centuries — possibly millennia.  DC, Moscow, NYC, LA, and London are the most heavily targeted metropolitan areas on the planet in the event of a full nuclear exchange.

b0bc3	It matters. Intensity of radiation decreases with the distance square (the cross section of the radiation is basically surface area), so a blast viewed from twice as far away is 4x less bright. Now, depending on the original intensity you may still need to get quite far away before the intensity falls off enough to not blind you, even with the squared falloff, but eventually you will get far away enough to not suffer visual damage.	1645218826.0	hxhwbnw	t3_svgirt	t1_hxhpkbt	/r/askscience/comments/svgirt/if_a_nuclear_payload_was_inbound_via_icbm_would_a/hxhwbnw/

lwnae	Correct, thats why i said distance also plays a vital role. With any source getting brighter all indirect reflected light will also get more intense so there will be a point where all light will be too intense (but at that point geoin blind will probably be the least of your issues). The sun is just an easy example to give because it has a steady brightness and is always at the same distance. With man made sources this will obviously be very different so anywhere from much less intense to a lot more. A bright flashlight held right up to your eye can be 'brighter' than a nuclear detonation at a large distance.	1645219156.0	hxhx5s6	t3_svgirt	t1_hxhpkbt	/r/askscience/comments/svgirt/if_a_nuclear_payload_was_inbound_via_icbm_would_a/hxhx5s6/

Hopefully your eardrums won't rupture, you shouldn't be blinded, and your lungs won't have ruptured from the overpressure, BUT you can still be horribly burned by the thermal pulse and/or have your cell membranes/DNA turned to jelly by gamma radiation.  The last twenty minutes of your life will be agonizing, but you'll get to see the fireball suck dust and debris up the convection column to form the mushroom cloud, and maybe even the beginnings of a fire storm.

gk3ym	If that's the case, wouldn't screaming or coughing be much louder? And wouldn't we theoretically be able to raise or lower the volume of our inner voice? Try screaming or whispering with it. The lack of variance in volume indicates that there is no amplitude component to our inner voice, suggesting lack of involvement of the cochlea.   Also, remember that while the larynx may be moving, it is ultimately the passage of air through the larynx that actually produces sound. Our inner voice continues unaffected by our breathing, while actually talking requires us to breath between sentences.	1645221549.0	hxi36bu	t3_svg9he	t1_hxhys2l	/r/askscience/comments/svg9he/does_the_auditory_nerves_activate_when_we_hear/hxi36bu/
11qgai	It's possible that you don't have too much damage, but it is also possible that you have damage, but your brain is compensating for the damage and "filling in the gaps" like it does with the blind spot that we all have in our eye due to the connection to our optic nerve.  What will happen is that if the damage is small enough, your brain will fill in the gaps so you don't notice, but at some point, you will hit a tipping point and you could find that after one too many exposures, your brain can't compensate any more and you start noticing things like dark spots or reduced vision.  Due to this effect, many people tend to not understand that they are damaging their eyes until they have done a fair amount of damage already.	1645221644.0	hxi3ezg	t3_svgirt	t1_hxhurna	/r/askscience/comments/svgirt/if_a_nuclear_payload_was_inbound_via_icbm_would_a/hxi3ezg/

fbjcx	One of my most interesting possessions is a letter sent from my grandad to my grandmother in the 50s. My grandad was doing his National Service with the RAF, and was stationed at Christmas Island to support the atomic bomb tests there (his job was, amongst other things, scrubbing the radioactive dust from the bombers once they returned.  Anyway, the letter describes the test he witnessed. It describes how they were positioned on the opposite side of the island to where the bomb was being detonated, sat on the beach facing out to sea (again, facing in the opposite direction to the blast), and they were instructed to close their eyes and cover their eyes with their hands. The letter describes how even through closed eyelids, he could see the silhouette of the bones in his hands.  So yeah, nuclear bombs are pretty bright.	1645221789.0	hxi3rw8	t3_svgirt	t1_hxhuy7f	/r/askscience/comments/svgirt/if_a_nuclear_payload_was_inbound_via_icbm_would_a/hxi3rw8/
76pxnzjw	Screaming and coughing involve an open mouth and or nose. I'm talking about events isolated to a (relatively) closed sinus system. There are a few examples of internally generated sounds being perceived as louder ny the person generating the sound. The volume of your ears "popping"/creaking or quietly humming are perceived as very loud by the person doing the act. They are entirely inaudible by any other person, even from a very close distance.   I can very easily and confidently whisper and or scream within my inner dialog. However, it's evident it mostly has to do with inflection rather than "volume".	1645221869.0	hxi3yy9	t3_svg9he	t1_hxi36bu	/r/askscience/comments/svg9he/does_the_auditory_nerves_activate_when_we_hear/hxi3yy9/
