70hfuiy	Are you speaking about the pain of the tooth, before the root canal? Because the route is not dead then. The process of the root canal removes the root and the pulp. Thereby getting rid of the pain. The actual process of the root canal is done with Novacaine and is painless.	1642695579.0	hth35e4	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hth35e4/
d9g6t	Don't be ashamed for wanting to learn. No one is born knowing this stuff, we gotta learn somehow!   So, not direction, just speed. You just assume the particles are moving randomly at an average speed related to temperature, because that's really what temperature IS, it's just the average vibrational energy of particles in a substance.   I kind of glossed over R because it's a little harder to explain. For an ideal gas, it doesn't matter how heavy the particles are. Basically, you can always determine how many atoms are in a liter of gas from the temperature and pressure because of the ideal gas constant, as long as that gas behaves like an ideal gas.  As for WHY it is what it is, that's mostly beyond my own comprehension. But what I do know is that it took scientists many years and many experiments to settle on the value. It is made up of two components, Avogadro's number and Boltzmann's constant. Avogadro's number is 6.02 x 10^23 , and it is defined as the number of atoms or molecules in a mole. A mole is roughly 1 gram of protons or hydrogen atoms (it was defined using carbon so it's a little off for hydrogen, but very very close). Boltzmann's constant is a relation between the kinetic energy of a single particle in a gas and its temperature.	1642696601.0	hth5x9d	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth2u1w	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5x9d/
btm1a6we	Cause the nerve isn't dead but is not salvageable either.  There is a big hole in our immune system; the nerve endings. They are so delicate that immune system is basically told to stay away from there. Otherwise the immune system could do too much damage.  So, when the nerves in the root canal gets inflamed you can't just clean it, cover it up and wait the body to heal it. The infection can travel inside the nerve bundles and destroy more of the nerve endings. Due to the proximity to your brain we are looking at grave injury or possibly death from untreated infection. So, the best choice is to kill the nerve. Which is the pain you feel, they will deliberately destroy the nerve and insert medication in the canal that will take care of the infection.     This is why cavities that exposes the nerve are so dangerous, there is a "hole" in out defense hidden inside our teeth.	1642697805.0	hth97rs	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hth97rs/
btm1a6we	>The actual process of the root canal is done with Novacaine and is painless.  Umm... no. it isn't. There is usually one very sharp pain and to get there can also be painful, and Novocaine is not magical, it removes by far most of it but when it comes to drilling to a root, it WILL hurt unless it is already dead. I call the sharp pain "piercing blue" cause that is the best way to describe it. I've had 7 root canals (and yes, i take care of my teeth now...). The numbing agent will numb the pain very fast, so i can say it is tolerable, it is just a second and the pain is then gone forever.	1642698140.0	htha5d2	t3_s8mble	t1_hth35e4	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htha5d2/
e3e7e3ns	Certificate validity is different (and shorter) than validation. The former is 3 months (actually, 90 days, but I won't quibble over 1 or 2 days) for letsencrypt -- other vendors  are longer, as you say, but validation is done every time a given service is accessed. One of the first steps is [checking that the current time is within the validity period](https://serverfault.com/questions/852419/how-much-clock-asynchronicity-can-secure-protocols-tolerate).	1642698258.0	hthah7o	t3_s7ev0q	t1_htg2ruq	/r/askscience/comments/s7ev0q/how_accurate_are_the_clocks_on_our_phones/hthah7o/
ajweh	So similar to the standard for a gram being 1cuibc cm, a mole is a gram worth of single protons? I'm assuming hydrogen isn't important but works because it only has 1 proton? And this mole is a way to measure volume so if we know the volume we could calculate exactly how much gas is inside? Then Boltzmann's constant tells us how the particles will behave when a force is applied? And using both measurements is considered the constant for ideal gas?   So like time and distance can determine the speed, these two factors can determine the speed of gas?  Really do appreciate the time btw.	1642698386.0	hthatwf	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth5x9d	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthatwf/

d9g6t	Well it's not exactly the mass of protons, it's equal to 8 grams of carbon, and it was chosen for historical reasons. If scientists had waited until today to define a mole, it would probably be equal to a gram of protons or something less arbitrary. The exact specifics aren't super important for basic measurements, just that everyone agrees on them.   Boltzmann's constant is the basis for relating the entropy of a system on a macro, measurable scale to its statistical components. Even after taking multiple classes in thermodynamics I have a hard time understanding it, but for practical purposes you can just accept it as a constant and not worry too much about what it means. Just that it comes up a lot in chemistry and thermodynamics and you often need to use these constants when designing chemical processes or machines like engines. The actual derivations are pretty advanced physics and math and beyond my understanding.	1642700844.0	hthhomc	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hthatwf	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthhomc/
eb3o8	It sounds like your endodontist was being stingy with with your analgesic.

d02xq	I've had several root canals, and the only time I had pain during a procedure was a tooth that had a bad infection. I'd already lost the nerve on that particular tooth, but when they were performing the procedure the relief of pressure from the infection drainage felt painful.  Every other root canal I've had was completely pain free after the initial lidocaine injections.	1642703823.0	hthpvhu	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hthpvhu/

16hgtd	So… you posted a link about hotter air and higher speed of sound then in the next sentence talk about hotter air being less dense than cooler air. Click the link please. The top of it talks about how IF PRESSURE IS CONSTANT this occurs. Yes ADDING heat to air causes it to expand and generally be less dense and rise etc. HOWEVER, if you added heat to air in a fixed size container it would heat up but the DENSITY would remain the same. Instead the PRESSURE would rise. There are many situations where you could have air at different DENSITY but the same TEMPERATURE. DENSITY does not equal PRESSURE.  As to why it’s faster in hotter air I will leave that up to people with more knowledge than myself.	1642705373.0	hthu5dn	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthu5dn/

15v3y2	I've had a couple of root canals but they were recommended by my dentist before there was any pain or inflammation.  As long as you get the procedure done prior to an infection, it's really not a whole lot worse than getting a cavity filled.  When people refer to painful root canals what they're really referring to is the infection itself and then having the procedure done while the infection is still ongoing.	1642707780.0	hti0l3e	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hti0l3e/

t5bcq	Since you obviously know your stuff, I'd like to ask an additional question.  I live in western Canada, where -30C to -40C temperatures are a a given for at least a few weeks each year.  These low temps are usually associated with high barometric pressure, sunny weather, and still air.  As soon as one steps outside in these conditions, one notices that sounds carry much further and much more clearly.  You can immediately notice a strange delay factor in judging distances.  The person shovelling their sidewalk a block away sounds like they're right next door, yet you can hear the delay caused by the finite speed of sound as their body movements don't match, visually.  I gather that the colder, denser air transmits sound with greater range and fidelity, but at a somewhat lesser speed?	1642714476.0	htihpu9	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth02zq	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htihpu9/

Cooler air absorbs less of this energy and allows sounds to travel further.   The relative stillness of the air also minimizes energy losses I imagine, but the viscous properties likely have a lot more to do with it.	1642725527.0	htj7eck	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htihpu9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htj7eck/

o1w3t	I think it would supercavitate first, which would form a wall of water vapour at extremely low pressures around the moving object. This is because water can transform state at low pressures, unlike air. This could happen in water at a few hundred metres per second - not slow, but within the range of high velocity torpedoes and high speed propellors. Given it supercavitates, we now seek the speed of sound in the gas rather than the liquid water.  This may be rusty, it's memories of a long past fluid mechanics course.	1642726277.0	htj95u1	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hti9hxn	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htj95u1/

The morning of my MI I wasn't even sure I'd had a heart attack but felt odd and luckily due to my experience with my family's history I went to the hospital.  I'm sure my blood pressure was elevated before but I was unaware.  Then the blockages are treated - I had a couple of stents placed as a result and have since been on medication to control blood pressure and watching my diet to control cholesterol and such.	1642727871.0	htjcudp	t3_s88jeh	t3_s88jeh	/r/askscience/comments/s88jeh/do_arterial_blockages_get_diagnosed_regularly/htjcudp/

Assign that number as a distance, like cm or mm or in. Then draw a circle with that radius, you know the point you are looking for is on that circle. Repeat with a second point and now your location can only be one of two places on the paper, where those circles intersect. With a third point there is only one place on the paper your location can be (hence *tri*angulation).

zqjvy	Not a lot of people know, but there are nerve crossovers from your left and right jaw that cross in the front of the roots, so no matter how much they numb it, it can still be very sensitive. This can also be caused by high adrenaline causing blood to flow faster than usual, and medicine to have a lesser effect.  Speaking from a voice of experience, I got 5 shots of different numbing agent, and I still felt the whole process.	1642738752.0	htk1e4o	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htk1e4o/
rwbls	I've had lots of root canals due to my poor dental hygiene as a kid, I also drink lots of soda, and smoke cigarettes and marijuana so that doesn't help either. I consider myself a pretty good patient though, I don't complain much, try to stay completely still, raise my hand and wait for the dentist to be away from my mouth when I need a second. I also have a pretty high pain tolerance, mostly because of a tooth I got removed when I was kid and the dentist gave me a shot in the root/nerve or something. I don't know what she did but it's left me with this sense of "as long as the pain doesn't reach that level I'm fine"  The last two root canals I had were absolutely dreadful. I came in to get some teeth carved up to get crowns. Too much decay, so they said I needed root canals, which I kinda knew. They send the money lady in, I pay some more, they get back to work. He starts doing something and I'm immediately in some of the worse pain in my life. Nearly in tears, fluddering like a mad man, I'm trying to tell him to stop. He gets me some more anesthetics, and the rest went smooth.  I asked him what that was, and said he was just flushing my nerve out, but since I wasn't originally getting root canals, he forgot he didn't use as much anesthesia as he would normally use. It literally felt like I was have something pulled out of my tooth, like a string of my brain through the root of my tooth.	1642738965.0	htk1u7x	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htk1u7x/

So two bodies in orbit each have a delayed response to the others influence on gravity based on their separation distance and the speed of light (gravity).  The delay between the sun and the earth is about 8 minutes.  The target is always being pulled towards where the body was at the time of the emission of the gravity wave.	1642746139.0	htkf6dx	t3_s8yph3	t1_htk6xo9	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htkf6dx/

fep5k	Can confirm. Had root canal treatment a year ago. Went to a doc who specialized in it. 3 hours in the chair, no pain at all. I had to watch out to now fall asleep (seriously). All filmed with cam so I could watch every step. Was just there few days ago to check if everything is good on xray and it's perfectly fine.  There are a couple of things you can watch out for to know if your doc is qualified for root canal treatment:  - does he use a microscope for the treatment? If not: don't go there - how does he measure the exact length of the root canal? A professional will have a electronic device for that (not sure about the english name but basically it does use low voltage to make sure doc doesn't accidentally drill out of your tooth but also doesn't forget a tiny part of the root canal, which would result in the infection getting back (eventually after years)) - what materials does your doc use to fill the root canal and what methods? Afaik guttapercha is still considered the best since it's reasonably stable (what you want) but still a natural product used for decades now (so we know it's not toxic even after years). But there are different ways how to lay guttapercha. Most just insert sticks, which obviously don't seal tight, causing bacteria to get back in again over time from the bottom of your tooth. So my doc heated it somehow and then pushed the resulting  paste in there really tight. Maybe there are superior methods to this by now but from my research they all come with the issue that they use materials we don't know for long enough to be sure how they perform over time - how does your doc make sure all bacteria in your canal is killed and no new get in during the process of the treatment? A good doc will use a rubber cloth in your mouth around the tooth so only the tooth he's working on is visible and no spit cat get in. He'll take the time to clean the canal using some sort of bacteria killing liquid (can't recall what was used in my case) at least twice before closing it. - and also of course, a good doc will take the time when doing the anesthesia asking you for feedback and eventually doing more if needed. Mine explained very carefully what nerves he needs to tread for that specific tooth and how they run in my mouth. From that point i knew that he knew what he's doing. I never had less pain at a treatment even for minor treatments.   To be fair thought my root canal was still vital as opposed to dead which normally results is better anesthesia. Afaik once your root canal is dead the anesthetics can't get there. It will still hurt (obviously, that's why you're there) but there not much a doc can do about it in that case. You still have to treat it or the infection will get worse. So all you can do in that case is hope for the best. A good dentist knows that and will inform you about it before the treatment.	1642748415.0	htkioif	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkioif/

66f7e	Marcaine is the long lasting anesthetic you are thinking of.  The other alternatives of the anesthetic not working is: A) an active infection. An infection is acidic in nature. Anesthetics are basic in nature. The acid in the infection will neutralize the anesthetic, reducing its effectiveness. (Which is why many dentists will drain an abscess, or give antibiotics to reduce the infection prior to treatment.) B) too much swelling/infection around the area preventing the anesthetic from getting where it needs to be to work.  There is also often pressure associated with root canal treatments as well as micromovements of the ligaments and tendons surrounding the tooth, causing some irritation post-procedure which can cause discomfort and pain afterwards. (Think of soreness after you go to the gym.) This pressure can be quite uncomfortable depending on intensity and the location. If it is on a top tooth, this pressure can be against your sinus cavity as well. Anesthesics will not get rid of any pressure.  In regards to post-treatment discomfort and pain: each person and each tooth reacts differently to root canal treatments. (I know I've had five done.) How active and recent the infection is, how intense the pain is day of procedure and the technique done on the tooth, may dictate the body's reaction to the procedure.  (Some dentists use the two-appointment technique as it was popular as it provided a higher success rate as opposed to the one appointment technique. But with more recent equipment, materials, and more accurate x-rays the two step method is slowly being phased out.)  Root canal treatments are also lengthy, and requires the patient to be open wide for long periods of time, which can create jaw pain post treatment.  And last, but not least: the only good story is a bad one. Nobody wants to hear about how you had the most wonderful root canal and how you fell asleep in the chair. But everybody wants to hear how you writhed and screamed in the chair getting this horrifying procedure that is pulling the nerves out of your tooth.	1642752932.0	htkozqa	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkozqa/

It has a faster onset than lidocaine, is way more effective, so I feel safe and comfy through the entire procedure, and from what I understand, it decays exponentially so it takes much faster to wear off. For me, lidocaine sometimes takes 6 hours to be fully gone, and even then there is some residual tinglyness, with articaine, I can eat as soon as I get home.	1642753997.0	htkqevi	t3_s8mble	t1_htjta4p	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkqevi/

If you push the substance inside at one end, how fast will the other side of the tube feel that movement? If you divide 1m by the time it took the movement to reach the other side you get that substance's speed of sound.  If the substance inside is, for example, solid steel, it's easy to figure that the other side moves almost instantaneously, and that speed of sound is incredibly high (approximately 3000 m/s, which might as well be infinite). This is true when we talk about an incompressible substance, and it also holds pretty well for water, for example. In fact, the speed of sound in water is approximately 1500 m/s, just about half of steel.  If the substance inside is air, instead, we don't expect the movement to be instantaneous. This is because air is compressible, so what happens when you push on one side is that some molecules of air just get closer to each other and form a wave (an acoustic wave, to be precise) which travels through the tube until it reaches the other side.  The speed of sound in air and in other gases is proportional to (the square root of) temperature. Why is that?  Temperature is a measurement of how fast, on average, the molecules of air are bouncing around and mixing with one another. This means that if you insert some floating color at one side of the tube, since air is moving so fast and is mixing with nearby particles, the color will spread much faster than if temperature was lower (and thus with lower mixing).  This is very similar in the case of an acoustic wave: if an acoustic wave forms, it can move much faster through the air if it is hotter because fast-moving particles are much better at transfering properties through the fluid.	1642764405.0	htl3ov3	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htl3ov3/

Two satellites intersects two spheres, giving you a planar circle that you could be anywhere on.  Adding a third satellite intersects another sphere with that circle, leaving two possible positions that you could be at, and a fourth satellite narrows down your location to which of those two positions is correct.  Including additional satellites beyond four in your fix just averages out the signal errors to improve the accuracy of the fix.	1642771478.0	htlfety	t3_s8qpe8	t1_htjsnoq	/r/askscience/comments/s8qpe8/why_are_there_only_two_signals_used_in_gps/htlfety/

Without knowing the exact local time, one satellite gives no information about your location. The fourth satellite is used to determine the local time. Two satellites give two spheres whose intersection is a circle. A third satellite gives a two point intersection with the other spheres. Only one of those points will be relatively stable with respect to the Earth's surface. The other will change wildly with each successive measurement.   >[An atomic clock synchronized to GPS is required in order to compute ranges from these three signals.

I have known some people to use cannabis daily from a teenager on and have high intellectual and scholastic attainments and high ranking jobs. Their use seems to keep them focused and high energy. These people you would most likely never suspect of drug use. I have also known others that use cannabis daily from a teenager and on and have failed out of school and always seem to been unmotivated and generally underperforming in all aspects of their life.

hljxc6c	As far as I understand, no, at least jot with opioids bc of the way that they change our brain chemistry. As I understand if we have specific opioid receptors in our brains (mu or something i believe?) And our brain actually creates more receptors to take in more opioids, which is why tolerance goes up so fast but doesnt come back down at the same rate, these receptors never go away. So while uou might be able to replace one addiction with another with any other substance i dont think the same rules apply to opioids. I am am addict and have known many other addicts over my time who have picked up a new addiction when trying to beat opioid addiction and just ended up with 2 addictions. Except maybe for weed. I know thar weed helps immensely with opioid withdrawal and detox, and pain management that leads many users to addiction in the first place. I personally have had a lot of luck using cannabis instead of opiates for my physical and mental issues.

yue6s	Barring the bizarre comment from the person who chews cannabis flowers, in general the "regular/chronic use" described in research is once per month or greater. That frequency, and greater frequency, is associated with memory impairment and all the other stuff hardcore stoners are in denial about. :)   If you want to look into it more, type the following into Google:  >site:ncbi.nlm.nih.gov chronic marijuana use systematic review  You'll find a number of review articles synthesized from credible, peer-reviewed literature. From those, you can follow the references to get more detail of each individual study's methodology and results/conclusions. I say regular use is generally defined as 1+/mo, but each study sets its own criteria. As these groups are often studying different aspects of marijuana use, it's best to look at each one individually to really get into the finer details.  Best of luck! Don't be afraid to try other treatments (assuming your use is for medical reasons) if you're put off by the potential harm marijuana can do to your ability to function agreeably in society (at work, with friends, etc.; that being said, it helps some people with those things). One of the more shocking side-effects associated with regular use is a predisposition to depression, so in that case especially it may be worthwhile to cut back and seek alternative means of treating whatever ails you.

zbd59	Optimal dose response curves are titrated during clinical trials. Finding a effective and safe dose is part of the vaccine approval process. Any approval is tied to the previously determined dose.  If you were to give an arbitrary (smaller) dose would likely result in a reduced statistical vaccine efficacy.  Individually, you might find that some people (e.g. younger, female) would mount an effective immune response at lower dose already (most older people, people with high body mass, etc probably not)	1642787078.0	htmio03	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmio03/

snpmb7k	The goal of any vaccine is to elicit a strong immune response, so that next time your body is exposed to a live virus you get that strong immune response right away. If you don't get a full dose, then your body might not develop that response, and you will have reduced or no protection from the virus. Even if you do get a full dose, some people don't develop a strong immune response for various reasons, which is why herd immunity is an important concept for modern public health.   The appropriate dose level is somewhat of an unknown for any given vaccine. There are models and historical data that we can use to estimate what an appropriate dose will be, but this is one of the primary reasons for conducting clinical trials. The vaccine developers come up with a number they think will be effective, and then the clinical trials in the population will tell you whether or not it's actually effective. Then (in the USA) the FDA approves that specific dose as the authorized "full dose" because it's been clinically shown to be effective.	1642791909.0	htmvp4i	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmvp4i/
fxyckcfp	Is the full dose required to get the same result is like asking why do specific dosage amounts exist. Simply put, yes. If you don't get a full dose of the COVID vaccine is like not taking all of your prescribed antibiotics for something like strep throat. If you do follow as instructed for the antibiotic, the bacteria can mutate, reproduce, and let enough bacteria exist with the mutation of being resist or immune to the antibiotic used to treat it originally which would mean higher power antibiotics would be needed. Same applies to COVID vaccine but its your immune cells instead of the antibiotics.	1642793307.0	htmzild	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmzild/

fxyckcfp	Its a matter of pressure, concentration, temperature and the components. Its a matter that as temperature goes up, pressure goes down which causes concentration to go down which means it has less to bounce against. Like u/cuicocha mentioned it is also a matter of the Ideal Gas Law, or PV=nRT, or Pressure times Volume equals moles times R(or 0.08206 liters times atmspheric pressure divided by mole times K or Kelvin) times Kelvin. Basically Pressure(atmospheric pressure) times Volume(Liters) equals moles times 0.08206 times Kelvin to determine the amount of gas in accordance to ideal gas law, which is rarely applicable because ideal gases rarely exist naturally, but it would be best to use here since you will likely be assuming its ideal gases.	1642794131.0	htn1sv3	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htn1sv3/

8owik4ho	I was on very strong pain meds for well over 10 years. I mean they put me on anything and everything. The last thing I was put on was the fentanyl patch. After a few years it just wasn’t working so I stopped putting it on. My doctor was flabbergasted when I brought my unused patches to my next appointment. You have to bring all of your pain meds and do a urinalysis at each appointment to show you are the one taking the meds and you have the appropriate amount of meds remaining. I had zero withdrawals or anything. That was 6 years ago.   Now here’s what’s strange. I have a new dr and I told her I’ve really been struggling with pain again. We discussed different options and she suggested medical marijuana. She said she’d much prefer me to be on that. Marijuana just became legal in my state, so I gave it a try for the first time. I have been experimenting with it for the past month. There is no way I’m getting that card. I can easily see myself getting addicted to it.

bqg56lkz	To make electricity flow, we need to create an electrical *imbalance*. As long as there's an imbalance, electricity will flow through every available path.         One tactic is to create that imbalance, and then just let it equalise slowly as the electricity flows until the imbalance is gone.  Or you could keep on topping up the imbalance.  Either way, the electricity is only going to flow in one direction through the circuit.  This is DC, direct current.  A plainer name would have been The Electricity Only Ever Flows In One Direction Current.          DC is easy to use but it's a little hard to generate. Let's think back to the time of the Industrial Revolution.  They were really  *really* good at building machines which were driven by a turning wheel. They also figured out that moving a wire near a magnet would create an imbalance and cause electricity to flow in the wire.   Combine these two ideas and you have an easy way to generate electricity. Put a coil of wire on a wheel, put magnets next to the wheel, and *voila!*  Electricity.         BUT, something attached to a turning wheel is going to move away from you, then towards you, then away from you, then towards you. And the same happens with the electrical imbalance.  It goes one way, then the other way  then one way, then the other way.        So these are the two grand tactics of making electricity: (1) create an imbalance which might run down but which will never change direction, or (2) harness a spinny thing to create an imbalance which changes direction over and over again.	1642798751.0	htnelxp	t3_s9g9rr	t3_s9g9rr	/r/askscience/comments/s9g9rr/what_are_ac_and_dc_currents_and_are_there_other/htnelxp/

An Alternating Current is like when you whip a rope and the wave travels down to the other end of the rope. The electrons are shaking back and forth (like the rope), but they're not actually *traveling to* the other end of the wire; the *wave* is what's traveling.	1642800162.0	htnijo1	t3_s9g9rr	t3_s9g9rr	/r/askscience/comments/s9g9rr/what_are_ac_and_dc_currents_and_are_there_other/htnijo1/

But chances are your executive functions are weaker during the part of the day you aren't high.  I.e.

Sometimes stoners refer to the time between not feeling high and actually feeling sober as a 'weed hangover.' The effects are not permanent (in my experience), but they do last 2 to 3 times longer than the psychoactive effects of the drug that people desire.	1642805778.0	htnxrqk	t3_s997hz	t1_htlakn3	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htnxrqk/

13sdyu	I look around at some of the research, sales and health outcome statistics, and I see no evidence at all that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada and some US states is contributing to reduce pot use and abuse among the population. In fact, it has been found that cannabis-related hospitalizations of adolescents have been increasing disproportionately in the US states where the recreational use was legalized, even though the minimum legal age is set at 21.  [Trends in Adolescent Cannabis-Related Hospitalizations by State Legalization Laws, 2008–2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X21003852)  Furthermore, it's impossible to ignore the painfully obvious conflict of interest among many of those who make a point to highlight the "economic" benefits of legalizing recreational marijuana? Cannabis-related stocks have been pooping up in tandem with the growing pro-legal noise and it's impossible to dissociate the pro-legal propaganda/agenda from an ulterior financial motive that doesn't properly value or flat out disregards public health consequences.  1. Do you not think that the legalization of recreational use is a reckless mistake? Shouldn't it had be simply decriminalized instead?  2. Do you think that a responsible drug legislation should also restrict the economic freedom of recreational drug-related economic activities with heavier regulation? Are you willing to opine or discuss the possibility of legally forbidding the listing of businesses that profit from recreational drug sales in the stock market, for example? Wouldn't strategies like this be useful to discourage not only misleading propaganda, but also ultimately sales and use of recreational drugs to some extent?	1642814513.0	htojgqb	t3_s997hz	t1_htn82c2	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htojgqb/

Suboxone is a very powerful opiate and while they say it doesnt cause the same effects, thats the marketing shit the companies made ip. Three years ago the FDA sactioned the sales of large quantities of loperdamide, which is even more powerful and sold otc. Loperdamide is said to not pass the BBB, but it's not a wall, and large amounts can push through, especially wheen they used to sell 400pills for $5 at Costco.

br6js5	Centrifugal force is only an apparent force, but then again, gravity is more of an acceleration than a proper force, so it kind of adds up.   Another way of seeing it is through seeing gravity as a centripetal force, which every little fraction of a second will change the direction you're going just a little bit, making your trajectory become an orbit	1642870246.0	htreyp6	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htreyp6/
dj00u	For one, centrifugal force is a 'phantom' force - it's only our perception (i.e., when turning the corner in a car, what we feel as an outward 'force' is actually just our inertia trying to carry us in a straight line, opposed by the car pushing against us). The actual force is centripetal (pulling *toward* the rotational center). However, neither are applicable to an orbit as being distinct from gravity (which is acting as a centripetal force). Instead, an orbit is the object trying to move in a line, but also being pulled doen by gravity - it's constantly 'falling' toward the planet. If the object's inertia carries it away from the planet at exactly the same rate as it is falling, you get a circular orbit. This is why they say astronauts DO experience gravity, but they (and the space station) are in a perpetual state of freefall.	1642870591.0	htrfv73	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrfv73/
moqxn	Orbits are defined by centripetal force. Gravity is the component pulling towards the main body, where the orbiting body is trying to escape perpendicularly (more accurately:tangential) to that force with its own velocity. The resultant path the orbiting body takes is a continuous arc “falling” toward the main body’s center of mass until/unless the orbiting body’s velocity is sufficient to create a full circle, which can continue to expand to an ellipse or escape trajectory if velocity is sufficient.   One more note: technically the orbiting body is equally pulling on the main body proportionally to the two’s masses. I simplified here assuming the orbiting body’s mass is negligible relative the main body.	1642870716.0	htrg70s	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrg70s/
jd8sn	Robert Bakker (paleontologist) wrote a fiction book called Raptor Red. He made a story about a female raptor and her offspring, and about what a typical life might be like. He brought his knowledge of the animal to explain (or hypothesize) what was going on at any given moment. One of the things he describes is that the raptor mom's sister meets up with her and the little raptors "understand" that this is pack (family) based on scent. Such as; the baby raptor would surmise:"Not mom....but like mom. Safe". So it's not the family as we have classified it but likely based on the familiarity of the smells.	1642872131.0	htrju13	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htrju13/

14bptt	It's would be better to say that the centrifugal force is the force of gravity. Centrifugal force isn't an actual force, it's a type of net force that results in circular motion. You still need to have an actual force acting perpendicular to the direction of travel to provide this centrifugal force. In a simple circular orbit, this force is provided by gravity. Objects in orbit absolutely experience acceleration as their velocity is constantly changing, not in magnitude but in direction. If there was truly a zero net force, then the object would travel in a straight line.	1642873434.0	htrn7gm	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrn7gm/

14bptt	>Centrifugal force is however a convenient simplification of the continuous change in direction.  This is not actually true because a continuous change in direction doesn't necessarily mean that you experience a centrifugal force. For example, you will experience a centrifugal force on a cyclotron at a fair because the centripetal force spinning the cyclotron isn't also affecting you so the centripetal force comes from the normal force of the outside edge pushing you inwards and we interpret this normal force as a centrifugal force since it feels like something is pushing us into the outer edge despite that not actually being the case. However the gravitational force keeping a space station in orbit equally effects the people inside and so there is no need for a normal force to keep the inhabitants moving in the same circular path as the space station and so they don't experience the same centrifugal force that the riders on the cyclotron do. But in both cases, there is a centripetal force that is maintaining the circular motion.  Also the centripetal force is only equal to the gravitational force because it's a net force and there is only one force acting on it so that one force must be equal to the net force. This isn't universally true though, if you spin an object on a rope in a vertical circle, you have two forces acting on it, tension from the rope and gravity. It's the sum of these two forces that will equal the centripetal force at any point, even these forces change depending on what part of the circle the object is at.	1642877484.0	htrxnb0	t3_sa4s88	t1_htrvbpn	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrxnb0/

If you threw a rock horizontally at 9.81 m/s the rock would orbit this mini Earth (ignoring air resistance and stuff). The rock is traveling fast enough cover the drop in curvature with gravity (9.81 m/s^2) to never hit the ground.

iutwx	Yep. It’s hard to conceptualize meaning, in general, for non human species. Concepts like parents, siblings etc are a way of describing a commonality among particulars. By describing Debbie as my sister, I am bringing her under a general discursive framework that abstracts away from any particular sister. Dogs (probably) aren’t using a discursive framework, so we run the risk of anthropomorphizing a dog’s behavior when we ascribe a thought process like “it recognizes that other dog as sister” or “here’s a dog I remember” to them.   “What is it like to be a bat” is the big paper that dives into this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F	1642878219.0	htrzj2p	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htrxi4l	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htrzj2p/

kyx8g	Yes, certainly. But the centrifugal force is actually a 'fictitious' force in that it is not a force at all but arises from an object's inertia.  IMO a better way is to think that the object in orbit is constantly falling toward its attractor/planet, but moving so fast that it overshoots the ground. The gravitational pull of the planet is constantly accelerating the body so as to pull it's direction of motion toward the ground, but the direction of the ground relative to the body is constantly changing.

p6de8si	Stop thinking of centrifugal force as a real force! It’s a fictitious force and you have to be very careful about reference frames if you’re ever going to use the term.  First, let’s define velocity and acceleration. Velocity is a speed AND direction. Acceleration is the rate velocity is changing. You are accelerating if you’re changing the speed (gas pedal of a car) or the direction (steering wheel). Newton’s second law says F = ma, so if we know the forces we can calculate the acceleration (in 3 dimensions). Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, we can use this to calculate what the velocity will be a small time step in the future (integration to be more technical).  Now, picture someone holding a weight on the end of a string. They start to spin in circles and the weight moves in a circle with them. Ignore gravity for this thought experiment, it’s just a person and a weight rotating in a plane. You’re watching them spin, the weight is moving in an ‘orbit’ around them.  As you are watching this, you can measure the velocity (speed and direction of motion) at any time of the weight. If you measure a moment later, the speed is the same but the direction of motion has changed. The direction of motion is constantly changing because it is accelerating inwards (direction of motion is constantly changing, not speed) from the force the person is applying on the string (centripetal force). This checks out with F = ma, no need for centrifugal force.  Now picture that you place a camera on the wrist of the person holding the weight. The camera is focused on the weight, you can’t really see anything in the background. As the person is rotating, so is the camera and the weight. So there is no motion in this reference frame.   But the person is still applying force in the string being applied to the weight, and we know F = ma must be true, even in rotating reference frames. This appears to be the only force. So why doesn’t the weight come flying inward at the camera?   Because we are in a rotating reference frame (camera on the wrist), there appears to be a force that is acting exactly opposite of the centripetal force in the string. We call this centrifugal force. But it’s not a real force, it’s merely a byproduct of being in a rotating reference frame. Because of this, we call centrifugal force a ‘fictitious force.’   If you’re on a rotating reference frame, like earth, you have to account for it to predict the motion of objects you’re measuring. But that force is NOT what’s holding the object in orbit!  Imagine that you place yourself far away from the earth (a sun-earth Lagrange point would be a good spot to watch, like where JWST is headed). Now you watch a satellite in orbit around Earth. You see it traveling with a velocity (speed and direction), but as with the weight, it’s direction of travel is constantly being changed. It’s accelerating inwards towards Earth. Instead of the force in the string, the force is now gravity. F = ma still checks out, it is in fact constantly accelerating towards earth.   TLDR: no, centrifugal force is only a thing because of rotating reference frames. Objects can still be in orbit if you’re not on a rotating reference frame.	1642886772.0	htskn1b	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htskn1b/

p6de8si	No, this is wrong even for most circular orbits! They would only cancel out if you were rotating at the same rate as the orbiting body.   Since LEO orbits are ~90 minutes, if you sped up earths rotation so much that a day was only ~90 minutes you could say centrifugal force cancels out with gravity for LEO orbits. Days are clearly longer than 90 minutes, yet LEO satellites still orbit. So that’s clearly not all that’s happening.  The *only* time this is true is geostationary circular orbits. That’s just a very specific orbit that has a period of 24 hours. You can’t generally say that circular orbits are gravity and centrifugal force cancelling out from Earth.  I have a separate comment where I tried to dive deeper into explaining what centrifugal force is and how it works if you want to learn more.	1642888141.0	htso0ad	t3_sa4s88	t1_htr96sj	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htso0ad/
ceijrrd	Yes. Smell. Many species, including other apes, can too.  My pet theory is it has to do with the veromonasal organ, which does exist in humans, but has been disconnected from the nervous system. Humans are so oversexed and promiscuous that if human fathers could tell they were cuckolded they would murder even more women than they already do, to say nothing of murdering children. Gorillas for instance are facing extinction and still the alpha males murder children unrelated to them. The human ape not doing that has really helped us overpopulate and become an invasive species.  For an example of how horny humans are, consider the discovery of the heritability of blood types. A study was done using blood from mothers, fathers, and neonates in hospital. It found at least 30% of the neonates could not be the biological children of the men listed as their fathers on their birth certificate. This was in the US in the 1950's, when women were far more modest than today, and the price for immodesty was far higher.  Note this figure is "at least" 30%. It could not attest to the infidelity of women who cheated with men who had the same blood type as their husbands. Being there's only 8 common blood types, that means approximately 42.5% of the babies born in the 1950's US weren't the biological children of their legal fathers.  Imagine if you will a human species where femicide was 42.5% higher, comparable with the other apes, and the birthrate was 42.5% lower, again comparable with our closest relatives. That would be a miserable species to be born into. You can see why there would be evolutionary pressure to lose the ability to determine by smell which child is yours.	1642888402.0	htsonl5	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htsonl5/

But you should add that our rotating reference frame (Earth) is not corotating with *most* orbits (because our day is a different length than the orbital period)  Geostationary orbit is the only orbit we corotate with, so the only one you can say centrifugal force and gravity cancel out from earths reference frame.	1642888502.0	htsow9e	t3_sa4s88	t1_htru2u7	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htsow9e/

6ru7m	I think that would be a very difficult question to answer. Certainly we can observe that a dog may be more interactive with familiar dogs than with unfamiliar ones. But how would you test whether a dog recognizes kinship, or whether that concept even means anything to a dog?    I think you'd need to design an experiment in which large numbers of dogs were exposed to:  \- Dogs with whom they are not familiar but to whom they are related  \- Dogs with whom they are familiar and to whom they are related  \- Dogs with whom they are familiar but to whom they are not related  \- Dogs with whom they are not familiar and to whom they are not related.  You would have to carefully observe the behaviors in each of these interactions, define specific aspects of behavior that can be consistently identified and quantified by multiple human observers, and then perform a statistical analysis to see if there are significant differences in how dogs behave in each situation. Such a study would be very difficult to get right.  This is just off the top of my head. If anyone has other ideas on how to test this I'd be interested in hearing them.	1642897689.0	httbg54	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/httbg54/

And like the other commenter said: equipment moving around or attaching/detaching/moving also cause energy loses that can be considered “friction”, and there’s also energy loses due to angular momentum changing. Not even to mention the energy changes that general relatively cause. None of these are “huge” energy losses by any means, but they are still things that definitely need to be accounted for unless you want a space station to deorbit uncontrollably within a few months/years or its creation.	1642908803.0	htu13r1	t3_sa535n	t1_httyyhj	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htu13r1/

So far the longest continuous time in space is 1.65yrs (a record set in 1995), and even that was unsafe. Compare that to Scott Kelly who set the American record of less than a year (340 days). Honestly I think keeping him up there that long specifically because he had an identical twin and to do some biological tests was at least a bit little unethical.  The research “energy” used to create such a system also wouldn’t really be all that much. The Saturn V and Space Shuttle were more intensive to create than any rotating space station could be. The most energy-intensive process of such a process would probably be the literally rocket energy required to launch and attach all the pieces together, not the engineering aspects themselves.	1642911320.0	htu71ho	t3_sa535n	t1_htu5jtm	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htu71ho/

qx12b	So how do you get it spinning? How do you keep it spinning? How do you correct for the energy and motion it imparts on the craft as a whole? How often? Where and how does it attach for maximum efficiency and minimum wear? How do you maintain the mechanical parts involved? Turning it off? Gotta expend the energy to get it up to speed again. How do you enter and exit from the stationary portion of the craft? What happens in case of structural damage or integrity loss? What's the procedure for mechanical failure that stops the section from spinning? How much friction is imparted by the pieces that connect it to the stationary portion of the craft? If there's not a stationary portion how do you keep the craft in orbit?   For someone who supposedly has an easy solution you're not offering any. Burden of proof is on the one who makes the argument. You say it's easy yet give no actual solutions and instead deflect. And then you have the AUDACITY to say the hardest part about making and maintaining a spinning space craft is getting it into space? That's literally JUST one step and by and large the one we have figured out.   So give your designs that I'm sure you developed through your time engineering at NASA and put this all to rest.

Hissing and fighting with those 2; they pretty much stayed away from each other.	1642917057.0	htuipv7	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htseawr	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htuipv7/

vp55s	I've always wondered about this.   We had a female stray cat that had kittens in my backyard.   One of the kittens was seemingly abandoned so we took him in and he's still with us inside the house, along with our other 2 cats.   He has a brother and sister that pretty much live in our backyard. He sometimes sits at the backdoor and looks at them. He's terrified to go outside but I always wonder if he knows he's related to them.	1642919721.0	htuncti	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htuncti/

If everything else is equal women can deal with high Gs and lower gravity slightly better than men. It’s something about their body shape and blood in the legs pooling and not getting to the brain.

1livu8w1	No, because "centrifugal force" isn't even a factor here. Actually, gravity and inertia canceling each other out are, in a sense, producing a "centrifugal force", but that's not the point.  The easiest way to think about it is this: gravity is pulling on you exactly as hard as you are trying to fly away. Normally, you'd fly off in a straight line, but the gravity of Earth (or another large body) is trying to yank you back down. If your inertia and the gravity are essentially in equilibrium, you don't get closer to the Earth, but you also don't get further away.  If you are moving at a right angle to the Earth, you enter a circular orbit. Elliptical orbits work by the same principle but are a bit more complicated, involving acceleration and deceleration.	1642933313.0	htv5ph9	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htv5ph9/

In some ways he never left the late puppy stages. He definitely acts younger than his parents did at the same age.

You're working against an energy gradient to put a bouyant object at the bottom of the ocean, right?

2zun0c7z	I already read a lot of good answers here including non- inertial rotating frames of reference, which induce fictitious forces like centrifugal force.  Seen from an inertial, fixed frame there is no centrifugal force and nothing cancels out. The mass in motion reacts to the force of gravity. If the initial velocity is zero or pointing to the center of gravity, it will fall straight down. If the initial velocity is horizontal, it will (at least try to) go into an elliptical orbit, starting at aphelion with the center of the earth in the perigee. The initial radius of the curvature near earth's surface is r=v^2/g. It is the interplay between initial horizontal velocity and gravity, which defines the curvature. If this radius is smaller than the radius of the earth, it will hit the earth before it can complete an orbit. If you start with approx. 8 km/s, the curvature is equal to the earth's radius, so have an circular orbit. If you increase it further, the circle will turn into an ellipse, which is now wider etc.  It is just the gravity, which causes the acceleration according to F=ma. (F and a are vectors). If the force  is perpendicular to the velocity, it will only change the direction of the motion and will produce a circle with the radius given above. For larger distances from earth's surface you have to take into account, that g gets smaller with increasing distance.	1642947077.0	htvq4ed	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htvq4ed/
30qlnuag	He doesn't. I had two sister cats years ago that couldn't be separated, because they went through trauma together. I found them in a box on the side of the road, and their bond was strong, but I can't say they knew they were sisters, just that they had always been with each other. I helped raise them, before rehoming them *together*. When one fell down our balcony, the other meowed and meowed for me. I found her under the stairs, but couldn't get back behind them (plus it was an area definitely filled with widows and scorpions). I ran back upstairs, grabbed the one who told me, and used her to lure her sister out. She was like an emotional support cat, for her sister.    On the other hand, I had a boy and girl, raised together. I was unable to keep them, so took them to a very small and more attentive shelter. When I went back to go see them (was allowed), they were in the same enclosure, hissing and snapping at each other. The shelter staff was terrified of the two of them, despite them both being insanely sweet.    So I separated them. The girl had a nail stuck to her cheek, because they had been fighting overnight. As soon as they were separated, they were both back to being sweet as pie.    A new environment was all it took for the two of them, born and raised together, to forget they were ever even living together.	1642947504.0	htvqy2v	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htuncti	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htvqy2v/

298hed	I would say it is impossible, even with an object with zero drag as the buoyancy force doesn't make sense at supersonic speeds, which would be necessary for orbit velocity upon breaching the water surface.  The ideal case would be a vacuum filled tube from space to the bottom of the ocean, with the object at the bottom sealing the tube.  With no friction in the tube and the tube disappearing as the object goes by to ignore any effects from water having to flow through the tube, water just passed by the object would have to flow fast enough to catch up to the object to apply a force to it.  When the object is going faster than the speed of sound in water, the water would have to move at supersonic speeds, which I don't think the water will be able to do without nozzle shenanigans.	1642958664.0	htwhqxj	t3_samslf	t1_htv5gwc	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htwhqxj/

11544l	The "external force" hypothesis is not universally true - as far as I can tell, there is a genetic predisposition that come come into play. It may be true for some people.  Recent theories also include neurogenesis rates, different neurogenesis rates in different parts of the brain, and synaptic plasticity all play a role too. The "level of chemicals" hypothesis doesn't hold water if you look at thinks like Spravato, which can alleviate depression for weeks/months after it has left your system, and it is not known to impact any of the neurotranmitters you listed.

d79lh7f4	Strictly an observer…. No expertise at all in these topics beyond casual interest in some podcasts and observing some fascinating people around me.  My impression is that depression really comes down malfunctioning control of neurotransmitters or the lack of an appropriate balance for your environment … while the cause can be one of many… trauma, inflammation, dietary, genetic, environmental…. (Basically good luck figuring out every individual’s cause).   Considering that your main happiness comes from things working out better than expected, in particular a positive dopamine hit difference between plan and actual. Depression manifests itself as a lack of interest/interacting with your environment because your cognition is not getting reward for acting if things are not under its control and your sense making is malfunctioning. I’m particular you lose control over attention, and stimulus of the environment, your lambic system starts to autopilot and you may experience weight gain reduced activity and stimulation, as you are now spinning in just planning thoughts become more in your head and detached from reality. Tons of screen time becomes preferable to bench pressing those extra 5reps.  The way I understand it, cognition not responding with the right right stimulation of your brain can cause depression. So in result you can’t really learn how to respond to your environment… basically eat less sugar, exercise more and you are likely to feel “smarter”	1642962837.0	htwsocw	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwsocw/

ncxd6	The best way I know to explain this given my own limited understanding and the fact that this field is still being pioneered...  Your brain is a network of roads, or you can think of it as paths in a forest. The paths lead to many different destinations. A path may lead to a feeling of happiness, confidence, sadness, anger, etc.  Often times, paths lead to the same destination, with some being longer than others.  Like any path in the forest, the ones that are used frequently are clear and free of overgrowth. The ones not so recently traveled, overgrow and can be difficult to travel.  You have to walk these paths every day, but depression is like if you sprained your ankle. That sprain could be something that happened over time because you weren't watching your step and caused a repetitive strain injury. It could also be something abrupt, like the loss of a loved one. You still have to walk those paths, but you move slower, and it's more difficult. As a result, you may take the easier, shorter paths (instant gratification), leaving the longer ones (self care, work, exercise), to overgrow.  Your ankle will not heal unless you take proper steps towards that end. Mostly because you *have* to keep walking those paths daily. The longer it goes untreated, the worse it gets, and the longer it takes to travel even the easier paths all while the longer ones overgrow even more.  Eventually, you're just crawling at a snails pace through as few paths as possible. Sleeping. Sleeping is the shortest one, so you do that a lot. Eating isn't very long, but your ankle hurts a lot today, so maybe just travel down that one once and it's good enough. The laundry path has been too overgrown for weeks now. And you're pretty sure a storm blocked the leave-your-house path.  The suicide path isn't very long. You've thought of that one. There's a big boulder at the beginning that you have to climb over, but it's easy down-hill travel from there. Maybe tomorrow.  Then cue antidepressants. Suddenly, your ankle is healed. With a renewed sense of mobility, you may travel some of those paths you have not in a long time. They're overgrown, so the first few dozen times you travel them will be difficult, but after they're cleared again, they become easier.  But maybe instead of cleaning those difficult paths, you try a new one, the suicide path. Since your ankle is better, you can easily climb that boulder now.  (Side note, this is why some anti depressants say that they can increase suicide risk. They help you to regain your motivation often weeks before you actually start to get better. Meaning you might actually follow through before things improve)  On the other hand, there's a lot of nice sights you haven't visited down the other paths. Happiness, self fulfillment, generosity, you havnt seen those I'm a while. Maybe try to travel a couple of them and see.  Even better, now you have a friend, a therapist. They can't physically help you clear those paths, but they can help you prioritize which ones need clearing first. Maybe even give you some advice on traversing difficult terrain to make you more prepared for the hike.  Sorry if you're looking for more of a scientific response given that this is /r/askscience  I just don't have to knowledge to provide that. But maybe this explanation helps to illustrate things a bit.	1642966290.0	htx1h65	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx1h65/

u63ch	While this is true in the sense that a low A1C can be an indicator of episodes of dangerously low blood sugars - there's some information missing here and I don't think this answers OPs questions about RBC and A1C in normal bodies. To clarify your points about diabetics though (as I don't have answers for OP) an A1C of less than 7 in Type 2 diabetics is considered the goal of their medical treatment so I have to assume you mean type 1s. In Type 1 diabetics, it is no longer considered an immediate cause for alarm. While it can indicate lower overall blood sugars or repeated episodes of very low blood sugar, today's technology has allowed many type 1 diabetics to reach near normal glucose levels safely. Additionally, while the overall 'low kills fast/high kills slowly' is very true - there are some considerations. A low that requires medical intervention is extremely dangerous and can cause death, coma, or other severe medical conditions. The term low for diabetics means a lot of things, though. Lows into the 70m/dL range are often considered trivial. Below 70 many many type 1s can treat a low on their own without medical intervention and treatment of these lows does not cause permanent harm. Sustained high blood glucose levels does cause harm that is potentially permanent and increases risk for complications and comorbidities that decrease quality of life and chance of death. So a low A1C in type 1s is generally considered a reason for celebration and a high A1C is considered reason for medical intervention.

12bt9d	For me I was 'diagnosed' with depression first, spent the best part of a decade going on just about every anti-depressant under the sun with things not really improving overall, only to see someone much later and come to the conclusion that actually it was ADHD. I was depressed because my life was a disaster, I wasn't failing in jobs and in things because I was depressed, I was depressed because I was failing in jobs, projects, relationships and most everything with no solution in sight.     It was a real eye-opener when we found some old school records saying I had dyslexia but no trouble concentrating...followed by pages of reports saying I got no work done unless supervised in every single subject and that I had a 'daydreaming problem' along with my goals being to 'keep track of his possessions' because I was forgetting things on a daily basis. I also found out my parents were told by the then headteacher to not tell me or anyone else about the 'dyslexia' because I would be disadvantaged/labelled if they did, which explained why I got no extra help after primary school. Go figure :')     I often wonder how many people are out there on anti-depressants and other drugs when really they have ADHD because of bad attitudes from professionals back then.	1642973270.0	htxjmh6	t3_sawfex	t1_htx5z5b	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxjmh6/

6ntxk	Adding to this: The public understanding of ADHD is still developing. Even today, there is a large contingent of people who refuse to accept that ADHD exists and that by diagnosing and medicating children, we're pathologizing 'kids being kids.' And the different presentations of ADHD may make it appear that something else is happening instead.   I was diagnosed with depression early in my life, and also have ADHD-inattentive. Because the inattentive expression of ADHD was less commonly known, no one (parents, teachers, doctors) ever thought to get me checked for it. I wasn't bouncing off the walls hyper - I don't get hyperactive symptoms - but I'm a textbook case of inattentive ADHD if anyone had known to look for it.   Because I'd already been diagnosed with depression, and there's a lot of overlap in how ADHD-I and depression are expressed outwardly, I didn't even think to get tested until a couple of years ago.   Depression didn't cause my ADHD, but my ADHD looked like, and was often hidden by, my depression.	1642977163.0	htxtp2t	t3_sawfex	t1_htx1tei	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxtp2t/

Later, I dated a vegan, and within about 6 months, I had gone back to complete intolerance.

it7xmukc	Some of my situation is similar to u/ryan30z: refractory, atypical childhood ongoing depression, diagnosis as an adult of ADD (no hyperactive component), hypnagogia (violently acting out in sleep, unrelated to sleepwalking), high IQ, and very creative. SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved ineffective and in a couple of meds, even dangerous.  Treatment is now centered around Emsam (12mg selegiline patch), which mitigates both depression and hypnagogia. After problems with ADD drugs, I've returned to self-medicating with prodigious amounts of caffeine to concentrate and sleep, and consider ADD not a handicap but a superpower for creativity.  Happy to share more if anyone is interested.	1643012240.0	htzvij9	t3_sawfex	t1_htx5z5b	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htzvij9/
y9ybd	I am very interested. I am waiting for my appointment to get diagnosed, unfortunately one year is the waiting list. I seem very similar to you, however, I don’t know if I act out in my sleep. Will have to setup a cam tonight I guess.   I fear these comments will be removed, but what issues did you have with ADD drugs? I presume you’ve tried ritalin and the sort?	1643012591.0	htzvyus	t3_sawfex	t1_htzvij9	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htzvyus/
it7xmukc	Until the ADD diagnosis, I'd self-medicated with caffeine– I consume prodigious quantities of caffeine to concentrate and sleep. Unfortunately, Adderall made me drowsy and Ritalin made me jittery at unpredictable times, so I returned to large doses of caffeine.Similar to u/Ryan30z, I wasn't diagnosed with ADD until well into adulthood. (My physicians use 'ADD' because I do NOT have the hyperactive component.)Like others, I have a high IQ and am very creative in multiple fields. I began to think of ADD as a creative superpower, which helped me deal with it.Since childhood, I've been plagued with refractory atypical depression. SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved either ineffective or outright dangerous.• Effexor® venlafaxine (extreme splitting headaches and weird popping sounds)• Lexapro® escitalopram oxalate (severe suicide ideation)• Remeron® mirtazapine (red splotches over body, MD doubled dose resulting in full-blown gout)There was some thought a reverse-MAOI might work, but none were available in North America.The clinical trial of Emsam (12mg selegiline patch) worked wonders… until the trial ended. Without the medication, depression set in.And so did acting out in my sleep, a type of hypnagogia unrelated to sleepwalking. The muscle inhibition from REM atonia had broken down. I punched, kicked, and leaped in my sleep. I was afraid of hurting my girlfriend, but I actually injured myself my eye striking the corner of a table. I mention this for a reason…My insurance company helped locate a psychiatrist knowledgeable about Emsam and willing to prescribe it. The malaise of depression begin to lift… and the hypnagogia began to fade. Selegiline was treating both… or possibly the depression and hypnagogian were related.Forgive me if I hijacked the thread. I merely hope others may benefit.	1643017144.0	hu01jh7	t3_sawfex	t1_htzvyus	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu01jh7/

y9ybd	Thanks for sharing friend! I’ll look up Emsam. I’ve tried around 10 different medications for depression, anxiety and anti-psychotic (my old psych thought I was going Schizo, due to my Depersonalization which is as wrong as it gets).  I’m really hoping, IF I am actually ADHD, that, first of all, I will get to try ADHD medication, and then that ADHD medication will actually help. It’s different for everybody.   As you said, ADHD is more of a weird superpower than an illness. It’s not confirmed, only theorised, but I somewhat believe in the hunter/gatherer hypothesis that ADHD was an advantage back then. Not to mention creativity. Sort of like being superman but unfortunately our whole modern life is kryptonite, so we are reduced to a wreck.	1643018876.0	hu03l7d	t3_sawfex	t1_hu01jh7	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu03l7d/

Male with BPD and ADD here, and I’ve actually had multiple psychiatrists / therapists talk to me about the importance of getting re-tested for ADD as an adult if you were diagnosed with ADD as a kid and then later with BPD, because they’re so commonly comorbid and have such similar symptoms in kids that kids with BPD are often *mistakenly* diagnosed with ADD or ADHD when what it really is is BPD.	1643031513.0	hu0mfol	t3_sawfex	t1_htxfcyj	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu0mfol/

g70ee3k0	Have you never experienced it? From the nature of your question it seems as if you might not have which if true is remarkable. Have you never had days where everything went your way and life was good and you were definitely upbeat? And then a day when you couldn't do anything right and nothing turned out as you expected so you felt the world was closing in and you were all alone? What happens to your creativity and ability to find solutions if you are "in a funk" and just want to stay in bed? Some folks are born optimists and it's easier for them to stay on an even keel. Those who are the opposite have a tough time. They always see the thorns and the weeds in the garden and never the flowers. There are meds for those who are clinically depressed which help. I have a friend who was clinically depressed for years so that's how I know meds help. Why people are as they are is embedded in their DNA and they have their parents to curse or bless for it.  I don't know if it is possible to change the wiring though it can be masked with help.	1643033494.0	hu0qhni	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu0qhni/

y5jls	How I always knew it: Hyperglycemia kills you over time with organ damage, but hypoglycemia kills you now.    Hyperglycemia is a chronic issue (although if it gets high enough it can become an emergency if it doesn't come down or causes diabetic ketoacidosis.) Hypoglycemia is pretty much always an emergency.    My mom is a brittle t1 diabetic and we have lots of trouble with lows (and highs) but things are a lot less stressful now that she has one of those continuous blood sugar monitors.     Bad lows at night can cause t1s* to die in your sleep.      *I assume it also effects anyone who is insulin dependent but the insulin dependent t2s I know say they never have this issue unless they accidentally overcorrect.	1643034473.0	hu0slyf	t3_saxb1r	t1_htwyr3b	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0slyf/

I think flagging pre-diabetics is probably one of the best use cases of the HbA1c test.  If you’re pre-diabetic and implement good lifestyle modifications, you can push back the diabetes diagnosis by up to 10 years!

y5jls	I think your doctor would probably just try to closely monitor you. 5.4 isnt THAT far off from 5.7 and a higher fasting isn't great.  From a1c charts the "average" blood sugar for 5.4 is 115, the average for 5.7 is 126, so while they're not the same, they're closer than I thought they were.    Prediabetes is kinda a sign that says "please try to turn back before this gets worse!"    My doctor would probably tell me to work on myself as if I had prediabetes with the info you have given even if he didn't note down "prediabetes" in his chart, but I have family history and a hormonal disorder that makes me more insulin resistant so we likely aren't the same.    What did your doctor say about it? This is something they can answer better than we can.    They could order one of those tests where you drink something sweet and they monitor you to have a more accurate look. If I were you, I might ask if they want to order that so you could have a better idea one way or another.	1643037584.0	hu0ztmw	t3_saxb1r	t1_hu05oos	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0ztmw/

The presence of the pulled-along-after fluid would preclude that, as long as the fluid's cohesion doesn't cause it to move slower than the object (which others pointed out to be cavitation).  ... though that means the answer to the question is actually 'Usually not, but with enough force/speed, possibly yes' since cavitation does exist.	1643039267.0	hu141kq	t3_sbehp5	t1_hu10csi	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu141kq/

I was going to comment something similar, all the publicly available research and tone of doctors communication is so rudimentary and full of half baked explanations. I have read and heard from multiple sources that the common complications from poorly managed hyperglycemia were from something to the effect of “glucose molecules clogging up small blood vessels”. Which always felt a little off based on the scale difference of a red blood cell that routinely passes through these areas and a singular glucose molecule (or thousands of glucose molecules for that matter).  That the glycation of proteins that weakens/prevents their normal function in the common problem areas is the reason for most diabetic complications was eye-opening and, strangely, motivating to keep working hard to maintain good levels.	1643039983.0	hu15wjw	t3_saxb1r	t1_hty46o7	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu15wjw/
4bzt1zdh	Yes there are a number of factors that affect sound propigation:  as a constant the speed of sound is calculated at 1500 meters per second. .   Temperature, pressure, and salinity are the 3 primary factors in relation to SONAR. And increas or decrease in any of these areas will affect the speed of sound up or down.   Depth is the primary constant and at a sertain point around  3000 meters below sea level. Surface Sound is curved back up. This  produced a cool affect called a convergence zone. A sound source can have multiple convergence zones at increasing and calculatable ranges .

smbs4ln	It’s only in the last couple of years that there is any inkling of general tests being available.  You’ve heard of Theranos. Back before they were outed as a scam, what they were promising was science fiction come to life.  Any tests that we have no that are multipurpose are very limited. They’re 3 different tests that just happen to not interfere with one another and also are useful together. Sort of like MMR vaccines. 3 diseases that are common and the vaccines don’t mess with the others.   Now, there’s a company called Grail with a product going through trials, but is also so promising that the UK government has paid for over 100k people to participate, that can detect from a single blood test 50 of the most common types of cancers. The idea is that you get this done at your annual physical at the same time as the blood draw to test your cholesterol levels. This test uses DNA sequencing and can’t detect things like chemical imbalances or viral infection at the same time. It’s literally just doing a bunch of sequences of the same person’s blood at once and the comparing the results. Remember, cancer is your cells with your DNA. Illumina’s sequencers that they use can sequence several thousand different individual’s genomes in one go, so I’m pretty sure they just put one person’s DNA on the whole test slide and then compare it all.	1643040048.0	hu162ju	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu162ju/

16qcpz	Pressure versus temperature is much of a muchness, but one way of looking at it is that stellar core pressure is not really the direct cause of fusion -- it leads to high temperature and high temperature is the cause.  Basically, inasmuch as temperature is a way of talking about how fast particles are zooming around, high temperatures are what make atomic nucleii bonk together hard enough to fuse.  If it were "just" pressure (if that were somehow possible without also getting high termperatures), you would eventually end up with something like a neutron star -- super compacted atomic matter just sitting there, chilling.  So for us on Earth, trying to ignite nuclear fusion artificially, a high-pressure mechanism is just one of many possible ways to achieve the high temperatures we want.  And it turns out it's not very efficient compared to other ways of getting to a high temperature.  So we mostly focus on those other ways.	1643041998.0	hu1b42q	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu1b42q/

3hmuyesw	It's the other way around. You can imagine L4+5 as the (relatively) flat tops of gravitational hills while L1-3 are local valleys. The thing is, minor disturbances can kick something out of the L1-3 valleys and into the main bodies gravitational well, while objects can quite happily roll around the L4+5. https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange-Punkte#/media/Datei%3ALagrangian_points_equipotential.png	1643042446.0	hu1cams	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu19cl6	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1cams/

f0pjd	I'd really like a source on that.  I find it highly unlikely that any reputable IRB would allow research on hospital lab 'leftovers'.  Most of the time, hospitals dispose of all blood samples within 5-7 days of admission.  I know this because coroners and medical examiners have to subpoena those admission samples to test them for drugs/alcohol on people who have delayed deaths from ODs or trauma.  If somebody survives a week or more in the hospital before succumbing, we tend not to get any samples to test from their initial admission, meaning we can't tell *why* they suffered a cardiac arrest.  But our right to those blood samples is explicitly listed in our state's Revised Code.	1643042589.0	hu1co6v	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu0urxz	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1co6v/
o59yb	My understanding is that they are less like valleys and more like hills. They are "stable" like how you can balance a ball on another ball if you get it just right. But if it tips to either side, it won't roll to correct itself back to the center, it'll just keep tipping until it falls.  Think of it like a pyramid with a 1 meter flat table on the top. You can put a ball on the table. It's stable, it will stay, no force is drawing it in any direction strong enough to move it. But if force is applied and it rolls off the table, it'll hit the slope and keep going. Because now one of the gravities is strong enough to pull it away from the other thing.  From your question it seems like you're thinking about it like a hole in the ground with sloped sides. That if something is at the bottom of the hole, and you try to roll it up the sides, and let go, it'll naturally fall back towards the middle. In reality it's the other kind of equilibrium.	1643042732.0	hu1d246	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1d246/
dq8fz	I work for a company that collects a lot of the clinical data for some of the big pharmaceutical companies to run drug trials, including some of the new COVID vaccines. The answer is that yes, their is a ton of data collected about each patient as part of a clinical trial that looks at all sorts of data points. Things like biometric data, medical history, any new diagnosis or prognosis. I don't think a lot of respondents realize the amount of data that's required in order to get FDA approval. When it comes to drug trials these aren't a couple of small data points we're dealing with, we're talking extensive clinical data that in many cases contains decades of data on the same subject.   &#x200B;  To answer your question directly...yes our clients have teams of of data scientists who scour the data and are looking at anything that might be significant regardless of the intended purpose of the data collection. If you have this incredibly rich data set you would be incredibly stupid not to see if their are other significant findings you can get out of the data.	1643043082.0	hu1e05w	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1e05w/
4nkw6	I believe you have it wrong. If perturbations won't kick things out of L4+L5 then it's not the top, it's the bottom of a hill, in this analogy.

8t0pzwe	I’d say the main concern is the concept of informed consent, the form is secondary. Pretty sure you don’t need a consent form for something like taking a nasal swab or blood sample anyway. The important thing is that people are supposed to understand what’s being done to them and why, including what’s gonna be done to sampled taken from their body. A consent form like you described would do nothing in the spirit of this principle.  But yes, you could draw up a form with an exhaustive list of all the tests you intend to do and have people read and sign it (or more realistically, just explain to them what you’re going to do). However, you still have the (arguably more important) consideration: are these additional tests likely to benefit the person? If not, you shouldn’t even be asking for consent in the first place.	1643043303.0	hu1elrz	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu1870u	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1elrz/

3hmuyesw	I still believe I'm right, but my terminology might be incorrect (not a physicist). I believe this excellent video (by a physicist) agrees with me: https://youtu.be/7PHvDj4TDfM  The L4+5 points are just more bigger and more "spread" (if you get my meaning), while L1-3 are much closer to the bigger gravity wells and so once an object is kicked off the Lagrange Point it's almost certainly going to fall.	1643043577.0	hu1fch7	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1e4j8	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1fch7/

In any case, they have fuel with them to ensure they keep it in the right spot, as it will eventually drift a little bit - they can make miniscule corrections.

These changes can take several weeks to occur from the initiation of therapy, however, and many patients will actually experience worsened acute effects during that "waiting period"   From my understanding, this is actually one of the stronger pieces of evidence backing up the trophic theory vs. the neurotransmitter model.

Covid PCR based sequencing test used to specifically amplify up the covid genome, and sequence it to determine which variant it is.  Respiratory viral infection panel sequencing tests, used to sequence multiple viruses including covid. This can find presence/absence of a number of viruses, and determine variants. It is however not widely used compared to the ones above.  So there’s some data on other viruses coming from covid tests, but overall not much because the diagnostic tests are primarily the ones specifically looking at covid, not the panel.	1643017449.0	hu01weg	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu01weg/
akdzf	As you go higher the air gets thinner. Airplanes fly because the curvature of their wings causes air over the top surface of the wing to take a longer path than below; the longer path stretches out the air molecules = lower air pressure and this pressure differential is "lift".   But at some point the lower air density starts to eliminate the lift except at higher speeds. So in general the planes that are capable of flying super high like 60-80 thousand feet are either specially designed  wth super high lift to weight ratios (U-2 spy plane) or super duper fast (SR-71), i.e. so fast they still generate lift at lower air densities.  At lower altitudes you have weather effects caused by high/low pressure boundaries, storms, clouds, lightening. At cruising altitudes of 30-40k ft you still have winds which can be quite strong, but they're more consistent airstreams. And sometimes you can take advantage of their direction. Flights at one altitude get a nice tailwind in a certain direction, others at a different altitude get a headwind in the same direction. So taking advantage of these can save some fuel.   But outside of weather and windstream related reasons, planes flight at certain altitudes because they strike a sweet spot in terms of fuel efficiency and speed vs the air density. An airliner at 35,000 ft may be 95% fuel efficient at 500 mph. Same plane at 20,000 ft might be only 80% efficient cause it has to power through denser air.  To add to this, you can design wings and engines that are capable of pushing your airplane at whatever speed and altitude you like, but to be fuel efficient (which is a key goal of commercial air travel) you have to design for a sweet spot which will require compromises which make the plane less efficient in other spots; either it will require more fuel, or it will be slower or have less lift or whatever.	1643121492.0	hu5nujd	t3_sc7jz7	t3_sc7jz7	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu5nujd/

iy0cq	The booster will give you a head start by at least increasing the amount of antibodies present at resting levels. There is still binding of antibodies to Omicron, even if it is not strong enough to prevent re-infection. Your body will have a head start developing stronger binding antibodies, while the weakly binding antibodies will still block some of the virus from binding to your ACE2 receptors.   So while it won't prevent an infection, you will be days ahead of the curve. Whereas if you didn't have a booster, your body would be playing catch up, having to first ramp up it's weakly binding antibodies, before starting to refine them to bind more strongly. The booster essentially buys you time by having your body primed to fight something that looks like Omicron.	1643136761.0	hu6ryvo	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu6njuf	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu6ryvo/

141lhz	Something to remember too is that there are often two things that land people in the hospital/kill people when it comes to the flu (and this goes back to the Spanish flu, etc)…  You either have almost no immune response (elderly, very young infants, or immune compromised);  Or you have a Massive immune response. This tends to be young adults (late teens/ early 20s but not exclusively) whose immune systems are still naive to the invading pathogen.  This has been seen in many pandemics / epidemics where a multimodal mortality curve is seen (peaks at different age groups).   Is this a catch-all answer ? No. But it’s something to think about. Getting annual vaccines isn’t just about protection against the virus, it’s also about letting the body recognize the virus ahead of time so the human body doesn’t get as sick (immune response doesn’t need to be as strong).	1643151689.0	hu7v0k2	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7v0k2/

iy0cq	Were you vaccinated? If not, your body makes antibodies to whatever sticks to the virus first. It's not necessarily the spike protein. Getting a vaccine would guarantee your antibodies bind to the spike protein.  The key with getting a booster is it increases the number of antibodies around at resting state.  Mutations make it so antibodies bind weaker, but doesn't prevent binding completely. Even weak binding to a viral protein is a million times better than starting fresh. Your body will know weak binding is happening, and will absolutely flood your bloodstream with those weak antibodies. This partially inhibits the spike protein from binding to your cells, slowing the virus's spread for long enough for your body to refine and make strong binding antibodies.   Here are the steps to basically how your body responds to a virus. Remember, in each one of these steps, the virus is replicating exponentially.  1) Virus is detected, inflammatory response activated and virus samples are sent to lymph nodes  2) if there is any b cells activated at all, those b cells start pumping out antibodies to interfere. It takes time to ramp up antibody production.  3) Lymph nodes develop and refine antibodies, hopefully to the spike, but also possibly to the nucleocapsid or other proteins.  4) strong antibodies are released in huge quantities to interfere with virus and target it for clean up. Again, it takes time to ramp up antibody production.  4.5) t cells are sent to kill any remaining infected cells  5) your body keeps making antibodies, but this number decreases over time  So, if you don't have a vaccine or booster, your body first has to ramp up antibody production of the weak antibodies. Then it has to develop a strong antibody and ramp up production of that. In broad strokes, if you are vaccinated and boosted, you get to skip from step 1 to step 3, saving time that the virus could be replicating. If you aren't boosted, you may have to start at step 2 and ramp up your weak antibody production.   The further along in the progression that you can skip to, the faster you heal, and the less infectious you are. If you skip the booster, or any new vaccines, your body is playing catch-up with the virus instead of already having the upper hand. And if you haven't been vaccinated, there is no guarantee you have protection against the nasty spike protein.	1643156588.0	hu87040	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu7wcip	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu87040/

cshogn00	People do not understand the difference between a vaccination and an immunization.  they are NOT the same thing.   one gives you a significantly greater chance of not catching something, and if you do, it will generally have significantly less symptoms.   The other gives a (often lifelong, sometimes requiring a booster) protection against catching the disease in the first place - see polio.    I think one of the biggest problems we have with the covid vaccination program world wide is that it was not explained properly and many people believed it was an *immunization* and they believed after the jab they would not catch it at all and that is where a lot of the distrust and wild theories have been born from.	1643162839.0	hu8lwcy	t3_scirna	t1_hu74v52	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu8lwcy/

dwx4l	I came to say exactly this. So, I guess I'll mostly just confirm.  Perhaps I can add a little. The skins are caribou, specifically. When I was up in the arctic on an ice floe in June 2002 (now it's May for that trip due to climate change), even just putting a caribou skin over you face down like that starts to feel warm almost immediately. They always kept one or two in the back of the komatics (sleds) that were pulled by the snowmobiles with the tour group members in them in pairs.  Interestingly, caribou herds can be tracked by their slight heat signature from satellites. Muskoxen cannot. Their fur is even warmer, so warm that there is not enough heat signature to track the herds by satellite.  I asked the Inuit guides (through our English speaking guide) why they didn't use muskox skins. The answer was "too warm". They said that when they used to build igloos for hunting trips, they might use a muskox skin as a rug in the igloo. But, they never wore them.	1643178713.0	hu9i5a1	t3_scbdvn	t1_hu9a2yk	/r/askscience/comments/scbdvn/what_is_the_coldest_temperature_a_clothed_human/hu9i5a1/

The coldest I've ever been was one time when I was on a date with this one girl and she just didn't have the greatest teeth. So we went out to some expensive steak restaurant, went all out pretty much. Then, at an opportune moment, caught a taxi back to mine and left the unsightly lady with the bill.  Cracks me up every time I think about it.  Anyway, thanks for the question Mr. Nelson, hope my response was insightful.

bmhdiel	1 blade (with a counterweight) presents the least drag and least power, so some gliders use them for takeoff instead of a tug.  8 blades presents the most drag and the most power, so a military turboprop might have 8 to generate a ton of thrust regardless of efficiency.  Everything in between is a tradeoff. Keep in mind that you can't just spin a 2 blade prop infinitely fast because the tips will exceed the speed of sound, so eventually you add more and more blades but spin slower.	1643200954.0	huacbsv	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huacbsv/

Color DOES tell how much IR heat it absorbs.     "Absorption is when the light is absorbed by the object, like how black paint makes a room darker. Objects that absorb more light, and thus are better at absorbing and emitting IR and thus heat, are darker colors.        This means color is an important indicator of how much IR is being absorbed and emitted."

4uc8uyl9	Former submariner, here. I would love to see a reference for this. The most I’m aware of is 8 blades for submarine propellers. They do have a sweeping curved design that assists in efficiency, acoustics, and limiting cavitation; This makes it look like more than 8, for sure. There may be designs or prototypes for more blades, but I don’t think any are in use. Again, I would be interested in any references you have.	1643205813.0	hualzb4	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huakhyg	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hualzb4/
1km2sgeq	Disclaimer: Not an engineer  I would imagine it has to do with a combination of:  * The shape the prop blades need to take to actually generate thrust * The lateral force on the propeller blades moving through the air * The amount of space there is at the center of the propeller for attachment points of the blades.  At the outer edges of the prop, there is a lot of room, but near where the power is generated, a bunch of material needs to come together in a circle with much smaller diameter. As the number of props go up, the amount of material down there that is able to hold the blade to the rotor while still producing sufficient thrust.  Think of turbines in comparison. Usually WAY more blades, but they don't need to generate thrust from the air movement as that happens with more with compression and combustion. I'm sure there is a way more mathematical explanation for this, but I'm pretty sure this is the twenty thousand foot view of the answer (pun intended).	1643206151.0	huamq8a	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huaiaxo	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huamq8a/

jpaap	Drag goes up exponentially as an object approaches the speed of sound. So, it's not that prop tips can't exceed the speed of sound, it is that they become more and more inefficient. In military vehicles, performance is often times more important than efficiency in battle scenarios. Military vehicles care less about the massive efficiency loss and more about their ultimate performance.	1643207124.0	huaoy6j	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huak2ky	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huaoy6j/

In fact, I think there's only one obscure model to do that. Most self-launch and/or sustainer equipped gliders have a two-bladed prop, or a folding five-blade.

Those that did not, survived and passed on their genes.   But, what's surprising to me, is that they must have passed on their genes to everyone they conquered to a significant degree, but that gene didn't take I guess. Maybe it's recessive and got quickly watered down when introduced to a normal asian population with high lactose intolerance, when there is no motivating factor at work through natural selection.	1643309689.0	huh4a16	t3_sdt52s	t1_huh2r6d	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh4a16/

A better description from a neuroscience perspective would perhaps be Dopaminergic Pathway Dysregulation, as what’s actually affected on a neuronal level is the regulation of dopamine (and to a lesser extent other monoamine) levels in the synaptic cleft along with their uptake at the postsynaptic terminals, and in a wider sense it’s an impaired function of the mesolimbic system.

cdwhy	Most humans (about 68%) do not have the gene for lactase persistence; that’s what we call lactose intolerance. If you do not persist in producing lactase once becoming an adult, then the lactose from any milk you drink after becoming an adult remains intact in your gut and can cause flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea. Lactase persistence is weird and strange among mammals. Lactose intolerance in adults is normal. They’re opposites.  Studies done on ancient DNA and dental remains of Mongolians show that they did not have high rates of lactase persistence in their population—which is to say, they were genetically lactose intolerant—despite drinking milk often enough that it left deposits on their teeth in the form of dental calculus. So the question is: how did they come to drink so much milk when they did not produce the lactase necessary for them to digest lactose? This is an active area of research.	1643311635.0	huh9ld4	t3_sdt52s	t1_huh7c6c	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh9ld4/

my76u	That is NOT the defining characteristic of ADHD. It is a symptom. People with ADHD have the ability to hyper focus on things and enter flow states, but they don’t have much control over what it is that they focus on. It could be a video game, when they should be focusing on homework.  ADHD is caused by having a reduced level of dopamine in the brain. If you understand that, you will understand how it is that a situation that would overwhelm a neurotypical person would only bring an ADHD person to a baseline level of stimulation.  People with ADHD can focus very well in highly stimulating environments. It is not a disorder of focus, it is a disorder of dopamine.

udgj2	A proposed renaming of ADHD is Attention Dy(i)sregulation Hyperactivity Disorder because the current one has that mistaken connotation.    Regarding the attention part, an easy way to think of it is:    If you don't want to do it, they have a strong unconscious urge to not do it.    If you want to do it, they have a strong unconscious urge to do it.     This typically results   1. Avoiding doing things that are mundane, boring, annoying, or anxiety inducing. Typical things that 'normal' people would just "get it over with", can be debilitatingly difficult to do for someone with ADHD.   2. Pursuing highly stimulating behavior. This is subjective to the person and it can be something as innocuous as binging a media (books, videos, shows, games), or seeking some vice like drugs, gambling, etc. Since this can be compulsive and consume someone's attention, it can get quite dangerous.    The kicker is, even if you become aware or conscious of the issue, it's not as easy as just putting in more effort or trying harder, because **it's always there**.    Imagine having to think about breathing every time you need to breathe. Now, imagine having to do [X] push-ups every time you need to breathe.    The amount can vary by individual, but you can see how it can get exhausting.	1643316634.0	huhn5u8	t3_sdt52s	t1_huf24ju	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huhn5u8/

i5zr9	It depends on how far you want to go with you're ideal situation.  A) If there is gravity, then I think the end links would break first.   \- 1) If the chain is supported by only the hooks at each end and:  \-- a) If one hook is higher than the other, then the link at the higher hook will break first. It has the greatest force due to the weight of the chain.  \-- b) If the hooks are at the same height, then theoretically both end links will break at the same time (see below).  \- 2) If the chain is resting on a horizontal surface and:  \-- a) If only one end is pulled, then the link at the pulled end will beak first. The other links will have less tension because friction with the surface will reduce the tension slightly at each link.  \-- b) If both ends are pulled equally, then theoretically both end links will break at the same time (see below).  &#x200B;  Below:   Since you mentioned steel chain, when a sample of steel is tested in tension it will neck in one location before failure and then break here. See this video at around 3:28:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8U4G5kcpcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8U4G5kcpcM)  I think it's fair to say that even with a perfect starting sample, a neck will form in only one location. So, as long as the chain is stretched slowly (and is not too long, see next note), I don't think you could get a double break. Now if the chain is stretched rapidly, then the forces from acceleration come into play, and a double break should be possible.  Next Note: if the chain is very long and resting on a flat surface, then if you pull both ends, you could break both end links. A loooooong chain could have considerable friction with the surface. When the force at one end drops as that end fails, the force at the other end could could stay high due to the friction on the middle of the chain	1643325127.0	hui9j37	t3_sdaviz	t3_sdaviz	/r/askscience/comments/sdaviz/if_a_chain_of_perfectly_identical_links_is_pulled/hui9j37/

A guitar is constructed to resonate at certain frequencies, so while the shockwave will initially excite all kinds of frequencies in the guitar, only the resonant ones survive long enough for you to notice them.  BTW, this is kinda how a violin works. The bow doesn't know what note it should produce; all it does is scratch the string, which excites all kinds of frequencies. However, only the resonant ones survive, producing the familiar note.	1643342591.0	hujea9t	t3_segatx	t3_segatx	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/hujea9t/

89x6n8f8	To address the "Maxwell's Demon" part: solar cells are not 100% efficient. Inefficiencies in the solar panel convert sunlight to heat, so the solar panel heats up more than its surroundings as it generates electricity. The conversion to heat here means the creation of additional entropy; in particular, as long as the solar panel is less than roughly 86% efficient, the total entropy of the system is greater after this process than it began, despite any reduction in entropy that occurs in the distribution of electron velocity. So there's a thermodynamic limit to the efficiency of a solar panel.  In reality, accounting for other sources of inefficiency (spectrum losses, impedance mismatch, etc.), solar panels are only about 33% efficient (the Shockley-Queisser limit).  >Why can’t we just put a bunch of PN junctions between metals to preferentially send those free electrons in one direction for infinite energy when it obviously works in a solar panel?  Real PN junctions require an imposed potential difference to turn "on" even in the forward-biased direction, called the "knee voltage". For silicon diodes, this is about 0.7 volts, and for germanium diodes, this is roughly 0.3 volts. So, at zero applied voltage, no significant current flows.	1643394868.0	hum6g18	t3_se90th	t3_se90th	/r/askscience/comments/se90th/how_does_a_solar_panel_produce_useful_current/hum6g18/

1737wx	Yeah, honestly this sounds like some smear campaign stuff. The dairy industry in the US is subsidized by the government and there’s a lot of money to be made. There’s a reason why dairy companies have fought hard to prevent milk alternatives to even use the name milk. Same with the livestock industry battling over the term meat. When these industries are threatened they use “science” to try and defame or discredit the competition. It’s not unlikely that study was funded by the dairy industry. Just like when almond milk was gaining popularity there was quite a bit of fuss made about how much water it took to grow enough almonds for a glass of milk. It seemed like a lot and a complete waste of water but when compared to that of cows milk it was significantly less.	1643401541.0	humo6h2	t3_seybvk	t1_humn0by	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humo6h2/

n03o9	My first thought went to Glyphosate (aka the weed-killer used in Roundup), which is used in conventionally and organically grown oats.  There have been some papers linking glyphosate with reproductive health harm.  [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42860-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42860-0) (murine, 2019)  [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es404258h](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es404258h) (zebra fish, 2014)  But also lit reviews that show no effect:  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22202229/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22202229/) (humans, 2012)  \>An evaluation of this database found no consistent effects of glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or the developing offspring. Furthermore, no plausible mechanisms of action for such effects were elucidated. Although toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosate-based formulations, the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate exposure....In conclusion, the available literature shows no solid evidence linking glyphosate exposure to adverse developmental or reproductive effects at environmentally realistic exposure concentrations.  Hopefully someone who has done more research in this area can provide further elucidation.  I do know that glyphosate is a hot topic on natural news-type websites.	1643401622.0	humoe7y	t3_seybvk	t3_seybvk	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humoe7y/

137mjq	Well, transphobia is certainly a part of it, especially insofar as they don’t believe in the concept, but I’d say it’s primarily an extension of their profoundly misogynistic core beliefs.   They imagine that soy is feminizing, which is inherently bad, because anything feminine is bad. This is convenient, because it justifies their negative views on “weak” men, trans women (who they really believe are just weak, feminine men), and East Asian men who eat more soy than western men on average and are *of course*, small, small-penised and weak. As a big man who consumes animal products instead of soy, they’re more masculine, and, as an extension of that masculinity, explicitly better.  This is all a bit beside the point, though, because the fact is that consuming soy does not have any feminizing affect on humans, value judgments of the feminine aside.	1643401811.0	humovy8	t3_seybvk	t1_humn3yy	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humovy8/

(My house backs onto a small local park)   The red kite tried to steal a baby pigeon or full fledging, got ambushed midair by the flock and it all developed into a 4-way interspecies war - red kite vs a 3-species alliance of seagulls, pigeons, and some crows that were also in the park. They spent about an hour fighting in the air - it was like watching a WW1 dogfight or something from Star Wars. Eventually the pigeons and gulls dropped out but one set of crows kept harassing the red kite for several more hours.   Over the next few days the red kite eagle came back a few times hoping to score more tasty chicks but the crows would zoom from across the park every time and chase it off.

4gtyx	It's worth noting too that it's a really unique and subjective application of the concept of adapting.  Granted we often do change our behavior which is pretty normal adaptation (just like say... a bear might, we may switch from eating one food to another if it becomes scarce.   Clearly all the people who hunted wooly mammoths as a primary supply found something else to sustain them.     But another thing that is probably a bigger part of our success is we adapt our environment to fit us.  Sure other animals build dens and nest but we literally fully enclose buildings with basically their own climates.  We make clothes.  We make tools.  All of those are taking something that is intrinsically external and changing it to suit our needs which no animal does on a wide scale and only a few do on any notable level.   Hell I think if we ever actually ran onto another intelligent species from another planet that'd be the one surefire thing they had in common with us. They could look incredibly different, have wildly different biochemistry. Not even have DNA.  But at the end of it all if they were able to thrive in a fashion that allows us both to encounter and perceive each other, they will at some point have moved beyond living within their environment to fundamentally shaping it for their own needs.	1643402270.0	humq2we	t3_setbxv	t1_humog97	/r/askscience/comments/setbxv/which_animal_species_came_the_closest_to_going/humq2we/

olrw9	Yeah, the idea that soy increases the odds of breast cancer seems to be based on an old study where mice  experienced tumor growth after eating a large amount of soy isoflavine. This link was never established in humans, and it has since been shown that mice metabolize soy differently than humans, making any extrapolation to human ill-conceived (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192476/). To quote the conclusion, the difference in soy metabolism "...cast[s] doubt on the value of the use of these rodents for gaining insight into the effects of isoflavones in humans, especially with regard to the effects on breast tissue."  The link has been further debunked by follow-up studies, such as the one you posted. An excerpt of note from that study:  >Current evidence suggests that a diet high in soy may improve survival and lower the risk of recurrence in women with breast cancer.7-9 The benefits don’t appear limited to Asian populations either.  >One analysis combined data from three large, long-running studies of survivors from both Asian and Western countries. It found that women who ate at least 10 mg of soy per day after a breast cancer diagnosis had a 25 percent lower risk of recurrence compared to those eating less than 4 mg per day.9    >However, soy is not currently recommended as a way for breast cancer survivors to lower the risk of recurrence. There are still some open questions about these findings because the studies were looking at many different types of soy, and because women who regularly eat soy simply tend to be healthier than those who don’t.9”	1643402632.0	humr0x6	t3_seybvk	t1_humnl7m	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humr0x6/
13d22d	Lots of nondairy milks contain “bad for you” ingredients. I really like the brand Three Trees. They have a variety of flavors but their Oat seed milk doesn’t contain any glyphosate. Their ingredients are simple: Filtered water, organic gluten-free oats, organic sunflower seeds, organic pumpkin seeds, organic flax seeds It’s also super creamy and froths well. I highly recommend this brand if you have concerns about all the additives in your oat milk.	1643402645.0	humr24a	t3_seybvk	t3_seybvk	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humr24a/

q07lz	> They imagine that soy is feminizing, which is inherently bad  For some people this may be true. However, it can be undesirable simply because you're comfortable with who you are and how your body works already. In that case *any* change that is unwanted can be bad. Equally, there are compounds that have a masculinizing effect on people and there are those who don't want to become more masculine and who would be worried about *that* effect.  It's a good thing to learn and understand what compounds can do to your body but we should also look at the information critically and try to judge if the effects are likely to be major ones. From what I understand, the effects of soy are fairly minor — if there are any measurable ones at all.	1643403057.0	hums4qi	t3_seybvk	t1_humovy8	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hums4qi/

We've tried *really* hard to get a glyphosate "aha." We haven't. That's not a conspiracy and it doesn't mean we shouldn't stop looking, but at this point glyphosate ironically has one of the most evidence-supported safety profiles in agriculture by virtue of all the scrutiny it's received.  Monsanto was a ruthless company. It's part of Bayer now. That doesn't mean despicable business practices translate into the science being bad.

What I learnt was that phytoestrogens are good for people whose estrogen is too high, because some receptors will get filled with weak phytoestrogens. I know some scientists believe that phytoestrogens should be avoided in those groups of people.   I’m interested in research saying there's no effect. I've been told to avoid soy because it's GMO and sprayed with glyphosate.

xtenz	This may be true, but it doesn’t chemically alter the juice, which is what is being suggested with the oat milk. Drinking orange juice is only worse for you than eating those oranges because you don’t consume all the fiber and you feel less full, so you’re more likely to just consume more calories. The same is likely true with oat milk, too. You don’t get the fiber, but it doesn’t chemically alter what remains.	1643404509.0	humvvvq	t3_seybvk	t1_humudjg	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humvvvq/

hjydf	You don’t consume the fiber and it is far easier to consume a larger quantity of the fructose without the filling effects of the fiber or the slowing effects the fiber has on the digestion of that sugar.   Oats contain phytic acid, lectins and avenin. These are anti-nutrients. How much more of those are you getting from a cup of oat milk than a cup of oatmeal? Again, I do not know if oat milk is bad for you, my point is that it absolutely could be, even if oats weren’t. This is all an academic exercise for me, because I DO believe that eating oats is unhealthy, but that’s unrelated to the logical failure I was trying to respond to initially (the idea that if oats are healthy it must follow that there is nothing unhealthy about oat milk).	1643404953.0	humx1hq	t3_seybvk	t1_humvvvq	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humx1hq/

r4y5o	>Although toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosate-based formulations, the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate exposure.  This is the problem with research on compounds like Roundup. While glyphosate in total isolation can be studied and declared safe, it is not used in the real world in isolation. The formula of Roundup is proprietary, so other ingredients may be affecting people, or interacting with glyphosate in a way that changes its chemical interactions and effects.  It's like studies of nicotine vs. tobacco. A study might find that nicotine didn't cause lung cancer, and the very human mental shortcut that associates nicotine with tobacco would infer the same outcomes for tobacco.   That kind of language is scientifically precise, but can be used by marketing and pr people to confuse and distract.  In short, it is possible that glyphosate is 100% safe for reproductive function, but for a brand-name herbicide which contains that ingredient to have dangerous effects on reproductive function.	1643406408.0	hun0rl7	t3_seybvk	t1_humoe7y	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun0rl7/

To date, there is no conclusive study showing eating soy has any impact on the human body from the phytoestrogens.	1643406415.0	hun0s7l	t3_seybvk	t1_humvtm6	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun0s7l/

113jc3	I’ve heard many times from sources I semi trust (though I don’t remember where sadly) that it contains a chemical similar enough to estrogen that your body processes it as such but it’s only a problem if you eat a lot of soy products. You’re telling me I got bamboozled?	1643406694.0	hun1hsz	t3_seybvk	t1_humzk3k	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun1hsz/
ze6r5	The answer to your question is because there's no evidence that it is dangerous, to either women or men. Any concern about pesticides would apply to many more crops than just oat.	1643406732.0	hun1lde	t3_seybvk	t1_humvsxj	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun1lde/
15w9f9	I don't think anyone is saying that. Soy does contain high amounts of phytoestrogens, which do seem to have some effect on human health, though probably not significant.	1643406774.0	hun1p5z	t3_seybvk	t1_humzk3k	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun1p5z/

5k4d2v21	That is simply not accurate. According to this letter from EPA scientists, it is used on 298 million acres of crops in US.  We have about 896 million crop acres total- that is 33% of crops treated with this chemical. Not 3%. Not commenting on safety etc- just common usage.

3wtih	Soy does contain phytoestrogens. But not in quantities that are going to affect you unless you're drinking litres of the stuff per day.   The evidence of what would happen with a high enough dose is also limited. E.g. does it trigger or just block the estrogen receptor.   And, typically, this whole argument ignores the amount of actual, mammalian, estrogen that is in cows milk.	1643406847.0	hun1w0s	t3_seybvk	t1_hun1hsz	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun1w0s/

feqz1	You're correct. Soy has estrogenic compounds. The tests where it was actually found to have significant effects on reproduction were done on mice fed literally nothing but soy for multiple generations. It's almost certainly not harmful to humans in the quantities people actually consume.	1643407405.0	hun3azd	t3_seybvk	t1_hun1hsz	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun3azd/
io46rim	Generally if you used the pesticide according to the product label and adhered to certified applicators guidance then you should be okay regardless of the type of pesticide.

6u88o	Soy absolutely promotes estrogen production, that's pretty well studied. Doesn't lower testosterone, only increases estrogen, which can throw off your levels. The effect is usually very minimal.	1643407542.0	hun3nne	t3_seybvk	t1_humzk3k	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun3nne/
