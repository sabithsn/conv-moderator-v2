ja1ys	When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself.

Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.

ocfkrx5	Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	1640883951.0	hqkek1y	t3_rs5386	t3_rs5386	/r/Conservative/comments/rs5386/is_the_covid_vaccine_causing_the_virus_to_mutate/hqkek1y/

4deig	Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	1640884421.0	hqkfsmx	t3_rs2a6g	t1_hqkdmd7	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2a6g/teachers_school_permanently_cancelled_after_wolf/hqkfsmx/

I feel like the only conservative left and the rest of you are posers.  The fact that any of you disagree with me about children being hurt is frankly very concerning.

It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	1640908800.0	hqm5zfc	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hqka0aa	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hqm5zfc/

41zh15ba	There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	1640915594.0	hqmloyy	t3_rsb7fw	t1_hqmjhlc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqmloyy/

Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes.

Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	1640928277.0	hqnbu85	t3_rsb7fw	t1_hqmaz7p	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqnbu85/

We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children	1640954564.0	hqoc1da	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqnjdqq	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqoc1da/

3yowjutx	Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	1640962327.0	hqoq6vm	t3_rsr767	t1_hqongi0	/r/Conservative/comments/rsr767/more_than_200_marines_have_been_discharged_from/hqoq6vm/

jnab5	The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.

I'm glad that the people from Germany and the Netherlands treat each other like good friends and don't hold onto the past.

First work on lowering the amount of school shootings, armed robberies, police brutality, gang violence, gun misshaps (children getting their hands on a gun) by at least taking away guns from people, or by improving living conditions so that people don't feel forced to steal  and getting cops an actual education so they won't act like some damn triggerhappy gunman.	1640968980.0	hqp5itl	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqopt9z	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqp5itl/

So, dash cams would be good, but this seems even less intrusive, since it’s not recording YOU, and less hassle, since it’s built into the car.	1640969031.0	hqp5n7i	t3_rsxf3z	t1_hqp59hh	/r/Conservative/comments/rsxf3z/always_watching_new_car_models_sold_in_the_eu/hqp5n7i/

v4d0r	Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	1640969577.0	hqp6ztu	t3_rsx714	t1_hqp67xv	/r/Conservative/comments/rsx714/california_facing_huge_coronavirus_surge_despite/hqp6ztu/

3k7lj	And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	1640975460.0	hqplir0	t3_rswl23	t1_hqp8ldp	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqplir0/

10l2gu	Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	1640976448.0	hqpnxin	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqpjcly	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqpnxin/

I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	1640984773.0	hqq7tei	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqq6uis	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqq7tei/

1ijqxzo1	Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	1640996485.0	hqqxq4v	t3_rsz1on	t3_rsz1on	/r/Conservative/comments/rsz1on/leftist_hypocrisy_never_fails_to_disappoint/hqqxq4v/

97sysua4	Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

Then conveniently despite affidavits by election workers witnessing fraud in every metropolitan city, challenges of the 2020 election where all dismissed by the courts.   It’s funny how Black Lives Matter can encircle the White House, actually charge the capital building and vandalize it, and not one mention of domestic terrorism or insurrection made by this current regime. Most of the pro Trump protestors who entered the capital building where peaceful. Ashli Babbitt was a veteran and did more for this country than the little Antifa bitches ever have done. She was allowed into the capital building, was unarmed, and was shot by some goon cop all of the sudden the libs are praising after bitching about the cops in every controversial police shooting.	1641016364.0	hqrzp1e	t3_rta54r	t1_hqrjuuv	/r/Conservative/comments/rta54r/documentary_drops_inconvenient_truths_on_the_jan/hqrzp1e/

Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead.

Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	1641025880.0	hqscmti	t3_rt81tm	t1_hqsbtm8	/r/Conservative/comments/rt81tm/abortion_leading_global_cause_of_death_in_2021/hqscmti/

6reyf	*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	1641144332.0	hqyew7b	t3_rubpjb	t1_hqyeac4	/r/Conservative/comments/rubpjb/marjorie_taylor_greenes_personal_twitter_account/hqyew7b/

As a liberal, I fully agree with you that we should make social media a public utility and have a full government take over.	1641148639.0	hqyqfmg	t3_rubpjb	t1_hqy5dgv	/r/Conservative/comments/rubpjb/marjorie_taylor_greenes_personal_twitter_account/hqyqfmg/

2i647xg1	Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket.

It is the right of sovereign countries to determine who enters, and under what circumstances.   But I understand you’re keen to change the subject and talk Covid.	1641177390.0	hr0rybx	t3_runb02	t1_hr0qw6k	/r/Conservative/comments/runb02/liz_cheney_gives_the_game_away_when_she_reveals/hr0rybx/
o3d7y3o	https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-data-vaccinated-people-do-not-carry-covid-19-2021-3?op=1  > During an MSNBC interview with Rachel Maddow on Monday, Walensky said: "Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick, and that it's not just in the clinical trials, but it's also in real-world data."  I’d like to agree with you, but earlier this year there were hundreds of articles touting this information. The narrative changes everyday sadly.	1641177420.0	hr0s10v	t3_rswl23	t1_hqpcdz1	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hr0s10v/

Especially because here I’m actually advocating a conservative, risk-averse position... and one I share with ALL of my conservative family members.]	1641208501.0	hr270ou	t3_rug9up	t1_hr0jhf4	/r/Conservative/comments/rug9up/biden_signs_137_million_deal_for_covid_test_strip/hr270ou/

I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	1642531418.0	ht7l8vq	t3_s6ylb4	t1_ht7fqxp	/r/Conservative/comments/s6ylb4/reddit_leftists_go_to_guide/ht7l8vq/

But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself.

When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.

16j64h	Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.

e8kgkot	>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	1642540155.0	ht88z4n	t3_s6mcgc	t1_ht84p08	/r/Conservative/comments/s6mcgc/i_have_a_dream_that_my_four_little_children_will/ht88z4n/

23lhp1yt	This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	1642540649.0	ht8abw3	t3_s766uk	t1_ht85el6	/r/Conservative/comments/s766uk/who_did_it/ht8abw3/

It is a tolerable compromise to ensure that Americans who are often quite literally on the other side of the planet have a say in their government.

Lol "it's a whole other thing" just admit you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Also stop projecting, it's annoying as fuck. I listed 4 things with taxation being one of them. We have one of THE most progressive tax systems in the world which by definition is socialist (taking more from some to provide benefits to all). If you want to talk about implementing a non socialist flat tax system I'm al ears. Otherwise I think I'm done chatting since you obviously don't even know what they thing you're promoting is  Edit: and no that is not the only form of socialism. It's redistribution of wealth.

dzsbz	The Republicans have undergone their reformation (Trump), but still have a number of hold-outs (Kinzinger, Cheney, etc) who need to go. Trump steeled the party...forcing them, IMO, to get back to the basics of America First...and subsequent policies to make sure that happens.      That said, the Left is masterful at branding: and post-Trump, most who identify as a conservative/Republican are an anathema. Sad, but true.  Feeling good about that swing of 14% is a great way to settle into a false sense of security. Biden gave us the gift of allowing EVERYone to see his policy v. Trump's policy prescriptions:  the results from undoing Trump's are palpable.

I agree everyone who voted for it should be primaried.     **That said, the title is absolutely fake news**. Nothing about the law requires a "kill switch." It doesn't specify implementation details at all.

What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not?

If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they’re actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they’re saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers.

96uj9	Couldn’t the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven’t had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I’m going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don’t see it because we don’t have transparency on either side. It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side.   It’s not about POLITICIANS, it’s about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can’t let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They’re all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	1642622557.0	htd0v56	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htczgr0	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd0v56/
96uj9	We just don’t see it, or hear it, because we don’t talk specifically about those people who are doing it. We say “the leftists” or “the democrats”, not the looters.   Just like democrats say “the republicans that stormed the capitol”. Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.   We need to stop arguing with each other (not saying you and I are, generally) and get on the same page that there are assholes on both sides that we - as a people - need to work on bettering our own parties.   It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side. We all need to do better.   We need to get dirty money and stocks out of politics. There would be a big swing, in both parties, if this were to happen. They would care a lot more about the people that build this nation instead of the companies.    We need to stand up to OUR OWN party leaders and say “hey - I agree with you on X, y, and X, but we really need to rework how you think about a and b”. It’s disgusting that we as a people have so little say, or are ignored in what our views our. Currently, we HAVE to match what our leaders say.	1642622935.0	htd1vw8	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htcxips	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd1vw8/

96uj9	Yeah this isn’t even going to go anywhere. You can’t even say that those people are not republicans, or if they are self-proclaimed and you don’t agree with him.   THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. Not politicians - us. You just said the media is the biggest problem, and that’s all trump used to communicate - Twitter. Twitter is just another form of media.   And a tweet that simply says “go home”, when none of those people are on their phone and distracted is useless. Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted “go home”, they would have listened?   Again, our problem is that WE don’t stop ourselves (citizens) or believe we need to.

cvsrv	I mean yea, I fully support any gun ownership as long as gun laws are super strict. Preferably some training for anything bigger than some pistols but mainly a register of what guns are where, crackdowns on loophole selling etc. Stricter laws the bigger the gun gets but not things like financial restrictions or time based, it still has to be possible to get guns if you really want something bigger.	1642624819.0	htd6ywn	t3_s7obiw	t1_htd56w2	/r/Conservative/comments/s7obiw/manchin_we_already_have_laws_to_ensure_people/htd6ywn/
96uj9	Why do you vote for politicians, like [DeSantis, who wanted to let cane sugar companies grow near the Everglades](https://www.everglades.org/desantis-chose-sugar-over-floridians/) that are continuing to dissipate? He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	1642624844.0	htd71ec	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htd52bd	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd71ec/

96uj9	Can I ask, and be honest, do you agree with EVERYTHING that Trump did throughout their presidency? Do you think he took the right approach most of the time?   In primaries, I did not vote for them. When it came to trump vs Biden - I did vote for them because I’m general I favor democratic views. I think both sides have benefits and flaws to them, but it’s a shame we vote on persons vs policies. Our system is broke.   Unfortunately we do not live in a democracy anymore. If republicans are our leaders, it’s a Republican agenda for 4 years. If Democrats are our leaders, it’s a Democratic agenda. Why can we not find common ground on topics?

96uj9	So on that same side, do you think there were no republicans that utilized the rioting and looting for their own benefit? Or exacerbated it?   Again, those people that were at the capitol and looters are not democrats or republicans. They’re anarchists. They’re terrorists. And they’re people that do not know how to handle situations rationally.

96uj9	You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game. It’s hard to go back and find tweets that aren’t in the news, but I’m sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	1642625832.0	htd9qjg	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htd6e4g	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd9qjg/

96uj9	I’ll donate $20 to the [Animal Welfare Institute](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/best-animal-charities/) (who is one of the highest rated charities worldwide) if you can name 50% of the party this is cooperating,excluding Liz Cheney, who has always supported it participating than yes. I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it’s non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying “all” was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that’s just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they’ll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It’s okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I’ll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	1642626898.0	htdcnjt	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htd9fav	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htdcnjt/

Or we will just see pipes burst and vote counting "stopped" long enough to get the watchers out of the building so new Democrat ballots can be pulled from a sketchy vans at 3am.	1642703919.0	hthq527	t3_s8ikcb	t1_htgnytv	/r/Conservative/comments/s8ikcb/cnns_dana_bash_jarring_to_hear_biden_say_2022/hthq527/

I'm worn out from so many people around me living their life as "do as I say not as I do". So many conservative veterans are out voluntarily ruining their lives for a rich kid who dodged the military but feels like he's a leader. For goodness sake Fox News won a definition case simply by claiming Tucker Carlson never states actual facts and is instead engaging in ' exaggeration ' and non literal commentary.

If they can censor *opinions*, they are no longer acting in the best interests of all people and are instead being weaponized as tools of those in power. That is not okay.  While we're at it, how about that $400 billion in tax payer money that companies received to build the internet as a public utility? What ever happened there?  Privatized gains and socialized losses.

1ebgiraa	Lol, don’t worry, 81 million people didn’t vote for Biden he just got 81 million “votes” from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you’ll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they’ll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don’t see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the “worst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics” even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you’re a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you’re constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	1642743708.0	htkazbt	t3_s92e33	t1_htk5o89	/r/Conservative/comments/s92e33/make_congress_great_again_imagine_a_republican/htkazbt/

fsosoups	It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately. I’m a conservative leaning independent and I think a lot of the Covid stuff is bs, but this was full of bullshit dude. Just telling you that this is like the left saying “all the children are on vents” “ gunshots can’t be treated too many ivermectin ods!!”.	1642776455.0	htlqhto	t3_s8v6pb	t1_htjefpt	/r/Conservative/comments/s8v6pb/scheduled_for_execution_unvaxxed_covid_patient/htlqhto/

80w74qh9	Trump made repeated swipes at DeSantis in his interview with OANN(which is propagandist garbage, but the video interviews are at least useful).   He's basically backtracking and gaslighting people on the subject now.   After his repeated flip-flopping and backpeddling, let's not beat around the bush here,   Trump is a coward and doesn't want to make waves when it's politically inconvenient *for him*, especially since DeSantis has broad support among his base as well as actual conservatives who do not support Trump anymore or never did in the first place.   Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	1642825060.0	htp7xz4	t3_s9e8b5	t1_htogmaj	/r/Conservative/comments/s9e8b5/trump_my_beef_with_desantis_is_totally_fake_news/htp7xz4/

From the article the author pasted in this article: Boosted vs unvaccinated isn’t even close. Boosted death rate is under 0.5 per 100,000 for all weeks displayed, while unvaccinated ranges between 1.7 and 7.6 per 100,000. That’s somewhere between 3 times and 15 times the risk of death to be unvaccinated.

Ignoring the obvious (rape etc.), it makes absolutely zero sense to compel a woman to carry to term.

hck4f6vo	It’s difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense.

hck4f6vo	Right, so by you’re logic you’re quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can’t support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it’s acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It’s the ‘parents responsibility’ to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they’ll suddenly ‘get it’ and do a good job… but they’re not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	1642865579.0	htr3m6h	t3_s9yyhq	t1_htr1csc	/r/Conservative/comments/s9yyhq/governors_of_fl_and_va_tweets_out_their_support/htr3m6h/

hck4f6vo	So I’m presuming you support policies that help mothers/fathers provide the best possible car for the child once it is born? I presume you’d fully support welfare and childcare resources for those who cannot meet the needs of the child all by themselves? Or is it some binary thing of “alive or dead” where quality of that life means fuck all?  If you fully support the above, then we may disagree but I could see your stance. If you’re of the view that the parents are on their own once the child is born, then you’re not pro life at all, you’re pro control and don’t care about welfare of the child at all.	1642865811.0	htr460d	t3_s9yyhq	t1_htr3loz	/r/Conservative/comments/s9yyhq/governors_of_fl_and_va_tweets_out_their_support/htr460d/

26i4wezq	Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.	1642870627.0	htrfylz	t3_sa5wzj	t3_sa5wzj	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htrfylz/

f9qfu	 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	1642885253.0	htsgwl5	t3_sa5wzj	t1_htrqxn3	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htsgwl5/

73pe89ba	Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	1642887419.0	htsm85y	t3_sa5wzj	t1_hts7yem	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htsm85y/

Followed up with something along the lines of:   "I will not call them by the gender they say they are, but I will respect them as a person and only attack their opinions." - unless there's a genuine reason to attack them as a person (Ex: Demi and Alok)   "I will call them by gender they say they are out of respect, but that doesn't mean I have to believe it."	1642888485.0	htsoutm	t3_saa9vy	t1_htsmms0	/r/Conservative/comments/saa9vy/what_is_a_woman_controversy_after_dr_phil_puts/htsoutm/

Doctors visits with no insurance or bad insurance are very high priced, vitamins, baby supplies etc even on the cheapest most generic you can find adds up to a lot of money. The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child. Pregnancy care is child care and only having a man pay child support after a birth still ends up putting a woman in financial trouble.	1642889243.0	htsqq39	t3_sa5wzj	t1_htrbv77	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htsqq39/

8fyn1am	When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.	1642921808.0	htuqjn2	t3_saimuf	t1_htupupg	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htuqjn2/

8fyn1am	Is it extremely small compared to the one life?  My math is back of napkin, but there's \~300 million people in the US, so to "balance" the 100% of 1 you only need \~0.0000000003%(1/300,000,000). And the one guy in who's body Omicron developed affected pretty much the entire planet - which is 1/7.9 billion.   I haven't really done the math, but the point is - since the virus affects all other humans, compared to one life you only need to move the needle an extremely small amount.  And also - even if it's an extremely small chance - it's no longer "between me and God". Other humans are definitely involved.	1642923213.0	htusjqc	t3_saimuf	t1_hturk29	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htusjqc/

8fyn1am	So what...the 5 million who died from COVID aren't significant enough?  Roe happened in 1973. It's been 49 years. That means on average we see 1.29 million deaths per year from abortions.  COVID has been around for 2 years and we've seen 5m deaths.  That's 2.5m per year.  You're going to get the vaccine now, right?	1642926883.0	htuxhqc	t3_saimuf	t1_htuwot2	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htuxhqc/
ibf4x	Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it’s very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It’s a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you’re sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you’re worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn’t that also change the probability of killing someone?	1642927858.0	htuyr34	t3_saimuf	t1_htusjqc	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htuyr34/

8fyn1am	It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.	1642929675.0	htv12ql	t3_saimuf	t1_htuyr34	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htv12ql/

8fyn1am	First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	1642932554.0	htv4q4n	t3_saimuf	t1_htv20f2	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htv4q4n/

We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.

A lot of the people in anti-work did do trade school.***     Most jobs nowadays requires bachelors, or 5-10 years of experience in a trade to even make some semblance of a living.     \---     I've calculated different jobs for myself, and all of them end up work 40 hours/week 5-6 days a week for the next 40-50 year, then retire on <3,000/month. **If I get a bachelors, or go back to trade school for a better trade, I can do it slightly faster & maybe go on vacation once a year.**     That's not living, that's slavery. Even if we have the best working conditions, it doesn't mean it's a good thing. ***Another's trash is another mans' treasure, but it'll always be trash to someone.***     In this case? It's a trash system to many.	1642954057.0	htw5vso	t3_satdtp	t1_htw0nus	/r/Conservative/comments/satdtp/experts_warn_a_marxist_revolution_is_under_way_in/htw5vso/

Or everyone’s blatant fear of COVID makes them contract it. Iv been around so many COVID positive people, and still haven’t gotten it. I haven’t taken an antibody test yet, but if I have antibodies, I must of been asymptomatic.

c7skv	The problem is, the high skill & high wage jobs are like this.     ***"Specialization in a trade that is in high demand will yield superior wages."***     ***That's the biggest lie you probably tell yourself.*** A masters plumber should make 25-35$+/hour, but they can barely make more than an apprentice at ***<20$. Maybe above 12$/hour if they are lucky.***     A mechanic won't make more than a beginner mechanic unless they can snipe the good paying job from the couple lead mechanic positions in an autobody shop.      Even college kids, and trade skillers who spent 5-10 years training, and learning aren't guaranteed a decent paying job with a decent workplace.     A computer technician, programmer, etc needs a bachelors, and 2-5 years of experience just to get started in the field. **OR** they could go the apprenticeship route, and make less than minimum wage for 2-5 years just to get the experience needed, and even then they aren't guaranteed the job they need to put food on the table for one.     With Inflation, jobs paying <20 for unskilled labor even when said labor can lead to 5day 9hour work weeks where you break your back to just live.     You need a minimum of 20-25$/hour just to live beyond eating well everyday, and paying utilities.     \---     You can't make it well for yourself in todays economy. It's not an Obama, Trump, or Biden thing. It's a 60,70s, and 80s problem that caused this. It is not a republican, or democrat problem. It's an American problem.     ***Minimum Wage needs to be 25-30 dollars just to live, and anything less than 45$/hour you need to work 30-40 hours/week, 60+ years of your life, then you can retire.***     Yes, this is America & you could make something of it. Most of the time? You won't be able to cause you're making 20-25$/hour just to make ends meet by yourself.	1642960768.0	htwn91l	t3_satdtp	t1_htw7lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/satdtp/experts_warn_a_marxist_revolution_is_under_way_in/htwn91l/

Not to mention,   > Domestic violence is more common than any other health problem among women during pregnancy.   https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy  I sincerely hope I don’t get banned for posting this link. I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.	1642981870.0	hty62ig	t3_sb2o9b	t3_sb2o9b	/r/Conservative/comments/sb2o9b/being_prochoice_is_really_just_being_prolife/hty62ig/

57g1vzpi	Yes, why would somebody blame Trump for helping to try to overturn an election when he told people that the election was rigged and falsely claiming that Mike Pence could overturn the election on 1/6 if he just ignored the will of the voters. /s He was literally the one who brought them there by pedaling bullshit. According to testimony he actually intended to go to the capital and didn't because the Secret Service told him they wouldn't be able to protect him. He only managed his "we love you. stand down" bullshit after a great deal of pressuring by others including his daughter and he still wasn't the one to request reinforcements.

57g1vzpi	It took forever to actually get a response for the problem and the President of the United States wasn't ever even who called for reinforcements. Apparently getting him to provide his half-assed message to tell his own followers to leave the capital was its own project that required a great deal of pressure. This shouldn't need to be said, but just because somebody acts like a dictator doesn't mean they're a rolemodel.	1643049620.0	hu1vr1r	t3_sbl7op	t1_hu0wufk	/r/Conservative/comments/sbl7op/trump_if_pelosi_had_not_turned_down_soldiers/hu1vr1r/

I don’t understand why you don’t see that as particularly heinous.

a9fcj2	Let’s be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what “side” they’re on. So don’t try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I’m not.   But you’re trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn’t be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn’t clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to “protest” a “stolen” election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	1643051440.0	hu20n7j	t3_sblwzu	t1_hu1saek	/r/Conservative/comments/sblwzu/after_brutalizing_trump_for_doubting_elections/hu20n7j/

So you'll make a ton of men financially responsible over an accusation, one that will take 9 months to prove.  This is going to be abused to hell and back, with seemingly no course for action for when the wrong man is held accountable.   A better bill would have been the inverse; if a woman can choose to medically abort a child, the male should be able to choose to financially abort.   The problem with broken families in America is the fact that the US Government financially incentives women to split from the father of their child. This new bill actually enforces that concept.

This is why it stops over time, since the protein stresses the body out (inflammation of the heart, and other reported side effects). The biggest thing though is that the vaccine creates no B and T cells. These cells identify infection and recall the best immuno response to fight it.   Natural immunity creates these cells, which is why it's better than any vaccine available for much longer.  The vaccines may help the elderly, obese and those with comorbidities a bit from initial infection, but for the younger and healthy it's not that necessary.	1642948532.0	htvt067	t3_satf72	t1_htvoxtc	/r/Conservative/comments/satf72/cdc_natural_immunity_offered_stronger_protection/htvt067/

Their media will report that racist voting laws are suppressing minority votes which is why republicans won, so it’s not a legitimate victory…as they sit there and tell us to accept results of 2020 elections and don’t you dare question that.

9lgrfix3	I don't understand the title of this post. How is it that pro choice is equivalent to pro-life about one person. If you are pro-life about one person, then that means that you believe one person should not have the choice to have an abortion.

Carhartt doesn’t have a policy where you can have Covid, but if your symptoms are low then you can come to work.

Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it’s future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	1642976647.0	htxsd2e	t3_sb2o9b	t1_htx9ec6	/r/Conservative/comments/sb2o9b/being_prochoice_is_really_just_being_prolife/htxsd2e/

bd7qe	Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).    But we're not allowed.  It's either or.  Those who have the time to adhere to ideologically pure positions (ie the unemployable or young) will dominate the discourse without wisdom to intervene and put its foot down and say to each side "you're wrong on this but right on this" and the "you're right on this but wrong on this".	1642978733.0	htxxvef	t3_sb4keg	t3_sb4keg	/r/Conservative/comments/sb4keg/carhartt_faces_boycott_after_keeping_covid/htxxvef/

After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...   And no one can ever tell me with certainty that there so many rapes or incestuous relationships in this country.  The numbers don't add up.  Abortion is a true failure of American values.

I hope plugging subreddits are allowed in this sub…   Anyway, I noticed that you may be conservative leaning since you lurk on this sub, yet aren’t afraid to question the legitimacy of particular things. Not everyone has to agree with everything a political affiliation just says, and it is very important for us to freely state opinions or ask questions regarding particular worldly topics.  r/ComplexPeople promotes the idea that people are complex and are able to share viewpoints from multiple political parties. It promotes free thought and respectful debate or discussion between those who may agree with you and those who do not. Being condescending is not allowed, and members must conduct themselves professionally. The sub is aimed to help rational minded people effectively learn of each others viewpoints and live harmoniously regardless if viewpoints are opposed. If you’re interested in these sentiments, I would love for you to join to help make Reddit and this world a better place!  PS: I apologize for the shameless copy and pasting.

l147t	Big Pharma lobbying against weed is based on 100% bullshit.    They don't care about recreational marijuana use.  Their issue is with people who sell medical marijuana using unscientific claims.  Big Pharma complains about herbal supplements, snake oil, holistic medicine.  They have to spend money and pay the US government to make their medicine prescribable by doctors. They have companies like Amway.  Medical marijuana industry wants more lax FDA regulation than Big Pharma gets.  Their issue is not with weed but with the herbal supplement and vitamin market, giving weed products FDA medical labels without the years of research to back them.   They don't care about recreational marijuana use, they welcome it.  It will creates more customers for them in the long run.  From what I've heard they lobby in favor of recreational marijuana deregulation because they think it will make the medical marijuana lobby go away.	1643162594.0	hu8lb8g	t3_sck72i	t1_hu8ic15	/r/Conservative/comments/sck72i/amazon_endorses_gop_bill_that_would_legalize/hu8lb8g/

g4qjl	> At the time of the transactions, congress was scrambling to put together the CARES Act, a monumental emergency relief package that cost more than $2 trillion, and which Crenshaw supported. The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.  None of this was behind closed doors. Most of it was index fund ETFs which I was told was supposed to be the only allowable investment by this sub, and the rest of it was after the completely public bill text was unsurprisingly passed.  What a bullshit hit piece. It's talking about the ROI on 6 individual trades not his actual portfolio.  > But in late April, the manufacturer passed on the deal, opting instead to raise $25 billion in private investment thanks to moves that the Federal Reserve made independently of the CARES Act. The day that Crenshaw bought Boeing, markets snapped their brief positive burst, and the company led the boards that day in losses. His investment has now grown more than 38%.  The S&P ETFs he bought way out performed this purchase by nearly double. After BA opted for private funding rather than the offered public funding.  What exactly did he do wrong and should be outlawed? Not including that he filed the disclosure extremely late, obviously. But you're acting like this is the poster child of why congress shouldn't be allowed to hold  stock when it's pretty blatantly not.  https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-rep-dan-crenshaw-decided-the-covid-19-pandemic-was-the-perfect-time-to-buy-and-not-disclose-stocks	1643164002.0	hu8onkq	t3_sciv25	t1_hu6xlwb	/r/Conservative/comments/sciv25/dan_crenshaws_stock_trading_yielded_the_fifth/hu8onkq/

dv8o48ob	Answer:👇  Sadly, it’s the West that’s been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia’s doorstep.  Putin hasn’t been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It’s been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What’s happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‘RESPONDED’ by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets’ military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America’s nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn’t having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn’t fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we’re a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.👇  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	1643175525.0	hu9cxdt	t3_scwc3n	t3_scwc3n	/r/Conservative/comments/scwc3n/ukraine_says_destabilization_fueled_by_biden/hu9cxdt/

clgjjqo2	Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.  A lot of the Battleground States had their legislators pass laws that said the mail-in ballots could not be counted until after in-person voting head finished. Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.	1643177655.0	hu9ghu4	t3_scmdxg	t1_hu9fodr	/r/Conservative/comments/scmdxg/breaking_georgia_officials_tampered_with_and/hu9ghu4/

In many cases though, leftist males, night after night, browse grindr for self degregating anonymous anal sex with strangers day, after day, night after night.

That way whoever is VP would be able to run 2 more times for a total of 10 years, but then they picked Harris as the VP who is super unlikeable.

Yeah there are people on there who don’t want to work and be supported but the idea is to. work at a job that is not soul crushing and that you can support yourself on.

Your concerns are legitimate in a few scenarios, however they took those talkings points and used them as a spearhead to accomplish the goal of not working at all or barely at all while screaming for more free shit.

3y269	I mean, in reality I'm sure he has a team of people who are better qualified to make that call. I doubt any one president has been like "oh yes, I'm going to select this judge in particular for the supreme court." Biden especially at his age probably has his cabinet taking the reigns moreso than others.  Everyone has their own political beliefs, but judges get where they are because they're able to make decisions where the interpretation of the constitution and laws can be thoroughly explained.  Unless of course you are saying that simply because he's a democrat, in which case I would ask that you try to be a little more open minded, as the dismissal of others simply due to political affiliation isn't really helping anyone.	1643239810.0	hud5yza	t3_sdfv9r	t1_hud22my	/r/Conservative/comments/sdfv9r/psaki_says_biden_stands_by_promise_to_nominate/hud5yza/

Really the fact that the person's face is angry makes the comic even more of a mess. Unless the intent is to day "you'll turn on it too," but the asking of the question it makes them sound like they're still hoping for it.

4cmgicwx	Some facts about Denmark.  -  84% Healthcare system is funded by tax dollars. The other 16% comes from patient co-pays.  -Denmark spends roughly 10% of it's GDP on healthcare. Life expectancy in Denmark is 80.8 years and achieves an infant mortality rate of 3.2 per 1k births. Compared to US which spends about 17% of GDP and receives life expectancy of 78.8 and an infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1k births.  - Denmark has a population of roughly 6 million. 80% of which has received 2 atleast vaccine doses.

4cmgicwx	Just to give some perspective; Sweden is a welfare state with tax-payer-funded, universal healthcare.    73% of their population has chosen to get fully vaccinated. Which is about 10% more than the US.  Their population is about 11 million that live in a land area of 174,000 sqmi. This means they have a population similar to of Ohio in an area about the size of California. Their population density is almost half that of the US (57 per sqmi vs.92)  There's no such thing as sick-days in Sweden because you're guaranteed time off if your sick and the government pays you the wages you missed; Meaning people don't have to choose between being sick and earning a living.  If they're dead then we're super-mega-dead.	1643385974.0	hulicqr	t3_seoafs	t1_hukr2wa	/r/Conservative/comments/seoafs/denmark_welcomes_the_life_we_knew_before_and/hulicqr/

If they truly cared about the will of the people, which is what they primarily argued, then they would have waited two months to see how the presidency turned out. But they didn't and appointed someone who was unqualified because she was younger and very conservative in her views, and they knew Trump was rather unfavorable as the election drew closer.	1643389213.0	hulr550	t3_seo8je	t1_hulp59x	/r/Conservative/comments/seo8je/elizabeth_warren_calls_for_courtpacking_after/hulr550/

59xjn	Expect act 77 was passed by general assembly and signed into law and not by executive fiat as you say. And it expanded and protected voting rights, not narrowed them like a poll tax would. Doesn’t the ideal democratic republic have every single eligible cast a vote. By your own argument every elected official in the Jim Crow south was elected fraudulently given that those election laws were later deemed unconstitutional.   And all this is ignoring the fact that this ruling will likely be overturned in time and the law probably will stand.	1643392411.0	hulztwa	t3_seuv32	t1_hulxo0f	/r/Conservative/comments/seuv32/rig_the_election_first_ask_legal_questions_later/hulztwa/

52aqkz6	Eisenhower is an example. He was an outspoken supporter of New Deal programs, labour unions, and unemployment benefits to name a few. He also expanded Social Security, increased the minimum wage, and created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. These are all things that all Republicans and even many Democrats vehemently attack.      Eisenhower was not an outlier among Republicans. Even the Nixon administration proposed numerous welfare, civil rights and environmental protection programs, namely the Family Assistance Program, which was designed to provide poor families with a guaranteed annual income, "set-aside" policies that guaranteed a certain percentage of construction jobs would be granted to minorities, and the EPA, which to this day set's pollution-control standards. These are all things we now deem "liberal," or "socialist," but they were widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike only a couple of decades ago.	1643397869.0	humehfe	t3_seapkv	t1_hujua3z	/r/Conservative/comments/seapkv/mitch_mcconnell_warns_biden_to_not_outsource/humehfe/

Everyone was going home and then they were told they couldn't, and had to keep counting through the night.  Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.     Look at all the wild claims that have been made and how many have panned out?  zero.  Meanwhile look at the actually caught fraud, mostly people double voting  and mostly republican.

That's tells you right there he wasn't chosen because he was the best or obvious pick.  And Biden didn't expect it either.     This was all rewritten in the media over the following years to try and recast the Biden pick as the obvious choice and shore up both Obama and Biden.

Sure, 10 and 11 are a bit strange, but that can be explained away as a population density thing combined with an already difficult border with Jersey. The rest of this map actually looks really sensible to me, much better than a lot of Republican-proposed maps in Texas and Louisiana over the years.   Calling this gerrymandering is like calling a small jog sprinting. I don’t care what your political beliefs are, calling this gerrymandering whilst ignoring the absolutely abysmal state of the Texan voting district maps over the past few decades is just plain wilful ignorance.	1643819018.0	hvajvme	t3_sipjnu	t3_sipjnu	/r/Conservative/comments/sipjnu/proposed_new_york_redistricting_map_brought_to/hvajvme/

2b0f1hi1	As a society have acknowledged the fact that males have high testosterone levels,  and women have low levels.  This leads to different mindsets around sex. Generally women want a commitment and love when have sex. Men are just happy to have sex.  Since girl students are not going to get commitment and love we see that they have been taken advantage of.  The boy student got sex so good for him.  If the male student were younger that would be different.  I'm not saying it is ok,  but that is why people respond the way they do.	1643822492.0	hvath6y	t3_sis3dp	t1_hvajhhh	/r/Conservative/comments/sis3dp/former_missouri_teacher_beats_charge_of_sexual/hvath6y/

In the year 2022, yes there is. It's the Republican Party, more specifically the libertarian/constitutionalist faction. They are ones advocating for school choice, police & criminal justice reform, more economic liberty, and a cultural shift back towards intact nuclear families. All things that Black Americans would draw crucial advantages from, even more so than other Americans.  > even voted against MLK, Jr. Day being recognized  So you base your voting decisions on the distant past. Okay. Where exactly do you draw the line? 2010? 1980? Surely somewhere after 1965, right? After all, the Democrats were the pro-slavery party, **and** the pro-Jim Crow party?

6g7ec3sp	PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead.   :heart:️Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate :heart:️.

sjbb8	Aight I’m convinced you’re a troll because after looking at even a bit of your profile you’re not Christian at all, but I’ll humor you. All of the members of Sabbath grew up and remain religious, mostly part of the Anglican Church, but their lead lyricist, Geezer Butler, is catholic. Any religious person who listens to them can see that in their lyrics and know that their “dark” persona, is just a persona, not sac religious or anti-god.

ghdozcyw	I'm just going to post this here, in case anyone hasn't had a chance to read it:  https://canada-unity.com/mou/  These are the demands from the convoy leaders.  To summarize, it doesn't say "remove COVID restrictions" or "remove vaccine mandates". It says "because of COVID restrictions, hand over control of the federal government to the convoy's leadership".  Edit: Downvote all you want. Convoy supporters can keep burying your heads in the sand, but that doesn't change the fact that you're being played.	1643843773.0	hvcene6	t3_sj30r1	t3_sj30r1	/r/Conservative/comments/sj30r1/trucker_convoy_trudeau_says_protest_becoming/hvcene6/

5eot50ww	That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it’s just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It’s also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don’t make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn’t want them, can’t adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That’d be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that’s their and only their decision. But first, it’s often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they’re often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren’t their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they’ve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one’s health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone’s personal circumstances (that also aren’t any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	1643855083.0	hvd5ww2	t3_sidf4y	t1_hvc08nt	/r/Conservative/comments/sidf4y/whoopi_goldberg_suspended_from_the_view_following/hvd5ww2/

2gpstx8o	Yea and with a population of 330 million its roughly 3% percent. Sorry while i yawn. Like i said, people die all the time. Considering the 1 million deaths you count as covid include every other death too because "covid" was being marked for everything so hospitals could get paid more. The number 1 cause if death right now in 18 to like 40 years is fentanyl, know where that is coming from the southern border.. Have you taken a look at suicide numbers lately?? Also way up, most consider it to be part of the isolation from lock downs. So if you were really caring about lives lost you would be much more pissed at China for starting this entire thing, you would be pissed at how open the southern boarder is and you would be pissed at the lockdowns. The reality is you are only pissed at what your told to be pissed at, while the Russians and Chinese get stronger and you all scream about diversity. P.S. you should be counting Covid deaths as war deaths, because like it or not we are at war.	1643861142.0	hvdjtrc	t3_siyxh8	t1_hvd557t	/r/Conservative/comments/siyxh8/us_army_begins_immediate_discharge_of_soldiers/hvdjtrc/

Amnesty International requires a thorough and indepth review of the target nations legal system and social conditions, which obviously they are unable to do in the case of China.   And regardless it's undeniable what is happening in Israel is horrible and they only get a pass because they're our ally and the only western style democracy in an area of strategic geo-political interest.	1643869847.0	hve01ta	t3_sj9zmb	t3_sj9zmb	/r/Conservative/comments/sj9zmb/amnesty_international_no_double_standard_in/hve01ta/

She also started asking for etransfers right before she disappeared. I'm sure she just assumed that that was all the money she'd ever get out of this grift and just took off with the cash given by whoever was stupid enough to send her any directly.  Either way, absolutely hilarious turn of events and the constant infighting within this fringe movement is entertaining as hell.	1643870169.0	hve0k6r	t3_sj8tfq	t1_hvdi477	/r/Conservative/comments/sj8tfq/trucker_convoy_gofundme_suspended_under_review/hve0k6r/

5eitpm2i	I also empathize with people who grow up in or around high-crime areas, and having grown up in one myself I can kind of agree with the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for people in these areas especially young men.  But in my experience that has nothing to do with survival. Nobody shoots another person "just to get by", it's not a source of income. Nobody is coercing or forcing people to start shooting each other and they're certainly not getting paid.   There is a cycle of violence in these neighborhoods and there's surely a reason but it's not because people are living by the sword in the united states. It's Chicago not Yemen.	1643872100.0	hve3ipr	t3_sj8zl0	t1_hve1wby	/r/Conservative/comments/sj8zl0/rudy_giuliani_is_unmasked_on_foxs_the_masked/hve3ipr/

xcr2d	i have a theory that all this school shooting stuff is happening because of the school's own Zero tolerance policy on violence. If you are being bullied and stand up for yourself , you get in trouble. If you get bullied and ask the school for help, their response is you need to learn to deal with it-no support, no trouble for the bully, nothing. So they create an incubator for pain and suffering with zero way out (if you were treated this badly at work you would quit, but it's not legal to do that with school). Then they're all surprised that the kid freaks out and shoots the place up.	1643904634.0	hvfo7u7	t3_sjhkkg	t1_hvf5w46	/r/Conservative/comments/sjhkkg/proposed_ca_law_would_require_schools_to_collect/hvfo7u7/

2ggoujn	College student here. In my second semester I was required to take “global perspectives,” which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn’t have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who’s a minority or has a “unique world view” (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I’m mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn’t speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it’s a threat - including stuff like “global perspectives” classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn’t have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn’t need any video/audio evidence of it and I’m a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	1643930064.0	hvhk6gj	t3_sjhm04	t1_hvf8y4l	/r/Conservative/comments/sjhm04/college_prof_appears_to_say_on_video_theres/hvhk6gj/

I looked it up and you can get 50 round drum mags for glocks…  Thing is not that democrats care about our safety, it takes more than one shot to put down a potential threat.  Say some one breaks into my home with the intent to harm my family , if i manage to not miss my first few shots due to adrenaline dump and i hit my target, unless its a headshot then one or two hits wont always stop a person… this is why you hear from the left that “so and so cop shot a guy 7 to 8 times” well thats because they keep shooting till the threat is neutralized.  People who don’t own guns i think do not understand that one bullet is not enough to stop a threat.

4cch1bnc	Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   “You only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.” Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let’s be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao’s China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	1643955541.0	hvj2yj0	t3_sjw7f5	t1_hvj1gku	/r/Conservative/comments/sjw7f5/pelosi_instructs_us_athletes_to_not_speak_out/hvj2yj0/

id5hwbl	So you're all cool if I stop here by with left leaning opinions? I'm not going to get insta-banned?  Awesome.  Let's see...  Tax cuts for the wealthy are bad for the economy. Capitalist business owners who pay workers less than the value of what they produce are leeches mooching off of poorer people who create the actual value. Abortion wouldn't be as common if "pro-life" advocates instead advocated for universal health care, universal free access to birth control, and sex education in every school, but if Republican politicians actually supported that they'd lose single-issue voters so it will never happen. The Republican Party has no real platform and has completely succumb to Trumpism which is little more than a cult of personality around a failed elitist millionaire who doesn't care about anyone who isn't currently kissing his ass. Critical Race Theory hasn't ever been taught in elementary schools. Banning books you disagree with isn't going to stop your kid from eventually realizing they're gay or transgender if that's who they really are and you not accepting them as they are makes you the freak, not them.

vc7dg	The responses to your question fog up what he ACTUALLY said.  He talked about the badness of whiteness for the vast majority of the podcast.   That whites are genetically incapable of sympathy and such.  That is NOT why he was fired from his job.  He was talking to an ex-member of Public Enemy ("Professor Griff")...who was in full agreement.  Nick Cannon made his mistake when he pivoted away from evil whites and made *a few minutes of comments* about Jewish people.  THAT is why he was (temporarily) cancelled.   The  white hate was fine, though.  All that said, I believe in freedom of speech and approve of his rights to express his opinions (hateful or not).   One bonus of free speech is that it allows us to identify these fools, too.... otherwise, they hide their true feelings.	1643976701.0	hvjvsxy	t3_sj72h3	t1_hvfwqrn	/r/Conservative/comments/sj72h3/unmasking_of_rudy_giuliani_on_foxs_the_masked/hvjvsxy/

Same with medicine. There are stuff like all natural drops and Tylenol that isn't recommended until so many months in.  But, let me shot em up 32 (I can't remember the actual number but I'm probably not far off) times in their first year with a chemical cocktail.  All my kids are fully immunized but I just think it's odd the level of inconsistency. Couldn't we wait a bit? Maybe a year or two? We already have herd immunity and likelihood of infection at their age is so low.

4aaxmi1e	I don’t take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being “retarded” ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I’m proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity. I do wish you the best in life.	1643986785.0	hvkg9px	t3_skdhzq	t1_hvketer	/r/Conservative/comments/skdhzq/cops_son_wears_thin_blue_line_mask_teacher_snaps/hvkg9px/

j3qch	The wikipedia for trans athletes lists a number of ftm athletes. But only three have competed against men. A college swimmer, a boxer who has had one professional fight as a man, and an olympic duathalon.  Realistically even giving a buttload of testosterone is not going to bridge the gap of a female body vs a male body.   But we also see more men who think they are women, it's a very recent change for so many teen girls to think they are boys, and I believe they also make up the biggest percentage of people who detransition.	1643993884.0	hvkz0i8	t3_skf0lp	t1_hvklg6m	/r/Conservative/comments/skf0lp/sixteen_upenn_swimmers_sign_letter_labeling_male/hvkz0i8/

vrsizbw	This is why the Chinese call us baizuo. It’s more than just a sense of moral superiority that defines a baizuo; it’s also a willingness to accept ideologies that require the undermining of existing social progress in the name of appearing inclusive. Here we see a triumph of second-wave feminism, the maintenance of female sports leagues at the college and professional levels, being supplanted by the new illogical trans-acceptance regime. All that hard work to make women’s sports viable gone down the tubes in the name of insisting that transwomen are really truly women.	1643996968.0	hvl7hut	t3_skf0lp	t3_skf0lp	/r/Conservative/comments/skf0lp/sixteen_upenn_swimmers_sign_letter_labeling_male/hvl7hut/

6hb3le0q	That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics. This ended up being quite electorally advantageous for him as no one on either side of the political spectrum had preexisting negative perceptions of him to burden his candidacy.   While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband’s current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She couldn’t still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of preconceptions of her. Especially since a plurality of the left and many independents still hold her husband’s tenure as president in a delusionally nostalgic amount of high esteem relative to the other possible democratic candidates.	1644002215.0	hvllndd	t3_sklcir	t1_hvljuhx	/r/Conservative/comments/sklcir/gop_activist_on_michelle_obama_god_help_us_she/hvllndd/

28doidow	Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible. The call is coming from inside the house. The saboteur is American.	1644009636.0	hvm5ami	t3_skdwea	t1_hvm2zef	/r/Conservative/comments/skdwea/no_rights_no_games_boycott_beijing_2022_olympics/hvm5ami/

So that being said, I think we agree that it doesn’t take 1,000,000 to praise or insult somebody. Good roasts are concise. And cartoons are lazy and hyperbolic. And hyperboles are weak.

b4r2z	There is a lot here to unpack but ill stick to our current discussion.   Do you know who would've left that crowd immediately after that statement? Everyone who isn't white.  Do you know why? Because at that point, there might only be a few white supremacists, but 1 is too many.  If you see a group of 10 people, and 1 of them is dressed like a nazi and no one is kicking that person out, or telling them to at the very least fuck off, there is a group of 10 nazis.   This last paragraph gives a glimpse into how the rest of the world sees canada right now. A convoy of misled truckers and racists standing outside our capitol demanding federal government change provincial restrictions.   Oh wait, their second group of hooligans are at the Couts, AB border crossing essentially demanding all the MPs to leave the cabinet or else they'll continue to disrupt 44 million in trade per day. Sounds a little bit like domestic terrorism, but I'd have to read up on some Canadian domestic terrorism laws to be safe.   And FYI the city police have estimated the rally to be between 7,000 and 15,000 protesters at its peak. While that is the first ten of thousands, it is not tens of thousands.   Reddit will rake you hard over the coals if you come to a debate without clear data and posting conjecture (black supremacists) and opinion (fox News, extremely right wing, they wouldn't give 2 positive minutes to BLM)  If I were you, I'd stop.

It will expedite our descent into fascism for the next couple of centuries, just like it happened in history, with the First Representative Democracy spreaded and upheld by Ancient Greece and the Roman Republic.

The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'  The only amendment that was added and then repealed in the past was the 18th amendment, Prohibition, so the likelyhood of them being able to touch an amendment is EXTREMELY SLIM.	1644020430.0	hvmvtmj	t3_skru0q	t3_skru0q	/r/Conservative/comments/skru0q/biden_on_gun_control_plan_theres_no_amendment/hvmvtmj/

mw85g	Let me preface this by saying I'm not one of "those guys". I am pro-choice on masks, anti-mandate, anti-lockdown, etc.   With that being said: If masks don't work, why have they always been used in hospitals, even before Covid?   My theory is that medical professionals know not to adjust their mask with dirty hands and likely follow other basic hygienic precautions with regards to mask wearing.   On the contrary, ~~telling~~ forcing common people to wear masks without additional safeguards does little to prevent the spread of illness if they are constantly touching their face, not washing their hands, wearing it half on/half off, etc.  Thoughts?	1644022225.0	hvmzv5g	t3_skji1r	t1_hvlkjbf	/r/Conservative/comments/skji1r/official_in_dc_mayors_office_its_a_necessary_evil/hvmzv5g/

9v2w9	I happen to be conservative myself, but I have a general disagreement with a lot of Republicans. For instance, I think Regan was the opposite of conservative with his financial policymaking: he implemented untested policies while a top banker whispered in his ear. I do believe that many conservatives mean well and want to defend their freedoms, but the conservative leaders for the past 50 years have been snake oil salesmen.	1644173388.0	hvudipf	t3_slu8te	t1_hvuc64l	/r/Conservative/comments/slu8te/jeff_bezos_exwife_donates_130_million_to/hvudipf/

fq7w0tqj	“Obvious sings of voter fraud and irregularities”  Ok mr. Trump. Where is the proof?   Trump needs to get out of politics.  Conservatives want a strong leader who will do what’s right for the country without engaging in inflammatory, childish attacks and furthering the divide in this country. We need a presidential candidate who can have honor, dignity, and class. Trump unfortunately does not possess those qualities and never will.   Yes I voted for him in 2020.

n0sf8	You wanna hear some real stupidity? People commenting things like “stupidity knows no bounds” in a conservative sub when you’ll go to a dem sub and see the exact same comments there. If you picked 10 random comments in both subs and got rid of the obvious words that’d give it away, no one would be able to accurately say which sub the comments came from because they’re all the same comments.   C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb” C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb”  Back and forth forever and ever.   Politics are fucking stupid.   Another thing that drives me nuts is when I see “they’re hypocrites!” I see the same comment in both subs. And the funny thing is THEY’RE BOTH RIGHT AT ALL TIMES BUT NO ONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHEN THEY DO IT! “Well, we’re being hypocrites right now because they’re hypocrites” but they were hypocrites because the other side was hypocritical and so on forever and ever and ever.   It is not a conservative vs democrat issue. I have loved ones on both sides, all great people. The issue is the misinformation on all sides, idolizing politicians that don’t actually give a fuck about anything but money, the divide that people make from all that, the other countries making that divide even wider and the actual government that fucks us every single day and makes it seem like it actually *is* a C vs D problem.	1644174198.0	hvufkd3	t3_slzye6	t1_hvu984h	/r/Conservative/comments/slzye6/stacy_abrams_deleted_this_twitter_picture_today/hvufkd3/

Also, this isn't our responsibility, the government can easily pay for this by implementing a wealth tax (on top .1%), banning stock buybacks, etc...  And you should care about these people.

9v2w9	The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple. It's responsible for checks and balances on all the states, to make sure their output is reasonable for the successful persistence of the United States.  There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy. Same with health - keep your citizens healthy so they can work.  I honestly do advocate for state's rights, but some things NEED to be looked at from a top-down view (from fed government) to determine the minimal amount of work needed for the success of the country as a whole.	1644184421.0	hvv4wms	t3_slwzzd	t1_hvuzu1s	/r/Conservative/comments/slwzzd/tucker_our_democracy_is_no_longer_functioning/hvv4wms/

9v2w9	Still doesn't fix the core problem. Citizens have to take out loans just to reach the middle class now. That needs to be eliminated. The government should be responsible for allowing a cost-free path to the middle class, because:  1. That increases the country's worker output 2. Increases tax revenue 3. Keeps wealth disparity more manageable 4. Doesn't treat the citizens like cattle  Honestly, the entire post-high education system is a scam. When American jobs started leaving after WW2, our middle class started to leave. We had a chance with the tech boom to retool our working class to enable a solid middle class again, but instead we slapped the university + unbankruptable loans in the working class's faces. This is posing a national security risk due to the younger generations have much less wealth. If we keep going this route, people will need to be housed by their jobs, and that's just the start of it. We're quickly approaching the endgame here.	1644185374.0	hvv78fb	t3_slzcnu	t1_hvv5ysb	/r/Conservative/comments/slzcnu/brandon_lied_lefties_cried/hvv78fb/

And they do that while doing very little themselves. Literally welfare kings. And you're fighting for them, which makes me very sad.

9v2w9	I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	1644186815.0	hvvao6f	t3_slzcnu	t1_hvv9fc8	/r/Conservative/comments/slzcnu/brandon_lied_lefties_cried/hvvao6f/
9v2w9	I keep talking to people saying the same thing about federal politicians being corrupt. Of course they're corrupt, people don't pay attention to elections. Our government structure is relatively good, and our representation is relatively fair, so we have the ability to elect good politicians. But a lot of people just don't care, which is one issue. Another issue is too much corporate money in politics, obviously.  And it sounds like your solution is to burn it all down and start new...

9v2w9	What would be awful in the end?  Healthcare should be universal and treated as a utility provided by the government. People's health is no joke, just like water. The healthier they, the more they can work. And citizens who know their government has their backs are more likely to be happy, and provide more output.   That said, I'd probably just model it after Canada's or Germany's system. They have proven to be robust, efficient, and relatively inexpensive.	1644189081.0	hvvg1w7	t3_slwzzd	t1_hvvdem5	/r/Conservative/comments/slwzzd/tucker_our_democracy_is_no_longer_functioning/hvvg1w7/

1ilpbr09	According to his old profile Dave Zegarac is a far left, violent, extremist associated with antifa types.   https://web.archive.org/web/20210905065814/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave\_Zegarac   "His song lyrics deal primarily with anarchist politics.\[3\] Zegarac is an outspoken vegan and long time Anti-racist activist." -- antifa terrorist they should edit this to be.   Seems like he is just like the racist terrorist that killed kids at the christmas parade last year in Waukesha and the racist terrorist in Charlottesville a few years ago.   The far left needs to start calling out these people or they are all extremists and racists by association -- following the standards of discourse set by Trudeau, Singh and the CBC.

And citizens should get teeth cleanings and doctor's checkups, because it costs less overall when preemptive maintenance is done. And if offered free, it is even more convincing to do it. Government should be there to push citizens in the right direction to get the most efficiency out of them, which involves responsibility over health, because individuals are pretty terrible at maintaining their own health. The US is filled with fat fucks that don't realize they're usually the ones that put the most strain and expenses on our healthcare.

a16r6	While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	1644194896.0	hvvt3vk	t3_slyedp	t1_hvv8r7r	/r/Conservative/comments/slyedp/why_does_it_seem_like_the_ceos_of_all_major/hvvt3vk/

Generally speaking, government policies are made with citizen efficiency in mind, and that's very true for our current situation. Except it's worse than my suggestion.

9v2w9	I haven't looked into that literature, but I'm very familiar with and greatly admire Michael Oakeshotte's work on conservatism. He is ideal in my mind, at least, when it comes to my framework of how to govern:   Mitigate disasters. Pass policies proven to work.  That is Oakeshotte's ideals in a nutshell. And I completely agree, that's what conservatism should be. In terms of mitigating disaster, switching government types is probably pretty high on the list of probable disasters. Small, incremental changes are probably better.  Anyway, I've got my own mindset of conservatism, and I know for a fact that switching government styles is probably pretty fucking stupid and anti-conservative.	1644199311.0	hvw2o81	t3_slwzzd	t1_hvvm2tf	/r/Conservative/comments/slwzzd/tucker_our_democracy_is_no_longer_functioning/hvw2o81/

99nxl	Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.	1644232131.0	hvxjuje	t3_slyedp	t1_hvthjx5	/r/Conservative/comments/slyedp/why_does_it_seem_like_the_ceos_of_all_major/hvxjuje/

93g6hnrb	You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it’s primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn’t bother to let science validate first.  But you can’t argue with or change the mind of nature.  It will act the way it does, and the results will follow.	1644238560.0	hvxtnds	t3_smeq93	t3_smeq93	/r/Conservative/comments/smeq93/more_important_ivermectin_study_results_strictly/hvxtnds/

brwf7ew5	 The study contained multiple methodological flaws that call the reliability of its conclusions into question. For example, there are indications that many people assigned to the ivermectin treatment group didn’t take the drug consistently, or stopped taking it after a while.

9v2w9	This is how I look at colleges: a scam endorsed by the government that takes advantage of vulnerable young people without a care for the repercussions. I blame the government wholeheartedly because they introduced this hole in our social safety net. Do I think it's the kid's faults for this? No, because they were promised a result from these loans, but instead they get a useless history degree.  Fairness is thrown out the window when discussing this. Purposely tanking people's futures is not okay and is a national security risk due to locking these citizens from high yielding positions due to high amounts of debt.   And idk what you mean by massively devaluing college degrees... Just by forgiving loans doesn't mean the education is worth any less.	1644243838.0	hvy464x	t3_slzcnu	t1_hvy0vq9	/r/Conservative/comments/slzcnu/brandon_lied_lefties_cried/hvy464x/

2ztz87hc	Meanwhile if you were to add up the total amount of deaths through religion, whether it's being a martyr to being persecuted for your religion, it adds up to ~200 million. So by your logic all religion- whether it be Christianity, Catholicism, Islamic, and all other religions are terrible to the point that if you mention God or have a cross on your wall it's akin to heiling Hitler and hanging a swastika on your wall.   We can add up how many people have died for or been killed by America over the course of two world wars in the name of preserving our American capitalistic values and freedoms and guess what that number would be? 100 million. So now again, with your logic, American Capitalistism also falls under the category of being classified as a bad word.   Left or right, y'all are actual troglodytes who care only about the tribal "us vs them" mentality and will twist your reality, stats, and logic to appease your sensibilities.

p27eu	>Now who doesn't know how they generate revenue?  You, dipshit. Because you've consistently missed EVERY single factor here while babbling about subscriptions; which would be one thing if you were correct, but you weren't even correct about THAT. He retains 11 million listeners per episode. Spotify now has a metric they can measure value to as opposed to just "People like music". ONE GUY keeps 11 million people paying 10 bucks a month. He paid for himself in under a month.  Then you have the free accounts, who have to listen to ads, but still listen to Rogan. Do I need to explain advertising dollars to you? Its generally 250 dollars for a basic ad on spotify. Rogans show allows spotify to hike that price as the value of the ad will have more reach.  Additionally, Spotify is getting in on the podcast game. Having Rogan be spotify exclusive makes it easier for them to secure exclusives with other people. This is long game. Joe Rogan, from all conceivable angles, is literally spotifys most valuable asset.  Meanwhile, you're talking about fucking subscriptions amd doubling down on trying to say a **market share valuation doesnt mean anything** like you know a THING of what you're talking about.

f9ami	Every time anything gets posted about women's sport, some hacks post trying to dunk on women for getting beat by men. The entire point of banning trans women from competing in women's sports is the staggering difference between biological men and women. Then when women talk about pay suddenly it's like "well, pssh, you can't beat boys, go play a real sport". Pick one.  A lot of women's team sports are still in their infancy and have very few fans and viewers. Of course, they shouldn't get paid the same as long as they aren't filling 100,000 person stadiums with insane TV deals, etc. I still enjoy watching the best players compete against each other. I love women's tennis for instance, the game is less dominated by massive serves and the points often play out differently. Even the best women in the world will concede that they'd be outside the top 200-300 in the world even at their peak. Either way, people, stop taking shots at women's soccer because some of the players are obnoxious activists.	1644271393.0	hw01ts2	t3_smtbln	t1_hvzrev4	/r/Conservative/comments/smtbln/canceled_woke_soccer_player_megan_rapinoe_left/hw01ts2/

qjeor4w	The ultra wealthy have almost always been liberal. They aren’t a victim of “wokeism”, it’s just that when you have *that* much money, where losing 10s of millions hardly makes a dent, you turn to philanthropy, expansion, and doing your best to right the societal wrongs. There’s also a difference between “spouting left bullshit” and general decency, responsibility, and respect. Advocating for diversity, advocating for environmental friendliness, advocating for equal rights is not a sided issue, it’s general human decency.	1644273390.0	hw06rl4	t3_slyedp	t3_slyedp	/r/Conservative/comments/slyedp/why_does_it_seem_like_the_ceos_of_all_major/hw06rl4/

They also negotiated non-monetary benefits into the contract which was offset by a lower cash payout.   In contrast, the men key the pay only contract (no benefits) and the lower guarantee (but higher pay for performance).   https://youtu.be/LLeAWuRbObQ	1644282289.0	hw0rk22	t3_smtbln	t1_hw01ts2	/r/Conservative/comments/smtbln/canceled_woke_soccer_player_megan_rapinoe_left/hw0rk22/

Boasting about confiscating 1000L of fuel and propane.   Not that he actually gave clear legal justification for it.  Probably the state of emergency declaration by the city.

a1q8p	Just got over being sick with covid despite being vaccinated. My unvaccinated wife was not significantly more sick.  Leftoids: stop fucking pushing this nonsense. This vaccine WILL NOT eradicate covid, nor will the next one, or the next after that. The only thing it will do is keep *some* people out of the hospital who might have a severe case. You can still get it, you can still spread it, you can still die from it.

834tz1uo	I use the term Salem 2 a lot.  Here's the thing: Salem happened by a thousand seemingly sane tiny steps at a time, which can only be seen as a giant leap off a cliff from a wider or outside perspective.  You don't jump instantly from normal Christian community to burning people...or to claiming transwomen have no sports advantage.   The first leftward steps seem reasonable: "minorities deserve equality", "what people do in their bedrooms isn't my business."  and a hundred steps later "people should be able to define their own identity" also seems perfectly reasonable but an outsider might start saying "wait what exactly do you mean by that?", and after a thousand more steps transwomen have no sports advantage and dissenters are bigots who must be penalized by law, and yet every individual step seemed reasonable from where you currently stood.  Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root.  When he returned he shut it down immediately.  He hadn't taken any of the steps.  But we have the internet.  No one is 100% outside of our community.  So in Salem 2 the illness is international. Even we resistors may not realize that we're 10% infected ourselves, and that that weakens our arguments drastically.  We are uncertain and angry in the confusion of it, and so ineffective, sometimes responding too weakly and other times with a harshness so extreme as to render us a different form of crazy.  So we have to redpill ourselves over and over, constantly treat the madness that keeps trying to grow back, but also redpill our redpilling, realize that reactionary right wing extremism is ultimately just another form of left extremism.  We're just the half mad trying to survive the mad.	1644287251.0	hw12zba	t3_sn5hf8	t3_sn5hf8	/r/Conservative/comments/sn5hf8/racist_is_the_new_witch/hw12zba/

8qaxo6st	Yes. I recently watched an interview of this trans (f-m) Ugandan LGBTQ advocate who faced off against a baffled moderator and a local pastor. The pastor sounded like a condescending,  hostile nutjob while the activist, who explained she was just advocating for "human rights," was so polite and patient that she started to made so much sense. I had to stop and remind myself that just because she seems like a very nice, decent person and just because the pastor is a total maniac, that doesn't mean she represents the right side of the debate.

fbeocp84	I work with people from central and south America.. Tell you right now. They aren't stealing jobs anyone wants. They're doing the jobs no one will do..   Some of the toughest, kindest family oriented people.  One woman legally got into the United States left her children in Honduras and for the next 8 years saved every fucking penny she could raising 60k and getting her children into the states just so they could work in motels cleaning up after people that have no respect, accuse them of being illegal.   I've been listening to my grandfather rant about dems and libs trying to take away our guns and Mexicans coming into America illegally, raping and stealing our jobs. No one has taken anyone's guns.. Ever.   What jobs? Not high paying jobs.. Maybe doing roofing, painting and landscaping.. Busting they're asses to make sure Americans are comfortable.   Trump... Is a criminal that has admitted multiple times he wants to fuck his daughter, he lies, he belittles everyone, he doesn't pay his taxes, he's stuck up... Does that man look like someone who's bled red for his country... This is the mother fucker who built a casino called it the Taj Mahal Trump and went bankrupt his daddy had to bail him out. He has terrible ideas when it comes to investment. Remember this.. He's doesn't give a fuck about anyone. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE A BUSINESS TRANSACTION... HE LIKES YOUR FUCKING MONEY.   Wake up.   Joe Biden is gross to, he's boring and old and gets nothing done. Our political system is failing on BOTH sides.   The dems and reps of this country need to stop fighting each other and figure it out. The whole world is watching us and laughing. We are getting dicked.   The fuck are you worrying about a wall for... Look at the inside of your country. It's falling apart, people are working they're asses off for nothing, poor health and a population and next generation of lost and confused kids because we can't grow the fuck up.   Our grandparents despite the differences would have set aside our opinions and picked this shit up. We made it through the civil Rights movement, we made it through war.. We made it.

He tried to over throw the government.. Stormed the capital.   Black people were mad about police killing them. Antifa was implemented and formed to stop the governments from fucking over it's citizens.

It's ok though. You've already made your ideological bias abundantly clear, so no amount of actual data can change your mind.  And before you pitifully invoke Fauci, I say he should step down. Tbh his communication needed some polish but, more importantly,  conservative media clockwork oranged people like you and now  his visage is carved into your reptile brain as THREAT forever. Thus a new face is requisite to placate all of you.

7drlg4vy	You’re 100% correct. All my experiences with Central American immigrants have been positive. The vast majority of them are hard working family people.   It’s just become the American way to demonize and blame others for our own problems, rather than constructively work together.   Both parties have been running on the same issues for decades now.

fbeocp84	I'm convinced that a lot of Americans crave chaos but CoD and watching WW2 in color on Netflix just isn't cutting it for action anymore. People are eager to Larp.. for the average American, democracy has been plentiful, people just don't realize it... Unless of course you're not white. Actually the saddest part is how many foreigners come here to live and love America. You can walk down the street and for the most part not have to worry about being bombed, shot at, kidnapped etc.. Not saying it doesn't happen but a lot less than other places... Oh you know places like Mexico, the middle East, Africa. Some of those people come here and are so fucking happy to be working shitty jobs that people don't want to do.. For close to nothing. They save that money and open small businesses like taco trucks, housecleaning services, landscaping services.. You know shit middle and upper class Americans love for cheap but quality.   It's such a joke.    But hey.. They're stealing our jobs, raping and bringing drugs into the country.

n3dqa	Can we make punching people who offend us legal again?  I'm even talking equality between the sexes. No kids, but no weight limit.  Between punching Nazis (which I agree with) and punching racists (also, hard agree) and now punching unvaccinated, and all the other expressions of aggression and dissatisfaction.   Just make it legal.  Surely the progressives would vote on something that allows them to express their frustrations.  Some might say that this would devolve the world back to 'might is right,' where only the strongest and most violent can speak their opinion while anyone weaker lives in fear and submission.

Joe Biden only won because people couldn't handle another year of Trump. All the people came out to vote under one common goal.. No more Trump. His groupies couldn't handle that and did what daddy said tried to storm the Capitol.   Personally think that was just a test.. See what the American people would do.. Which was nothing! People should be more upset. This man is walking free, we have known criminals running the world... People are like eeeeh I'd rather fight over skin color and who has control of who's genitals.

5oxswjnk	The mask serves two purposes.  1)  Governments have seized many "emergency" powers due to Covid and they don't want to give up those powers.  The mask serves as a constant visual reminder that "The Crisis" is still going on, so no one will question all the extra government control over their lives.  If they let the masks go away, people might start questioning why their business has to be closed while the favored big corporations get to stay open, or why they have to stay locked up in their homes while high-level Democrats get to go to big parties.  2) It's a symbol of submission, which is why high-level Democrats are always unmasked at their $10,000 a plate dinner parties but the servants are masked up.   Screw that.  So yes, the masks are harmful.	1644336152.0	hw3gfrg	t3_snmux0	t1_hw3e6hd	/r/Conservative/comments/snmux0/50_years_from_now/hw3gfrg/

1dt04p9m	I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	1644336725.0	hw3hy16	t3_snmux0	t1_hw3gfrg	/r/Conservative/comments/snmux0/50_years_from_now/hw3hy16/

Y’all bunch of pussies complaining about trivial shit like masks in the middle of pandemic.  COVID really shows where your priorities are. If something is not impacting YOU directly you don’t give a fuck, even if it’s such a minor inconvenience…. To such an aggressively dumb extent that it became your political identification.   I mean how difficult is it to wear a mask without making it into overly complicated conspiracy ridden problem? Why are you such pussies? I thought you were the gun loving “tough” people. Man you won’t last a second in an actual combat, cuz you will run out of breath or it will be too cold for your feet or some other dumb shit.

huq5l6zy	Dunno, I was in Minneapolis last week and the city's infrastructure seemed pretty intact. None of the buildings on Nicolette were demolished, smoking ruins. In fact, the whole of the downtown core was pretty much humming along.  I didn't see any burn marks or damage to anything on Nicolette or Hennepin Avenues downtown.  And which Portland? I live in Portland, Maine and there's no damage to the city here. No burnt out buildings, etc.  If you mean Portland, Oregon. My MIL lives there and I just talked to her last night. There was no mention of apocalyptic hellscape, no fires, no destruction.  So..

46xf018r	The "60 years" was referring back to the late 1950's. Not the war that ended up, also, ending slavery.  "girl" .... if used in the friendly "how are you my gay pal" kinda way, sure. Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb 😁😁😁  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am 😈 Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.	1644444439.0	hwa91cx	t3_sokey4	t1_hw9enuj	/r/Conservative/comments/sokey4/what_should_we_do_about_critical_race_theory/hwa91cx/

Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years.

1832th9n	The theory is that the spike protein is what causes these issues.  The spike protein itself damages cells.  The protein is present in both the vax and COVID itself.  However, the counterpoint is that a serious COVID infection is going to lead to a much larger quantity of this protein than the vaccine.  So, I believe, and my qualifications are I'm just a dude with an internet connection, that pretty much any risk from the vaccine is also a risk present from a serious COVID infection.  If there's a difference between the two I think it has to do with differences in quantity and where the protein tend to concentrate in the body for an infection vs the vax.	1644504085.0	hwddoib	t3_sp6j87	t1_hwd7e9l	/r/Conservative/comments/sp6j87/covid19_seems_to_increase_risk_of_serious_heart/hwddoib/

4iiip	I am also just a dude w an internet connection. But I think you are correct. The issue I think is that we don’t know how much spike protein is produced by the vaccines. We know Pfizer has 30 micrograms of mRNA and Moderna has 100, but that doesn’t tell us how much spike protein those amounts produce in each individual. So an 18 year old might produce a buttload of spike, whereas an 80 yr old produces very little. And unfortunately, I don’t think there is really any way to quantify this other than going a step further and measuring antibody levels, but that’s not necessarily a direct correlation.  So the vaccine is similar to a natural infection, in that we don’t know how much spike each person is exposed to. What is different, is that a natural exposure is generally through the nasal passage or throat. Reducing viral load in those 2 places would potentially be extremely useful to minimizing exposure to large amounts of spike. Maybe even micro-dosing in the way of repeated exposures to low amounts of virus is helpful, but who knows and how to implement that is even more of a question. It’s also essentially what vaccines are, but once again mRNA are much different than a traditional vaccine would be, where spike is quantified.  The other thing is we’ve seen higher than expected accumulation of the liquid nanoparticles(fat globules that carry mRNA into cell membrane) in the ovaries and a few other organs where they shouldn’t be. This is concerning. Perhaps something similar is happening with the heart too, but so far I haven’t seen it.	1644505690.0	hwdhn66	t3_sp6j87	t1_hwddoib	/r/Conservative/comments/sp6j87/covid19_seems_to_increase_risk_of_serious_heart/hwdhn66/

But now that I mentioned capital, let's recall every big corporation jumping on the BLM bandwagon.  Suddenly every corp had BLM messaging on their website.  Kamala Harris started a bail fund for BLM rioters, OK.

ahth9	You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country. You are making up lies about a massive movement just like the democrats are doing about the truckers.	1645025905.0	hx6moe1	t3_stbx2j	t1_hx6l5me	/r/Conservative/comments/stbx2j/canadas_use_of_terrorist_laws_against_peaceful/hx6moe1/

5oxswjnk	If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.  TL;DR - if your protest is furthering the goals of the government and big corps, then your "protest" is just a tool of the government and is not real.	1645028126.0	hx6sfqi	t3_stbx2j	t1_hx6moe1	/r/Conservative/comments/stbx2j/canadas_use_of_terrorist_laws_against_peaceful/hx6sfqi/

16j64h	I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.	1645044605.0	hx7yo0z	t3_sts4np	t1_hx7gnd5	/r/Conservative/comments/sts4np/allegiant_air_passenger_kicked_off_flight_for/hx7yo0z/

p8rrh	Well now let's dissect this shall we, by claiming first that "Trump sucks" is that against any of the 3 principles? I wouldn't think so, seeing as he orchestrated and incited an insurrection to overthrow the government that is established to uphold these principles.   You don't think Trump did that, okay fine, let's dive further. Saying "Trump sucks" implies I don't agree with his character and his agenda, what's trumps character? Oh yeah the racist, misogynistic, elitist, liar that ran away with an election because he managed to tap into a VERY deep seeded hatred that lives in America, not Republicans, but Americans as a whole. He brought forth the worst this country has to bring and slapped a GOP sticker on them. What's his agenda? To 'drain the swamp'? How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	1645052519.0	hx8ima4	t3_su31dl	t1_hx8gaih	/r/Conservative/comments/su31dl/no_valid_reason_to_withhold_more_than_14000_hours/hx8ima4/
