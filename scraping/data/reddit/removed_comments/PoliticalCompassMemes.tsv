97b4u8ov	> Since you have the answers here, please give me some numbers, at what number of COVID deaths can government stop coercing the injections onto us?  None, and the government has not *yet* (and should not) ever make them mandatory. What they should do is ensure that this decision does not affect other people negatively. That is to say, I have a right to go to the pub and not be exposed to preventable additional risk because someone else decided to not take a vaccine. It's the same reason we mandate seatbelts *on public roads*. You can drive without one on your own property here, because you're not placing additional risk onto anyone else. But on public roads, you risk becoming a projectile and killing people in other vehicles should an accident happen.	1642747100.0	htkgox4	t3_s8xvt3	t1_htke0gm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8xvt3/australia_is_the_true_centrist_paradise/htkgox4/

hj2sj	I don't get the left/right on this issue.   There's a likely fraudulently "elected" president in the White House who is in full dementia decline. And in the meantime the White House has had fortified walls built around it with National Guard patrols. The White House occupant is issuing illegal edicts and attempting to overthrow the Supreme Court when his illegal commands are struck down, as well as discussing overthrowing Congress to "pass" legislation without the necessary votes.  The US being a fascist dystopia would be claiming the DNC/Biden are fascist. Is anyone really going to dispute that?

4u0eozuy	Women here. What we say is problematic for clout an what we truly find sexy isn't the same.  The hard reality is, white are currently the most powerful group of men socially worldwide. We as women value power so much because our kids's safety depends on the guy being able to protect us from other men.  That's why white men are the most sought after on ever dating app after Lasquisha/Reiko/Nikitita/Cloud Soul trashed them on twitter. They hate that men of a different race than them have the power but they'te still gonna fuck them and have their babies. It's kinda  tragic for our pride as women, tbh.  POC women want white sperm and will be mad all day long about the fact that the white man probably humiliated their race wherever they come from at the same time. It's basic sexual/social hypergamy mixed with shame and jealousy.	1642898376.0	httd73l	t3_sacomf	t1_htt2ey3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sacomf/its_ok_to_hate_whites_except_for_me/httd73l/

4u0eozuy	It's not "cucked", it's realist. What do you think about Homo Habilis or Homo Erectus, two races who could perfectly reproduce with Sapiens? Oh, right, they fucking disappeard. The hard truth is, no race id eternal. When you fall so back behing your kids are systematically retarded compared to kids of other races, your race is fucking dumb an least likely to survive. "Cucked" means weak, nothing else, and I see races for what they are, strong or weak.  Life's goal is survival of the most genes possible. If your race is weak, you'll end up crying for welfare, not educating your own kids because you're too stupid yourself, basing all your history on the white man and not what you could have done in 250 years in the most powerful country on earth. The black man could lead globally, today in the USA. They could have a thriving community of relatively rich black people helping some african countries developp very well.

Creepers: Represent muslims. Not only do they blow themselves up but they are also green which is a color strongly associated with Islam.  Enderman: A tall black man who steals shit and can't swim  Villagers: Big nosed merchants who live in the desert and have their hands constnatly rubbed together  Notch saw that Sweden was getting cucked and made Minecraft in collaboration with Pewdiepie in an effort to redpill the Aryan youth.	1642972410.0	htxhcn6	t3_satg72	t1_htwz1wh	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/satg72/based_authright/htxhcn6/

4pk8ox2k	Ascended Auth Right wall of text:  In social environments where the point is just to relax and be groovy or day-to-day fleeting interactions, idc.  If someone desires to obscure our perception of reality, I won‚Äôt abide by it.   Sure, there‚Äôs really no such thing as sex, gender, time, or whatever hippy shit some could go on about, but they‚Äôre accurate descriptions of actual, measurable, objective, physical phenomena.  There‚Äôs no such thing as blue, but we what call light, which is real, that moves at such and such wavelength and that such and such wavelength is real.  And for better or worse, we occupy reality. Distorting our most accurate descriptions of reality is going to have detrimental effects on the way we organize our lives on large scales. See the commie bullshit that every soft brain soyjack believes in despite the fact commie societies abort themselves pretty fuccing qwik.  If some brainy guy comes along an elevates our understanding of reality, thus, improving the way we interact with the physical universe, great! That may mean doing away with some paradigms but the new ones are better anyway.  The trans ideology, if accepted, degrades one‚Äôs understanding of reality and it‚Äôs gonna be a fucking bad time for those who accept it or try to live through it.  {40% statistic here}	1643007611.0	htzp863	t3_sb9s28	t1_htznn1d	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb9s28/malt_wash_on_dr_phil_was_hillarious/htzp863/

c1w5u4g	It's not Americans. It's a cabal of Jews and white liberals who literally live to shit up and destroy all whites created because it makes them feel tolerant and happy. Tolkien said evil cannot create, and can only mock and corrupt, and what's going on in Hollywood is solid proof that his statement's absolutely true. That's why all of their creativity revolves around remakes and adaptations of other people's works that they take a flaming shit all over. And don't ask black people to be creators of this kind of stuff. Every day they prove their mental inferiority by leaning more and more on whites to include them in the things they lack the thinking capacity to create for themselves.	1643035893.0	hu0vu2g	t3_sbkqkb	t1_hu0mlvq	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbkqkb/have_a_feeling_the_jannies_might_not_like_this/hu0vu2g/

o97pnjf	I'm not "anti-Jewish" at all and wish the whole thing would just go the way of sectarian Christian conflict and turn into a joke.  However it's rather difficult to ignore that virtually all of the vanguard political/legal figures behind European mass immigration and ethnic replacement seem to be radical leftists of Jewish extraction. There is no way Europe would be en route to extinction had they not been present & so relentless.  It's disproportionate but not to the same extreme degree when you look at the US adoption of permanent mass immigration in the 60s/70s and the political collapses of South Africa/Rhodesia (as well as the subsequent violent scapegoating of rural Boer farmers).  It will always be an interesting and tragic topic because leftist Jewish culture seems to view all gentiles are interchangeable. A British soldier who died liberating prisoners from the Germans in WW2 seems to be viewed as interchangeable with his German adversary and equally guilty of their crimes because they are all Caucasian gentiles. Gentiles appear to be oblivious of this race-wide vendetta and take the blows without response.  I specific "leftist" Jewish culture because obviously there's political dissent within Judaism and lots of pro-Israel people, traditional religious Jews, etc end up siding with European nationalists when things get desperate enough.  I think a great tragedy needs to occur before Jewish culture generally resets and stops seeing other Caucasian groups as potential "Nazis"; and the Islamification of Europe may lead to that wakeup call/tragedy.	1643050971.0	hu1zecr	t3_sbsbg7	t1_hu1u7b3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbsbg7/germans_are_sadly_going_back_to_their_roots_of/hu1zecr/

itarz2h2	Fun fact about hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B). As a result of hydrogen cyanide poisoning the human body turns bright cherry pink. You see, hydrogen cyanide works by preventing cells from absorbing oxygen. This means that the blood contains tons of oxygenated blood that can't be used, and as a result the cells start to die. Now this oxygenated blood is bright red, which means that bright cherry pink skin is an indicator of cyanide (or carbon monoxide) poisoning. Note that the cyanide does not need to be absorbed by the skin for this redness to occur, inhaling hydrogen cyanide will have the same effect.  https://www.chemm.nlm.nih.gov/cyanide_prehospital_mmg.htm Clinical Signs and Symptoms  Skin - A cherry red skin color may be present as the result of increased venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation  https://www.emedicinehealth.com/cyanide_poisoning/article_em.htm  The skin may be unusually pink or cherry-red, breathing may be fast, and heartbeat may be slow or fast.  Now, isn't it chilling to read all the eye witness reports and documents describing the bright cherry pink bodies from the gassings in the holocaust? Piles upon piles of bright red bodies, looking like boiled lobsters. One surely could never forget a truly terrible sight like that. The witness reports from the sonderkommando, the shock of seeing their comrades almost unrecognizable, the bright red of their skin seared into their retinas forever.  No? Never heard of it before? That's because it has never been mentioned. No witness reports exist describing THE indicator of hydrogen cyanide poisoning. None of the thousands of witness reports. None in the Nuremberg trial documents. Nowhere is what should by all reason be a prominent part of the holocaust mythos ever even mentioned	1643052988.0	hu24qt8	t3_sbs9fi	t3_sbs9fi	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbs9fi/turn_the_volume_on/hu24qt8/

I think he was a teacher or something and got fired for it. My friend was so distraught because he sees this is the path we are going down where any interaction between the races could be construed as evil. I know the word racism has been so bent it doesn't mean much to me anymore, but I really do think most "racists" these days are just people who are willing to accept our differences, good or bad, and look past them.

hotgwmq5	Jesus was a victim of voice to skull technology (v2k on the boards) and a "targeted individual" who was "gangstalked". The phenomenon has occurred in humans ever since and is becoming more and more prevalent as the years go on. Every day, new people are coming online, going to the police, and reporting use of the alien's voice to skull technology to trick people as part of a manipulation strategy to control human beings. Jesus was a human icon we were willing to accept and follow when we would not directly worship the extra terrestrial aliens that were controlling and influencing Jesus. To this day human beings would still never worship a being from another world, especially when it is responsible for their own punishment, but they are comfortable with worshiping a human being that was controlled by a being from another world. Would we take orders on how to live from aliens? Nope, but we will from Jesus since he's human. Faith in Jesus is dramatically on the decline for a good reason- truth and knowledge of who Jesus was and what happened to him.	1643224606.0	huc0fzp	t3_s79bsc	t3_s79bsc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s79bsc/depictions_of_jesus_on_the_compass/huc0fzp/

hcmbd475	Their (the mods) ideology is about being antiwork in general, they don't want people to work at all. They want all work to be abolished. The sub was, in recent months, about fair working rights, dignity and setting proper expectations between bosses and workers. Just look at the posts on WorkReform which is where the bulk of the community is now moving to.     You're not supposed to hate them, you're not 'supposed' to feel anything, make up your own mind on that one, dude.    It's not about cancelling them because they embarrassed 1.6million people at once. It's not about cancelling at all. The mod fucked the pooch for everyone and then refused to stand down despite the sub calling for it. They didn't prepare for the interview which the sub voted against in the first place. All of the mods dirty laundry came out and you can't have someone like that representing a movement. What choice did the users have? All criticism was scrubbed, people were banned for bringing it up and the mod was just posting about how they were okay with how they did and deflecting blame.     When your ally is an admitted sex offender, accused rapist and refuses to admit they made a mistake it's time to get rid of them. They tried to educate the mod, the mod refused to accept it, refused to step down, had to be removed like a tick by the admins and then had the audacity to post as an alt defending themself and then came back on a different alt as a new mod.   The people didn't throw the mod under the bus, the mod threw the people under a bus. On live TV.

Also, try applying the logic of age of consent to anything else and people will yell at you. Tell people that women should be forced to stay in the kitchen and raise children because they're objectively better at it? You will get yelled out of the room for being a misogynist. Tell people Black people shouldn't be able to vote while white people can because you can show a difference in IQ between the races (regardless of what caused it)? You will be yelled out the room for being a racist.

5fc1idjo	I will just give you one example of an event that happened associated with them. Group of them was given some apartments to live in there for free since they usually live in hooverville type ‚Äúhouses‚Äù and flat out refuse to work. After couple of days/weeks/months (I don‚Äôt know exactly) those apartments were found empty with no stoves, dishwashers, furniture, washing machines‚Ä¶ Also another precise example, my mom said she had couple of them in middle school and they had all sorts of privileges like less strict grading, free books etc. and still they usually failed classes and had atrocious grades. I could talk about their problematics for days but the bottom line is that they aren‚Äôt necessarily evil but their lifestyle is incompatible with social norms in literally every country in the world (education and job). That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt have their own country and never will because that country wouldn‚Äôt be able to function for a week	1643819219.0	hvakf8f	t3_sioikj	t1_hva2sj9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sioikj/98_times_out_of_100/hvakf8f/

46x1s2iu	They rob, steal and destroy everything in their path. You'll probably think that it's just a minority of them right? No, they isolate themselves from the rest of society and live in their own communities with their own values and ideals. They grow up learning to steal from houses and mug people. They have no empathy for anyone outside their community and will happily beat the shit out of you with a group of 12 people for often no reason at all. They refuse education and usually marry their cousins because of that the majority of them are dumb as fuck and will focus more on stealing shit and fighting, God save you if you beat one in a fight because they'll find out where you live and turn up with a massive group purely to beat you and occasionally destroy your property. Anyone who's lived near them or had experiences with them will always be negative. They're absolute scum of the Earth and anytime I see an American defending them I get pissed off.	1643819815.0	hvam2dd	t3_sioikj	t1_hva2sj9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sioikj/98_times_out_of_100/hvam2dd/

8565tokw	Gypsy culture is nothing like Black American culture.   Gypsies are nomads who refuse to participate in settled society, and consider non-gypsies unclean. They consider it perfectly fine to grift, rob and steal from non-gypsies, because they basically consider non-gypsies subhuman. Gypsies who leave the nomadic life are considered unclean as well.

No, they isolate themselves from the rest of society and live in their own communities with their own values and ideals. They grow up learning to steal from houses and mug people. They have no empathy for anyone outside their community and will happily beat the shit out of you with a group of 12 people for often no reason at all. They refuse education and usually marry their cousins because of that the majority of them are dumb as fuck and will focus more on stealing shit and fighting, God save you if you beat one in a fight because they'll find out where you live and turn up with a massive group purely to beat you and occasionally destroy your property.

13t42q	Dear Unflaired,  You useless piece of trash. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.  The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to mess up on the unimaginable scale you just did.  When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.  After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.  No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.  Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.  I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.  You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.  You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of crap and I hate you with every single part of my being.  Even this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just messed up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.  Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.  In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.  You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.  It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.  Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.  I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.  The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.  Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.  You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.  If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.  You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.  The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.  I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute horror you have just released upon the world.  When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you mess the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.  My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.  But than again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure any living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you.	1643900682.0	hvfdwhk	t3_sjd92i	t1_hvfdcad	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sjd92i/ottawans_on_suicide_watch/hvfdwhk/

Define 'personhood'. The christians have a definition, both a spiritual, AND biological. Spiritual = conception. Biological = unique human DNA. Either way, by the time the mother is 2 weeks pregnant, there is a human being inside her and to perform an abortion, is morally a murder. And also a violation if the NAP.   Christians have a definition of a lot of things, theyre still just following fanfiction, that doesnt mean others have to follow your definition.

More rigorous contemporary research is needed to make a definitive comment on the effectiveness of surgical facemasks.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/)  and said the vaccine was an actual vaccine that provided immunity?  [While they now claim otherwise, every single major government health official and pharmaceutical executive has claimed that COVID shots stop the virus. Let‚Äôs take a look at what the top government health officials have said on the record about these shots over the past year.](https://dossier.substack.com/p/memory-hole-virtually-every-major?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNjAyNzkxNywicG9zdF9pZCI6NDU2OTIxMjMsIl8iOiIxTE5FMSIsImlhdCI6MTYzOTg2NDIwMywiZXhwIjoxNjM5ODY3ODAzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNjkwMDkiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.J-DzBT5WQz5MEF54yG_mY9iFS3sHcIb8jFpQtUB4qZA)  >>‚ÄúWhen you get vaccinated, you not only protect your own health and that of the family but also you contribute to the community health by preventing the spread of the virus throughout the community. In other words, you become a dead end to the virus. And when there are a lot of dead ends around, the virus is not going to go anywhere. And that's when you get a point that you have a markedly diminished rate of infection in the community."  -Fauci.  >>‚ÄúOur data from the CDC suggests that vaccinated people don‚Äôt carry the virus, don‚Äôt get sick and that it‚Äôs not just in clinical trials, but it‚Äôs also in real world data.‚Äù   - CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.  >>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccinations.‚Äù   -Joe Biden  >>"NIH director urges vaccinated Americans to get Covid booster shots to curb breakthrough infections over holidays"  - Francis Collins, NIH director.  >>"More People Need Shots In Arms To Reduce COVID Cases, NIH Director Says  Either they're incompetent, or have been actively lying to people. They have been wrong every step of the way. I don't see how anyone can look at them with anything other than disgust. They are not trustworthy organizations, and have proven that time and time again over the last 2 years.  >It's overwhelmed because it is understaffed.  Not at all. They're "overwhelmed" because they fired 1.4 million workers and now can't operate at a higher capacity due to a lack of workers. Vaccine mandates have made this an even bigger issue.   But even then, they're not overwhelmed. Wait times are the same as ever. Stop reading propaganda, and actually go in sometime.   >Yes and antivaxxers add to this problem.  First off, it's not a problem.  Secondly, so do the obese, alcoholics, smokers, elderly, etc. Guess we should ban McDonalds to eh? You have the freedom to be unhealthy.   >Yes and if you want to enter any place that requires vaccines you have your choice of vax.   Except you do not. The government restricts what ones are available.  Furthermore, no. The place often does not have the right to allow the unvaccinated inside. Whereas a hotel can be a nudist Hotel if it sees fit to. There's no choice at any level. The fact you can't see that is astonishing.  >Yeah you can just get a different type of booster next time.  Nope. They restrict that as well.. Try again.  Oh, and love how the vaccine was so effective you needed a booster. Ready for the next one because it's so effective? And the one after that?  Lol. If you honestly get a booster, you lack any kind of critical thinking.  >The state is coercing these people to do certain things to their own bodies.  The state doesn't force you to do anything to your body. Wearing clothing doesn't affect your body, anymore than closing a door affects a house.  Furthermore, there's many public places you can do nude. Again, including National parks.   Lastly, yes, long term effects are an issue. You cannot get rid of the contents of a shot. That is a permanent effect that you will never be able to undo, and will be with you until you die. Whereas having the freedom to be naked at home will never change.  The fact you cannot understand why the analogy between a PERMANENT and TEMPORARY thing is irrelevant, really goes to show how much the school system is against teaching critical thinking.  >If there was a temporary vaccine where people could insert and remove the vax from their bodies at anytime, would you be ok with vax mandates?  No. For a few reasons.  1. This is the fucking cold. Not a single mandate, restriction, or precaution was required.  2. Such a thing cannot exist. It's literally impossible.  Oh, and because you're an idiot, clothing has been around for thousands of years. It's as human as eating and drinking. A large part of the world literally couldn't go a year without some kind of clothing. On top of that, it proves utility. Pockets, belts, traction, protection, etc.   Compared to a useless vaccine, against a less than deadly virus. One that doesn't even provide immunity, or long term effects.   >Would it be ok to discriminate against antivaxxers and fire them from their jobs?   No, as there's no evidence that the vaccine does anything substantial.	1643940739.0	hvi92eq	t3_sjny1l	t1_hvi5nt4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sjny1l/god_fucking_dammit_emily/hvi92eq/

My guess is that some people think gypsies are culturally diverse racial minority hated for their skin color. One day I saw them steal forks from a restaurant. Other day I saw them breaking my bike lock when I came back from a shop. They aren't alone, they bring their kids with them whenever they do crimes to look sympathic.

ijh62qhn	You're the most retarded person I've ever heard bag out Christianity:  1. You're applying modern ethno-religious guidelines from Rabbinical Judaism to early Christians/Second Temple Jews. You do understand the reason Christians were persecuted is because they didn't receive the same protections as Jews when it came to the requirement of sacrificing to/for the Roman emperor? That's because the Jews of the time kicked up a fuss and made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with Christians who they didn't consider Jews. They even stopped using the Septuagint and scrapped together a Hebrew based scripture (later used by Protestants) because they didn't want to use the same scripture as Christians. 2. Even if you were right you've failed to address the fact that modern scholars believe the Bible wasn't written in the 1st century but the 3rd or 4th. So all you've done is deflect from reality as someone who supposedly doesn't believe in Christianity you have a pretty good understanding of Sola Scriptura 3. One of the disciples is literally called Simon the Zealot as in the sect of Jews independent of Pharisees as explained by the Jewish historian Josephus who literally witnessed the political events of the time. 4. What is your evidence that Jesus was a Pharisee when the Essenes understanding of the Messiah as both a religious and temporal leader is much closer to the Jesus's teachings. They even practiced the same forms of strict asceticism (as both Jesus and John the Baptist) out in the dessert which last time I checked wasn't something the Pharisees ever practiced.   There you are, you literally admitted you're a deceitful Jew at the end of your little rant. Who would have guessed? And like all Jews you block out the history that doesn't make you look good and lie about your own scripture in order to try and deceive the Goyim.	1644012156.0	hvmbvp7	t3_ski6o3	t1_hvm5xao	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ski6o3/its_that_bad/hvmbvp7/

ietztufx	No; for the most part if you're trying to wheel, you want your options to expire. The (most common) point in selling options is collecting premium, first and foremost.  Say you're selling puts on a stock that you wouldn't mind owning if it dropped to the strike price (this is important to me, because if your theory goes tits up, you don't want to be stuck holding a shit investment). If the premium is 1.00 ($100) per contract, you automatically make this return just by putting up collateral and just selling the contract.  Selling Puts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r\_rKof8IdfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_rKof8IdfU)  Selling Calls: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnTsQBJHMSk&t=434s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnTsQBJHMSk&t=434s)  This guy is really informative on the topic and will take you step by step through the process.

It is not easy to recover from cardiac tissue death, as measured by troponin levels in vaccinated men with heart palpitations or trouble breathing.   The vaccines are not a solution at all, being that a significant amount of hospitalizations are still occurring in fully vaccinated people.  We are already beyond the herd immunity thresholds set by Dr Fauci, and the virus is till spreading.  You do not get domain over another humans body, in order to protect others who have the ability to get vaccinated.  Once again, being unvaccinated does NOT impact vaccinated people, as they are "protected".  Once again, under normal circumstances, the rate of side effects would immediately have this product pulled from the market. Remember, the vaccines are *only* usable under Emergency Use Authorization, they do not have full FDA approval, as they have  it undergone phase 3 or 4 trials. The current rate of side effect would eliminate this drug from further consideration under normal circumstances.  Per Dr Fauci, the approval time for this new technology would be 10 years, and they need a pandemic to bypass regulations, as he stated on video in October 2019	1644279247.0	hw0kmb7	t3_smd9mz	t1_hw0b2uj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/smd9mz/the_orange_likes_the_taste_of_corporate_pfizer/hw0kmb7/

Even powerful men than run entire empires or cultural movements can‚Äôt handle it and puss out like Hitler, Kurt Cobain and Hemingway.   What are a few major Black leaders or icons that killed themselves?  White men and their ancestors have also never faced widespread oppression in US because of skin color, so they have less to cope with and still can‚Äôt manage.   Fucking.

mx2dn	In all seriousness, if you're someone who's suicidal after people explaining reality to you, you probably shouldn't be getting a sex change operation in the first place.  Opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one.   If someone expresses their opinion about a subject and it makes you suicidal, you need help. And I would argue, the help you needed before the sex change operation to begin with.  In my experience, most gay/trans whatever people were severely abused as a child. You need to get help before getting the operation, because the operation isn't going to help you. It's going to make things worse.	1644875091.0	hwykm6x	t3_ssfb6t	t3_ssfb6t	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ssfb6t/hmm/hwykm6x/

qx9qc	Well, time to put my AuthRight hat on.  I was under the impression we *weren't* supposed to feed into the delusions caused by mental illness, because they're *unhealthy*? Because, -spoiler alert- gender dysphoria *is* a mental illness, much like BIID, yet for some reason we're being told that we're supposed to tell those suffering from it that their delusions are real, and to reaffirm the voices in their head. This is as opposed to disorders schizophrenia, anorexia, *BIID,* and so on, where an integral part of treatment is getting the patient to realize that the delusions are, in fact, *delusions*. Refusing to do so gets you cancelled and shamed in much of the western world, if not outright arrested in some jurisdictions.  If transitioning/HRT/whatever was the magic bullet the trans community claims it is, they wouldn't have such a horrific rate of suicide. The suicide rates in the trans community don't seem to be any lower pre or post-op, either, suggesting that there's underlying issues to their condition that aren't improved by genital mutilation and experimental hormone therapy. Considering the comorbidity of GD with other disorders on the autism spectrum, as well as the prevalency of sexual assault or abuse -at least for FtMs- it does raise some interesting questions...  That and there's a significant and increasing amount of newcomers to the trans community who are being effectively indoctrinated. They're encouraged to cut away family and friends, destroy their own support network, and to join the cult-like communities that reach out to them when they're at their lowest. They've been known to engage in gaslighting and other toxic behavior to turn people against their loved ones, in order to groom them into the cult. Obviously not all trans communities are like this, but all one has to do is browse those on Reddit to see a trend.  As much as I just prefer to stay out of things, this is one issue that's been making me very nervous over the past few years. The orange left has steadily been eating their own, with the LGB part of the alphabet soup being pushed away in favor of TQ+ for not being "progressive enough". It's not a Slippery Slope fallacy when you're watching it play out in front of you.	1644875814.0	hwymczh	t3_ssfb6t	t3_ssfb6t	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ssfb6t/hmm/hwymczh/
