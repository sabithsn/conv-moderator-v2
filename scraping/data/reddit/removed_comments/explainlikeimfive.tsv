Though I have read about there being an odd lack of sneezing in performing artists.

isfx2dnk	Dissociation  Schizophrenia  Anxiety *hell*  HPPD  OCD  Paranoia  Brain zaps  Brainfog  Deja vus  Random delusions (yes, 2 months afterwards)  I mean, whatever. I had a full blown The Absolute enlightening experience on potent af *weed*. The emptiness and realization of non self was brutal and I wasn't ready at all. Left me dissociated and brainfogged for 8 years. Then did it again due to very intense love experiences in meditation and wanting an easier way to get into that state. Went full blown paranoia, brainfogged so hard I thought I was having a brain stroke, called an ambulance and left me so fucking hard dissociated afterwards to the point that I said to myself ''if it's going to be like this for the rest of my life, I won't be able to deal with this' '  The second time have me A LOT of compassion for those who suffer serious mental illnesses.  I'm still dissociated and brainfogged and it will never go away but the intensity has gone down at least. I still have moments it's really really fucking strong to the point I can't tell wtf is happening but I learned to shrug it off and just vibe with it.  But trust me, in the end, it was not worth it. I didn't get to experience the oneness and incomprehensible love I experienced in meditation once, instead, I had to go through all stages of grief in the span of 1 hour thinking I had severe brain damage.

97xacnpp	I don't think there are any serious ideas on this, only sound bites and talking points, but when you start to work though what it would look like, it fails, for the reasons you state, as well as others. Additionally, though you say it would be 'one time', once the gov taps a new source of money, it's never one time... BUT, even if it was on time, and you took all of it from the 1%, their complete total net worth, neverminding that it would actually crash markets, what would that value be, and how long would it fund the gov? Look at the total annual US budget, and if you took everything, how many days would that pay for? Not many...

6i3j4isk	LOL. Thanks so much for your concern! I only took out $42k and have been overpaying since my payments started, and also continued paying through the pandemic moratorium when I didn't have to. My loans will be paid off in another 3 years and given that I'm in my 40s, no, I won't die with them unpaid. I am not on IBR (don't need it) but I want the option to have it if something happened with my job, and I also want the security in place of having whatever I have left on the loans discharged if I die, so my assets don't have to go to paying off that debt.

z64m7	Much like Christianity, it depends on what group you are talking about.  The Satanic Temple has 7 fundamental tenets.  1. One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason. 2. The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions. 3. One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone. 4. The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own. 5. Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs. 6. People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused. 7. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.	1642803832.0	htnsm41	t3_s9mko8	t3_s9mko8	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9mko8/eli5_what_are_the_basic_beliefs_of_satanism/htnsm41/

ijuh5u70	Why run BLASTp and not BLAST?  Unrelated proteins have a chance of sharing certain sequences of amino acids. Imagine two enzymes, from a plant and an animal, converting substance A into substance B. The enzymes might be more or less similar but I'm willing to bet that the maximal similarity will be at the catalytic site where the enzyme must hold A in the right position for the reaction to happen.   DNA sequences are better suited to distinguish differences among closely related species or individuals.  I wonder if the researcher ran BLASTp and not BLAST because there's less similarity at DNA level...	1642808673.0	hto564j	t3_s9nzv3	t3_s9nzv3	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9nzv3/eli5_how_did_a_unique_moderna_genomic_sequence/hto564j/

i8lmj	Different chemicals all have a unique shape. In the US, the main chemical in weed that gets you high (delta-9 THC) is illegal. Delta-8 THC has a *slightly* different shape, so it affects your brain very similarly as delta-9 THC. However, because the shape is different, it's not the same, and wasn't made illegal. In fact, there a specific law that explicitly says it *is* federally legal, as long as it comes from hemp.  Since hemp plants make very little of it on their own, people take other similar chemicals and change it into delta-8 THC. Chemistry is usually easiest when your starting chemicals are pure, those are taken out of the plants and purified into an oil. After the chemistry is done, you also get a pure oil. This is what goes into the delta-8 products you see available.*  As far as medicinal properties, to my knowledge they are the same as regular delta-9 THC.  *It's also why you shouldn't ever buy delta-8 flower. It's not real, it's just delta-8 oil sprayed onto it. Just vape it instead.	1642812701.0	htof30j	t3_s9p1pn	t3_s9p1pn	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9p1pn/eli5_please_explain_what_delta_8_canna_honey_is_i/htof30j/

b8xeo	Here's another theory. The $ sign is a pole with a snake on it. Numbers 21. The Israelites were whining because the manna the Lord sent them didn't taste like bread right out of the oven. So the Lord sent poisonous "fiery serpents" to strike them down. Then he sent a cure, by having Moses create a serpent and hang it up on a pole. Many Christians suppose the serpent is a symbol of the devil, but here it's a symbol of Christ on the cross. In Nephi's commentary he explains that the Israelite tribes, or "nations" as he calls them, had only to look at it to be healed. It was the power of God that healed them; looking at the serpent was a filter to weed out people who were stubborn and wouldn't look. Anyway, the American founding fathers made this symbol in the hope that the new American money would heal the economy. It was a good thing. American money has boosted the economy of every nation on earth.	1642823122.0	htp3ozp	t3_s9cdm9	t3_s9cdm9	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9cdm9/eli5_why_is_there_a_cross_sign_in_most_of_the/htp3ozp/

8mv174bl	I think in general, the ability for salt (NaCl, ie, sodium chloride) to reduce bitterness of foods, and thus enhance flavor components like sweetness, savory, etc. is why it’s so great -   and I think this is largely attributed to the Sodium ions within the salt, interacting with, or diluting, the more bitter and alkaline compounds within the food. this then reduces that bitter taste and seemingly enhances sweetness, and other flavors.	1642873187.0	htrml1q	t3_sa7g02	t3_sa7g02	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sa7g02/eli5_why_is_salt_so_important_for_flavor/htrml1q/

And the way you copied and pasted it as if it speaks for itself is kind of douchey.  Go read the actual study and see that lobsters scored the highest rating in the ability to feel pain. Page 42, Table 3, Criterion 4. Very high confidence that Lobsters meet Criterion 4.  Page 49 explains Criterion 4 as "*The animal possesses an endogenous neurotransmitter system that modulates* ***(in a way consistent with the experience of pain,*** *distress or harm) its responses to threatened or actual noxious stimuli;*"  Page 12 describes noxious stimuli as "*extreme heat, extreme acidity or alkalinity,*   *toxins, or breaks to the skin)"*  You got shrekt.

One other anti-anxiety that's not an antidepressant and not a benzodiazepine is buspirone. I don't think it hits like a benzodiazepine but that's probably why it's not so fast to form dependence.	1642902258.0	httm76w	t3_sahkl1	t3_sahkl1	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sahkl1/eli5_why_does_it_feel_off_when_something_thats/httm76w/

8hw4n	No, it is worse. It is purpose-built so it is practically impossible to “comparison shop,” or even find out what providers pay for things. Hospitals purchase their supplies through purchasing associations, who  1. Add another layer of profit on top of already bloated prices  2. Can conceal actual costs as “trade secrets.”  So when the hospital charges you $8 for a single Tylenol, there’s no way to know if the hospital paid  $.01 or $7.99. The lack of transparency prevents the existence of a competitive market and keeps prices high. Keeping in mind, in many situations in health care the consumer does not have the luxury of researching the most cost-effective treatment options, following a car wreck or heart attack.	1642908277.0	httzxiu	t3_saftzs	t1_httnmy2	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/saftzs/eli5_united_states_why_are_drug_retail_prices/httzxiu/

7jrdfj30	Well actually Germans are extremely aware of their own history and have very open education and discourse on it, and having lived there during the Trump years, when a lot of the national political dialogue was about the rising fascist and now Nazi parties in and outside Germany - I would say that is a pretty valuable conversation to be a part of. I also marched in an anti fascist protest in Berlin.  Also I am in the field of education, so I know how they teach their own political history to new generation, which is very openly critical about fascism.	1642909105.0	htu1rmk	t3_sajuw6	t1_htu1cr9	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htu1rmk/

85d20rn5	I don't know the scientifics behind it, but as someone who takes adderall for my adhd I can explain how it helps.  It's not that doesn't make you more hyperactive, it does, but it allows you to focus that hyperproductivity to one task as opposed to multiple.   It's hard to explain but normally I can't sit at my computer and do schoolwork for no more than 5 minutes maybe before I get distracted by something else, sometimes miniscule shit but still a distraction. And when I take the aderall those distractions tend to happen less frequently and I can sit down and focus my energy to one thing for potentially an hour depending on the day.   You still have the energy but the stimulants help you to focus it on one productive avenue as opposed to multiple like my brain normally does.   I.e. I used to have about 100 projects on the go in my garage, I would start building or cleaning something, and then get distracted away from it and it just sits there for months lol. Once I started taking stimulants now I can actually maintain focus on the project and find it easier to come back to it, almost like it's addicting to be doing what I'm doing, which normally wouldn't be the case.	1642909691.0	htu34sm	t3_sak7ci	t3_sak7ci	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sak7ci/eli5_why_are_people_with_adhd_often_prescribed/htu34sm/

Also, i've hear from numerous sources that ever since the Nazi's waged genocide, Germany really does go out of its way to focus a lot of school time to learning about the rise of racism, how it works, how it happened, how to never let it happen again.  It is actually true that the average German is an expert on facism; being from Germany does mean that you know more about facism that the average person and certainly than probably the vast majority of Americans no matter how up to speed they are on Republican/Fox news talking points about how to claim you are not facist.	1642910058.0	htu415q	t3_sajuw6	t1_htu1rmk	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htu415q/

ex4ca	This is the exact opposite of the truth. I'm always surprised that people can be so poorly educated, yet here we stand.  Here's a good explanation of the basic tenets, origins, and examples of socialism from encyclopedia Britannica: https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism  Hitler's Nazi party, after the Night of The Long Knives (where Rohm and many potential adversaries were murdered) never espoused any sort of ideology or practices that could be remotely described as socialist. I think you'll agree after reading a bit about what socialism is, and perhaps a bit more about Nazi leadership.  Not only was it callous and murderous, but it promoted private business ownership and created massive wealth for many people. So the antithesis of socialism.  Anyway, off to do your homework.

4adwc	Monopolies are illegal since they are bad for humanities.  An exception for a time is made to this since in the form of patents since that can also be bad as the investor can cost recover although market lead should enable this anyway.  So patents run contrary to the idea of capitalist competition and the overarching illegality of monopolies beyond Government based coercive monopolies (eg Utilities where all the population must be supplied even at subsidy and not just the highly profitable niches)  The thing that is often forgotten that operating a business is not a right. It's a boon in exchance for taxes and FULL complicance with the laws of the entity granting the boon. Even the legal personhood of companies is just another boon. A pretence of personhood in order to serve a limited purpose (ownership, able to be sued, etc.)  If not for the corruptness of many people in Government lots of these companies would not only have their artifical monopoly exemption removed but they would be de-registered and loose their artifical deeming of personhood.	1642915929.0	htugnke	t3_saftzs	t1_httvr5d	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/saftzs/eli5_united_states_why_are_drug_retail_prices/htugnke/

f8pmm	>Hitler was big government. In modern terms that makes him left wing.    Banning abortion = regulation = big government = left-wing.  Border control = government employees = big government = left-wing.  Banning "critical race theory" = censorship = big government = left-wing.  Regulating gender transition = regulating what you can put in your body = big government = left-wing.  Single-family zoning = regulating what you can build on your own property = big government = left-wing.  I could keep going, but I believe I've made my point, namely that if you honestly believe that *government doing things = left-wing*, then you're to the right of literally every single politician to have ever held office for any reason, other than to destroy the very office they hold (e.g. Scott Pruitt and Betsy DeVos).

exw5d	Fascists changed their ideological labels rapidly early on in order to attract as many people as possible, but in practice they did most of their *successful* recruiting from the right (more specifically, from disaffected conservatives who believed that the mainstream conservatives of their day were too weak and tepid), which is why they ultimately embraced framing themselves as the furthest-right option.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_and_ideology):  > Mussolini took these electoral gains as an indication that his right-wing strategy paid off, and decided that the Fascists would sit on the extreme right side of the amphitheatre where parliament met. He also used his first speech in parliament to take a "reactionary" stance, arguing against collectivization and nationalization, and calling for the post office and the railways to be given to private enterprise.  > Prior to Fascism's accommodation of the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members. After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.	1642917468.0	htujfwp	t3_sajuw6	t1_htugyvp	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htujfwp/

12kpyp	The scary thing is I think that a lot of the early Fascists were actually sincere - they did believe what the espoused, and were working for "the people". It's just that they were working for THEIR people (Germans, Italians, what have you), and most of "the people" were more than happy to go along with that because they benefitted, at the expense of "the other people" (Jews, Gypsies and Jehovah's Witnesses to name an alliterative few).  I think modern "Fascism" is more duplicitous, and serves a select few by utilising popularism in the way you outline. Which is also terrifying...

c69b46mb	'The entirety of National socialism was based on Marx' -Hitler.  No, you read a lie that validated your defence of Karl Marx, a man who called people "Jewish N*****" and called for "The emancipation of society from Judaism" via "Despotic inroads" and "the Guillotine".  If you're comfortable defending Marx knowing this, and you're comfortable rationalising that an ideology that calls for the extermination of the Jews is fundamentally different to an ideology of the same name that also calls for the extermination of the Jews, then sleep well at night.  But if you have even a shadow of a doubt that you might be on the side of an evil ideology, then I beg you to research this	1642919723.0	htuncy7	t3_sajuw6	t1_htumr5i	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuncy7/

inmhu0py	Because they were socialists. Just nationalistic m. Fascism and socialism have a lot in common like one party authoritarian regimes that use fear and division to keep society on line/subordinate. Both highly tout public ownership > private. Where western socialists promote the unification of subjugated groups against privatization nationalist socialists do the exact opposite and promote the socialization for a specific sect against others. Really socialism makes those against the empowerment of the state for communist ends its enemies where fascists get to the empowered state by making enemies of those against the nation. It’s the difference between say the unvaccinated being linked to being the enemies of the state/society vs a only a certain religious or race being described as those worthy of being the state/nation.	1642920090.0	htunxxd	t3_sajuw6	t3_sajuw6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htunxxd/

A few regrettable statements doesn't automatically invalidate everything proposed by one of humankind's most influential economists and philosophers. Nothing about Marx's economic theory requires racial bigotry, trying to tie the two together to invalidate the former is textbook ad hominem and wouldn't be allowed in intellectual debate.   Let me put it this way, if you're comfortable defending the US Constitution knowing that most of the people who wrote it owned and sexually exploited slaves, you're rationalizing and condoning a moral worldview that endorses owning people as property based on race and the sexual exploitation and rape of said property.

13ca87	Modern right wing politics involved us in an endless war on terror, spending trillions of dollars. Modern right wing politics attempts to infringe upon a woman's right to get an abortion. Modern right wing politics started the drug war, which is almost certainly by your definition "big government." Modern right wing politics is the reason you can't buy an automatic weapon. Reagan signed that bill. Modern right wing politics tried to stop the legalization of gay marriage, and actively attempts to stop gay people from adopting children. Modern right wing politics is currently attempting to implement barriers to voting, so they can lower voter participation. Modern right wing politics doesn't give a shit about individual liberty, they only care about corporations and whipping their religious fanatical base into a frenzy, usually on the basis of bigotry.  Alright so now onto your points. I said preserving, not conserving. He was ultra nationalist, saying Germany was the greatest country on earth, invested heavily into military spending and militarization, and idolized the past image of the German people. The term "3rd Reich" is based on inhereting the right to rule from the HRE (1st Reich) and The German Empire (2nd Reich.) He absolutely was hell bent on conserving German culture and heritage. That was like his entire schtick. His hatred of the Jews was based on the fact that he believed the Jews were controlling too much of German society when it should be pure blooded Germans who should run society.	1642920697.0	htuovwx	t3_sajuw6	t1_htui6is	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuovwx/

y93q6	Dude has no idea what he's talking about. Russia hasn't been communist in name in decades and even longer in practice. It's a kleptocratic oligarchy where the rich and powerful siphon off billions in public wealth and let the peasants wallow in poverty and decaying infrastructure.   It's the exact situation that on paper Communism seeks to avoid, but Russian society is built on corruption and authoritarian governance and that shit is stronger than philosophical ideals.    But to answer your question, socialism is a vague term used to describe governments with heavy social safety nets, worker protections, and state owned public corporations. To give an example, a socialist economy may have one government controlled oil company, like Venezuela or Norway, whose profits are used to pay for government services instead of a bunch of private for profit oil companies that make a few people very rich. Communism is the extremist far left form of economic organization where private ownership of capital and the means of production are completely banned and the state owns it all. There's no private oil companies, or any companies, allowed. There's no rich people, but there's also no "poor" people. Everyone is allocated the same amount and quality of stuff, and nobody is left wanting for anything, at least on paper.   In practice, the societies that have experienced extreme enough situations to swing that far towards communism have waaaaay too much baggage to actually pull it off and it ends up drowning in corruption and authoritarian government abuse. Not that those are traits/outcomes exclusive to communism, there's plenty of free market capitalist countries that end up with the exact same kind of guy in charge thanks to said societal baggage.	1642921145.0	htupk9s	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuo3l9	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htupk9s/

Of course, in periods when the political state as such is born violently out of civil society, when political liberation is the form in which men strive to achieve their liberation, the state can and must go as far as the abolition of religion, the destruction of religion. But it can do so only in the same way that it proceeds to the abolition of private property, to the maximum, to confiscation, to progressive taxation, just as it goes as far as the abolition of life, the guillotine.	1642921848.0	htuqlrk	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuqjjr	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuqlrk/

xjsd4	Yes. The Russian revolution, the Soviet Union, Stalin, eastern European socialism… all that was a massive propaganda campaign running decades long to smear socialism.  Tbf, there has been propaganda for sure, but it hasn’t been 1 way only. An entire generation of intellectuals in the interwar period as well as right after ww2, were socialists. People like Oppenheimer, for instance. How could they not be? They witnessed the great Depression, and they hoped to build a better world.   It was the reality of socialist life in the Soviet Union, and many years later the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that changed their minds. Socialism became a dirty word.   Sure enough, we are in an era similar to the 1920s, with great income disparity, injustice, upheaval. So it’s not surprising that socialism is fashionable again. “We’ve never tried it,” right?	1642922608.0	hturp7j	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuk601	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/hturp7j/

It works damn well too, hence why so many are opposed to socialist ideals. That being said, any one political ideology is shit on its own, including socialism. I believe the only way for a country to be a good nation is to draw ideas from different political ideologies and implement them together. Way harder said than done, but Germany today is a good example of a country that does it. It can work, and to say "socialism ruined my country" is just wrong.

dcb7w58x	I mean, in pure Marxist-Leninist terms, it absolutely was socialist as the means of production were owned collectively through state. The fact that it turned into what some refer to as “state capitalism” is inevitable when the ideology calls for a massive government that owns everything and expects the government to magically wither away as everyone is a pure soul and wishes nothing but communism and equality for all.

j02r9	That's a narrow definition of "superior". A system can be better for the people but not be implemented for any number of reasons, including outside interference.  For example, I work IT for small businesses. Some of those businesses use bad practices like using RDP to access their server. A better (read: superior) system would be for them to use a remote viewer, like TeamViewer, but they still use RDP.  It's not that using TeamViewer is the "worse" option, it's that people choose to use the worse option for one reason or another—maybe they don't understand why RDP is bad, or in a few specific cases there's some "friend of a friend" who "totally knows computers" convincing them to continue the bad practice.  The point of this extended analogy being: you're basically asking people why they don't make perfectly correct decisions all the time. I guess the answer is, have you *met* people?	1642925076.0	htuv2s3	t3_sajuw6	t1_htutncl	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuv2s3/

They had programs for alcoholics to get clean, focused on rehabilitations of criminals and provided benefits for ex-cons who completed their sentence, so they could become productive members of society. They funded holidays for all workers. They were implementing a universal healthcare system.  Kind of sad when the fucking Nazis could do that shit 80 years ago.

544tkzob	Well I guess I’d say I take issue with the claim that no one is arguing for the US to veer that hard into socialism. Politically speaking yes, I think very few people are advocating any more than a more Nordic model like system. But in terms of political discourse, especially on sites like Reddit, a lot of people absolutely are.  The sub which takes its name from late stage capitalism is openly communist and they regularly joke about slaughtering anyone they consider to be bourgeoise. The antiwork sub hits the front page all of the time and they push people to take actions in real life that could actually cause a lot of problems as some sort of stand against capitalism.  It’s honestly kind of a problem. I’m all for more social programs, but reasoned and nuanced debate on those topics rapidly gets drowned out by tankies looking to farm karma, and I think that does real damage to efforts to actually get some of these social programs enacted.  Go to any politics thread and most of the comments will be about how Biden is actually a Reagan style conservative and Bernie is barely center left, and people should give up on voting for democrats because they just Aw corrupt as republicans. All of those people are openly lobbying against the possibility of improving the USs social infrastructure because it doesn’t fit whatever weird revolutionary fantasy they have in their head.	1642926521.0	htux0j1	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuwci7	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htux0j1/

o6oz9	It's clear that a jolly old man flying through the winter night behind a train of jingling caribou is not from the Bible. Nor are glittering trees or ribbon-wrapped boxes. That image comes together in a poem written by an New York Episcopalian (a slave owner who thought Jefferson's rationalism was a threat to Christianity). American Santa Claus is a blending of many European characters, enhanced with an American consumerist aesthetic.  Traditions involving saints are often masks for pagan rituals. New World Santeria is an example where we can still see both elements, but many European saints are euphemisms for older deities of the areas where they're revered. Christian colonialism couldn't eradicate the beliefs of the people they converted; they were adapted to serve the same purposes in forms acceptable to church authority.	1643183432.0	hu9ou4s	t3_scziyz	t1_hu9n04z	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scziyz/eli5_why_we_keep_things_like_santa_claus_and_the/hu9ou4s/

I can recall the words and the sentence structure, but when I start trying to form the words, I get tongue-tied trying to pronounce it in a Japanese way.

It also requires you to be able to construct sentences from scratch which means grammatical structure, conjugation, and also figuring out which vocabulary words best convey your thoughts. When you listen to a sentence, by contrast, the grammatical structure and conjugation work has already been done by someone else. Even if you don’t know a vocabulary word you hear, you can get the gist of its meaning from the context of the conversation.	1643212394.0	hub27o5	t3_scum5q	t3_scum5q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/scum5q/eli5_how_can_people_understand_a_foreign_language/hub27o5/

You can tell by how you said "every time", but I didn't, or how you don't seem to know that on many cars there is only one fuse for both headlights, so a headlight naturally wearing out doesn't result in both headlights going out, while a burned out fuse does.  It's also clear that you don't understand the kind of damage that can be done to a complex circuit like an ECU or TCM if it loses primary power while it's still connected to other fully powered modules, causing an expensive and catastrophic (if not dangerous) failure.

You start out by demonstrating that you don't even know what a strawman is, then proceed to completely ignore the point that was made, which was that a fuse can take out *both* headlights at once (and suddenly).  After that, you continue to demonstrate your complete ignorance (at least you admit it) about how electronics work while still giving your (now, admittedly!) uninformed and thus useless opinion on how they work!  Twice!  Then you finish up with another 6 year old attempt at an insult.

pj8sq	So, there are actually **two** kinds of accounting firms, and they do different things.  One type of accounting firm does things like pay bills and book invoices and prepare financial statements. It's actually more common for *medium* and smaller firms to use these kinds of accounting firms. Bigger companies often do this work in-house, though they may *centralize* it, so there's one office where all the accounting is done, even when the company has multiple locations.   The other type of accounting firm is an **auditing** firm. Those firms are engaged to *review* a company's existing books and financial statements for accuracy and completeness. They don't actually "do" the accounting for a company, but they *certify* that the company's financial statements and reports are correctly stated, not leaving anything out or misrepresenting anything.   When a company has investors, or stockholders, or even has large loans to a bank, those parties (the bank, the stockholders, the investors) want to have assurances that the company's financial reporting is true and accurate, so the company hires 3rd party outside firm to audit and certify their accounting. Any publicly-traded company **must** do this as a condition for being able to offer their stock.	1643230293.0	hucgii1	t3_sdf8f0	t3_sdf8f0	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sdf8f0/eli5_why_do_big_companies_get_their_accounting/hucgii1/

fp2so	On top of the good answer from Ajreil, I just wanted to clarify some terminology you seem to be confused by:  **Tastes** (traditionally salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, arguably more too) are what you seem to be talking about. And you're right! Minty (or rather, the cooling sensation associated with mint) has a good argument to be included as a taste.  **Flavours** are everything else. They are more complex combinations of tastes and aromas. Minty is definitely already considered to be a flavour; anything you put in your mouth has a flavour even if it's unpleasant or inedible. Flavour is just the word for the experience of eating something (excluding some things like texture, temperature, etc.). Chicken *flavour* is a thing. Chicken *taste* is not.	1643238427.0	hud2ii3	t3_sdidcf	t3_sdidcf	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sdidcf/eli5_why_arent_minty_menthol_flavors_considered/hud2ii3/

cxvtw	In addition to the other comments (which I agree with), "extreme" is highly relative.  If you were born & grew up in the Arctic, you're perfectly well adapted to cold living and California is stupid insane hot and it seems "extreme". If you grew up in Dubai you learned how to keep cool, not to do hard work at high noon, and you'd think France was freezing about half the time.  I went to grad school in Boston with a guy from Thailand; he'd never left Thailand until he came to Boston in August (which is cool for Thailand but not stupid cold).

I don't know man the shit just seems mind blowing to me when I think about it ngl.   So then the time as we know it as is pointless?   I see.... interesting thing to note actually. Humans make up things to make sense of it. Well I get that, but that begs the question. Again, how do we know we're "correct" about it.

Even the Russian alphabet involves some form of the 26 letters we know.   Ok cool and I get that. But again, you say it's basic arithmetics.  But you actually pointing out just by what I mean which people seem to ignore. HOW COME it is that way. Like if it's just a universal thing of life how do we just know this. You literally saying it's that way because it's that way doesn't really provide explaination, except it just is. So how do we know what we perceive as 2 is actually 2 and 2 plus 2 = 4. I get now that we as humans come up with shit to explain or put it in simpler terms but interesting how no one really answered the whole 2 bit.  Hmn fair enough.   Perhaps.

dvz4dm3p	And why jews got them selves a nuclear wapons.. if someone remember nuclear wepons convention, wat was after ww2.. there was a resolution, that its too many nukes and we must restrict theme.. thous who allready have them, they kan keep, and no other country cannot own nukes.. and also there was couple of countries, from who was taken away weapons, what will basically guarantee that nobody will not invade your territory.. ukraine and belarus was told that your region is not stable to preserv nukes, and if something will happen, we are going to protect you... Now everyone has seen what happened with a crimea.. did someone protect ukraine???  But this is not the point i was madeing... My question is how the hell jews manage to get nucs for israel?!? If convention stated that nobody else cant develop or own nukes besides those countrys who allready had them before...   In our society is understandable that money is a problem sover.. and thous dudes own most of it... But if we analize region of ukraine and belarus at the time of nuke convention and compare it to israel... Then its obvious that israel is not stabel and historically newer was... Lets take a look just what they have done with palestinians and their people.. thei have no more home and country, they dont have freedom, their homes, rights and everything is taken by jews, whos occuping every single day their home, houses, territory, killing and murdering innocent palestinians.. and no one ever mention it it mainstream media or forcing them sanction like they do with russia... Well from my point of wiev crimea cant be even compared with crimes that was made by jews in past and what still is happening against palestinians.. and yet israel has no sanktsions or restrictions what so ever, instead they got them selves a nuklear weapons.... Seems to me as double standard shit...

16lq7d	don't know if anyone else has mentioned it, but it's important to remember that the idea of "race" and "races" are all made up.  They mean whatever a society wants it to mean.  It can ebb and flow and change usually to whatever is convenient for the oppressing group to justify their continued oppression of whatever group they're oppressing.     So whenever someone says "I'm not racist 'cuz Mexican is not a race!", understand it's a giant troll.  "racist" is just a word used to describe the antagonizing oppression of a different group - even if that group is grouped together in completely made up ways.  Jews, especially for the likes of Ben Shapiro and Stephen Miler, are "white" - they're the in-group, which is why those two think they're safe and can do the oppressing of others.

7wynlqxe	I have a whole novel of things to say about this.. I lived with a partner who experienced hypnagasia.  Never before living in this house nor after living this house had I experienced the kind of demonic activity that had gone on in my life. It has changed me in my opinion on ghost spiritual things and religion altogether.  The reason they only see scary things is because it is demonic activity.  Whenever I was living with my ex one night I was laying in the bed and trying to go to sleep. Her 2-year-old son came into the room and I tried to reach down and pick him up from the side of the bed but I suddenly couldn't move. He shot into a figure of light that went through the ceiling and it startled me and I looked towards my ex and she had turned into something that looked like baraka from mortal Kombat as far as the teeth went and was spitting blood in my face and laughing at me.  I said three times in the name of Jesus that this would have to stop because it was the only thing I could think of to say. Everything went away and I gained complete control back of my body and I immediately woke her up and told her that I had one of her hypnagogic experiences and she was very ugly to me and just told me to go back to bed.  I had another experience that was very similar and after I moved out of there and went and visited a church and got baptized I was feeling a hell of a lot better.  After living there my head was full of junk I was always depressed and things just never seemed right even if they were going good on the outside.  People can believe whatever they want and some people have even said that maybe I have a psychosis. For the record I do use psychedelic drugs and have no issues using them. My mind is always completely sound and I'm always very capable of conversation with friends and family. I'm usually the one that they go to for advice when any kind of experimenting goes on.  I have no history of using any kind of psychiatric medications or any other kind of issues. I'm telling you demonic activity is real.	1643850093.0	hvctxto	t3_sj2b46	t3_sj2b46	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sj2b46/eli5_why_do_people_with_sleep_paralysis_only/hvctxto/

Interest in retrogaming has been on the rise for about 10 years I'd say and the interest grew rapidly with the pandemic. Around 5 years ago I'd commonly find original Xbox games selling for $1-2 a piece that now would sell for $20 each minimum. At that point, the Xbox had already been discontinued for about 8 years. You have certain sought after titles that go for $100+ now that were half the price pre-pandemic. I bought an N64 and Dreamcast with accessories for about $50 each right before the pandemic started; what are those running now?	1643870565.0	hve16js	t3_sjb3ok	t3_sjb3ok	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjb3ok/eli5_why_do_commonly_used_items_such_as_crts_or/hve16js/

f0qigrkk	In fairness that kind of wasteful spending is necessary to preserve to industrial capacity needed to go to war. If nobody is shooting our planes down we don’t need to make many to keep the strength up. But we do need to know how to make many because someone might start shooting them down one day. If that happens it’s no use not being able to tool up because the skilled workers and interconnected industries don’t exist.  As a military superpower the US likes to subsidize strategic industries by giving them pointless orders to fulfill. They then have to offload all the surplus, usually as foreign aid (giving Israel money to spend at US defence contractors for example).	1643872400.0	hve3ym5	t3_sj7545	t1_hve29zf	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sj7545/eli5_when_do_planes_reach_the_end_of_their_life/hve3ym5/

7d4lg8ij	As I understand it, in the West, since say 1900 people who think they are far smarter than they are able to demonstrate thinks a few things: That government by controlling monetary policy can stave off the worst parts of the economic downturns, and that deflation is the worst thing in the entire world.   When these people got power in Central banks they took their wealth of knowledge to focus on inflation with the belief that by controlling it, letting it exist but at a small level they can stay away from deflation.   These wizards of smart at the Fed managed to create a recession inside of the Depression, and prolong the depression by years.   These same geniuses were happy enough to let inflation run rampant in the late 60s and early 70s instead of using their monetary policy to kill the inflation.   TLDR; we have inflation because central banks say we have to have inflation.	1643900718.0	hvfdzr3	t3_sjk7j5	t3_sjk7j5	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjk7j5/eli5_why_is_inflation_necessary/hvfdzr3/

etbs1	It depends.  Do you want to keep your apartment? Then you keeping paying your rent. If you can't pay your rent, then your landlord can probably go through the process to get you evicted.  For what happens to all your stuff, hirer movers/storage space to move and store it all until you get out. Gonna be in for too long and can't afford that? store it at families place or sell it off.  Utilities and tv/phone/internet bills can often get cancelled pretty easily if you are going to prison. Maybe if you are in a contract youll have to pay a fee, but you if you are going away for a while you should probably cancel your phone plan anyways.	1643906914.0	hvfugpu	t3_sjnsre	t3_sjnsre	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjnsre/eli5_what_happens_to_all_my_things_if_i_go_to/hvfugpu/
dfxub	Well, the world just goes in without you really. So you either pay your bills from prison, set up something before you're incarcerated, or default on the bills when they arent paid.

(unless they've done some really bad stuff, but even then murders get out on bail)  This would give you time to get your affairs in order (put your stuff in storage ect)  Also just because you're in jail doesn't mean you've fallen completely off the face of the earth, you can still contact the outside world.	1643907189.0	hvfv8c1	t3_sjnsre	t3_sjnsre	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjnsre/eli5_what_happens_to_all_my_things_if_i_go_to/hvfv8c1/

j7f7r	Not necessarily. You will be evicted if you, or a trusted friend, doesn't pay the rent, in which case your stuff is abandoned if no one picks it up. But you can have someone collect your belongings for storage if you can't afford rent/are going away long enough that the apartment doesn't matter.   If you go to prison it's possible to keep all possessions as long as they are not evidence or purchased with money related to the crime.

j92hedpx	American prices are rising because we’re no longer producing our own supply of oil and natural gas. Biden stopped that all and no new drilling is allowed.  We’re importing everything.  Their reasoning is that the rising costs will help provide incentive to people to switch from gasoline to oil. Well, how can that be when our savings accounts were going towards paying the energy bills and gasoline bills?  I was paying 400/month on gas, I finally sucked it up and bought a Tesla for 60k with a loan and it was almost not going to happen because I was eating my savings paying for gasoline.

n03e7	What you were saying makes sense. I often think about how real estate works, when buying a home here in the United States you are looking at roughly 6% to cover all the fees and commissions. I don’t understand why there aren’t flat fees to begin with because the paperwork work is relatively the same whether it’s a cheap one bedroom or a fancy 5-bedroom home in a nicer neighborhood. Look at all the crypto exchanges making serious bank by charging a commission on activity instead of a flat fee. The "work" is literally the same regardless of the dollar amount involved.	1643924843.0	hvh6rge	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh6rge/
quide	From what i got people that work service over there get paid absolutely horrible and absolutely depend on the tip money. Thats why they have a whole other tiping culture.  Compared to lets say a random country in europe or wherever where hourly pay might be regulated and "okay" so they can still have a life. It seems to be much harder in the us.	1643924862.0	hvh6tb9	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh6tb9/
j53cmiyn	It's what the tipping culture settled on. The assumption is probably that the more food you order, the more service is required to bring that stuff to you. That, and some places require tips to be split.  That, and settling on a flat amount would be awkward. Who decides it? Do we standardize it? Who gets to keep watch that every restaurant follows that? Is it not going to screw the customer when you order a 5$ item but have to tip.. 5$?? How would tipping 5$ on a 250$ meal for 6 look like? Do we need a tipping chart now, with different tips for different price ranges?  It's a headache. Paying proportionally to what you order makes more sense.	1643924961.0	hvh730q	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh730q/
37mvz	Because it's the simplest shortcut to approximate effort while setting an expectation that all easily understand, in terms of being the customer or worker relying on it for income. In general, the higher the bill, the more involved the service whether it's quantitative (serving a big table lots of food at a cheap place) or qualitative (high end service at a fancy place). Too much complexity would just confuse everybody and make it harder, more stressful to dine out or get other services. Sure there are edge cases where the cost and service don't quite match up, but it makes the system simpler for the 98% of the time it does.	1643924963.0	hvh738w	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh738w/

xgkc2	We'll skip over the fact that the whole system over here is f-ed up.  The *general* idea is that a restaurant has an average price per plate, and a larger table has a larger total bill.    Of course, you are right that it doesn't stand up to variations in individual orders.  Also, it means that a waitress at a diner is making less per person than a waitress at a fancy steakhouse.  While the server at the steakhouse might know a *little* more, or give *somewhat* better service, the difference in work is smaller than the difference in pay.  Oops, guess we didn't skip that "system is f-ed part"...	1643925231.0	hvh7teq	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh7teq/
cn2m5	In some cases you don’t need to tip them but it’s a shitty situation … the restaurant chooses not to pay them so you now are forced to do it.  They make it blatantly obvious and as a good human being how could you leave someone in duress like that.  Every county in the world has figured out how to provide you with a low cost high quality meal and still pay their employees properly … the US just doesn’t care to change.	1643925235.0	hvh7tst	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh7tst/
63z10zy5	You tip based on service. If you enjoyed the service 20% or more if you’re feeling generous. I’m a waitress and rely on tips but if I’m given shitty service you’re getting a shitty tip.

ikqyd	The problem with tipping culture in the US is that waitstaff can be paid under the minimum wage (federal minimum for waitstaff is $2.13/hr). Tipping isn't really about how great of a service they gave anymore, it's about offloading the waitstaff's paycheck onto the customers.   Higher bill typically means more food, which means more work for the waitstaff, and therefore higher pay.	1643925331.0	hvh831v	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh831v/

13phcg	Yeah I guess it makes more sense in that case.  But the percentage is also a headache. When I first moved to the US, I lived in a low cost of living area and everybody tipped around 10%. And when I moved to a bigger city, I tipped 10% and the waiter pursued me and asked for more.	1643925423.0	hvh8bpj	t3_sjv8ux	t1_hvh730q	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh8bpj/
f8nxr	The history of why we tip is interesting, but the basics of how much is based upon what the government says minimum wage for tipping is and how much a person needs to earn in tips to get to actual minimum wage.    If you think about how much time and effort goes into dropping a burger and fries on the table with a bottle of ketchup vs. bringing appetizers, salads, discussing wine selection, opening the wine, bringing your main meal, coffee, perhaps dessert - you get much more time involved at the expensive restaurant, and the servers are not flipping the tables as quickly.  You can likely serve 3-4 cheap meals in the same time it takes to do a leisurely nice meal.  And people going for nice dinners linger.  You are not just paying for service - but time at your table as well.    Based on the origins of tipping - it should be abolished, but I can tell you as a former server - I wouldn't do that job for minimum wage or even slightly more.  Because it sucks.  It is a lot of work and people are not always very nice.  Restaurants would need to raise the prices of food a LOT to pay enough to keep servers.  One of the perks of being a server is the instant gratification of tips, and being able to directly affect how much that is by the quality of your work.	1643925655.0	hvh8xnu	t3_sjv8ux	t3_sjv8ux	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjv8ux/eli5_why_do_we_tip_by_percentage/hvh8xnu/

m9lij	Basically, the idea is that if you order a lot more items, you've made more work for the waiter, and thus they should be paid more. So if you have a larger bill, the waiter should earn more money from having worked harder. Using a percentage of the bill is a decent way to estimate this, even if it isn't going to be the most accurate way of measuring how hard the waiter worked.	1643925891.0	hvh9jwm	t3_sjvp18	t3_sjvp18	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjvp18/eli5_why_is_it_in_america_that_recommended/hvh9jwm/

17fl9e	Basically it's so you get better service the more you pay. If it was a flat rate, say $20. Then the server at Applebee's would make the same as a server at a fine steakhouse. I might spend $50 at Applebee's but $250 at a steakhouse. With percentage based I would tip far more at the steakhouse.   Typically I wouldn't expect much of my Applebee's server. But at a fancy steakhouse I would absolutely expect the server to be top-notch with detailed knowledge of the menu and beverages (like wine or bourbon pairings). So they should make more, based on the total cost of the meal.   Should we just pay a higher hourly rate and skip tipping altogether...? Yeah absolutely.

Drugs, weapons, propaganda, and various other things can be used to destabilize countries.

zjxhh	In a word, control. In two words, control and money.   Assuming you aren’t smuggling something that is itself illegal (e.g. drugs) then the problem is that they cannot tax or regulate the transit of the goods.

36jcv470	Imports are typically taxed to incentivize buying from local sources, so taxes would be lost on regular items being smuggled. Other items are usually being smuggled because they are banned products in a country. Drugs are a good example of this. Certain natural items may be banned to prevent the import of disease or agricultural pests that will negatively harm food production or the general population. Authoritarian governments may ban the import of information through tv, internet, and books so those would be smuggled.	1643930308.0	hvhkrtp	t3_sjxeaa	t3_sjxeaa	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sjxeaa/eli5_why_is_smuggling_illegal/hvhkrtp/

9s5ya	What? No. Are you trying to educate me on my own disorder? The disorder I've lived with and researched fir the last 21 years of my life? The tics ARE the syndrome. It's entirely relevant. Nobody who has this does what they do for attention, or any kind of unconscious bias. It causes physical pain and discomfort, and makes being in social situations incredibly awkward and uncomfortable. It is a genetic disorder that has nothing to do with what you want or don't want to do. It is entirely disconnected from your subconscious, and even to an extent your conscious, self. It is nigh uncontrollable.	1643990574.0	hvkq0v7	t3_skfope	t1_hvknqia	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/skfope/eli5_why_do_people_with_tourettesyndrom_modt/hvkq0v7/

37ymx	A lot of restaurant work just straight up sucks. It's straight up hard and stressful work. If you're back in the kitchen then it's just a constant stream of orders that you're trying to keep up with, and if you work in the front then you're dealing with dozens/hundreds of people over the course of your shift and a decent number of them are  entitled jackasses.   Then add in that in general restaurants are low-margin businesses, so the pay typically isn't that great, and if you're waiting tables, then most of the money you're going to make is tip based so even less predictable.   Basically, these days most people don't want to work at restaurants unless they can't find anything better. Since the economy has been opening back up and lots of places are looking for workers, it's not that hard to find something better these days.   So restaurants either need to hope the overall situation for workers returns to the 'old normal' soon, or they'll have to make their jobs more appealing (through better conditions and/or better pay).	1643995159.0	hvl2ido	t3_skgyq2	t3_skgyq2	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/skgyq2/eli5_how_are_restaurants_in_dire_need_of_work_but/hvl2ido/

d7w0h	Most of the time, it's probably going to be that the OS had run out of memory (RAM) and had to start paging things to disk (SSD/HDD).  Working in RAM is much faster. When you run out of RAM what happens is that it tries to shuffle the least recently used things to permanent storage (temporarily) while it shuffles out of storage those things that now need to be used but had to be put there to make room earlier for something else.  It's a nasty loop of incurring overhead because you've incurred overhead. Kinda like when a bank charges an overdraft fee.  Why it runs out of RAM in the first place is more complicated. A bunch of different things can cause memory usage to creep endlessly upwards.  Most of them are variations of bad programming or owing to bad but uncompromising architectures that were never going to facilitate "good" code.	1644005034.0	hvlt594	t3_skgs7c	t3_skgs7c	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/skgs7c/eli5_when_a_computer_starts_running_extremely/hvlt594/

afu6qlfg	My grandmother used to make some fabulous date- filled cookies every Christmas.  I loved the dough so much that she started giving me a coffee tin full of cookie dough for Christmas every year.  I kept it in the fridge and pulled a chunk of dough out whenever I needed a snack.  This was before factory-scale egg farms. I don't know about conditions for flour production at that time (1950s).   I don't remember it making me sick,  but I did get sick off of commercial malted milk balls once.   Probably ate too many.	1644081108.0	hvpvrmh	t3_sl933a	t3_sl933a	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sl933a/eli5_why_cant_we_eat_cookie_dough_because_its_got/hvpvrmh/

dubz6dh3	My best guess - I think that most solar systems have to have \~1 gas planet and \~1 solid planet. If you think about star formation, after the star begins going, there is matter left in the  gas dust swirl around it - that has to aggregate. If it is too close to the 'sun' it falls in. If it is further, it merges / coagulates into planets. The close matter has to become a solid planet or the solar wind would blow the gas planet away. The further material must become a gas planet because it becomes so large that pressure at the center creates heat with forces some gases not to solidify.	1644162509.0	hvtm8h9	t3_slzi5x	t3_slzi5x	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/slzi5x/eli5_why_do_we_have_8_planets_in_our_solar_system/hvtm8h9/

You have an instant feedback and don't need to mash the button all the way down to know.  They also vary the force needed to push them down. Super fast typers like these options.

lh5ey	A lot of people have covered the technical aspect here so I'm focusing more on appeal but I think an important distinction here is the gamer mech keyboards by Razer, Corsair, etc vs the custom mech keyboards like on r/MechanicalKeyboards. And like with any type of product, you'll have people who just want to get the job done and people who want to spend a bit more, even turn it into a hobby.  For the average person, a normal keyboard is totally fine. They serve the purpose they want. Press key to make letter on screen. Totally get it.   The gamer keyboards usually come with your typical Cherry switches in red, blue (the loud clicky ones everyone knows), brown, and a few others. I'd say that a lot of it comes down to people initially enjoying the different feel of it. I know when I got my first blue keyboard I was obsessed with it but after a few years I was so tired of how loud it was and how much pressure I needed for the key press to register. I like to type quickly so I like to have a fast responsiveness from my keyboard. Then you have the people who want to have the whole branded set, Razor Black Widow with their Razer Viper and Razer Kraken you know?   Your typical gamer mechs are ugly. Honestly. They're all black and with RBG all over. Usually big too but more form factor ones have been made like the Huntsman Mini. For the normal keyboard, they're also usually your typical black office job keyboard. There are definitely more colourful and nicer looking ones coming out lately but still, nowhere near the quality a custom mech will have.  Custom mechanical keyboards are truly a step above them if you care about looks, sound, and the feel. When you switch to building your own, you can really focus on what you want to get out of a keyboard. There is so much on the market that covers a whole range of needs and preferences. Personally, going from a switch that requires more pressure and has a longer travel for it to register, to a switch that only requires a light pressure and has a shorter travel distance has been great. I don't make as many typos anymore because my keys can actually keep up with my fingers.   You get to choose whether you want a full sized keyboard all the way down to just the letters and modifiers. You can choose what kind of frame you want, what switch you want, what the keycaps you want. It all affects how it feels and sounds to type on it. Which is honestly really nice. Not to mention the visual aspect. There are some truly beautiful keycap sets and boards out there and there's a reason there's such a big market for it. Some people take pride in their workspace and really want it to look like nice. I like to have a really light workspace so when everything else on my desk is nice and bright and then there's a giant black rectangle in the middle of it, it really feels out of place and diminishes the look of the whole area.   As I said, like with anything, you have people who are happy with the simple version and you have people who truly take interest in it and want to spend more in order to get something they actually like. And there's nothing wrong with that. At the end of the day, it all comes down to your own personal preferences and happiness.   Of course if you have a mechanical keyboard and are acting like an asshole with a superiority complex then that's just really shitty. Be cool.	1644192545.0	hvvnw9r	t3_sm5igj	t3_sm5igj	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sm5igj/eli5_what_does_a_mechanical_keyboard_do_compared/hvvnw9r/

rv4dw	Basically when the pandemic came around people stopped buying stuff that had chips on them, so automotive and computer makers stopped requesting them. This also couples with trade and tariff wars between China and other countries.  As a result companies that made chips reduced their output. Then more people wanted it but it’s a lot easier to cut production than it is to increase it.   2023 is when most companies estimate being spun up	1644202061.0	hvw8jlq	t3_smf3w5	t3_smf3w5	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/smf3w5/eli5_wtf_is_the_chip_shortage_and_when_will_it_end/hvw8jlq/
4h41g	Computer chips are extremely difficult to make. The facility that makes it has to be super clean, the equipment is super precise, and the workers have to be very well trained in order to make chips reliably.  This makes it very difficult to expand operations. Since they were shut down for a while due to the pandemic, the supplies of chips have been exhausted. Now that people are buying more stuff, all the manufacturers are trying to buy chips for their goods. But, as supplies are exhausted and it will take a lot of money and time to expand chip production, it'll take a while for the chip supply to make up for all the built-up demand.  No one knows when it will end. The more COVID waves there are that disrupt production, the longer the shortage will last.	1644202105.0	hvw8n2c	t3_smf3w5	t3_smf3w5	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/smf3w5/eli5_wtf_is_the_chip_shortage_and_when_will_it_end/hvw8n2c/
w8ggh	Pandemic made a lot of industry shut down.   It's sort of open now, but it shook up the chip making industry a lot and a bunch of companies closed or restructured. A lot of the issues are specific chips are basically impossible to find. Cars especially used a bunch of super standard decades old chips. When everything closed the factories that made those sort of moved on to make other things. Now pretty much no company wants to contract to make super non-profitable chips.       It could end either by some company deciding there is a market it becoming "the company" that makes all that stuff, or it will end when stuff moves off old designs and picks the generally more expensive newer chips that things still manufacture.	1644202144.0	hvw8q49	t3_smf3w5	t3_smf3w5	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/smf3w5/eli5_wtf_is_the_chip_shortage_and_when_will_it_end/hvw8q49/
150xgf18	Chip manufacturing, across the value spectrum, is exacting production. Quality of ingredients on hand for production runs, and other supply and manufacturing logistics. As Covid erupted, customer demand projections collapsed and manufacturers cut production. Since so many Fab plants are in Southeast Asia, especially low capacity chips, workers couldn’t return and, surprisingly, consumer demand for products that used the lower performance chips surprised companies who’d already canceled orders.	1644202249.0	hvw8yh3	t3_smf3w5	t3_smf3w5	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/smf3w5/eli5_wtf_is_the_chip_shortage_and_when_will_it_end/hvw8yh3/

4pepx	In the Reagan Era, fiscal conservatives had an idea. If we redistribute wealth from the working class to the upper class, the innovative entrepreneurs of the upper class will use that wealth to create jobs and improve jobs. The end result would be the working class will receive the money that was diverted away from them back - but we will have used the funds to finance economic growth and innovation as well.   But now 40 years later every economic study, chart and graph shows that this was an absolute failure. Instead of reinvesting all that redistributed wealth back into the working class (referred to as Trickle Down economics), the upper class instead hoarded it, or invested it on expanding their own wealth.   And now we have two problems:  * an income inequality that is *absolutely insane* with mega billionaires going to space using money they didn’t earn but rather that was redistributed by economic policy into their pockets, and…  https://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM  * A citizenry who are used to the status quo, such that if you talk about amending the errors of the Reagan Era, *they think you are redistributing wealth unfairly away from the upper class and to the working class (rather than just returning the system back to normal) and anything flowing from the wealthy to the poor can be easily branded as Communism - so would be political suicide to advocate for.	1644206236.0	hvwhd52	t3_smgbbu	t3_smgbbu	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/smgbbu/eli5_why_are_capital_gains_taxes_lower_than/hvwhd52/

The data is not palatable for most people...it basically says Ashkenazi Jews are by far the most intelligent subset of people in the world, implying inherent racial differences in intellect.  That said, there is so much variation of iq within any group classification, that none are great predictors of intelligence for an individual.  Diet, mental health, and culture all have an impact on iq...but most of it is genetics.	1644240396.0	hvxx2kq	t3_smps3y	t3_smps3y	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/smps3y/eli5_is_intelligence_determined_by_genetics/hvxx2kq/

r7r1d	I always thought it would be a good idea for American trucking companies to run the big cabs for the long hauls where driver comfort is a must, then swap those for the euro style cabs when they get to the cities and being able to turn corners helps. Always seemed a bit out of place when you’re in a downtowny area and a huge semi is backing into CVS with just millimeters to spare.  Would also make it easy to eventually transition the long hauls to semi-autonomous to reduce driver strain, but keep the human drivers in the city where navigation is tougher.	1644254093.0	hvyt4t5	t3_smm08c	t3_smm08c	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/smm08c/eli5_why_do_european_trucks_have_their_engine/hvyt4t5/

You have not discovered a potion for remembering, but for reminding; you provide your students with the appearance of wisdom, not with its reality.

These guidelines cover cats, dogs, primates, and most other mammals, but exclude birds, rodents, fish, reptiles, and amphibians.   When the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) reviews a protocol, they focus on the "3 Rs": replacement, reduction, and refinement.	1645024037.0	hx6hyzr	t3_stwf6m	t3_stwf6m	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/stwf6m/eli5_are_there_laws_regarding_what_scientists_can/hx6hyzr/

vmm1z	As [this article](https://aldf.org/article/federal-laws-and-agencies-involved-with-animal-testing/) briefly explains, there are laws, and there are also regulations.    Regulations are in effect because laboratories are, for example, monitored and audited by a number of government agencies, FDA, OSHA, etc., and all of these agencies have "rules" (regulations) about how to operate the lab or facility.    So while these regulations aren't voted by the Congress as actual laws, it is *against the law* to continue to operate a lab if the FDA or the other agencies audited the lab and ordered it closed down for whatever reason.	1645024929.0	hx6k6wa	t3_stwf6m	t3_stwf6m	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/stwf6m/eli5_are_there_laws_regarding_what_scientists_can/hx6k6wa/

156om0	Not sure how science backs this claim but, I’d imagine it’s due to the body using energy it has to fight the sickness. The feelings that the body produces that is fighting the sickness could make you lose your appetite which doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not hungry but your body is not registering you’re hungry.   This could also explain why cancer patients lose their appetites because the body is dealing with others or on your last few days you no longer care to eat because the body is doing other things to keep it alive. Brain can only do so much.   That’s probably why you should eat plain/bland foods so the body doesn’t have to work extra hard to break down sugars or starches or have other things working. Imagine dairy when you’re sick and your enzymes are like “wtf is this”.   Best thing to do in any scenarios is always eat. Get something in your body that it can use. The sickness could also be blocking receptors (gaging on water with rabies). Or the body is too weak and has accepted it’ll die. Not sure though.   Just make sure you put in health calories no matter the reason and drink a lot of water.	1645026268.0	hx6nlmr	t3_stupl4	t3_stupl4	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/stupl4/eli5_why_do_we_have_the_feeling_of_not_wanting_to/hx6nlmr/

co10g	Our sense of taste and smell are strongly linked to our sense of well-being. When we're sick, our body is working hard to fight off the infection, and it's using a lot of energy. That means there's not as much energy left for things like digestion.In general, it's a good idea to eat light when you're sick. Soups and broths are great options because they're easy to digest, and they provide your body with essential nutrients and fluids. If you do feel like eating something solid, try choosing foods that are gentle on your stomach, like toast. And remember, it's always important to drink plenty of fluids when you're sick – especially water and herbal teas.	1645031883.0	hx72fqf	t3_stupl4	t3_stupl4	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/stupl4/eli5_why_do_we_have_the_feeling_of_not_wanting_to/hx72fqf/

kbpzq	Lots of very knowledgeable sounding people here are saying it's because of the energy consumed in digestion.  That makes sense, but I always thought it was more of a defense mechanism.  Like, your body is ill and maybe thinks that something you've been eating is causing it.  So, to stop you from continuing to poison yourself with bad food, your body cuts your appetite.  Kinda like how when you get carsickness because your body interprets the inconsistent signals of traveling fast and feeling no motion as a sign of having been poisoned, and so it hits the eject button on your stomach.

Intermittent fasting and fasting induced auto-phagy (and its benefits, if any) are hotly debated topics with no clear answers at this point. Even legitimate research done in these fields is drowned out by too much noise in the form of health gurus and fitness influencers wanting to peddle their shake/powder/book/diet plan. While surely there would be something of a benefit in not keeping on munching crap 18 hrs a day, to anyone reading this, kindly take all the fasting related stuff with a pinch of (low sodium) salt and do not make drastic changes to your food routine based on internet advice.	1645036983.0	hx7etin	t3_stupl4	t3_stupl4	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/stupl4/eli5_why_do_we_have_the_feeling_of_not_wanting_to/hx7etin/

f9c6398w	You may think you remember bits and pieces, but once you start detailing certain things that happened, you will start to remember more details.  It's not that you don't have those memories.  They just aren't easily available and need to be recalled back to the forefront of your mind.  Think of your brain like a computer (simplistically).  Your short term/easy recall memory is like the cached RAM (rapid access memory).  You have it on hand, but what's included changes day by day, depending on your needs.  Then, you have somewhat long term memory, like the last few years of your life and extremely crucial events from before, which is like a hard drive.  You have to think about it for a bit, but you can recall stuff with relative ease, and then it sticks in your short term memory for a bit, until it is no longer useful/relevant to you.   Then, you have the bulk of insignificant or distant memories that are essentially archived, like stuff stored in the cloud.  You have to dredge through it, download whatever necessary, transfer it to your hard drive, and then actually cache it in your RAM.	1645039560.0	hx7lkym	t3_ss9w4d	t3_ss9w4d	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ss9w4d/eli5_how_do_people_writing_biographies_recall/hx7lkym/

7xx1z	My guess. It's about co trolling the sloshing of the fluids inside which could over tuen the truck if ignored due to the way fluid can throw its weight while moving freely. It's the same reason those are also sectioned off on the inside. The chambers connect so the fluid can fill everything but by having rows inside they can help control the sloshing which helps keep the weight load in a consistent place vs against one side as its going around a corner for instance.    Again I think this is the reason.

iu5z8	People in the US are spending a lot less of services, entertainment and non-stuff; and more on stuff.  That raises the demand for stuff, and thus the price.  Almost all stuff in the US travels by truck, and trucks run on fuel, and so rising prices for fuel also drive rising prices for transportation; which the merchant passes on to the customer in the form of higher prices.  Fuel prices are rising because the Biden administration wants to reduce fossil fuel use in the US by raising prices, through techniques like blocking new drilling leases banning fracking on federal land, and the like.  The Biden administration hopes that higher prices will encourage people to buy electric cars and drive less.  Alas, higher trucking demand and fewer trucks traveling the roads is a formula that can't work.  It's a mess because politicians don't like to say they were wrong.  Even when they are wrong, they don't like to say that.  It's unfortunate, as most other people have figured out that saying "I got that wrong" is the best path; and their opponents are going to play tapes of them saying things that turned out to be wrong anyway.	1645064048.0	hx98ppy	t3_sud1uy	t3_sud1uy	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sud1uy/eli5_why_the_supply_chains_are_a_mess_still/hx98ppy/

iu5z8	I said they want to.  To quote candidate Biden, "ban new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters".[{ref Washington Post}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/11/19/biden-climate-change-drilling/ )  They have instituted executive orders to do this, and courts have put those orders on hold while the cases are litigated.  The oil industry is pressing hard for all the leases they can get, before the policy goes into effect.  But to get from leases to fuel, a large investment is required, which is much more difficult to justify economically when the government has made it quite plain that their goal is to end US production.  They don't care for energy independence, unless it's green, because using fossil fuel doesn't align with their climate change goals.	1645065954.0	hx9cyrj	t3_sud1uy	t1_hx9abdy	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sud1uy/eli5_why_the_supply_chains_are_a_mess_still/hx9cyrj/
