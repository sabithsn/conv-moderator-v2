fa5x9	This is why, if a woman ever falsely accuses me of rape, I'll just kill her right then and there.  If your life is ruined either way, better to be in jail for a crime you *did* commit (murder) than a crime you *didn't* commit (rape).	1641120235.0	hqx72sr	t3_rthl62	t1_hqti4q6	/r/MensRights/comments/rthl62/gurugram_woman_arrested_for_filing_8_fake_rapes/hqx72sr/

drm9t323	Ahh yes because the laws havent changed a single bit in that period of time. Gynocentrism was never a thing before feminism. /s🤦‍♂️  And no, calling out womens privileges and silly conspiracies like the patriarchy is not misogyny.

drm9t323	Okay, so heres the thing.  Shopping for clothes isnt real work.   Doing makeup isnt real work.   Spending 2 hours cooking when you can do it in just 1 is an extra hour of work thats not real work.   Spending a billion years picking out *just the right* items for the child/house isnt real work.  Stop acting like womens lives are so unfair when most of it is just women putting it onto themselves. Spending more *time* doing work means very little if someone else can achieve the same results using less. Which is what men generally do. So yeah. If you want an "equal amount" of work done, the solution is really easy. Its called not wasting your own damn time.	1642713090.0	htidu37	t3_s7shyj	t1_hti8rzk	/r/MensRights/comments/s7shyj/why_women_being_more_college_educated_than_men_is/htidu37/

drm9t323	It actually is that simple in this case. This is a zero sum game. You either care about a womans and/or mans right to choose, or a childs right to live. If you choose the first, the child loses its right to live. If you choose the second, the parents lose the right to choose.   By stating your belief that women (but not men) have the right to choose, you are implying that you do not believe in a childs right to live.	1642723640.0	htj2xqx	t3_s804hf	t1_htim9oa	/r/MensRights/comments/s804hf/this_person_doesnt_acknowledge_that_it_could_be/htj2xqx/

Again, once it's legal, I see no issue. I am not going to push it. However, marriage age used to be 12 -13 years old.  Even Epstein's victim of 14 years old don't get a bad deal from Epstein.  She was a drug user at age 14, she was poor, and people talk about how horrible she is of having sex with a billionaire. Epstein is dumb to play around with her. I don't see him as evil.  It's just one of those case where an individuals choose a deal that both seems to be good but for some reason society says it's bad.	1645172878.0	hxf9euv	t3_smu81w	t1_hxdasgm	/r/MensRights/comments/smu81w/pe_teacher_23_accused_of_having_sex_with_pupil_18/hxf9euv/
4rx3hoya	Schopenhauer got it right, in his treatise 'On Women.' *It is natural for a feeling of mere indifference to exist between men, but between women it is actual enmity. This is due, perhaps, to the fact that "odium figulinum", in the case of men, is limited to their everyday affairs, but with women embraces the whole sex -* ***since they have only one kind of business****.*	1645175945.0	hxfd6p2	t3_sukj9v	t1_hxex0ki	/r/MensRights/comments/sukj9v/people_just_throw_around_the_word_incel_to/hxfd6p2/
