7xo29s8e	Jimmy?  I thought we were discussing feminine choices.  I can already tell where this is going.  You'll keep tap-dancing around the core issue and deflect any blame or criticism from any single woman or group of women because...survey says...women can't be wrong ever!  People like you should work for or with charities or non-profits and have to humble yourself and serve others so you not only see the world from a different perspective, you might \*gasp\* work alongside horrible, evil men and understand we're punished and made to face the consequences of our choices \*all the goddamn time.\*  And on the subject of choices:  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that American men are forced to sign up for Selective Service even though the draft hasn't happened in decades.  Women?  Get off scot free.  To say nothing of the advantages women get in terms of alimony, child support, sometimes free housing when they're pregnant, getting men arrested in domestic abuse cases even when the woman is the perp, and in a situation I was involved with, filing false police reports and nearly getting an ex boyfriend shot because a borderline personality suffering lunatic couldn't handle anyone else having differentiating opinions from her own, and so she'd get the police involved to handle arguments she started and nearly got her first boyfriend shot because she claimed he was going to hurt her and her kids.  At the time she did that, btw, he was helping out his comatose mother.  Clearly a threat.  And about choices?  The way the world is now men have absolutely no reproductive rights.  The only protection we have now is self-protective isolation or a vasectomy, which can be irreversible.  Your gender is so ridiculously privileged and chock-full of choices.  Want better men?  Be better women.  And that starts with being better to people.	1642948059.0	htvs1mp	t3_sar60q	t1_htvq41l	/r/antifeminists/comments/sar60q/feels_good_to_insult_these_bitches/htvs1mp/

I’m going to be completely constructive here.

ixot5qq2	>Patriarchy is pretty clear on its meaning.  Actually no, it's not. Not how the feminists nowadays are using it. They can't even define it.  WE can define it insofar as how a typical family is run, but their application of it is not well defined at all.	1643124143.0	hu5u9m7	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu5t11b	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu5u9m7/

ixot5qq2	Yes, but since the feminists en mass interpret the word to mean something negative and specific that doesn't fit, that's what I'm talking about.	1643138765.0	hu6x939	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu6dscb	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu6x939/
ixot5qq2	>So, my point is it isn't easy to properly empathise with the feminine struggle when you are a guy.   There is no feminine struggle. They have it easy in western world. It's the men who are oppressed and struggling. This is yet another reason why I roll my eyes at feminine struggle.	1643143479.0	hu79vgb	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu7859r	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu79vgb/
ixot5qq2	>That you don't see or understand atoms doesn't mean they don't exist, mate.  First of all, I don't need an analogy. They are only used to help someone see a point. I don't miss any points.  >Just try to open up your mind.   To what? You're not being clear.  >I am definitely oppressed but surely not by women.   Nope. It's the god damn system.. although feminism and women in general assist in that oppression.	1643148682.0	hu7ngl2	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu7j5vc	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu7ngl2/

ixot5qq2	Feminism has fought for what? They've fought to break up families and get paid for it. They have a ton of rights and abilities where men do not.  They have equality but they took much more.	1643164207.0	hu8p4oi	t3_sc8fgi	t1_hu8kfiz	/r/antifeminists/comments/sc8fgi/do_antifeminists_believe_the_patriarchy_doesnt/hu8p4oi/
