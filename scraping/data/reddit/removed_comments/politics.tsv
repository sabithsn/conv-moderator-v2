i0j4n	>Biden has the 2nd lowest approval rating of any president except Trump.  Except Truman, Nixon, Carter, Obama, GW Bush, Ford.    Nixon had 34.4.  That's certainly lower than 42.    Or are you just parroting disinformation you heard but didn't want to verify yourself?  Where's your data for "Biden has the 2nd lowest approval rating of any president except Trump."?  Is it the CNN article from yesterday, no, that doesn't support your claim.  The Hill?  Still no.  Gallup News?  Still no but close as they only went back to WW2.   NBCNews, no.  You know who does make that claim that you're making?:  A Facebook post.  A Facebook post that was flagged as misinformation.	1642706094.0	hthw2mx	t3_s8n4ot	t1_hthpnjo	/r/politics/comments/s8n4ot/one_year_into_his_presidency_bidens/hthw2mx/

What I don’t understand is how you can ignore the fact that the FBI, one of your supposed most trusted institutions, was clearly caught on camera in-sighting a riot and lying about it to congress.  But sure, focus on the quote “secret meetings”. If you cant understand that politicians all over the world partake in meetings “off the record” there is no hope for you.	1642706286.0	hthwksz	t3_s8hjgf	t1_hthu10i	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/hthwksz/

I know I don't have to list all the underhanded means they go about accomplishing this but to get back to our original point, blaming Nader for his Florida votes plays right into their strategy when it was really Republican corruption and the Democrats resistance to a truly progressive platform.

You can’t “call me out on my bs” when I was asking about an article about a press conference that really happened.

3ta39	It seems quite plausible to me that the rotating villain theory is true. Time and again, it seems on every fight, that Dems are consistently losing. They lose so frequently, so embarrassingly, that this seems more like a scripted WWE fight that the Dem is determined ahead of time to lose. What’s more plausible: the Dems have not one single person smart enough to strategize and scheme to come up with plans as well as McConnell that makes them lose just about every political battle in the past 20 years…. or that they’re scripted to lose?  I hope I’m wrong but the consistent ineptness of the Dem Party is hard to explain any other way. Yes, I know the Dem party isn’t just one party and harder to stand unified against the one-minded GOP but that still doesn’t explain it. Battle after battle lost to McConnell’s evil fuckery for almost the entirety of the 21st century so far. Much of it not due to certain factions within the Dem party disagreeing on the issue.	1642715127.0	htijj4l	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htiakt8	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htijj4l/

What policies that they've passed aren't in line with neoliberalism?  Rather than attacking the source, attack the argument.  > Also, just because someone "deregulates" one thing, that doesn't make them a champion of deregulation, which is why the entire assertion that they are neoliberals is flat out bogus.  Obama was literally writing opeds for the Wall Street Journal explaining the need for deregulation.  It's hard to champion it more than that without passing executive orders and signing bills from congress in that direction (whcih he also did both of, this op ed is explaining one of his executive orders focused on deregulation).  https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703396604576088272112103698  > I understand what a "New Democrat" is, I didn't put it in "scare quotes", I put it in "quotes" for emphasis. They are not neoliberals, which is something you obviously don't understand.  General political theory thought processes disagree with you.  The New Democrats fall clearly under the banner of post classical liberalism, aligning closer to Ordoliberalism than even Blair's New Labour.

3ta39	It’s far more than that. I’m talking about strategies that the GOP has pulled that screw traditions and expected norms. Such as disallowing a Supreme Court nomination because it’s an election year and then turning around to do just that under Trump. Such as allowing the Senate Majority Leader to be the sole decider if legislation is allowed to go to a vote. There’s been many examples like this. Do I really have to bring them up?  You’re quite up on politics, obviously, so I doubt I need to.   It’s been apparent for many years that the GOP doesn’t give a shit about precedence, decorum, tradition, or good faith.  They’ve demonstrated this behavior again and again and Dems continue to take the high road and play by the rules that the opponent has already thrown out the window. This goes beyond majorities and cannot be simply explained away because “filibuster”. Dems keep thinking “go high” will play out well for them in the long run but it hasn’t. And they keep doing it. At some point, you start wondering why they keep repeating the same mistakes.   Granted, I’m no PolSci major and don’t know all the ins and outs of the 3 branches, but come on, this smells of BS to even a layman. Really does seem like Corp Dems and Corp GOP are on the same side. Seems like QUITE a nice deal (for both sides) to have two scapegoats to keep you from having to vote on something you don’t want to vote on because your constituents won’t like the way you’ll vote. Bah w/e I doubt either of us will change our outlooks on this so it’s probably pointless to continue.	1642717954.0	htiprnq	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htikrl6	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiprnq/

Your kind had a problem with the machines (which was 100% fake, should be thrown in jail for it), then the paper ballots, and the mail ballots. It isn’t a holiday.  You just love making it harder for people to vote. And you think this is a “good thing”. We’re one of the only countries to be this backwards. You’re ignorant.  We had an unprecedented amount of mail in this last election due to covid, and it went smooth as butter. Despite the sabotaging from trump’s pick for USPS.   And you have the arrogance to sit here and talk about democrats wanting to overturn elections when you literally have a PowerPoint discussing exactly how to do that: attacking our very foundation. Saying dominion was hacked, saying paper ballots were faked, all kinds of fake videos of election fraud. And it turns out it was Trump supporters who admitted to voting for trump twice.

i6f5y	Agree totally. I didn’t learn anything useful whatsoever in high school. In Econ, which was only one semester, our big semester project was to plan our fucking wedding day. Most of the kids in my class had million dollar weddings, of course. I tried my best to be a cheap ass and save money but we were required to order flowers, invitations, all that crap and price it all out. Anyway, none of that is important, but back to my original point- I think high school should be spent actually teaching useful knowledge about life. Skip history and social studies- 99% of kids in high school couldn’t be more bored by a subject. Wait til college for that stuff.

7vf7z	God damn you have some real anger issues you need to find a better outlet for getting out of your system. I don't see why you on the left always have to resort to personal insults and attacks lol. Insulting someone only proves that you need to attempt to discredit and dehumanize them in an attempt to give your argument more basis. Calling me disgusting, saying "your kind" like im some sort of less than human individual and you wonder why im not very interested in a dialog with you? Youre the problem with this country. The idea that any differing opinions on the matter is immediately seen as heinous and vile is ridiculous. You sound like a wannabe racist who just takes that hate out on people not far left because its socially acceptable to do. 70 years ago youd be the type of person to be complicit with nazism because you clearly have no issues seeing people as subhuman based on their beliefs.  Do you know most first world countries have a voter ID system for voting? Just like most countries have restrictions about illegal immigration which is also apparently a crime to want borders. Every president has been increasing our deficit, hence why they call it a deficit and try to avoid looking at it as overall debt but the democratic party wouldve spent 10 trillion dollars last year in bills if there was no way to block them, thank god for that. And contrary to what they say, they really don't make a lot. If they did states like california and new york wouldn't have needed a bill to give them billions to bail them out last year. Places like LA, SF, NYC are trashcans to live in right now and filled with homeless people, but yes they are doing oh so well.   Cities will generate more income and revenue over rural areas, thats a pretty dumb argument to make. What youre essentially saying is because theres more poor people in cities who vote blue that means that the ones in the state and cities making the money vote blue as well. Yes, businesses are usually based in cities and not in barns and they generally produce more income than places without big cities, but to pretend its the democrats making that revenue is just a lie.

echps	I wasn't alive during Nixon.  I barely knew what politics were with Reagan, cause I was like... 5.  Bush, yes.  I now recognize what a failure it was from the beginning.  You want to know why people don't like liberals?  Because of how you just responded.  #1 you assumed way too much.  #2 actually, no - it has nothing to do with how I am being impacted personally.  Living in NYC, I'm fairly isolated from the GOP.  I'm against the GOP now because I was young and impressionable and I've broken away from the Foxnews outrage machine and started learning about how things really were/are.  #3 someone tells you they changed their views and learned from it, and your response is FUCK YOU?   Good luck winning people over with that attitude.  Instead, maybe you should try to understand why I changed my views, what caused them to change, and start using that understanding to apply to other people so you can get them to join your cause.

The purpose of our governmental structure is not to "trigger snowflakes" and participating in this kayfabe reality TV show style sensationalization is the cancer in the heart of our political conversation.   President of the United States Joe Biden was right to recognize that question as loaded and stupid.   President of the United States Joe Biden was also right to make a apology for his rudeness afterward.  Politics is a dirty game. Governance is a thankless task. I am glad that president of the United States Joe Biden did not take the bait and make a comment tying inflation to midterm elections.

hhlxvt0x	What this assessment completely misses is the fact that in Afganistan and Vientnam USA faced people, whose mentality was very alien to them and different from theirs. And USA actually didnt try to integrate these counties in itself. If Russia has a war with Ukraine, this will not be the case. Our people have 800+ years of history of living in one state. Our blood is so intervined that it is almost impossible to tell a Russian person from Ukrainian. Also, Ukraininan hatred towards Russians is less than 10 years in making. Given these factors, we have a very good chance to integrate Ukrainian population. We faced WAY harder situation in Chechnya, given that it was a religious war for chechens, they have tribal warrior culture and they hated us WAY more. But we won. Ukraine is larger than Chechnya, but that is about it. All the other factors are more favorable.  P.S. I am not in favor of war with Ukraine, it would be stupid, honestly. But nevertheless, this assessment is wrong.	1643150128.0	hu7r0uz	t3_scpgy5	t3_scpgy5	/r/politics/comments/scpgy5/russias_vietnam_why_an_invasion_of_ukraine_would/hu7r0uz/

And the problem is usually this fictional preconceived idea of what a racist really is.  This kind of stuff does no good for anyone (well except for racist people who get a free pass).   People can be racist and still be human, still have “good” qualities. Also, being old is not an excuse, it’s funny to me how they’re rarely too old to vote, drive, own property, travel, whine. But way too old to grasp basic concepts and let go of stubborn childishness.   I’ve had to deal with this with my grandmother and my father, trust me people can change if they want to, and if they don’t want to they’re fucking racist.	1643317004.0	huho5no	t3_sdz1wa	t1_huh3a9k	/r/politics/comments/sdz1wa/tiktokers_say_thousands_of_them_are_spamming_the/huho5no/

It’s a shame their personal morality on political topics basically doesn’t exist until mid-October of election years and then is only dictated by whatever is trending in the 24-hour news cycle but that’s what it is. They wouldn’t be undecideds if they paid the slightest bit of attention.   I do see you’re doing a *lot* of complaining about tone and not a lot of complaining about accuracy.

i2rx7utj	Have you seen the security footage? The people in the  buildings are literally just standing there and walking around inside the capital building. How can you say this is worse than let’s say a single BLM riot? The BLM riots were 10x worse than Jan 6th ever was and ever will be. If you really can’t see Jan 6th was a setup to label all republicans as “dangerous” and “domestic terrorists” then you are so blinded by how politics actually work and the power of words. You probably think now that anybody who supports the opposite candidate or Trump is a danger to society and is a domestic terrorist and don’t even argue that because I know it’s true. The left have brainwashed people and it’s scary to think just having a political opinion or voting for one person makes you an evil, racist, homophobic, disgusting person when in reality the people who are racist and only see skin color are the people on the left. Jan 6th was a false flag event to tarnish Trump and anyone who supports him or is a republican to ostracize them and make sure democrats look better in americas’s eyes cuz they’re “not trump” when in reality they’re 15x worse than Donald trump is.

Although reddit wants you to believe that the US is irredeemably racist down the very DNA of every institution the reality is if that is true then it really sucks at it because there are too many poor white males and too many successful minorities which one would think is the opposite of the desired effect. Racism does exist, always will, but you basically never hear about say: hate crimes against Asians by a certain non-white race or what would happen to a white boy if they dared roll up in my old hood.  Meanwhile it's mostly white people pushing all of this stuff, like CRT, which is extremely ironic considering the second tenet of CRT is Bells "interest convergence" which basically says that white people only support non-white interests when it benefits them in some way.	1643817246.0	hvaf3x5	t3_siq9yp	t1_hva9vec	/r/politics/comments/siq9yp/mitch_mcconnell_ridiculed_as_he_admits_he_doesnt/hvaf3x5/

fenvbejq	> There is a long term strategic play in this. Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas is a short term problem as they build out more wind farms and the EU's power grid becomes more integrated.  Lol what? There was no purpose in cancelling the sanctions. It would have caused far more harm to Russia by keeping them in place. It’s not like they were ever going to pivot to renewables just because Nord stream 2 was under sanctions. What’s more, the sanctions forced Russia to play nice with Ukraine as the only route for gas was through a pipe line in Ukraine which the Ukrainians could cripple if Russia stepped out of line. The second Ukraine lost that leverage, it enabled Russia to invade. And guess what? Russia almost immediately started amassing troops at the border after the cancellation of the sanctions. As bad as trump was at kissing putins ass, Russia didn’t pull this while the republicans held the White House.  > Russia's dependence on fossil fuel revenue is a long term problem for Russia. Every major petrostate, except Russia, sees that fossil fuel revenue has an end date and they are preparing for that day. Russia does not have the internal economic consistency in order to retool into a post-oil economy.  Wtf does that have to do with canceling nord stream sanctions? This sounds like giga cope and a weak attempt to justify Biden’s baffling decision to cancel the Nord stream sanctions.   > Giving them Nordstream 2 revenue over the short term creates a lever that the West can use against Russia to coerce them into line over the coming decades... and encourage them into transforming their economy into a post-oil economy  Lolwut? No it doesn’t. Cancelling the sanctions emboldened Russia and improved their position.
