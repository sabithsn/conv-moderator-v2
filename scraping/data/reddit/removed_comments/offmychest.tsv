bruze3bk	You would have my sympathy if you did not feel the need to inject race into your story. I have been treated like shit at doctors offices and hospitals as well and I am not a female and I am not black, so have other members of my family. It is awful what happened to your love ones, no doubt.  Sounds like the medical staff you dealt with had no bed side manner.  As far as the fireman goes, they deal with all kinds of shit everyday, accidents, fires, drug overdoses, strokes, heart attacks, exc.  No first responder is going to come on the scene and just take your word for it.  They have training that teaches them how to access a patient and decide what the best course of action is.  Be it  a SOC-M in the military, a fireman, a paramedic or whatever, they have a processes.    Most medical professionals in my area (MD's, specialists, Nurse Practitioners, exc.) are POC. Most medical professionals look at things logically and analytically, not through the lens of race, politics, or gender.    Stop looking at everything through the lens of race.	1642781058.0	htm2cu5	t3_s97a33	t3_s97a33	/r/offmychest/comments/s97a33/angry_and_tired_of_how_the_healthcare_system/htm2cu5/

cxvrt4s0	I feel like there’s always been a division in America though, it’s just that the masks and vaccine have become concrete manifestations of the underlying issue.  It’s like the killing of George Floyd. Did that kickstart racism in America? Oh no, it’s been here, but that was the final straw after years and years of deep seated discrimination.  The reality is that Americans have always had hostility towards views contrary to their own. It’s just that Covid and the mask debate have made the disparity between conformism and anti conformism much more salient.  But the reality is that dissonance in America between political parties has been percolating for years, but the pandemic has become a new platform on which people vocalize their opinions.   The masks and vaccines aren’t the real problem, the need to assert one’s views is.	1642784264.0	htmazn9	t3_s9by4g	t3_s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htmazn9/

4xr3g	I love this reply, and let's talk about it. Cults are a well-studied phenomenon that not very many people truly take the time to research and understand. Now I know, I know, you’re an educated, intelligent intellectual and know you would never wind up in a cult.  But name another group of humans who are as depressed, hopeless, lost, mentally ill, angry, upset, lonely, and desperate for a reason to live.  That’s right. It’s largely young adults: the generations whose lives were kicked off by 9/11, a financial crisis that never really ended, who grew up watching technology take over, went to school with the constant thought that one of our classmates might shoot us today, got lost in the abyss of capitalism working terrible jobs for a paycheck that won’t even cover a quarter of an apartment’s rent, are trying to start our lives in the middle of a pandemic, watched the American government system fail time after time after time, watched the justice system fail and fail and fail and fail -  Should I go on?	1642792420.0	htmx355	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htmw13e	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htmx355/

4fs3bl71	It’s absolutely not freedom at its finest. Some jobs require a drivers license because driving is a part of the job. These expectations you speak of need to be questioned if they’re not grounded in logic. Am I more likely to be contagious with Covid if I’m not vaccinated? No? Then it’s none of anyone else’s business because it doesn’t impact them. All the vaccine does is reduce symptoms not transmissibility. If there was evidence that the vaccine reduced transmission then there would be a logical reason to require it for work place safety but there’s no evidence of that. The vaccine has been around for over a year and there are more cases of Covid than ever in spite of the millions of vaccinated people in the country.  Having employers coerce people by saying if you fail to do this thing we will fire you and endanger you and your family’s livelihood is literally not freedom.  I’m amazed how many people fall into these ideological fascist ways of thinking. We’re headed down a dark path and anyone with a cursory understanding of history would see the warning signs.	1642797664.0	htnbkf3	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnabgd	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnbkf3/

4fs3bl71	We went from HIPPA your medical life is private to show this vaccine passport or fuck your right to earn a living. That is not the way.   There are alternatives. You can say ok well if you need sick leave for Covid then it’s unpaid for example. Your deductible in insurance is higher for Covid illness if you’re not vaccinated. Plenty of ways to handle this.  This “doesn’t mean freedom from consequences” argument is such a cliche. And it just keeps getting repeated as freedom gets reduced.  Maybe some day you’ll understand but the way this country has set about demonizing people for their choices and having zero empathy for people making that choice, reducing their humanity, is absolutely scary. This shit has happened before and it doesn’t go to good places. You shouldn’t look at people so simplistically. There is nuance to the argument. I’m not using anecdotes. I’m referencing real data. Look at Covid cases over time. Do they go down after the vaccine entered the ballgame? No. People are just accepting too much at face value and now it’s all ideology. You’re either vaccinated or a fucking idiot. This is how people look at each other now. It’s disgusting and it’s dangerous.	1642798549.0	htne1l9	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htncw39	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htne1l9/

4fs3bl71	I appreciate your response. I am vaccinated. I reject the totalitarian direction the country is heading in. Again we are seeing higher cases than ever and more people are vaccinated than ever. Why is that? It isn’t logical to suggest more people vaccinated means the virus transmission is reduced just based on that evidence.   People seem to have forgotten all about early 20th century history and seem of the impression we can’t get there again. Freedom should be valued and protected. It’s much harder to get freedom back than it is to retain it. But this whole cycle has manipulated people into thinking these freedom restrictions are acceptable.

4fs3bl71	See here you are ignoring the important question I am asking and making assumptions about my character. You’re putting me into a group category. I am vaccinated. I understand they reduce symptoms.   But the question I am asking anyone to answer is pretty straightforward - why is it that we have more cases of Covid than ever when there are more people vaccinated than ever? If the vaccine is about reducing transmission, logically would the results be opposite? More people vaccinated resulting in lower cases than ever?   You see this is a simple logical question. You’re ignoring it in favor of this ideology, and treating me like I’m some anti vaccine q anon trump supporting hick.  If you’re interested in facts then how do you explain the fact that more cases of Covid are now reported than ever when the vaccine allegedly reduces transmission?

But also I’m not anti vaccine and never said I was. I’m just asking what actual evidence supports the notion that the Covid vaccine is helpful in reducing transmission to others because it doesn’t appear to be in the numbers.

7rwd1kxp	1. If you want to be scientific here’s some science: the vaccine has side effects. Yes, rare. But they exist.  2. People have the right to measure the risks of the vaccine vs. the risks of the virus and act according what they see fit. If what they see fit is “unscientific”, does that make them less human? People believe all unscientific things - astrology, for ex. - and we don’t get a free pass for dehumanizing them because of it. “Oh but they are putting publich health in danger”, how so? The vaccine does not stop transmission. In fact I know a couple of cases of vaccinated people being the source of infection for unvaccinated people. If unvaccinated people are the ones with more severe symptoms, then maybe we should prohibit vaccinated people from entering places, no? They are the ones putting unvaccinated at risk. I’m obviously joking with this last part but you get the point. Or not, but I don’t care, you’re gonna throw an ad hominem at me anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️	1642802117.0	htnnz2l	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnhumn	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnnz2l/

I'm sorry for you and your family but weekly tests should have been an opportunity for your father. If they're going to go by the CDC's recommendations then that's what it should have been.

4fs3bl71	I guess the point I’m getting at and what confuses me is this — I’m vaccinated. I’m sure you are too. Even being vaccinated we still have the potential to catch and transmit the virus.  So if you’re vaccinated you can transmit the virus. If you’re not vaccinated you can transmit the virus.  So with that in mind, why should a person have their livelihood threatened for not being vaccinated?  I’ve received some good responses such as public sector jobs are subject to different rules and I suppose that is true. But I wonder why people are so eager to support this idea that unvaccinated people deserve to lose their jobs when you have potential to spread the virus regardless.	1642808855.0	hto5mn3	t3_s9gzx4	t1_hto2cfo	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/hto5mn3/

91w4yqc9	I mean. I look at it like this. The Government hasn’t been the most trustworthy sources of information. Now before people get their pitch forks out, I am vaccinated with the booster. But besides the whole Qanon aspect, there are many legitimate reasons to not trust government.  Example: The Tuskegee Syphillus experiment which was conducted on an entire population of my fellow African Americans. Which if I remember was government sanctioned. So for a variety of people I can see their reluctance to trust something like that. That being said to each their own. No one is going to do something that they don’t want to do, especially when it involves sticking something into their own body.  It’s kinda shit your dad got fired wish their could have been a compromise. But public safety is public safety.

tc7qt	To be honest, using job to force people to get vaccinated is unjust.   I still think that no matter how good / how bad is the vaccine, the government should not use job security to force people to make a medical decision.  I thinkthe real concern should be that we agree to let government force people to inject things into their own body. It doesn't matter what it is. Even it is truly a vaccine, no conspiracy, I still think it is a problem.   I am not saying your father make a good decision.

2xezgw4u	Is your father Libertarian? Libertarians have a strong belief in personal freedom. I'm sorry he was fired.  No one should be fired for not being vaccinated yet corporations and governments can certainly implement that requirement with some exclusion based on religious beliefs and midecal conditions. My ex-boyfriend had Guillian Barre Syndrome as a teen. He almost died. He said he won't be vaccinated, and I said I totally supported his choice and anyone's choice not to be vaccinated. I've been vaccinated early in 2021 and contracted Omicron along with my entire family. None of us went to the hospital or clinic fortunately.  COVID-19 is not going anywhere vaccine or not. It won't disappear if the entire world is vaccinated because COVID-19 persists in very large animal populations such as deer. Deer aren't affected by COVID-19 but we certainly are and humans easily come into contact with deer regularly. A wide variety of animal species have contracted COVID-19. This country and other developed nations aren't sharing or helping the entire planet be vaccinated, so what's the point of your dad and every single person in America being vaccinated when this country can't exist in a vacuum. It's far too late for that. Also, vaccinated people are contracting Omicron at record speed along with unvaccinated. This government is being completely irrational because we can't vaccinate the whole world every 6 months, let alone this entire country. COVID-19 is here to stay.	1642817440.0	htoqeqv	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htoqeqv/

Looks like you follow an ideology similar to « incels ». Which is an ideology, not a real tool to understand what the world is and how to live and attain happiness. A woman hurt me a lot recently too but I don’t feel the need to lie to myself and put this on the back of all women. You are just trying to hide your weaknesses revealed by a crush/gf/so who hurt your soul and is trying desperately to revenge on every girl. Hope that my comment helped you a little.

9ptyv	Oh okay. That’s kinda where I figured this was going.. because it’s his fathers obligation to finically support his grown son, right? And he can’t make his own choices based upon what he wants to do with his own body because you know. His adult son needs his money. Do you m is how entitled and absurd that sounds? My wife is a single mother who put her self through college while working full time before I came along to help support her.literally all on her own. His father doesn’t owe this man a thing! The entitlement is bewildering. Why does the left constantly berate people and tell everyone that “people should be able to do what they want with their bodys!” When it comes down to literally any other issue such as sex changes and abortions. But when they disagree with what someone wants to do with their own damn body, they throw a fit. Like I said, literal nazis.. do you seriously think that any man on the face of this earth should conform to doing anything to his body that he doesn’t want too in order to finically support his grown son? Like really?! Especially when said son obviously has no respect for his own rights, or him for that matter based on the way he’s talking about him. Look, I’m not “anti-vax” . I’m actually for people getting it! But what I am not for, is people telling me and others what the fuck to do with my own body. Listen pal, I’ve smoked enough k2 when I was a teenager that covid isn’t gonna hurt me. I do not socialize with anyone almost outside of my own family. Me not getting vaccinated doesn’t effect anyone else. It’s my body, it’s my choice! I don’t think the vaccine will hurt me, I just know that covid won’t either. I just think that such as we should respect women being able to choose if they abort or more should also respect people’s decision to not get vaxxed. My wife got it, everyone I love got it and it makes me extremely happy they did. But the idea of belittling my Loved ones because they chose not too is sickening. Can you understand where I’m coming from?	1642828276.0	htped83	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpdjx7	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htped83/
9ptyv	Okay lol. It’s absurd that you think someone’s parents are obligated to support their college career and damn them if they don’t. You’re entitlement is showing. Can y’all just choose if you think people should be able to do what they please with their own body’s or not? Or they should only be able to choose when it fits your agenda? Tell me. If it was up To you and you could mandate vaccines or make People face jail time, would you?  Also, last time I checked depending on mommy and daddy as an adult wasn’t anything to be proud of. As an adult you should be able to take care of yourself, and eventually help take care of your own parents. Y’all are goofy.	1642828884.0	htpfjti	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpem0a	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htpfjti/
9ptyv	Dude you’re absurd.. I honestly think it’s pretty sorry that you think ANYONE is obligated to support another adult . Under any circumstances. Give me one good reason why this man can’t do exactly what my wife has done or what so many other students do and make his own damn money and support his own damn self. They have an obligation to raise and support you until you’re an adult and nothing more. It’s insane to me how entitled you sound man. College is not a RIGHT! It’s not costing him anything. If he refuses to pay his own way through college, how is that anyone’s fault but his own? Y’all are wild dude. You seriously actually believe that parents are obligated to put their kids through college??? What planet do you live on? Does that mean all the parents that aren’t able to, or won’t are somehow less than?	1642829340.0	htpgf52	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpfy4q	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htpgf52/
9ptyv	My father is extremely wealthy. Man never opened his wallet for me not once. I used to feel a sense of entitlement to his money. When I was 17 he let me lose my first apartment over a lack of $200 and I had a hard time not resenting him. I didn’t understand why until later in life. He was teaching me not to downed on anybody. Now I’m a successful business owner, and I could live very well off working ten hours a week if I so chose. I recently picked up a part time Job while my business hours are slow in the winter just because I’m a fuckin hustler and I don’t like to sit around on my ass waiting for shit to come to me. I’ll always be thankful for my father letting me get evicted. Now I can take care of my family! Including support my grandmother and helping my wife Through college. When my son turns 18 he will not see a penny out of me and he will also be successful. Be sorry for me all you want that I didn’t suck on my daddy’s tit , I’m extremely thankful for it. And maybe that’s what makes the difference between me and an entitled 36 year old  who’s mother asks if he needs grocery money. Shocking.	1642829617.0	htpgyb0	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpfy4q	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htpgyb0/

Being that vaccinated ppl can still get Covid, get mad at the pharmaceuticals.. Maybe one day they'll have a real vaccine.  You act like this w your own flesh and blood? Some have died or has had serious reactions..  All these vaccines aren't even approved by the FDA (yet) and now you hear about needing a boosters every 3 months for life.  Just respect other ppl.

Imagine if all of us commented on here how we have it so much worse than the OP, and that her issues arent real **because** we have it worse...Imagine how that would make her feel.

8e2ewhr9	Firstly as a man i am a bit offended that you are dragging all men over a cliff and usually i prefer to not drag gender into things but as an example i have been told multiple times by woman that bald men are ugly. I am a bald man. Do i think all women should do better and not comment on my appearance? No i dont. I think they are assholes who should learn to not be assholes.  At the same time i understand your frustrations. My advice is to ignore them, realise that they are a small loud minority but it seems like a lot because you are so aware of them. I was very insecure about my baldness and every comment made me feel like the world agreed with the statement that bald men are ugly. Usually the people we hear are the loud and opinionated people who really should just shut up so we could have a better world.   It sucks that you have had to go through this and im sorry i cant be of more help and that my comment probably isnt conveying what im trying to say. I dont know if this comes off as trying to invalidate you but at least it's not what im trying to do.	1642851870.0	htqe76y	t3_s9xuta	t3_s9xuta	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xuta/im_a_former_hot_girl_who_gained_weight_due_to_a/htqe76y/

Vaccines don’t exist to reduced symptoms they are meant to stop transmission, the media changed the narrative when they realized that these vaccines will not get us to herd immunity (the CDC actually changed their definition of vaccinated from “provides immunity” to “provides protection”). Not to mention the insane amount of “rare” heart inflammation and blood clotting tied to this shot. This vaccine has killed more people in one year than every vaccine on earth administered in the last 30 years, this is not helping us it’s hurting us.	1642852652.0	htqfbtd	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpy564	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqfbtd/

If government will fire him because they couldn’t force him to do something he didn’t feel was right, then good for him. The point it gets to is when will that stop? They could end up forcing him to do anything and threaten his nice cushy job if he doesn’t. Just bend over and take it up the ass, it’s good for you.

i4rplyk5	I know you disagree with him, but in reality it’s his body his choice. When getting a vaccine, you sign a contract understanding the risks associated and basically if one of these risks harm you then you can’t sue for damages. If he’s unwilling to sign that agreement, and take on those risks, that’s his choice. It’s annoying, but it’s his choice. Perhaps maybe instead of being annoyed and angry, try talking to him. I talked to my friend who isn’t anti-vaccines she just doesn’t trust the covid-19 vaccines. I don’t agree with her, but I can see why she’s concerned. I myself do not trust the Pfizer vaccine, but I made the decision to get the AstraZeneca vaccine instead. By listening to her concerns and not immediately calling her a conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxer, danger to society, I made her feel comfortable and safe to talk about it. She hasn’t been vaccinated yet, but she is about to once this new vaccine, that I encouraged her to research, comes out in my country. We have to accept some people are not comfortable doing things, but we should be accomodating and positive and make them feel safe to talk about their concerns instead of just calling them an idiot. I love my friend, and I empathise with her concerns, and I have helped her find a way to be both vaccinated and comfortable with the situation to accept the risks and sign that contract. Mandates are also proven to lower vaccination rates, the famous case being britain enforcing a vaccine mandate I think it was in the 70s or 90s. Try talking to your dad and maybe you’ll be able to convince him and he’ll be able to get his job back.	1642861651.0	htquyae	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htquyae/

i4rplyk5	Haha thank you! I’ve read a lot about the vaccines, and I’ve read a lot about people wanting to question or express concerns about vaccines being immediately shut down and that decreases vaccination rates. As long as we are understanding and create a positive environment, vaccination rates increase.	1642861949.0	htqvkgy	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqv58f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqvkgy/
4ld6j27x	Sorry your father thinks for himself and prioritizes his picture of health  over a "job".  The Qanon is a bit far ...but questioning the Vaxx is perfectly normal to do, especially because its been proven to have some nasty side effects.   The mandates themselves are even more stupid and a huge human rights violation...

i4rplyk5	I can sympathise with your dad. I believe the Pfizer vaccine is slightly untrustworthy due to reports of unhygienic lab conduct, falsifying test results, and dodgy human testing. Some of these things are not confirmed, but there have been many whistleblowers recently. I also didn’t completely understand how the Pfizer vaccine worked. I refuse to get the Pfizer vaccine also due to their attitude to shutting people down and calling them idiots and stupid instead of trying to politely communicate and educate them and create a positive environment. Instead, I researched other vaccine options and found AstraZeneca made me feel comfortable. They were majority privately funded, they didn’t seem too concerned with earning a profit, and there were a few things that made me a bit annoyed such as the lack of research on how it affects womens menstrual cycle, but overall I was happy with it. Try talking to your dad and allow him to express his concerns and questions without criticising or judging him. Try and help him find a vaccine that makes him feel comfortable. By creating a positive and comfortable environment for him, you can help him find a covid vaccine he feels comfortable taking and then it’s a winning situation for all	1642862413.0	htqwk1u	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnfi1m	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqwk1u/

i4rplyk5	I agree. I think OP should try and talk to their dad and make sure it’s a comfortable and positive safe space. If they could make him feel heard then maybe they could help find a vaccine option that what make the dad comfortable. Also, a vaccine is considered a contract, and there are many countries with laws against “backing people into corners” to force them to sign a contract. Also, it’s his body his choice. There is also no duty of care the dad has to anyone else when deciding to get the vaccine. We need to create a safe space for people to voice their concerns about the vaccine so that we can understand their feelings and make them feel heard.	1642862676.0	htqx4jy	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqnv56	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqx4jy/
i4rplyk5	Very true! I like that sentiment. I think OP should be proud he didn’t bow down to his job and sacrifice his morals, even if they disagree with him. He is free to make his own choice, and even though I disagree with it myself, I am not entitled to demand he should be vaccinated. I am vaccinated and therefore I’m safe.	1642862802.0	htqxebm	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqwxwy	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqxebm/
i4rplyk5	I do believe that your family members shouldn’t have been fired. It is their choice to be vaccinated. However, comparing mandates to the Holocaust is an extremity. The Holocaust is a tragic and god awful historical event that is just so hard to explain in words of how awful it was. It is wrong of them to downplay such an awful part of history. However, vaccine mandates are more comparable to “backing people into a corner” to sign a contract. I think it would be best if someone listened to their concerns and made them feel heard, perhaps try and help them find a vaccine option that makes them feel comfortable. By creating a positive and safe place for people to discuss the vaccine and instead judging them we can increase vaccination rates.	1642863071.0	htqxzwr	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqvoqc	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqxzwr/

i4rplyk5	I slightly disagree with your comment. I can sympathise with OP’s dad. He doesn’t trust the vaccine, and that is his choice. Prior to receiving the vaccine, you should have signed an agreement that you understood the risks associated with it and that if these risks harmed you, you or your kin could not sue for damages. That is a contract. I am a law student, and in my contracts subject we are taught about legislation in my country that protects individuals from being “back into a corner” and forced to sign a contract. Instead, we can create a comfortable and positive safe space for people who do not trust the vaccine to voice their concerns and opinions to help them feel listened and comfortable. We can then aide them to help find a vaccine choice that they are comfortable with. I did this with myself, I found Pfizer to be rude and I could not trust them. I also did not understand how their vaccine worked. So, I did research and found AstraZeneca to be more trustworthy and I also understood how it worked. If we did this for everyone, for our friends and family, we can increase vaccination rates. Vaccine mandates have also proven to lower vaccination rates, as evident by a vaccine mandate brought in by the British government between the 70s-90s (sorry I couldn’t remember exactly). I disagree with the dad’s decision but I sympathise with him. I also think it is good he stuck with his beliefs and morals instead of being backed into a corner. It is also important to remember vaccines is an individual’s choice as it will affect the body. Their body their choice. They have no duty of care to anyone, and I slightly believe it is entitled and selfish to demand someone get vaccinated whether it be against their beliefs. Since there were claims that a fetus’ cells were used in the production of the Pfizer vaccine, many people refused to get it due to religious reasons. I did not believe the claim was real, but what if it was? Pfizer just shut down these people before trying to hold a safe and positive conversation to address their concerns. Do you think this kind of attitude inclines them to get vaccinated? However, instead of calling these people selfish and stupid, I talked to them about it and convinced them to instead research into other possible vaccine choices that aligned with their religious beliefs, and made them feel comfortable.	1642863774.0	htqzjix	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqxfzl	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqzjix/
i4rplyk5	I agree! Though I disagree with the dad, I think it’s honourable he stood in what he believed. He wasn’t pushed in a corner and forced to sign a vaccine agreement (effectively a contract that means him or his kin can’t sue for damages). I just hope OP changes their attitude and instead tries talking to their dad and help him find a comfortable vaccine option.	1642864041.0	htr04r5	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htql6fd	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htr04r5/
i4rplyk5	Agreed! I think people need to understand that sometime throughout their life they’ve gotten a cold and maybe they went to work, school or just out. They then passed that cold onto someone else, and maybe that person came into contact with a vulnerable person and that person eventually died. This is the law of nature. You could be vaccinated against measles and still pass it. A good example is how my older sister got exposed to the chickenpox virus when she was a newborn baby. She was still breast feeding and therefore had antibodies from my mum. I got chickenpox and then my sister got exposed to the virus a second time, but she didn’t have the vaccine yet because she was too young and didn’t have natural immunity. Therefore, she got shingles. I don’t feel guilty about it because I can’t control a virus. Even now being vaccinated against covid, I can still get it and spread it. It could be spread to my grandma by accident. This is the sad truth but reality to diseases and unfortunately it’s something we have to accept. Yes we can try and minimise the damage, but how many people skip their flu shots or actively went to work when sick and didn’t care if they were a danger to others back then?	1642864482.0	htr13q3	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpz5gu	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htr13q3/

Unfortunate he didn't have support from his family. If it wasn't mandated he'd still be employed.

i4rplyk5	Understandable. If they’ve placed themselves in an environment such as Facebook anti vaccine groups, it’s difficult to communicate with them. One of my cousin-in-laws used to be anti-vax, but then my uncle (a doctor) was very polite to them and showed them all the medical research on every vaccinate available to their children. I wouldn’t recommend isolating yourself from them as it might reinforce the echo chamber they’ve placed themselves into. I’m very happy to hear that you were as positive as possible, a lot of people aren’t like that and it’s such a shame. I think it mainly stems from not understanding how vaccines work, and false reports and studies such as the one that states vaccines cause autism. I read a study that people who have studied vaccines in school and understand how they work are substantially less likely to be anti-vaxed. In my country and state, we have a law that states you cannot receive government assistance if your children are not vaccinated but only with vaccines that have been approved by like our version of the FDA. However, my country’s FDA is very strict and is much better (less prone to corruption due to legislation etc). I am against the vaccine certificates, but what your aunt is doing is wrong. I strongly believe in upholding the law. When she gets caught, definitely reinforce the idea that she broke the law willingly. Perhaps if you persist with a positive attitude, and try and break them from the echo chamber, it could lead to a breakthrough?	1642867451.0	htr832b	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htr6qh7	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htr832b/
i4rplyk5	No problem. I’m sorry if it seemed like I jumped to any conclusions also. There’s a lot of misinformation out there, it’s just about informing others about it. The media is hardly a trustworthy source, I don’t even watch the news anymore. I hope you do change their minds in hopes their children do get vaccinated and that they themselves get their boosters.

hivoa9u4	I went on a date with a woman recently, she brought up the argument “what if you take up a bed in a hospital because you’re not vaxxed and someone who was died because they couldn’t get in”, I told her “as far am I’m concerned, the amount of tax I’ve paid this year alone, I’d feel I’ve already paid for my bed and wouldn’t feel any way about it”.

745rnna	Yo!! This is an understandable feeling, it makes total sense. It’s in our nature as humans to experience jealousy. However, there are a few things you can try to remember that might help!! One is the fact that they ARE your friends, they’re going to give you a hard time no matter what. That’s what friends do. But you should still support them! The most important thing comes from another Reddit post though. A man writes that he struggled really badly through school, barely passing his classes and exams while his friends breezed through them. He was taking some pretty hard classes, but good friends were taking the same ones. He worked hard and persevered, passing his classes by the skin of his teeth. Now he works at NASA! He makes his main point at the end, saying that the grades aren’t what matter. As long as you’re trying your hardest, you remain optimistic, and you remain CURIOUS then things will work out for you. I’m not sure if this helps how you’re feeling, but I have a personal take on these feelings too. Wherever I get these feelings, I think about it in a karma like way. People who build these resentful feelings lose themselves and their success to bitterness. But if you remain happy and supportive while you work your ass off and stay on your path (doing what you SHOULD be doing), then the universe will take care of you. I know that’s cliche and kinda cringe but I’ve seen it multiple times in my own life and the lives of people around me. If you stay on the path the universe has in store for you, she will help you get where you need to be.	1643217358.0	hubfyba	t3_sd56j4	t3_sd56j4	/r/offmychest/comments/sd56j4/my_friends_are_always_better_than_me_and_im/hubfyba/

You honestly have no right to tell her or conclude that cigarettes caused his autism unless you have a peer reviewed research study with that as the conclusion….I looked it up for you https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5489536/#Abs1title - in summary, the super brilliant scientists could not correlate smoking to causing autism….but you magically can??  My oldest 2 are neurotypical and my youngest 2 are autistic. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs and neither does my SO.

At least I'll be honest with my double standards and admit I'm an asshole for it. You're a man. You slept with a girl. She raped you. But the fact you haven't cut ties already implies you still feel as if you can heal the relationship from this. So evaluate what is more important: your continued relationship or your self respect. She took away what cannot be restored. Even though I have trouble comprehending this as a non religious virgin man(as in I don't understand why you care at all actually. Someone wanted you badly enough to rape you. This isn't a power thing in this scenario), I think if you truly cared about your vows, you'd hold her and the rest of her family accountable. By law or otherwise.	1643328386.0	huihfcc	t3_se6y2b	t3_se6y2b	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huihfcc/

He's not just very young, he also just had his beliefs, trust and body all violated. People going through that usually don't think right for awhile. That's probably why he's asking here for console rather than what you or I would do, cut ties and report her.

He aught to know that if he thinks that. Maybe I'm sparing him some hours of grief and pity. Maybe I'm making the hole deeper. I know what works for me. Nothing like a jab in the soul to get me off my ass. But thats me. And when you ask strangers for advice, you'll get a little bit of everything. As for the power thing, being desired as a man is a scarcity only a lucky few don't understand. All I'm saying is its a better problem to have. Otherwise you'll end up like me, a person who completely doesn't understand why this entire scenario is this negative.

euujkgxz	I understand, but I'm just not sure about a female friend who is one year older than you (16) who asks you (a 15 year old) to sleep over, and you are a 15 year old guy, I just don't think it is rape in the traditional sense.  I understand the obvious though.  As I meditate on it, i'm just not sure it is rape.  Too many hormones at play, and the dynamics are different.  If it was a girl, who was interested in saving herself, she quite simply would of never slept over, no question.  I'm not sure about this.  It is interesting fodder for sure.	1643334171.0	huiv6xv	t3_se6y2b	t1_huittci	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huiv6xv/

bnarsgzj	The whole idea of "most guys would kill for this," is very, very untrue. I've come across a lot of boys/men who aren't looking for this kind of thing. I would say that most men I've met aren't looking for this kind of thing. It's a false idea that is very dangerous to society.   Just because it was a female that committed the rape doesn't excuse it. To say "this happens all day with young girls." That's bullshit too. As a woman, I try to be very consideration of my partners wishes and boundaries. Any human being who is told "no" but then has sex with someone without consent is committing rape.   It is not uncommon for men to be raped, it is under-reported.   OP, please please find an adult you trust and get help. Getting help now is the best way to make sure you mental health doesn't go downhill. This is NOT your fault and you did not deserve it. And a side note, only you can give your virginity away, it cannot be taken.	1643334881.0	huiwu8n	t3_se6y2b	t1_huiole1	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huiwu8n/

1qqa1clh	Yes, ethically this is 100% rape. I’m so sorry this happened to you. Realistically, you may not have much legal recourse. You’d have to contend with deeply ingrained gender stereotypes that will work against you, and state laws (if you’re in the US) vary widely in how they define and punish rape. Taking it to court can be retraumatizing for many victims, even though we all want to stop rapists from hurting more people. I would look into your state’s sexual assault laws and see how they define rape and sexual assault. I was raped but my state did not consider it rape (intoxication and coercion type of situation).  Your reaction of freezing up and letting things happen is completely normal and it does NOT mean you consented. She knew the limits of your consent and willingly chose to violate them. That’s rape.   Rape is not sex. It is a crime. You did not lose your virginity—you did not have sex, you were raped. It makes complete sense that you feel even more violated and hurt because you wanted to wait until marriage. Just know that you don’t need to bear any guilt for the virginity side of things. Virginity is a social construct, not biological. I sincerely hope you find healing and peace.	1643334911.0	huiwwo5	t3_se6y2b	t3_se6y2b	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huiwwo5/
31r1j2sg	it is rape. it is in the traditional sense. any sex that any party has not consented for is considered rape, there is no other way to look at it. hormones don’t matter, it’s still a crime. the fact is that even if he agreed to undress in front of her, stayed over, all of that, he still in no way expressed consent, verbal or otherwise, for any sexual behaviour and even told her to stop.	1643334999.0	huix420	t3_se6y2b	t1_huiv6xv	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huix420/

euujkgxz	Yes, you are 100% correct in a legal sense.  I am simply saying that I want you to imagine a girl who is 15 being invited over to the 16 year old guys house and the guy forces himself upon her .... that is a different version of rape.  I am a fairly sensitive guy but I don't believe they are the same version of rape.  Then you add the idea that he wants to save himself for marriage.  Hmmm, gives you pause as there is no way a 15 year old girl who wants to save themselves for marriage stays at the guys house.	1643335618.0	huiyjuk	t3_se6y2b	t1_huix420	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huiyjuk/

ality68d	Sorry that this happened to you. It is technically rape, yes. I think you need to talk to a therapist, work through how you feel about all of this, and decide the proper course of action.   Given that it was her 16th birthday, there is a lot of expectations and pressure around that bday, especially for young women, and she probably had this built up in her head as her sweet 16 where she has sex at the end of the night and it's a big deal, etc. She also probably thought that you were just scared to have sex and she'd change your mind by you both being naked, etc. etc. All that said, the way she went about it without your consent is completely wrong, manipulative, and harmful to you. It's obvious she had a plan and while she probably thought you'd change your mind and get into it, it sounds like you didn't go along with it or change your mind at any point, which means ultimately, it is definitely a form of rape.   Finding an adult you can trust to talk to is a good idea, but I can see how you might be conflicted or want to not say anything so as to not get the law involved since this is somebody you've known for so long. So talking to a professional who is not directly emotionally tied to you may be good, because they will be less reactive.   On the religious side of things - if there is a god, and that God is just, this won't be held against you since it wasn't your fault. So I know you feel horrible about breaking your vow, but if this happened the way you said it did, it was out of your control.   Do you have mental health resources through school or anything? There are hotlines as well - it may be possible to get connected to a good therapist relatively anonymously to help you process this and then decide the right course of action.   Also, have you talked to her since? Does she feel bad? Has she apologized? Not that it would make up for what she did at all, but it will surely influence how you decide to proceed. It may be wise to take some distance to help you think clearly about what you want and what's best for you at this point.	1643336241.0	huizzwv	t3_se6y2b	t3_se6y2b	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huizzwv/

3dahwvby	I'm pretty sure that there's also the factor that the guy was quite tired and pretty much _couldn't fight back_.  Rape is rape, what changes are how the power dynamics are shaken. A guy raping a girl, in most cases, would require greater physical strength and an isolated area while a girl raping a guy would require that the girl put the guy in a situation where he can't fight back or else get his his life shafted.  Both are rape, both are taking advantage of someone by either abusing your own power or their vulnerability, and both take away at someone else's freedom in order to satisfy the depraved desires of the perpetrator.	1643339322.0	huj7238	t3_se6y2b	t1_huiyjuk	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huj7238/

ber1lk7e	I know it’s not Covid because I had that a month ago, and I tested for it a few times, including last night, but they all came back negative. As for the pain, I managed to convince myself for a while that the itchiness was psychosomatic and that the increase in pain might have been from me fidgeting with it and inadvertently scratching it in my panic. I want to believe that I’m just sick from flu or something like that, but nobody else in my family is remotely unwell.	1643381424.0	hul6hxa	t3_ses45q	t1_hul5jbh	/r/offmychest/comments/ses45q/convinced_i_have_hiv_lots_of_symptoms_all_at_once/hul6hxa/
ber1lk7e	Thank you for your reassuring words, HIV anxiety seems to be the principal health anxiety I have, insomuch as I only ever freak out this much when it comes to it as a possibility.   As for the parties, I made a point of stopping going to them years ago and yet on New Year I slipped up one time when I could have been safe with my family, and the fact that it might have ruined my life breaks my heart.

ber1lk7e	This is very true, but the party at this point was about a month ago, and the symptoms have gradually shown them self only after a few weeks since then.   I think you’re right about doing an overall test, the problem is that HIV tests require waiting a good while after the possible exposure, and it’s that wait which is killing me	1643382079.0	hul84p6	t3_ses45q	t1_hul7cv9	/r/offmychest/comments/ses45q/convinced_i_have_hiv_lots_of_symptoms_all_at_once/hul84p6/
ber1lk7e	Thank you for your kind words! If I’m negative I’ll probably avoid anything sex related for a while just for the sake of my sanity!

ber1lk7e	I live with my three brothers and my parents so it’s a very male and straight environment, so if I was positive my family would just believe I was gay even though I’m not, and I would’ve possibly been some male victim of sexual assault, I don’t think they’d know what to do. If I was positive it wouldn’t be much use taking treatment so I could have sex anyway, I’d hardly be in a position to get a girlfriend again	1643383703.0	hulcafs	t3_ses45q	t1_hulbg23	/r/offmychest/comments/ses45q/convinced_i_have_hiv_lots_of_symptoms_all_at_once/hulcafs/

ber1lk7e	Yeah that makes sense. I think I’d rather just cut out the middle man and kill myself if I am positive though. Any conversation about relationships, sex or health already makes me upset because I’ve convinced myself I’m positive. If it’s confirmed it’d be better just to end things, since it’s no life when I’m some miserable wreck who can’t have basic conversations with people aha	1643384694.0	hulewty	t3_ses45q	t1_huld6f4	/r/offmychest/comments/ses45q/convinced_i_have_hiv_lots_of_symptoms_all_at_once/hulewty/

Is there any shelter that you can go? Please watch the show Maid on Netflix, yeah it’s a show but it still shows you how the main actress got away from her abusive boyfriend. It only gets worse from there if you stay with him. You say that he doesnt make up for the bad with good, this will actually help you move on faster. The problem with breaking up and moving on is that we tend to forget the bad and keep thinking of the good because we miss them. Him being a pos that he is, will make it easier for you ti move on. Please call ANY family or friends that you have and if you feel comfortable, tell them.

Also are you considering him to him liking younger women cause that’s a big age gap for your situation still being in school and him being in adulthood.

acn1jii5	Depends. You're giving me a vague scenario. If said woman comes on here to defend her capacity to use and manipulate wealthy men where her love lies only in his resources and not the man, she is promoting a harmful lifestyle and deserves to be shamed. If she comes on here just to defend her standard for wealthy men, I'd assume she is also using wealthy men, because few ever shame women for the only other alternative: only dating wealthy men while having standards beyond just wealth, thereby not using the man for his resources. I'm going to assume you're giving me the gold digger scenario, in which case it is not comparable.

15ke27	Doctors and nurses aren't dictators. There is a reason doctors and nurses don't just automatically have medical power of attorney over patients. You inform your patients based on best medical advice and keep your personal feelings and opinions out of it. Period. It's not your hospital. Patients' health-related choices are not your choice. You're an employee. Just do your job and shut up.   In our society, criminals get lawyers and trials... even if they're on camera committing crimes. It's no different. You don't rant about that...  I'm so sick of anti-anti-vax bullshit. It's about humanity. There is no healthcare response heirarchy based on your opinions (ie. you disagree with their behaviour or views so you think they should lose healthcare access).

j09f8612	I respect your opinion, however, that’s not the case for most people. Even if they’re young and healthy. My healthy and fit cousin, who was 21 at the time, got COVID and was in severe respiratory distress. She’s recovered but it took a v long time and she was on a breathing treatment at the hospital for it since she couldn’t even get a word out or take full breaths without coughing. She was incredibly weak.   I’d you read my post carefully, it wasn’t about convincing people to get the vaccine. It was the frustration of these people coming to the ED and REFUSING any treatment from us. I also just threw in some useful information that I’ve seen first hand rather than posting a link to something found online that can lead to confusion and misconceptions.

j9qldutz	Perhaps you and your doctors should know that if they already have covid, the shot is even worse and more useless than it is normally. And I thought monoclonal antibody treatments were mostly banned now? Nurse/doctor used to carry weight. Used to think they were saints with an oath and trustworthy folks that knew what they were doing, they would not have the capacity to call fellow humans a waste of space. Even criminals would be treated. I'd never go to a hospital willingly these days. So I agree with that part and I don't know what she was looking for if not the monoclonal.

Women sleeping around with alot of men is always going to be considered badly. And why should you as a man take a women seriously, when or if she gets bored or angry at you, all she has to do is open her dms and tell anyone of the guys dm her to take her out.  A man does not have that option, far more harder for a man to be entertained by women, but its not the other way around.

98pbfmb9	Leave him. My ex was like this too. He made me dread birthdays and holidays so much with his appalling treatment of me that one of the biggest motivations to finally cut him off was that I couldn’t bear to spend another holiday feeling miserable and sorry for myself.  He didn’t even get me any present like yours did but still expected seggs. I only asked that he bring me on a proper date where we could dress nicely, but he always insisted that I sneaked to his house for seggs first even on my birthday, and only offered to pay for dinner after when he saw that we ordered something cheap (less than $10). If i had ordered something more expensive he would have conveniently waited another week to offer to pay for it.  The Valentine’s Day he offered me was just as bad… he wanted me to sneak over to his room for seggs again because valentines and very generously offered to cook me instant noodles. His excuse was that restaurants would be fully booked (then pick up the phone and call up to reserve in advance, bastard). This is when I had a perfectly good meal of salmon waiting for me at home—why the fuck would I travel all the way to his place and be a free bangmaid for a pathetic bowl of cold instant noodles?

c5ip795h	Hi :) Happy birthday <3 I completely understand you, my birthday is coming up in less than 2 weeks.. my 21st and I could not care less. My mom keeps asking what I want to do but little does she know I’ve felt upset and unmotivated to do anything. I’m a year behind in college because I didn’t know what I wanted to do either. Right now I’m trying to finish with an associates degree in science—if I can pass pre-cal. I was in your position last year, hating my job and wanting to be hopeful again. My advice to you is choosing any ‘adult’ job, like front desk or an assistant maybe. I got a front desk job at a chiropractor office—by luck—but it makes me feel good, like I’m doing something ‘professional’ I guess. Those jobs will also look good on a resume. I’m trying to move out of my parents house too. But I have 2 friends and I’m afraid of living with them because I’m afraid we will see different sides of each other and argue. Just like you, I want to be hopeful again, and move out of my parents house to gain some independence.	1643949087.0	hvir7l2	t3_sk3nz5	t3_sk3nz5	/r/offmychest/comments/sk3nz5/my_depression_was_getting_better_until_today/hvir7l2/

ch5124ke	As someone who just started, I gotta say: it does seem like unreachable, especially when you're broke, until you have your first appointment with the professional. My very first appointment with sexuologist (in my country I first have to gather some documentation from sexuologist and psychologist before I can get my data changed) was totally life changing, I went from "I don't know if it's worth it, I probably won't be able to do it" to "LET'S FUCKIN' GOOOO" in literally an hour, which is how long the apointment lasted. It cleared my doubts, wiped off my concerns and honestly made me more comfortable with myself.    Transition takes time. Depending on where you live it takes more or less steps. So if anything, you can always retreat or pause. But if I can give you any advice, just see a professional and talk your concerns with them. Look for either trans-friendly psychologist or someone who specifically gets people through transition. Doing the first step doesn't mean you have to go all the way from there but if it can spark this hope that it's actually possible then it's worth trying, believe me.	1643963815.0	hvjevnb	t3_sk4u5f	t3_sk4u5f	/r/offmychest/comments/sk4u5f/i_wish_i_could_transition_but_i_can_never/hvjevnb/
e1d3rheg	Hey, sorry about the "warm welcome" you got from the other user. I'm a month late but whatever. I just stumbled upon your post and figured "what the hell, let's reply". It's scary af how much I can relate to the first part of the text. Even the same age. As for the rest I cannot say much, since I never became good looking, lol. Not ugly either, just meh. I don't complain tho, I like being as noticible as a blank wall.  I hope the ending brackets in your post worked out well, the whole friendship thing I mean.    It makes sense you were hated a lot, since you achieved a lot while everyone else stood behind. It's kind of a paradox. Authorities came out and assured the community, with proof, that you're a good person with great qualities, who's worth loving and be loved by, which got you hate from your equals instead.  I mean, when I play Mario Kart (yeah, I'm using that as an analogy) I just hate the guy that's in first place. Not even one second into the game, I hate him, since I'm in the race, worse yet, that just means I hate the race. I don't even need to know the guy's face to get an evil satisfaction when throwing a blue shell. Me hating you is nothing personal, I'm just trying to heal the tragic fact I don't like racing, and yet, I'm stuck in a race.   You just need to love good qualities in people (loving good qualities, not people alone. Any good quality in anyrhing) more than you hate bad qualities in people. It's necessary, it's an advantage. Master this and it will lead you to love all your good qualities more than you hate the hate it may attract.   Idk man. I'm not a psychologist, I don't even speak english. I'm just giving you a picture of what getting out of the hole looks like in theory. I'm Just a guy who figured out that I paid my good fair of depression and it was my turn to enjoy this, my character arc, my will, almost like some sort of revenge, to be happy at all costs.  Anyways...  I'm here for you, OP, if anything surfices. Good luck!	1643964391.0	hvjfmdg	t3_rm3vqp	t3_rm3vqp	/r/offmychest/comments/rm3vqp/gifted_hypersensitive_girl_struggling_with_bad/hvjfmdg/

ch5124ke	Well I did and you confirmed, I said we cannot agree to disagree on people's rights to be respected and you said  we can, are you not keeping up? Also you are actively disrespecting transgender people, which kinda applies that they don't deserve respect in your eyes.

5oxx2j0o	You are forming thoughts in your head that I am not stating. It seems I am not the one who is not caught up. If we are conversing, then repeat my exact words, not some failed reiteration of my statements.   What I’m ultimately saying is that I simply disagree with the fundamental idea of transitioning. However, I believe you should have the right to do so because that is something this country tries to claim it is built on, a set of liberties and freedoms that we all hold dear.	1643985194.0	hvkcg4e	t3_sk4u5f	t1_hvkbt91	/r/offmychest/comments/sk4u5f/i_wish_i_could_transition_but_i_can_never/hvkcg4e/
ch5124ke	Okay.  Me: We cannot agree to disagree on respecting other human being and their rights  You: Yes we can disagree.  Here 🤷  Well by disagreeing with the fact that transgender men are men, which again are your exact words to me, you are one - spreading misinformation, two - disrespecting them and three - just simply wrong about that. Facts are that transgender men are men, it's science and I doubt you have the qualifications to argue with statements of people who studied transgender people for years.	1643985887.0	hvke33b	t3_sk4u5f	t1_hvkcg4e	/r/offmychest/comments/sk4u5f/i_wish_i_could_transition_but_i_can_never/hvke33b/

7myd7lhc	You're not obligated to give him sex. It has to be a mutual agreement between you both without use of any form of manipulation or guilt tripping to convince you. It lacks feeling and feels downright repulsive because, as you said, it feels transactional. It's as if the value of the object he's giving you is the valuation he made on you. It makes you question if that's all you're worth/good to him.   I wonder how he'd respond if you were to tell him "I don't want your gift, so does that mean I still have to repay you for that?" It would be sad if he doesn't realize how messed up that is. Worse if he does realize it, but doesn't care.  You have every right to say "no", and why you feel that way. If he can't understand that and meet you half way to fix the situation, then he's the problem. In that case, you'd be better off without him.	1643994110.0	hvkzmyr	t3_sk00q2	t3_sk00q2	/r/offmychest/comments/sk00q2/im_dreading_my_birthday_because_my_bf_expects/hvkzmyr/

I mean it was decided in civil court that MLK was murdered by a completely different man than that one arrested and that man did it on behalf of government agencies. They still teach MLK was shot by the man in jail and the king family has been trying to get him released for like 30 years. This stuff isnt a conspiracy it was proven in court, but depending on who you tell this to they are libel to think your a crazy person. People hold too much faith in governments.   Also Facebook uses a government funded  Organization to police their web site in the usa. So on top of all this we the tax payers are paying to be censored online. We are paying to be spied on to the point where it is common practice for eliet to put tape over their webcam, so we are all aware we are being spied on and we are just ok with it like an Orwellian future hell scape. “Oh why do you care if they are spying on you, if your doing nothing wrong yoo have nothing to hide” even though the line for what is wrong moves on a daily basis and what you did yesterday that wasn’t wrong could suddenly become a felony.	1644023737.0	hvn37nv	t3_skqoh6	t1_hvmump6	/r/offmychest/comments/skqoh6/931_of_all_covid_deaths_in_the_usa_are_for_people/hvn37nv/

If you're going to be offended by my advice, then DM me and I will delete my post.  Ok so with powerful men that work with a young lady, they focus on a few but very important things; your hair, face, eyes, teeth, tits, ass, and legs. Hair and eyes are cosmetic things that can be quickly solved with money. Curology is excellent for facial skin. I recommend it. How's your teeth? It doesn't matter if they are shit on the inside. How are they on the outside? Chipped? Crooked? Yeah you need to fix that shit with a dentist. How's your titties? Are they bouncy, pointy, or do they sag like an gorilla? Try to where a push up bra to keep your breast at eye level. Men like that shit, and even some women appreciate the powerful confidence of shoving your boobs in a man's face. How does your chest area look? Like the area below your neck and above your tits. Is it a crater botched mess? Lots of scratches. Definitely clean that shit up, and scratch something else less obvious like your arm or whatever. Ok let's talk about your ass. It has to be big and bouncy. Like do you have like a flat brick wall of a butt? Ew get rid of that. That's gross. You have to work on trimming the fat on your hips and rounding your ass with proper leg exercises including squats. Medicine ball exercises are a must, especially for lifting. Legs have to be toned. No doubt. Like exercises will help trim the fat and build muscle. A rowing machine is your best friend. Make sure your legs are shaved too. No one wants to hire a sasquatch. I hope this list of small goals will help you be the lady you need to achieve your professional goals.	1644172450.0	hvub6ib	t3_slzlrb	t3_slzlrb	/r/offmychest/comments/slzlrb/i_need_to_become_perfect_before_i_go_to_business/hvub6ib/

hdat7a84	Could there be some abuse, or a really traumatic experience in your child's past? It seems like they may be taking steps towards some sort of extreme identity removal, with the transition and subsequent attempts, and also they are willing to hide extremely important information from you and others as evident by this event.   I want to point out that I'm not discrediting your child's feelings, their want to transition, any gender disphoria, or the plight of the trans community and the struggle of being trans in a non-accepting society. On top of that its hard enough simply being a teenager, going to school, dealing with shitty teenagers' bullying both online and off, and the innate pressure of our school system that both subtly and non-subtly implies you should have your entire future figured out by senior year. Also I am not saying that if something traumatic happened that it invalidates your child's need to transition.  I am not a psychologist, psychiatrist, nor a medical professional in any shape or form, just a cheeto-fingered redditor that thinks this may be a topic worth somehow pursuing.	1644182634.0	hvv0i5r	t3_sm2hd0	t3_sm2hd0	/r/offmychest/comments/sm2hd0/im_watching_my_family_fall_apart_and_it_breaks_my/hvv0i5r/

You can't apply today's standards to the past it's just not realistic. Basic needs were literally life and death you could die from things that would be unthinkable nowadays. Was it fair no but the world is not fair human nature is not fair it's the way things were go back to any point in history and you will see conquests and wars etc. But I think from all the bad things this country came out in a great place for everyone involved is it perfect no but nothing is and that is what everyone should be focused on making things better not feeling guilt over things that you had no control over or you can't possibly understand	1645038648.0	hx7j6wj	t3_stnx27	t1_hx7e3dd	/r/offmychest/comments/stnx27/native_americans_deserved_so_much_better/hx7j6wj/

7jrxte3a	That's how things were done back then. It's not whitewashing history it's fact. They were not some flower power peaceful people the raided and enslaved themselves long before we came. The world was different and we did not exterminate them they are a part of us now. Yes they defended themselves yes and lost that is end of the story we moved on since then. But to sit here and act like it was murder no that is incorrect it was conquest and expansion they would have did se thing of it was flipped and they had the ability.  Having some misplaced guilt over something that was common place way before you were born is not healthy. It's done and nothing can change that we are all Americans now so we should be moving forward like that instead of trying to dissect something that has zero bearing on today's life	1645041195.0	hx7pwdx	t3_stnx27	t1_hx7kp1f	/r/offmychest/comments/stnx27/native_americans_deserved_so_much_better/hx7pwdx/

So what have you personally done to help them hot shot you donate every cent beyond what you need to live to them? You go out and help them in your free time or you sit here behind a keyboard and talk intellectual stupidity because that's what it sounds like to me .. that you are emotionally weak very weak. It's history it happend apparently you can't deal with that.  We conquered them and then made them a part of us they are American now and deserve not one thing different then any other American .

Do you know why we have tomahawk steaks, Apache helicopters, Washington redskins, etc???? These native Americans were our allies in many different wars against other native Americans. They intermarried and greatly influenced American culture.   This is why modern Americans are bad ass and the Europeans who didn’t integrate with native Americans are still soft and listless.   Do you know anything about the Comanche??? They had a huge territory and committed genocide on Native American group after Native American group.  The only reason we won is bc so many tribes were fleeing the genocidal Comanche that we learned their tactics and overwhelmed them.  At one point, they had defeated the French army, the Spanish army, the Mexican army, the American army...they were truly the most difficult foe america has ever faced.   TLDR: native Americans had no qualms about taking land through force...they just happened to lose.	1645054643.0	hx8nnbj	t3_stnx27	t3_stnx27	/r/offmychest/comments/stnx27/native_americans_deserved_so_much_better/hx8nnbj/

8efuymm3	My life as a adult is better then it ever was as a child. My father was a abusive alcoholic who use to smack the crap out of is kids and my mum. I was homeless at 16, made my own legal guardian after I had had enough and gave him a hiding. What I can tell you is it will get better. I'm 41 now, I own my own home, have a 6 figure income, married two kids living the dream happy as. But like you I thought the shit would never end....... It was a mate committing sucide that stopped me..... Suicide does not stop no pain at all, it actually transfers to the people who do actually care for you. I had to be stronger. So I carry his pain as well as my own . Suicide is not the answer, working in yourself to be the best you can be is. The best way to show everyone is to be more successful then them, the only person who can do that is you!	1645060644.0	hx914un	t3_subhf2	t1_hx8zil5	/r/offmychest/comments/subhf2/im_only_12_and_im_going_to_be_dead_in_3_days/hx914un/

6nktbl62	Heyyy just wanna reach out to say I am completely with you. I was in a similar boat a few months ago and ended up taking freelance contracts to just basically survive.   If you re in tech, recruitment (I d say 85%) is going downhill. Everyone copies n pastes behavioral questions from “FAANG” without context and the right people (ppl with org. psychology training) to conduct the interviews. The whole time I felt like I had to twist my brain into a pretzel to come up with “good” answers that they expect even if it felt off on me.  Not only the protocol is weird, so are the people. Once I had this lady who completely muted herself every time she finished a question and it was my turn to speak and it made me feel like I was speaking to a void 🥴. Still I was supposed to just ignore it and deliver my standardized answers.  My interview season was also terrible because I had to do “case studies” which was ultimately exploitative and timewasting. They cost me an average 6hrs each to finish. The funny thing is I thought finally this is my advantage because I am super well researched and I tend to let my work speak for me but noooo. I still ended up not getting the job because I was awkward at the behavioral questions 😪	1645080012.0	hxa1gxl	t3_sh5jcc	t3_sh5jcc	/r/offmychest/comments/sh5jcc/i_feel_like_giving_up_on_job_hunting/hxa1gxl/

jilun742	If that were true, why are all of them so nasty for no reason? Some want people to like me (XY chromosomes) dead. Why should I let a nazi-like ideology spread around the world? Soon I might be in a concentration camp for all we know.  I’m transitioning more than just bigoted women. I felt safer being seen as a woman and having men protect me. I have a physical disadvantage for being effeminate and 5 ft 5. The reality is I rather be seen as a woman than a short man because you’re going to get clapped.  I still wish I have my own family but thinking about why should I bring up children (more so a male one) to a man-hating world we live in right now? We are on the edge of war, and they might not exist anyway because of the lack of decent, classic and respectful women, not the modern-day Karen with short hair and dyed it pink.	1645095016.0	hxakksk	t3_sulhtx	t1_hxajw5r	/r/offmychest/comments/sulhtx/im_undateable_to_women/hxakksk/

jsgrngkw	First off you need to be telling the whole story and not just half of it. You make it sound like your the victim in all this when you orchestrated this mess in the first place. Open relationships never work. The fact that you didn’t love your wife for years is what has built up to these exact moments. Wanting to dump your kids off so you can go see your “girlfriend” doesn’t make you a good father. Your wife went into this open relationship to help you love her more because it is what you wanted. So you need to get the facts straight. You never wanted those kids and you haven’t been a good husband or father to your wife and kids. You are the reason things got out of control. You are “the man” and you rather mess around with some girl or guy or be too wrapped up in worlds of war craft to maturely work on your relationship to be a better man and husband and father. It’s sad and it is pathetic that your coming on here to get sympathy when you are actually the one who needs a reality check.	1645105704.0	hxb26vt	t3_ssv329	t3_ssv329	/r/offmychest/comments/ssv329/i_had_my_wife_arrested_today/hxb26vt/
csv617rk	Yeah, I think it honestly really had to do with finding the right group of friends. I do not feel pressured to keep my feelings inside or not to share with my friends on how I feel....I am just a private guy who likes to keep things inside. I wasn't taught by society or my Dad or anyone to feel this way, it is just my personality.  I think there are more men with this type of personality than women. Do not get me wrong, there are terrible fathers out there that tell you to keep shit deep down inside but luckily I did not have a father like that.	1645117757.0	hxbw457	t3_suizz1	t1_hxb49h4	/r/offmychest/comments/suizz1/you_know_what_sucks_about_being_a_guy/hxbw457/

hf2dfocv	To be fair OP's dad just seems like a cheapskate, old school father who, in his eyes didn't want to buy the "milk" when he already had it at home.  What further proves this is how OP's father didn't care when OP bought vanilla ice cream using their own money.  I seriously think this is a case of a dad being a cheap ass dad and less of "controlling, toxic, evil douche bag" that everyone else is painting him as. That's what's hillarious to me: the fact everyone is jumping on this hate wagon making it seem like OP's dad is an emotionally abusive demon from hell when he's probably just a cheap old man with flaws logic.	1645149838.0	hxe509b	t3_suzvef	t1_hxe48i5	/r/offmychest/comments/suzvef/growing_up_i_was_never_allowed_to_have_vanilla/hxe509b/

OP's dad is literally *the* worst type of human being I've known (excluding myself) and quite frankly I personally now find his actions offensive to me.

35igpx9s	OP, i’m so sorry this happened to you. I can’t imagine being in your position. You sound incredibly strong. Your kids are going to be able to recognize that eventually. I know that things may seem very scary & overwhelming right now (& i’m sure they are), do whatever you have to do to properly grieve & be there for your children. I can’t give any advice on how to tell little man, I can’t imagine how hard that’s going to be. Please shoot me a message if I can help you in anyway. I know you said that he was your provider, are you & your kids okay right now? (food, shelter, transport?) If comfortable, i’d love to send something your way to take off a bit of stress that you shouldn’t have to worry about. Please reach out. Sending all the love and good vibes to you & your babies during this incredibly difficult time.	1645194942.0	hxg7exk	t3_svj5rr	t3_svj5rr	/r/offmychest/comments/svj5rr/my_fiancé_died_today/hxg7exk/

i39ye69s	But, it does happen. It happened in my case. It’s happened in others. It’s kids with guns, no morals and no rational thinking. If I had to guess what happened, they probably tried to take the bag from him without paying and my fiancé wasn’t going for it. Probably put up a fight and was shot. I’m not sure where you’re from but, in my area people get killed for less. People get shot and killed for literally NO REASON. Everyday. Wrong place, wrong time scenarios. It can happen and it does happen. It happened to my fiancé and it’s happened to others before him.	1645199262.0	hxghwfu	t3_svj5rr	t1_hxghgir	/r/offmychest/comments/svj5rr/my_fiancé_died_today/hxghwfu/

jl3tl7lf	Why is this such a common sentiment in young Americans? Messed up society you got over there, if people treat their "friends" and "lovers" better than their own families. And over such absurduties too. Wow, your father disn't let you eat vanilla ice cream, that's must be a lifelong trauma. Are you all mentally 10 years old over there?	1645200396.0	hxgkteh	t3_suzvef	t1_hxe9vo7	/r/offmychest/comments/suzvef/growing_up_i_was_never_allowed_to_have_vanilla/hxgkteh/

Seems very common nowadays. 20-somethings whining about the unforgivable sin of daddy not buying you ice cream... I'm not an American, but my impression from social media is that a huge number of young Americans act very entitled and have 0 respect for their parents and families.	1645200933.0	hxgm7ts	t3_suzvef	t1_hxf0hq8	/r/offmychest/comments/suzvef/growing_up_i_was_never_allowed_to_have_vanilla/hxgm7ts/
