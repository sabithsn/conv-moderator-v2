bruze3bk	You would have my sympathy if you did not feel the need to inject race into your story. I have been treated like shit at doctors offices and hospitals as well and I am not a female and I am not black, so have other members of my family. It is awful what happened to your love ones, no doubt.  Sounds like the medical staff you dealt with had no bed side manner.  As far as the fireman goes, they deal with all kinds of shit everyday, accidents, fires, drug overdoses, strokes, heart attacks, exc.  No first responder is going to come on the scene and just take your word for it.  They have training that teaches them how to access a patient and decide what the best course of action is.  Be it  a SOC-M in the military, a fireman, a paramedic or whatever, they have a processes.    Most medical professionals in my area (MD's, specialists, Nurse Practitioners, exc.) are POC. Most medical professionals look at things logically and analytically, not through the lens of race, politics, or gender.    Stop looking at everything through the lens of race.	1642781058.0	htm2cu5	t3_s97a33	t3_s97a33	/r/offmychest/comments/s97a33/angry_and_tired_of_how_the_healthcare_system/htm2cu5/

cxvrt4s0	I feel like there’s always been a division in America though, it’s just that the masks and vaccine have become concrete manifestations of the underlying issue.  It’s like the killing of George Floyd. Did that kickstart racism in America? Oh no, it’s been here, but that was the final straw after years and years of deep seated discrimination.  The reality is that Americans have always had hostility towards views contrary to their own. It’s just that Covid and the mask debate have made the disparity between conformism and anti conformism much more salient.  But the reality is that dissonance in America between political parties has been percolating for years, but the pandemic has become a new platform on which people vocalize their opinions.   The masks and vaccines aren’t the real problem, the need to assert one’s views is.	1642784264.0	htmazn9	t3_s9by4g	t3_s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htmazn9/

I literally sat in an ER waiting room for 15 hours with my elderly cancer patient grandfather who has CHF and was having trouble breathing because they triage a lung cancer patient who can't breathe as lower than other ailments.

4xr3g	I love this reply, and let's talk about it. Cults are a well-studied phenomenon that not very many people truly take the time to research and understand. Now I know, I know, you’re an educated, intelligent intellectual and know you would never wind up in a cult.  But name another group of humans who are as depressed, hopeless, lost, mentally ill, angry, upset, lonely, and desperate for a reason to live.  That’s right. It’s largely young adults: the generations whose lives were kicked off by 9/11, a financial crisis that never really ended, who grew up watching technology take over, went to school with the constant thought that one of our classmates might shoot us today, got lost in the abyss of capitalism working terrible jobs for a paycheck that won’t even cover a quarter of an apartment’s rent, are trying to start our lives in the middle of a pandemic, watched the American government system fail time after time after time, watched the justice system fail and fail and fail and fail -  Should I go on?	1642792420.0	htmx355	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htmw13e	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htmx355/

14vn14zv	Lol don't be too hard. Been on both sides of this fence.  Sometimes anxiety can work with you because it can make you appear humble, genuine,  and wholesome.  When I interview someone and they are nervous. I find it flattering, because I tell myself. If they didn't want really want the job or care about the work - then guess what. They wouldn't be nervous.  I won't hire people who aren't some level of nervous during an interview.  Anxiety won't be a deciding factor on you getting a job or not unless it's a public speaking job or something.	1642796168.0	htn7eho	t3_s9j53w	t3_s9j53w	/r/offmychest/comments/s9j53w/i_just_had_the_worst_job_interview_of_my_life/htn7eho/

e16ol3mc	No, he didn't leave his partner hanging. He made a choice about what to do with his body because that's his choice, and the choice cost him his job. Even suggesting he let someone down for making a personal healthcare decision about his own body is insane.   Oh, I'm vaccinated -- so is my entire family -- and we all got COVID-19. The vaccines are junk. Nobody got vaccinated to lessen the symptoms if we got COVID-19. We got the vaccine to stop the spread. Lies. Bullshit.  I'm a former pro-vaxxer, triple vaxxed indeed, and still got sick as shit, as did my entire family. The vaccines are garbage.	1642807425.0	hto20lw	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnfgtz	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/hto20lw/

91w4yqc9	I mean. I look at it like this. The Government hasn’t been the most trustworthy sources of information. Now before people get their pitch forks out, I am vaccinated with the booster. But besides the whole Qanon aspect, there are many legitimate reasons to not trust government.  Example: The Tuskegee Syphillus experiment which was conducted on an entire population of my fellow African Americans. Which if I remember was government sanctioned. So for a variety of people I can see their reluctance to trust something like that. That being said to each their own. No one is going to do something that they don’t want to do, especially when it involves sticking something into their own body.  It’s kinda shit your dad got fired wish their could have been a compromise. But public safety is public safety.

tc7qt	To be honest, using job to force people to get vaccinated is unjust.   I still think that no matter how good / how bad is the vaccine, the government should not use job security to force people to make a medical decision.  I thinkthe real concern should be that we agree to let government force people to inject things into their own body. It doesn't matter what it is. Even it is truly a vaccine, no conspiracy, I still think it is a problem.   I am not saying your father make a good decision. No matter how unjust this shit is, we probably need to consider our family first. But I am pissed that we even need to make this decision.	1642810961.0	htoau2a	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htoau2a/

Looks like you follow an ideology similar to « incels ». Which is an ideology, not a real tool to understand what the world is and how to live and attain happiness. A woman hurt me a lot recently too but I don’t feel the need to lie to myself and put this on the back of all women. You are just trying to hide your weaknesses revealed by a crush/gf/so who hurt your soul and is trying desperately to revenge on every girl. Hope that my comment helped you a little.

8e2ewhr9	Firstly as a man i am a bit offended that you are dragging all men over a cliff and usually i prefer to not drag gender into things but as an example i have been told multiple times by woman that bald men are ugly. I am a bald man. Do i think all women should do better and not comment on my appearance? No i dont. I think they are assholes who should learn to not be assholes.  At the same time i understand your frustrations. My advice is to ignore them, realise that they are a small loud minority but it seems like a lot because you are so aware of them. I was very insecure about my baldness and every comment made me feel like the world agreed with the statement that bald men are ugly. Usually the people we hear are the loud and opinionated people who really should just shut up so we could have a better world.

Sometimes we don't need friends to make us happy but ourselves. Trust me, I've been there. It's gon be hard at first but as time goes by you might love your own company.

At the end of the day, you both laid down and decided to do what was necessary to create the child. They were just as much your baby as they were hers. You absolutely should have had a say, assuming that you would’ve stepped up and been the father that you should’ve been, and I’m guessing you would.

745rnna	Yo!! This is an understandable feeling, it makes total sense. It’s in our nature as humans to experience jealousy. However, there are a few things you can try to remember that might help!! One is the fact that they ARE your friends, they’re going to give you a hard time no matter what. That’s what friends do. But you should still support them! The most important thing comes from another Reddit post though. A man writes that he struggled really badly through school, barely passing his classes and exams while his friends breezed through them. He was taking some pretty hard classes, but good friends were taking the same ones. He worked hard and persevered, passing his classes by the skin of his teeth. Now he works at NASA! He makes his main point at the end, saying that the grades aren’t what matter. As long as you’re trying your hardest, you remain optimistic, and you remain CURIOUS then things will work out for you. I’m not sure if this helps how you’re feeling, but I have a personal take on these feelings too. Wherever I get these feelings, I think about it in a karma like way. People who build these resentful feelings lose themselves and their success to bitterness. But if you remain happy and supportive while you work your ass off and stay on your path (doing what you SHOULD be doing), then the universe will take care of you. I know that’s cliche and kinda cringe but I’ve seen it multiple times in my own life and the lives of people around me. If you stay on the path the universe has in store for you, she will help you get where you need to be.	1643217358.0	hubfyba	t3_sd56j4	t3_sd56j4	/r/offmychest/comments/sd56j4/my_friends_are_always_better_than_me_and_im/hubfyba/

I’m going to be overly sensitive on this one because you need to educate yourself.  If you tell that to your mother, you’re a giant clown. You honestly have no right to tell her or conclude that cigarettes caused his autism unless you have a peer reviewed research study with that as the conclusion….I looked it up for you https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5489536/#Abs1title - in summary, the super brilliant scientists could not correlate smoking to causing autism….but you magically can??  My oldest 2 are neurotypical and my youngest 2 are autistic. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs and neither does my SO.   If someone rolled up to me and said “you did such and such so it’s your fault they have autism.” They’d look like the world’s biggest assholes because they literally are.

2mcdqt8k	First thing I see is double standards in the comments. If this was a girl, you'd all be calling for the guy to be arrested. At least I'll be honest with my double standards and admit I'm an asshole for it. You're a man. You slept with a girl. She raped you. But the fact you haven't cut ties already implies you still feel as if you can heal the relationship from this. So evaluate what is more important: your continued relationship or your self respect. She took away what cannot be restored. Even though I have trouble comprehending this as a non religious virgin man(as in I don't understand why you care at all actually. Someone wanted you badly enough to rape you. This isn't a power thing in this scenario), I think if you truly cared about your vows, you'd hold her and the rest of her family accountable. By law or otherwise.	1643328386.0	huihfcc	t3_se6y2b	t3_se6y2b	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huihfcc/

He's not just very young, he also just had his beliefs, trust and body all violated. People going through that usually don't think right for awhile. That's probably why he's asking here for console rather than what you or I would do, cut ties and report her. Power or not shouldn't be a consideration either (even though it sounds like she used her emotional power over him to take advantage), rape is rape.	1643329542.0	huik6wt	t3_se6y2b	t1_huihfcc	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huik6wt/

He aught to know that if he thinks that. Maybe I'm sparing him some hours of grief and pity. Maybe I'm making the hole deeper. I know what works for me. Nothing like a jab in the soul to get me off my ass. But thats me. And when you ask strangers for advice, you'll get a little bit of everything. As for the power thing, being desired as a man is a scarcity only a lucky few don't understand. All I'm saying is its a better problem to have. Otherwise you'll end up like me, a person who completely doesn't understand why this entire scenario is this negative. Whats worse, a potentially cascading mental catastrophe or an inate lifetime of doubt and loneliness.	1643330287.0	huilz7m	t3_se6y2b	t1_huik6wt	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huilz7m/

I understand the obvious though.  As I meditate on it, i'm just not sure it is rape.  Too many hormones at play, and the dynamics are different.  If it was a girl, who was interested in saving herself, she quite simply would of never slept over, no question.  I'm not sure about this.

bnarsgzj	The whole idea of "most guys would kill for this," is very, very untrue. I've come across a lot of boys/men who aren't looking for this kind of thing. I would say that most men I've met aren't looking for this kind of thing. It's a false idea that is very dangerous to society.   Just because it was a female that committed the rape doesn't excuse it. To say "this happens all day with young girls." That's bullshit too. As a woman, I try to be very consideration of my partners wishes and boundaries. Any human being who is told "no" but then has sex with someone without consent is committing rape.   It is not uncommon for men to be raped, it is under-reported.   OP, please please find an adult you trust and get help. Getting help now is the best way to make sure you mental health doesn't go downhill. This is NOT your fault and you did not deserve it.

1qqa1clh	Yes, ethically this is 100% rape. I’m so sorry this happened to you. Realistically, you may not have much legal recourse. You’d have to contend with deeply ingrained gender stereotypes that will work against you, and state laws (if you’re in the US) vary widely in how they define and punish rape. Taking it to court can be retraumatizing for many victims, even though we all want to stop rapists from hurting more people. I would look into your state’s sexual assault laws and see how they define rape and sexual assault. I was raped but my state did not consider it rape (intoxication and coercion type of situation).  Your reaction of freezing up and letting things happen is completely normal and it does NOT mean you consented. She knew the limits of your consent and willingly chose to violate them. That’s rape.   Rape is not sex. It is a crime. You did not lose your virginity—you did not have sex, you were raped. It makes complete sense that you feel even more violated and hurt because you wanted to wait until marriage. Just know that you don’t need to bear any guilt for the virginity side of things. Virginity is a social construct, not biological. I sincerely hope you find healing and peace.	1643334911.0	huiwwo5	t3_se6y2b	t3_se6y2b	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huiwwo5/
31r1j2sg	it is rape. it is in the traditional sense. any sex that any party has not consented for is considered rape, there is no other way to look at it. hormones don’t matter, it’s still a crime. the fact is that even if he agreed to undress in front of her, stayed over, all of that, he still in no way expressed consent, verbal or otherwise, for any sexual behaviour and even told her to stop.	1643334999.0	huix420	t3_se6y2b	t1_huiv6xv	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huix420/

euujkgxz	Yes, you are 100% correct in a legal sense.  I am simply saying that I want you to imagine a girl who is 15 being invited over to the 16 year old guys house and the guy forces himself upon her .... that is a different version of rape.  I am a fairly sensitive guy but I don't believe they are the same version of rape.  Then you add the idea that he wants to save himself for marriage.  Hmmm, gives you pause as there is no way a 15 year old girl who wants to save themselves for marriage stays at the guys house.	1643335618.0	huiyjuk	t3_se6y2b	t1_huix420	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huiyjuk/

ality68d	Sorry that this happened to you. It is technically rape, yes. I think you need to talk to a therapist, work through how you feel about all of this, and decide the proper course of action.   Given that it was her 16th birthday, there is a lot of expectations and pressure around that bday, especially for young women, and she probably had this built up in her head as her sweet 16 where she has sex at the end of the night and it's a big deal, etc. She also probably thought that you were just scared to have sex and she'd change your mind by you both being naked, etc. etc. All that said, the way she went about it without your consent is completely wrong, manipulative, and harmful to you. It's obvious she had a plan and while she probably thought you'd change your mind and get into it, it sounds like you didn't go along with it or change your mind at any point, which means ultimately, it is definitely a form of rape.   Finding an adult you can trust to talk to is a good idea, but I can see how you might be conflicted or want to not say anything so as to not get the law involved since this is somebody you've known for so long. So talking to a professional who is not directly emotionally tied to you may be good, because they will be less reactive.   On the religious side of things - if there is a god, and that God is just, this won't be held against you since it wasn't your fault. So I know you feel horrible about breaking your vow, but if this happened the way you said it did, it was out of your control.   Do you have mental health resources through school or anything? There are hotlines as well - it may be possible to get connected to a good therapist relatively anonymously to help you process this and then decide the right course of action.   Also, have you talked to her since? Does she feel bad? Has she apologized? Not that it would make up for what she did at all, but it will surely influence how you decide to proceed. It may be wise to take some distance to help you think clearly about what you want and what's best for you at this point.	1643336241.0	huizzwv	t3_se6y2b	t3_se6y2b	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huizzwv/

A guy raping a girl, in most cases, would require greater physical strength and an isolated area while a girl raping a guy would require that the girl put the guy in a situation where he can't fight back or else get his his life shafted.  Both are rape, both are taking advantage of someone by either abusing your own power or their vulnerability, and both take away at someone else's freedom in order to satisfy the depraved desires of the perpetrator.	1643339322.0	huj7238	t3_se6y2b	t1_huiyjuk	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/huj7238/

3dahwvby	Oh, if it really happened, then this absolutely rape, now way around it.  Your fears aren't that far-fetched either, it wouldn't be the first time someone's tried that. Do feel at easy though, most of the time those people are quite panicky and their ability to actually explain what happened usually devolves into them having a monologue this coming across a desperate.  This young fella seems to be more lost than anything. The situation is the kind of shit most singular brain cell teens want to happen to them and the whole way our culture treats these scenarios only serves make people confused on whether they should or shouldn't feel bad about something _that is clearly terrible_, yet highly _expected_.	1643341218.0	hujbbf9	t3_se6y2b	t1_huja7cb	/r/offmychest/comments/se6y2b/is_this_rape/hujbbf9/

ber1lk7e	I know it’s not Covid because I had that a month ago, and I tested for it a few times, including last night, but they all came back negative. As for the pain, I managed to convince myself for a while that the itchiness was psychosomatic and that the increase in pain might have been from me fidgeting with it and inadvertently scratching it in my panic.

ber1lk7e	This is very true, but the party at this point was about a month ago, and the symptoms have gradually shown them self only after a few weeks since then.   I think you’re right about doing an overall test, the problem is that HIV tests require waiting a good while after the possible exposure, and it’s that wait which is killing me	1643382079.0	hul84p6	t3_ses45q	t1_hul7cv9	/r/offmychest/comments/ses45q/convinced_i_have_hiv_lots_of_symptoms_all_at_once/hul84p6/

ber1lk7e	I live with my three brothers and my parents so it’s a very male and straight environment, so if I was positive my family would just believe I was gay even though I’m not, and I would’ve possibly been some male victim of sexual assault, I don’t think they’d know what to do.

ber1lk7e	Yeah that makes sense. I think I’d rather just cut out the middle man and kill myself if I am positive though.
