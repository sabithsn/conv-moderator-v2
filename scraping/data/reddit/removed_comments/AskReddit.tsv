h2s0u583	You've been brainwashed by the same institution that invented the term psyops in the first place. Your "people that think like you" is telling. You have been manipulated by a fascism ruse named "othering." You have bought into the idea that critical thought and skepticism should be banned world wide, that only a select few have the right to ask questions, and you call me anti-science? You have it backwards.      I won't be staying home, I'll be living my life while there's still some left of it. We can all die at a moment's notice, no matter how "safe" we pretend to be, or how much of our lives we hand to war criminals, and it didn't stop with Bush, the drones still fly today.	1640873256.0	hqjpd07	t3_rr8p9n	t1_hqjjcin	/r/AskReddit/comments/rr8p9n/what_do_you_think_is_your_biggest_lesson_learned/hqjpd07/

I don‚Äôt know the process so that‚Äôs probably a drastic oversimplification.	1640907485.0	hqm2s7t	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqklrxx	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqm2s7t/
4q0arfgk	This is true, but many trans women are shorter than many cis women. If height is the real issue, then why are we talking about gender at all? Not to mention that hormone levels in trans women are tightly controlled, which is not the case for cis women. This means that many cis athletes actually have *higher* testosterone levels than their trans counterparts. As it stands, the current regulations are working, and rather than seeing trans women dominate (as some would have you believe), we actually see trans women winning less often than their cis counterparts, even when adjusted for population size.  In the end, this is an issue that has been basically solved already, and is mostly just being used as a culture war issue to win seats for politicians.  One more side note: "a transgender" is not really the preferred wording. It comes across a little dehumanizing, like saying "a black" to refer to a black person. Transgender is an adjective, so it doesn't really work as a noun like that. I am not "a transgender", I am a transgender woman (or a trans woman, or even just a woman).	1640908522.0	hqm5b21	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqm42tw	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqm5b21/

7go21	Well, I would certainly agree with you that the real problem is ***NOT*** trans women (or trans *people* for that matter). Side note: that's a great point for me to emphasize in future discussions, so thank you for that!   But rather, I think the root problem‚Äîin this discussion anyways‚Äîis, "laws that erode the category of 'female'". In my view that's the problem that needs to be solved.  And I think it will never get solved if liberal / progressive-minded groups continue their approach of censoring, bullying, and / or threatening anyone who disagrees with them. We as a society need to be able to communicate openly with one another and try to resolve our differences. There is no "us" or "them", except in our minds. We're all human, and we're all in this together. Every single person is right about some things, and wrong about other things. And we can help each other, to fill in the gaps where we fall short, and to help everyone be a better version of themselves!   /soapbox üòÖ	1640937393.0	hqnq0l8	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqnne06	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqnq0l8/

jqwi6ff	What I've been reading/hearing about recently is that the whole "conversation therapy" name is really abused here. Of course it sounds horrible because we associate it with therapy that tried to force gay people into not being gay etc. But apparently the issue here is that this ban extends to the idea that a therapist would question or simply not automatically accept or agree with a kid who claims they're trans. So for example if a little girl comes out as trans after 4 other girlfriends in school did the same (apparently this is a thing) and her reasoning is that she has "masculine" interests or some nonsense, a therapist can't talk to her through that and about that, ask questions, etc before assigning her to hormone blockers or treatments, let alone reach the conclusion that the issue is something else and work with her on it. Therapists are apparently supposed to non questioningly validate the opinion of their patient	1640938139.0	hqnr0pb	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqm2s7t	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqnr0pb/

5b8ytx7b	Im very left wing, but i think some of the pronoun stuff is a bit ridiculous. Fair enough calling someone whos transgendered by their preferred gender pronouns, but it doesnt need to be such a prominent subject that you have to ask everyone their pronouns when you first meet them, or that its on every form you have to fill in, and if you arent transgender, and even if youre gender neutral, you should understand that when other people have to refer to you when talking to others, they are just going to use whatever seems obvious. The amount of over labelling is just stupid. Pronouns are just words that have no power over you other than what you give to them	1640967387.0	hqp1net	t3_rs6sap	t3_rs6sap	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqp1net/

1bj7qixs	The point is that gender and sex meaning different things is not an objective fact. It is a definition created by a small group of sexologists that has gained *some* support and common use, but I would be willing to bet that the majority of English speakers (going beyond the Reddit/Twitter bubble) think of gender and sex as being the same thing. So linguistically, your definition certainly can count as an alternative definition, but the word has certainly not undergone a full shift in definition.  And there was no "discovery" that gender and sex are different things. A few sexologists just up and decided that from now on gender meant gender identity, and sex meant biological sex. And that's the thing, we already had a perfectly good term: gender identity. Why do we need to change the meaning of the word gender?	1640968569.0	hqp4hzr	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqo82ip	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqp4hzr/

iu59ikol	Hahaha funny i got jokes too tell me what you think   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Jennifer, a 19 year old  college student  walks home by herself from a sorority party in the City. She takes a shortcut through a dark alley as she's cold and wearing just a short skirt and low cut shirt exposing her supple breasts. It's a foggy night making it hard to see the street to turn on. She passes a homeless man passed out with a bottle of malt liquor next to him. The smell of piss as shitty blue  jeans fills the air. Then she notices  a group of  Black men in the distance walking her way. She stops and her  heart rate increases as a sense of terror comes over her. She fears the worst‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Covid. And not the Alpha variant but the Delta which is much more contagious. She remembers reading a report earlier that day that the Blacks have vaccine hesitancy and chances are they most likely haven't had the jab.   As they get closer she notices they‚Äôre all wearing masks... She's  immediately relieved and thinks to herself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

hiyjrpyp	I think that the rising tensions with Western Europe are a result of the increasingly aggressive actions of the West. The Europeans have been trying to encroach on Russia's sphere of influence, and Russia has been pushing back. I don't see this as a bad thing, as it is natural for countries to compete for influence. However, I hope that the Russians can be successful in pushing back the West without resorting to violence.	1642763790.0	htl2uki	t3_s98ahs	t3_s98ahs	/r/AskReddit/comments/s98ahs/russians_of_reddit_how_do_you_view_the_rising/htl2uki/

e864nfc1	It‚Äôs common for children to throw tantrums and not want to sleep. There can be different reasons why she doesn't want to sleep. Try talking to her and find out why she doesn't want to sleep. You can also start keeping a bedtime routine for her. Do not do any activities a few hours before bedtime that will require her to think a lot, and change to PJs a few minutes before bedtime so she will know it's almost time for her to sleep. Also, no screentime at least 1 hour before bedtime. You can also have brush your teeth together, read a book from bed. Make sure you don't do many activities in the bedroom especially on the bed. Make her know that the bed is for her to sleep.

fik7kok1	You didn‚Äôt add a serious tag and are commenting some tasteless and not funny ‚Äújokes‚Äù  I‚Äôll add mine, even though OP is kind of a dumb douche.    Saw a live cat full of moving maggots.  Went to euthanize said suffering cat, and the cat simultaneously dies and erupts with maggots flying across the room.  Bursting with maggots.  Smell was actually not as bad as you‚Äôd imagine.  I tried to give the cat a comfortable end, but she was brought into us too late, as she was obviously so close to death.  Of course she came from a hoarders home who was so mentally ill they didn‚Äôt realize there was a problem until their cats skin was seemingly vibrating due to all the maggots under the surface.   Second most disturbing thing I encountered was cleaning cat feces from a recent seizure of 20 cats.  A man had died in his hoarder home and not been found for three weeks.  He had 20 cats.. so nature is going to happen and the cats eat most of his remains. I talked to some of the officers that said they‚Äôd cleaned his face and hand meat off because those were the most exposed.  As I cleaned their poop, I noticed it was very healthy and they had JUST come in, hadn‚Äôt received any food from anyone else.  It‚Äôs possible they were eating rodents as well, but I believe I was mostly picking up little turds made of that man who passed away.  I tried to be more respectful of it but ultimately the cat shit has to go in the dumpster does it not.	1643183802.0	hu9pc9v	t3_scz4ug	t3_scz4ug	/r/AskReddit/comments/scz4ug/whats_the_goriestmost_brutal_thing_youve_seen_irl/hu9pc9v/

jwilf	Yeah it's something I care about. I highly doubt I'd die with this issue, but it's something I can never change my mind about.   My views are that that person you speak of has mental issues, and I don't agree with their solution. But they're free to do that if they want I guess. But I will never, ever, can never, ever, see that person as anything but a man. That isn't my fault. So if I ever speak of that person as a man, refer to him as a him, people get mad at me. That's just not cool.  Why do I care if it makes them happy.. well there ARE reasons why I am totally against this practice, BUT for the sake of discussion, let's say that I don't care and they are free to do whatever they want to make themselves happy. That's fine right? But then if I dare to say no, they're still a man, or refer to him as a him, people get mad at ME. They're free to pretend, but don't make me pretend with him.	1643189243.0	hu9w5ht	t3_sd1r5r	t1_hu9vv3f	/r/AskReddit/comments/sd1r5r/why_cant_society_peacefully_accept_that_a_big/hu9w5ht/

fvp6p8hz	Because it's the people most vocal about this belief that then spurn someone to go and attack someone for simply just being trans. Because no matter how much they try to spin it, a large portion of the time it's never just "I don't believe that. Good day." It's them using that belief as a reasoning for why Trans people should be attacked, ostracized, belittled, etc.   Because they'll say it's an excuse for people to peep on kids in the bathroom to cause a moral panic, we must think of the children, intrinsically implying that a majority of the Trans community are pedophiles or some other form of monster instead of someone just trying to live their life.   Because it's not people "peacefully" just believing it a lot of the time. Hate begets hate. It's an incitement of violence against trans people, and if you're someone who holds this belief then you're in the very least complicit in that very cycle. Why's it so hard to accept that someone can be born in the wrong body, considering how many other problems one can have at birth? Why is it so important to die on this hill when it's you arguing about a feeling you could only ever experience yourself by transitioning to a gender you are not?      It's because trans lives matter; and there's no reason people should be afforded courtesy, much less civility. Their entire point is not backed by the science, known history, or any reputable source other than trans people making them uncomfortable.	1643189341.0	hu9w9or	t3_sd1r5r	t3_sd1r5r	/r/AskReddit/comments/sd1r5r/why_cant_society_peacefully_accept_that_a_big/hu9w9or/

You get so mad at random strangers on the internet...it's so funny to watch you guys. And you're all the same. It's almost like one person has thousands of Reddit accounts and they pop in and out of the subs all day posting the same lame crap everywhere. I suspect this is the result of our poor school systems, leftist professors in college, and the news media.
