iu59ikol	Hahaha funny i got jokes too tell me what you think   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Jennifer, a 19 year old  college student  walks home by herself from a sorority party in the City. She takes a shortcut through a dark alley as she's cold and wearing just a short skirt and low cut shirt exposing her supple breasts. It's a foggy night making it hard to see the street to turn on. She passes a homeless man passed out with a bottle of malt liquor next to him. The smell of piss as shitty blue  jeans fills the air. Then she notices  a group of  Black men in the distance walking her way. She stops and her  heart rate increases as a sense of terror comes over her. She fears the worst……….. Covid. And not the Alpha variant but the Delta which is much more contagious. She remembers reading a report earlier that day that the Blacks have vaccine hesitancy and chances are they most likely haven't had the jab.   As they get closer she notices they’re all wearing masks... She's  immediately relieved and thinks to herself……. That was a close one	1642702871.0	hthn9cj	t3_s8nj9t	t1_hthmxpc	/r/AskReddit/comments/s8nj9t/people_who_give_the_homeless_money_why_do_you_do/hthn9cj/

e864nfc1	It’s common for children to throw tantrums and not want to sleep. There can be different reasons why she doesn't want to sleep. Try talking to her and find out why she doesn't want to sleep. You can also start keeping a bedtime routine for her. Do not do any activities a few hours before bedtime that will require her to think a lot, and change to PJs a few minutes before bedtime so she will know it's almost time for her to sleep. Also, no screentime at least 1 hour before bedtime. You can also have brush your teeth together, read a book from bed. Make sure you don't do many activities in the bedroom especially on the bed. Make her know that the bed is for her to sleep.

fik7kok1	You didn’t add a serious tag and are commenting some tasteless and not funny “jokes”  I’ll add mine, even though OP is kind of a dumb douche.    Saw a live cat full of moving maggots.  Went to euthanize said suffering cat, and the cat simultaneously dies and erupts with maggots flying across the room.  Bursting with maggots.  Smell was actually not as bad as you’d imagine.  I tried to give the cat a comfortable end, but she was brought into us too late, as she was obviously so close to death.  Of course she came from a hoarders home who was so mentally ill they didn’t realize there was a problem until their cats skin was seemingly vibrating due to all the maggots under the surface.   Second most disturbing thing I encountered was cleaning cat feces from a recent seizure of 20 cats.  A man had died in his hoarder home and not been found for three weeks.  He had 20 cats.. so nature is going to happen and the cats eat most of his remains. I talked to some of the officers that said they’d cleaned his face and hand meat off because those were the most exposed.  As I cleaned their poop, I noticed it was very healthy and they had JUST come in, hadn’t received any food from anyone else.  It’s possible they were eating rodents as well, but I believe I was mostly picking up little turds made of that man who passed away.  I tried to be more respectful of it but ultimately the cat shit has to go in the dumpster does it not.	1643183802.0	hu9pc9v	t3_scz4ug	t3_scz4ug	/r/AskReddit/comments/scz4ug/whats_the_goriestmost_brutal_thing_youve_seen_irl/hu9pc9v/

jwilf	Yeah it's something I care about. I highly doubt I'd die with this issue, but it's something I can never change my mind about.   My views are that that person you speak of has mental issues, and I don't agree with their solution. But they're free to do that if they want I guess. But I will never, ever, can never, ever, see that person as anything but a man. That isn't my fault. So if I ever speak of that person as a man, refer to him as a him, people get mad at me. That's just not cool.  Why do I care if it makes them happy.. well there ARE reasons why I am totally against this practice, BUT for the sake of discussion, let's say that I don't care and they are free to do whatever they want to make themselves happy. That's fine right? But then if I dare to say no, they're still a man, or refer to him as a him, people get mad at ME. They're free to pretend, but don't make me pretend with him.	1643189243.0	hu9w5ht	t3_sd1r5r	t1_hu9vv3f	/r/AskReddit/comments/sd1r5r/why_cant_society_peacefully_accept_that_a_big/hu9w5ht/

fvp6p8hz	Because it's the people most vocal about this belief that then spurn someone to go and attack someone for simply just being trans. Because no matter how much they try to spin it, a large portion of the time it's never just "I don't believe that. Good day." It's them using that belief as a reasoning for why Trans people should be attacked, ostracized, belittled, etc.   Because they'll say it's an excuse for people to peep on kids in the bathroom to cause a moral panic, we must think of the children, intrinsically implying that a majority of the Trans community are pedophiles or some other form of monster instead of someone just trying to live their life.   Because it's not people "peacefully" just believing it a lot of the time. Hate begets hate. It's an incitement of violence against trans people, and if you're someone who holds this belief then you're in the very least complicit in that very cycle. Why's it so hard to accept that someone can be born in the wrong body, considering how many other problems one can have at birth? Why is it so important to die on this hill when it's you arguing about a feeling you could only ever experience yourself by transitioning to a gender you are not?      It's because trans lives matter; and there's no reason people should be afforded courtesy, much less civility. Their entire point is not backed by the science, known history, or any reputable source other than trans people making them uncomfortable.	1643189341.0	hu9w9or	t3_sd1r5r	t3_sd1r5r	/r/AskReddit/comments/sd1r5r/why_cant_society_peacefully_accept_that_a_big/hu9w9or/

You get so mad at random strangers on the internet...it's so funny to watch you guys. And you're all the same. It's almost like one person has thousands of Reddit accounts and they pop in and out of the subs all day posting the same lame crap everywhere.

8o12eevo	I appreciate your detailed response, but I also find a lot of flaws in your arguments.  First, just because we cannot conceptualize the next economic system doesn't mean it's preposterous. You think ***slavery*** was correct because they couldn't think of a different economic arrangement? I'm asking this honestly.  "You can not criticise capitalism for something that isn't allowed in capitalism."  The problem is, it *is* allowed in capitalism. I don't understand why you don't understand this. Are you abiding by some weird archaic law where capitalism is defined as an ethical system or something?  Because that's not what it is.   If it helps to invoke the history of capitalism in the U.S.: FDR introduced the New Deal in order to ["save capitalism"](https://www.hoover.org/research/how-fdr-saved-capitalism) because Wallstreet speculation had wrecked the country and plunged it into a depression (much like in 2008). FDR introduced social programs to help people in light of [capitalism's fundamental instability.](https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/Tymoigne_1.pdf) It worked, because in FDR's time, tax rates were [94% of income for those who made over the equivalent of $2.8 million/ year.](https://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/student/whys_thm02_les05.jsp). Currently, the [true tax rate is about 3-4%.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2021/06/09/the-ultra-richs-punitive-tax-contribution-in-perspective-infographic/?sh=36fb0f4e3863)       >Capitalist systems have the best quality of life in the world.   This is just propaganda. Wtf do you have as evidence to support this? How do you define quality of life? I'm not saying other systems are automatically better, but for the love of God, please seek out sources other than Fox News. I can tell you're smart, and this is beneath you. There are cogent arguments that [being a worker today demands more work than a medieval serf.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001F0PYH8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) And [less political autonomy.](https://www.harvard.com/book/capitalism_vs_freedom_the_toll_road_to_serfdom/)     >No one criticises Scandinavian countries for being capitalist. They have very good implementations of the system.  You're right, and that's because there's heavy regulation — some of the heaviest in the world. I'm a U.S-born citizen, but I'm not a U.S. resident, and I've lived in a Scandinavian country for many years. They pay a lot in taxes, but no one complains, because most people there approve of the system. But, to be fair, they have far more regulation and far more worker co-ops. Capitalism is the dominant system, but it's taxed in a way that's equivalent to FDR's New Deal. In fact, I think it would fair better (and I think most people I know would agree) if capitalism were transformed into a profit incentive for worker co-ops, but the point is — when corporations don't have unlimited reach, the country as a whole fairs better. But capitalism's logic *is* unlimited reach. That's the problem.  Do you think capitalism and democracy can regulate each other? Because I have news for you.... it's not the case. Capitalist enterprises have been encroaching more and more on your beloved, regulated "Scandinavian"-style systems for awhile now. Regulatory capture is becoming more and more the case.  But I guess this is human nature? If you wanna take a stand, take one or the other: human nature sucks, and it's man-eat-mean. Or human nature doesn't quite suck, and thus can be regulated (kind of)? If it's the latter, then that's a start....	1643840829.0	hvc72dm	t3_shlb3p	t1_hvawrz2	/r/AskReddit/comments/shlb3p/who_can_just_go_fuck_themselves/hvc72dm/

j7uo922	No, I'm not bending it at all. While in most cases chromosomes, hormones, and genitalia will all fall in the expected alignments, there are numerous conditions and outside cases where that is not so. Sex chromosomes that fall outside XX/XY,bor hormone deficiencies that lead to the development of unexpected genitalia, for example. Did you know that if somebody with an XY chromosome is completely insensitive to androgens they'll develop female external genitalia and have a completely female hormone profile? You have a grade schooler's understanding of the biology of sex, and yet you seem to think you're more knowledgeable than experts who have dedicated their lives to studying these topics. You are willfully and unforgivably stupid. Trans people are here to stay, and no matter how much you bitch and moan about "much biology" that will not change.

1eynvehv	I have autoimmune diseases. Which is why I got vaccinated. I paid attention and understand that even with the vaccine I can still get covid but supposedly not as bad.   You show how uneducated you are on the topic when you try making unvaccinated people look like the bad guys.   Not getting the vaccine is nothing but a personal risk. Period.   Vaccinated people have a higher probability of getting AND giving covid than the unvaccinated because they’re less likely to actually know they have covid, or in your case, they think they can’t get covid.	1644081344.0	hvpwd8y	t3_skzwrs	t1_hvolb23	/r/AskReddit/comments/skzwrs/what_is_one_socially_unacceptable_fact_about/hvpwd8y/

jd92zd10	I disagree. Men do like natural women as far as being in a long-term relationship. But when a woman looks all done up and Shes single it signals to us that Shes on the prowl and more interested in sex that a woman who isn't. It's like saying Men want women a cute girl to walk around half naked and have sex with them on the first date knowing that we are the third dude that week. This might be true, but we would never want that type of girl as a girlfriend or to be the mother of our child.  Men will put women in two categories, the fun zone and the relationship zone. Don't confuse the two. Fake lips are a check mark in the fun zone that's for sure. And yes men will date women in the fun zone but we sure won't marry them.  All is fun and games til you're a women in her 30's.	1644166083.0	hvtv187	t3_sm0isl	t1_hvtu1gi	/r/AskReddit/comments/sm0isl/what_do_yall_think_about_fake_lips_if_youre_a/hvtv187/

e9cxhoyp	When we say “trans women are women” and take away women’s right to self-define and have their own [rape shelters](https://globalnews.ca/news/5824446/vancouver-rape-relief-womens-shelter-graffiti/amp/), and their own sex-segregated spaces and athletic competitions, women are harmed. Their sex is being appropriated, not just their gender. We’re not just talking about men who simply want to be “feminine” (gender). We’re talking about men who want to force our entire society into accepting that they are **literally** equivalent to females in just about every way, shape and form. That’s a serious social problem.	1644192399.0	hvvnkl3	t3_slyug6	t1_hvvmuut	/r/AskReddit/comments/slyug6/whats_a_belief_that_you_hold_with_which_many/hvvnkl3/
e9cxhoyp	>gender is subjective   “Male” isn’t a gender. As a male, you can have your own ideas about *masculinity.* Sex, on the other hand, is just as objective as race.  Are you saying that transgender women don’t view themselves as female (sex); they only view themselves as ‘feminine’ (gender)?   The mantra isn’t “trans women are feminine.” If it was, I wouldn’t have a problem with it.	1644193326.0	hvvpmn2	t3_slyug6	t1_hvvobdb	/r/AskReddit/comments/slyug6/whats_a_belief_that_you_hold_with_which_many/hvvpmn2/

e9cxhoyp	No, I didn’t give you a definition of a “real” penis. I just said told you what a real penis **isn’t**: It isn’t made out of forearm-skin.   If I said “a shopping cart isn’t a truck,” that’s not a definition of “shopping cart” or “truck.”  You’re the one who just asserted that there’s no scientific way to differentiate “real” from “fake” body parts. If that’s what you believe, then you can’t claim that surgeons can construct a “real” penis out of forearm skin.    So, my argument is not that “because you don’t accept my definition, you can’t say whether it’s correct.”   My argument is: Because you don’t think it’s possible to come up with an objective, scientific way to distinguish ‘real’ from ‘fake’ body parts, you cannot claim that surgeons can *really* transform a penis into a vagina. Or at least you have to admit that you’re making an unscientific statement when you claim that doctors can *really* change a person’s sex.	1644196086.0	hvvvqfi	t3_slyug6	t1_hvvuxxf	/r/AskReddit/comments/slyug6/whats_a_belief_that_you_hold_with_which_many/hvvvqfi/

Sure, he dances around semantics because they changed the definition of gain of function  a couple years ago, but for all intents and purposes, that is what Fauci was funding. He and the people he was funding unintentionally created this pandemic. But he nor anyone else will ever be held to account.  Only Fauci was such a darling of the left because he was so against Trump. And because he was against Trump, all the media had to have a huge undulating boner for him. So they will never go after him.  So, I'm not sure what's more evil. The creation of the pandemic, or the free pass he is getting.	1644242820.0	hvy1yzi	t3_smqysw	t3_smqysw	/r/AskReddit/comments/smqysw/what_examples_of_pure_evil_have_you_personally/hvy1yzi/

There's a YT movie about such a thing happening. It has that guy who played the father on The Waltons, with him suddenly appearing before Jackie Kennedy to start with. A favorite, what if movie of mine.	1644246921.0	hvyb9lg	t3_smqcht	t3_smqcht	/r/AskReddit/comments/smqcht/if_you_could_travel_back_in_time_in_your_personal/hvyb9lg/

alijn4bb	True, I've tried to watch it with my mum and girlfriend and none of them understand the overall plot... It reminded my girlfriend of "fantastic Mr fox" and my mum lost interest after the "fucking faggot" scene.   I do love the film, it's cinematography, the way it's almost all visual, the fact that it is just one of them films where, like you say, you have to watch it in order to fully understand the context.   Ralf Finnes, and the guy the plays Zero (I forget his name) are both brilliant. Specially Finnes as before that I'd only seen him play Voldemort, so seeing him in a comedy role was a massive difference.	1645033278.0	hx764gd	t3_sti2c0	t1_hx754ye	/r/AskReddit/comments/sti2c0/whats_a_movie_you_love_that_you_swear_no_one_ever/hx764gd/
