3p62i1	It was probably on top because so, so many men died in the war. A whole lot of women died too, but women in frontlines was mostly in Battle of Stalingrad.     That resulted in Soviet Union having no other options anyway. I mean, we can imagine a thought experiment where the wars never happened - perhaps the graphs would look similar. But this is precisely what it would have looked like as it did happen, and it's likely it's a huge factor at play here.	1642713491.0	htiexqv	t3_s8s37u	t3_s8s37u	/r/socialism/comments/s8s37u/wonder_why_eastern_europe_was_on_top/htiexqv/

bxap9g57	First of all, China is not a "leading country," though it has came a long way since 1978, when 90%+ lived in absolute poverty. Though the living standards in China is far higher than countries with similar GDP per capita (Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, etc), it is still a developing country by many metrics.  Second of all, there is no magic light switch for Socialism. You can't just turn it on and say well, all foreign investment goes out the window, the State nationalizes all the foreign factories and whatnot (might be useless without the technicians who knows how to use them) no more diplomacy with capitalist countries, all private business shuts down immediately and is confiscated by the state, all home owners now live in a state owned property, etc.   The real world is complicated and messy, anyone who even ask such a question I would assume is someone who never worked a day of his life before.   I'm sure everyone has their "perfect vision" of what Socialism "ought" to look like, or how a perfect novel ought be, or how a perfect software ought to be. When you try building that utopian vision of yours, you realized, the world is really complicated, and you run into all sorts of contradictions.  It is like those who criticize China and Vietnam as not really socialist because they don't have universal healthcare and everyone living in pent houses in Shanghai 10 seconds after the revolution (like how many doctors that is trained in modern medicines are there in 1949 China??).  A revolution is not an event, it is a process, a struggle between the old world (China being dirt poor and dominated by foreign interests), and a socialist China (everyone lives moderately well, the contradictions of capitalism handled by the State dictatorship over the means of production, without looting from the Global South through imperialism).  If you are a Western (armchair) "socialist" who is more concerned about how China is not socialist, and you have far better policy suggestions for them on what the State should do, even better than the people who actually lives in China and understands the material contradictions of China far better than you do, then I'd suggest you get rid of your colonial mindset. Your criticisms will have 0 effect in China since the people who actually live there won't listen to you.   If you are so smart at knowing what socialism is, then build socialism in the West. Show the Chinese why they are wrong.	1642784900.0	htmcpy8	t3_s8r6ex	t3_s8r6ex	/r/socialism/comments/s8r6ex/why_hasnt_china_abandoned_there_mix_economy_yet/htmcpy8/
g22lrree	You don't.  The concept of arming the public is a flawed one and the second amendment of the US constitution should be read how it really is: to arm well-regulated militias, which is the only context in which your right as a person to be armed is valid.  If that isn't the case, then why have that opening statement about well-regulated militias?  It's like saying you have the right to expose your breast in public in a general sense when the real law states "Given the purpose of breastfeeding a young child, the right to bare a breast in public should not be infringed."  And if people want to continue to misread it, then the second amendment should be amended or repealed by another amendment.  Guns are too dangerous and people are too unhinged and unpredictable to allow general arming of the public.  I realize that there's some sort of "socialist ideal" that imagines a glorious armed public to ensure government cooperation, but let's face it -- against any government, you're going to fail because they can afford more and better arms than you.  It's a trick by governments to enable even more class warfare and social unrest so they can gain even more control over us.  Maybe at one point in our history when governments were not so well-organized and militant as they are now were weapons a tool for change but now?  Now they only serve to divide us, harm us, and allow governmental oppression.  Throw your weapons in the fire and win hearts and minds with the most powerful weapons of all: your words.  Someone with a gun isn't going to change the world, because a government with guns just waiting for retaliation is going to keep that society down.	1642786290.0	htmgii0	t3_s9c35u	t1_htm4gw1	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htmgii0/

2krb31d2	Note: I am not a Ukrainian, but I was born in the USSR and my grandmother as well as her family come from Crimea. They lost everything during the October Revolution and many members of my family were murdered by the Bolsheviks. They considered themselves Russian yet they liked the Ukrainian culture and language more. I used to see myself as a Russian because that is the culture and language I grew up with, yet I am so utterly disgusted by what Russia is doing that I do not consider myself Russian anymore. Fortunately, I do not live there anymore either.   Now about the Ukrainians and Russians:  The relations between Russia and Ukraine have never been good. In short, Russia stole Ukrainian history and has been mocking the Ukrainians as some kind of simple-minded "brotherly nation" for several centuries in a row. The reality is that Ukraine is pretty much the birthplace of Kievan Rus as Kyiv was its capital.   Over time, Kievan Rus collapsed and was divided between different entities whereas some parts, mainly Novgorod and Muscovy, managed to survive on their own despite paying a large tribute to the Mongols. After the Mongols were beaten back several centuries later, Muscovy conquered the Novgorod Republic and then kept adding more territories transforming itself into Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire. The Russians began to view themselves as the "Great Russians" while Ukrainians were referred to as "Little Russians". The modern explanation is that this simply refers to the difference in size and population, yet I doubt you want to be referred to as "little + your people's name" by another nation. Because of the imperial past, many Russians are still very chauvinistic which you can easily understand if you speak the language.   In the Russian Empire the use of Ukrainian was forbidden. In the USSR it was discouraged and active Russification of Ukrainians (as well as all peoples of the USSR) took place. The Ukrainians were never truly fond of the Russians during the Soviet times but the gradual Russification and replacement of the ethnic groups by the Russians did make it seem that the relations were good.   After the collapse of the USSR, all the former Soviet republics had this brief moment of euphoria when they thought they would start living better because life in the USSR was absolute shit. People were extremely poor, yet the Soviet elite lived far better. In reality, the October Revolution changed nothing: they just replaced the Tsar with the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and the nobility with various top decision-making members of the Communist Party.   People were fed up, but nobody really knew how to transform their economy to become more productive and competitive in the global market. Remember, we did not participate in the global economy for decades and prior to that the Russian Empire was a backward agrarian state run by monarchs with absolute power. Just like most other post-Soviet republics, Ukraine was suffering from endemic corruption, poverty, inefficiency in virtually every sector of the economy, but this made it easier for the ultra rich business people and corrupt officials to maintain control and enrich themselves even more. Since all of them were still economically tied to Moscow due to the way the Soviet economy was built, they kept doing what Moscow told them to do.   In the early 2000s people got fed up with this situation and they demanded changes. This is why the Orange Revolution happened. The same things happened in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and to a lesser extent in Armenia. The Russians, however, felt betrayed, and who is easier to blame than the US and EU? Yes, the US was involved because it was the only unchallenged superpower left - can you imagine it ever staying away from such an  opportunity? But it played a rather minor role of advising and trying to limit the chaos, it did not start the revolution. The people themselves were fed up with the old ways of living.   Unfortunately, there is no quick and painless way to transform your poor country into a developed one when it had been an integral part of an autocratic regime for centuries. So they failed and this led to Maidan in 2014 with all the mess that we see today. Russia is paranoid about losing control over its former republics because Putin fears the same events happening in Russia itself. NATO, US, EU - these are all boogeymen created by the paranoid minds of the Soviets and kept alive by Putin and his team of kleptocrats.   The events in Kazakhstan are just the continuation of the story. People want changes while Russia and its puppet governments in the former Soviet republics want to maintain a firm grip and continue stealing. The West and especially the US have actually been very disengaged from the whole process. Maybe it is for the best but right now Ukraine does need help as they do not want to be with Russia and there is no chance they will forget what the Russians did there.	1642794686.0	htn3cjj	t3_s9hcwj	t3_s9hcwj	/r/socialism/comments/s9hcwj/opinions_on_ukraine_and_russia_conflict/htn3cjj/

30qo4h8a	That's really the easiest-to-answer question you could have asked. Depending on what exact conceptualization of socialism you adopt:  (1) Social Democracy -- Tax the rich.  (2) Democratic Socialism -- Tax the rich, tax the co-ops, surplus from state owned enterprises.  (3) Marxist-Leninists -- Tax the rich (if, for whatever reason, they're allowed to continue existing), tax the co-ops (insofar as privately-run institutions are allowed to exist), surplus from state-run industry/enterprises.  (4) Anarcho-Communism -- Money is an outdated concept, we already have the industrial capacity for communism to exist.  ***The question you should be asking yourself, is "how does Jeffery Bezos pay for 30 second rocket-rides to space?"***	1642909675.0	htu33hn	t3_sa5z39	t1_httl3o6	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/htu33hn/

8wbiq4hb	Quick question, just want to tackle one thing you've said. You say, "Israel has completely ignored the two state solution," but you honestly think the Palestinians held up their end? They literally denied a two-state solution ever since 1948 and have made it abundantly clear that Gaza, Judea, and Samaria are not enough for them by perpetuating terrorist attacks. Also, where is the public outcry that it's illegal for Jews to live in Gaza, Judea, or Samaria? There are no laws prohibiting Muslims or any ethnic minority from living in Israel.	1645028334.0	hx6szn2	t3_stsf8c	t1_hx677e4	/r/socialism/comments/stsf8c/white_nationalist_israeli_pepper_sprays_old/hx6szn2/

I find it kind of funny Israelis are called "Occupation Forces" when you fail to, and quite frankly everyone else does too, that the land was occupied by Jordanian forces between 1948 and 1967. Israel won the land in the Six-Day War and have given allocations towards a new Palestinian state, including Gaza.

I’ve also adopted a bit of doomer thought as well. I’m aware that socialism is the transition to communism, and that’s why I’ve adopted it. It leads to the ideology that I truly believe in. I’m starting from scratch and taking it one step at a time. I’m also starting a new sub for communists where communists of all forms of thought will be welcome to share their opinions without fear of being silenced. After all, we are all red, so why not unite? There’s nothing stopping us! The red flag of liberty shall prevail!	1645060663.0	hx916c2	t3_sub1vn	t1_hx8zwbj	/r/socialism/comments/sub1vn/hello_i_am_a_refugee_from_another_sub/hx916c2/
fg2p9cyc	I strive to make the world a better place where people can coexist. All I want is a government that actually cares about its people. People across the United States are literally starving because the capitalist regime is bleeding them dry. People in my neighborhood are starving. The government hides it, taking down as much information about it as they can. Our government is actively committing human rights violations, and possibly genocide. I want to be free from the chains of tyranny within my lifetime, and I’d like to see the same for people of all creeds and colors. That is all.	1645061003.0	hx91xev	t3_sub1vn	t1_hx90lec	/r/socialism/comments/sub1vn/hello_i_am_a_refugee_from_another_sub/hx91xev/
fg2p9cyc	I’m not a liberal or a centrist. I despise both, especially centrists, but liberals too. I am critical of Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un, so that may be why I got banned. Which is really mind boggling because any communist who actually fully or even loosely follows the doctrine of Marxism would absolutely be against Uyghur genocide. Genociding or forcefully re-educating a group of people will only push them farther from communism. Leaving them be may allow them to willingly adopt communism without any violence and misery.	1645061431.0	hx92vul	t3_sub1vn	t1_hx90s92	/r/socialism/comments/sub1vn/hello_i_am_a_refugee_from_another_sub/hx92vul/
fg2p9cyc	The evil actions like the holodomor or the Uyghur genocide in China. Those are the big ones. Aaaand then there’s Pol Pot… that’s a whole different can of worms. And yes, I could have worded that a little better. What I meant was “I’ve adopted socialism as the part of the ideology that I proudly support”. Autocorrect keeps removing words from the things I type and if I don’t catch it before I post, it tends to make me sound like a caveman. It’s really annoying and I can’t fix it, and trust me, I’ve tried. Also, I find Nazbols to be a paradox because nationalism directly contradicts communism. I am against right wing views in general, with one exception: the stance on gun control. No guns; No revolution!	1645062513.0	hx95app	t3_sub1vn	t1_hx92t3k	/r/socialism/comments/sub1vn/hello_i_am_a_refugee_from_another_sub/hx95app/
fg2p9cyc	China still did terrible things to its own people in Tiananmen Square and Hong Kong, so I still don’t support them. They also engage in state sponsored capitalism. North Korea is ultranationalist, which contradicts genuine Marxism. I’m also not entirely as hateful towards ol’ Kim as North Korea has been doing better in recent years, at least according to some news sources. Then again, North Korea is called “The Hermit Kingdom”, so it’s hard to tell what is actually going on there without being there to experience it for myself.	1645063140.0	hx96p7g	t3_sub1vn	t1_hx94jdb	/r/socialism/comments/sub1vn/hello_i_am_a_refugee_from_another_sub/hx96p7g/
fg2p9cyc	I’m not anti-communist. I’m anti-tyrant and anti-genocide, as well as anti-capitalist. Also, I chose racist because that’s the closest thing I can compare it to.

fg2p9cyc	I like the regimes in Cuba and Vietnam. Miguel Díaz-Canel is pretty cool, I guess. Che Guevara as well. Fidel Castro was a bit of a tyrant, but not as bad as others.

fg2p9cyc	Fidel did some things that aren’t necessarily good, but other than that he was actually decent. I was saying Fidel Castro did some not so great things, but other leaders did things that were worlds worse. Yes, I’m aware of China’s influence on Cuba and Vietnam. I like Vietnam because there are a lot of aspects of Ho Chi Minh thought that I agree with, and there are some I don’t agree with. My conclusions are based on all aspects of a leader’s life, including their views on race and freedom of expression. Those who push too hard into the private lives of their citizens I consider tyrants. A little bit of surveillance is okay, but monitoring innocent people 24/7 is not okay. People’s bedrooms should be considered part of their personal property, because it is. I’d also like to add that the personalities of leaders is extremely inconsistent, which is part of the reason my conclusions are inconsistent. Also, Pol Pot was a Marxist-Leninist and a Khmer nationalist. He was not a pure Marxist, but he was still a Marxist.	1645067923.0	hx9h74l	t3_sub1vn	t1_hx9f7ai	/r/socialism/comments/sub1vn/hello_i_am_a_refugee_from_another_sub/hx9h74l/

Maybe, they used to be part of Russia, but I wouldn't trust a referendum done by the Russian government. Either way this is something he's done before. I don't think he had any intention to invade (who knows now) but he did everything he could to make it *look* like he was going to invade so he could get concessions.

Putin has, in his speeches and state TV propaganda, tried to (and succeeded) foster a nostalgia for the USSR and Russian Kingdom. Like fascists or MAGA, he tries to mobilize support by giving people this idea of "making Russia great again". And the way he wants to do that is to expand back to borders of the past.

They didn't like Russian meddling in their politics but joining these massive power blocks could also be a loss of independence in a sense.   Then Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatists in Donbass. The question was effectively answered -- they want to keep Russia from shitting in their yard.   Russia has been nothing short of a drunken shitty neighbor to Ukraine every step of the way.

84su4mrz	In addition he is actually going by the Nazi playbook- protecting so called "oppressed ethnic minorities" in other countries as a pretext for incorporating then into his own country. He claims Russians are being oppressed in Ukraine and so he needs to save them- by annexing the place of course and eventually bringing it into the Russian federation. The name of the game is 1. State propaganda supporting "going back to a greater past" 2. Censorship and repression of dissidence within his own country 3. Pretexts to invade surrounding countries 4. Create an empire and become a superpower. It's literally fascist.	1645170309.0	hxf64ht	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf5f0y	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf64ht/
84su4mrz	Yes there is, instead of annexing, Putin could have tried to have talks with Ukraine about Crimea. But it simply wasn't about that. Before Euromaidan he had more control of the Ukrainian government. After the Ukrainians overthrew their government he invaded and stoked and funded separatist groups in order to gain some of that lost power back.	1645170450.0	hxf6b06	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf5vh7	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf6b06/

84su4mrz	I just get very passionate about this subject because I'm a NEET and all of my friends are online and mostly in Russia and ukraine because I wanted to learn the Russian language.

I have never met anyone in Russia who supports Putin or his ideals but Russian intelligence could easily have you fooled if you just see what's put online without talking to real people or going to Russian image boards and things. They are incredibly good at information warfare and engage people to spread propaganda through social media, something they also did to support Trump and continue to do in America.

84su4mrz	I don't think that Ukraine has no problems but I don't think they're in the wrong in this situation. For instance, Azov Battalion or Svoboda. Svoboda is an alt right/neo Nazi political party, there's no denying that. But at the same time Russia has similar people and groups, so do many countries. Azov Battalion is extremely concerning but I've also read that even though it started as a Neo-Nazi paramilitary, once it was conscripted it began to change. I still think it's highly concerning though and if they're really going to change it they need to change the insignia first and foremost. I don't think Ukraine is any more or less fascist than the United States. I don't know what ceremony you're talking about though, what was it? Unfortunately Ukraine also made communist parties illegal, which I think is wrong, but considering their past with Stalin and the fact that the communist party was connected to the separatists I also understand it. All of these things are wrong but they also don't change the nature of their conflict with Russia.	1645171353.0	hxf7hjo	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf71ez	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf7hjo/
84su4mrz	Yes, the people of Crimea could have possibly joined Russia if Putin was able to make some sort of deal with Ukraine instead of just invading. The Minsk agreements were in relation to him stopping what he had already started.

84su4mrz	It, in fact, was. Only the regions with large Russian demographics were upset by this. The only areas with separatist are places with ethnic Russian majorities. The president they overthrew was very much in agreement with Putin's policies, the ethnic Ukrainian part of Ukraine (most of it) has had no problems with this because the majority of the people in Ukraine supported it	1645171758.0	hxf80hg	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf7pds	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf80hg/
84su4mrz	I think Russia is just as imperialist and they want to expand. Ukraine wants defense from Russia because Russia, and Putin in particular, have a history of doing exactly what he's doing right now. I'm sure he doesn't like NATO but I also don't think he'd even be in this situation if he wasn't already engaging in imperialism. Communist countries like Cuba have a much more legitimate reason to be afraid of NATO. NATO is mostly focused on protecting capitalism and taking down communism.	1645172152.0	hxf8iji	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf82r5	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf8iji/
84su4mrz	Yes and I have a problem with the Azov battalion but that doesn't make Ukraine fascist. Azov battalion has since become less neo-Nazi but the ukrainian government needs to focus on rooting out all of it with the battalion, and I think that starts with changing the insignia.	1645172239.0	hxf8meq	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf8dqk	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf8meq/

84su4mrz	The government isn't neo nazi by any means. People supported Azov Battalion because they were attacking separatists. The Azov Battalion clearly needs to change and even though it has become less neo Nazi since being integrated, they need to focus on it a lot more. However, I personally believe that their employing azov battalion was more a move if opportunity or necessity, it doesn't mean the ukrainian government is Nazi	1645172379.0	hxf8ss7	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf8mfo	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf8ss7/

a5n12	You just argued for a reason the Russians are the bad guys here.  You're right, Ukraine can't join nato while in conflict. The whole Russian argument is that they'll be "forced" to invade unless the US promises no one else will join nato, the fantasy being that the US is going to have Ukraine join NATO then Ukraine will invoke article 5 and start WW3. Which is patently ridiculous for reasons you literally just pointed out.  Ukraine didn't even really want to join Nato until Russia violated the Minsk accords in 2014. Ukraine wants to join NATO now because it's rightfully concerned about its sovereignty. If we annexed part of Mexico unilaterally you bet your ass Mexico would be looking for allies to protect them from future invasion.	1645172732.0	hxf98fs	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxexvmv	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf98fs/

a5n12	So Russia is imperialist, violates treaties it has with Ukraine and causes Ukraine to seek out allies in NATO. NATO says no because of the delicate situation Ukraine is in involving Crimea and Donbass. Russia freksd out and threatens to invade Ukraine unless the US basically promises never to invite another European nation into a defensive treaty. US predictably says no as Russia absolutely expected them to. Cue 170,000 troops on the Ukrainian border.  Therefore the actions of the US and Russia are somehow equally bad? I fail to see how the US not promising to diplomatically cripple themselves in Eastern Europe for the foreseeable future is in anyway comparable to what Russia did.  Was the US supposed to somehow stop Ukraine from asking to join nato?	1645173172.0	hxf9rt9	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf82r5	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxf9rt9/

84su4mrz	My reason is based on Putin's past actions. Azov Battalion didn't commit war crimes against the "people", that sounds like the propaganda Putin is spreading saying that they're killing Russians and dumping them in mass graves. From what I've read they mostly did stuff to the actual separatists, not random citizens.

84su4mrz	Well I wouldn't want to join another neo nazi country. Russia is much worse than Ukraine as far as human rights.

1333lh	This is less about Russian security and more about Putin staying in power more than anything.   From a certain perspective two major world orders are developing -- China and Russia on one side and the US + Europe on the other. It makes sense that Russia would oppose NATO expansion, but to degree they're doing this right now? This is Putin diplomacy at work, he's pouring a lot of resources into this bargaining chip because he needs a political win.   Russia's economy has gone downhill significantly under his watch due to sanctions. All it has is natural gas and the infrastructure of trade between China and Russia doesn't exist yet as their relations have just warmed. Putin wants to stay in power because the sanctions are killing him, and he needs time to secure his legacy. Hence the jingoist posturing.	1645174152.0	hxfaz8h	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxf8947	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxfaz8h/
6qz06	By my understanding NATO wouldn’t ever try to invade Russia, just to keep Russia from invalidating the sovereignty of member States. Ostensibly, there would also be more governmental oversight (to a certain degree, to meet certain standards) in Ukraine.   I find it interesting that a lot of people defending Russia right now seem to be defending their right to change other States’ borders.

d12dcicv	Because you cna believe in ideas like leftism, anti-imperialism, etc for their ideals, or you can do it because you oppose something that leftist are opposed to.  Its basically just fascism. There are people who oppose the West not because they believe it to be anti left, imperialist or neoliberal, but simply because they oppose it. So they attach themselves to leftism like a parasite and start making up conspiracies, lies about their own side and just in general being inconsistent.  They often support capitalist dictatorships like Russia and state capitalist distatorships like China even though neither adheres to leftist and progressives ideals and both are imperialist nations with their own fair share of human rights abuses.  Depending on what part of the world you live in you've either benefitted from or being the victim of one of three major imperialist powers: The USA+EU, Russia or China. None of these three powers support leftism, democracy, freedom, and the only reason to equate these ideals with any of these three is not because people believe in them, but because their entire ideology is defined by its opposition to something else.	1645183032.0	hxflzn2	t3_sv7bch	t3_sv7bch	/r/socialism/comments/sv7bch/why_do_so_many_modern_leftists_seem_to_support/hxflzn2/
d12dcicv	Probably because they don't like Imperialist powers doing Imperialism and since Russia is currently doing that in Ukraine, people look to their natural opposition which is NATO.  I think the only reason leftist support NATO right now in this specific conflict is the same reason Ukrainian support for joining NATO has shot up: Russian aggression.  Talk to lefties about NATO in the Middle East and you get a vastly different response. They're not pro NATO, they're anti Imperialism and don't want Ukraine to be overrun by an Imperialist nation. These same lefties would speak up in the same way about a US invasion of Cuba.	1645183358.0	hxfmf8x	t3_suz0ed	t3_suz0ed	/r/socialism/comments/suz0ed/why_does_it_seem_that_so_many_leftist_are/hxfmf8x/

ddz2bte	I wouldn't call Russia's action defensive. Ever since the collapse of the USSR they've been trying to regain their lost influence thru either soft power, like supporting far right parties across Europe and dividing the population more and more, or by hard power like annexing Crimea. I really can't justify these actions and call it being on defence. One thing justifying lefties in supporting Russia I think is privileged of not living next to it. For the US leftists the US imperialism seems much worse than Russia's, but I live in Poland and there's a possibility that I will be drafted into the army if Russia starts a war, so their Imperialism really scares me.	1645184403.0	hxfnv76	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxff74y	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxfnv76/

Russia did nothing regarding Crimea until the U.S. helped install a new explicitly anti-Russia government 🙄  > The Ukrainian people get to decide what country they belong to, nobody else.  So, like the Crimeans did? Like the people of Donbas want to do?  > Of course they want to protect their borders.  🙄🙄🙄🙄  And of course evil spooky Russia was such a threat to their borders before the 2014 coup that actually we needed an American backed coup in the hopes of expanding NATO to further press up American military bases against Russia’s borders…  You cannot be a socialist until you start critically engaging with the American imperialism you take for granted. Assure yourself by quietly chanting under your breath that Russia is bad and Putin is bad, fine, whatever, but if you let it get to the point that you sincerely see NATO as any sort of normal or necessary institution beyond purely imperial purposes, you may as well just admit you only really want a nicer American capitalism.	1645194528.0	hxg6h85	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxfb5hr	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxg6h85/

Citizen's cellphones are spammed with pro-Russia propaganda. Internet and TV and are interrupted with pro Putin messaging. There is a flood of misinformation on social media and private channels that are trying to push for an internal conflict. Accusing the local government of corruption and altering or taking down their public resources.  The idea that Russia is blameless up until their first soldier fires a gun is the most backwards idea that I've ever heard.  Russia isn't just posturing-- they've been actively weaking Ukraine for years. The best case scenario for them is that the Ukraine "implodes" and they come in to "rescue the government".	1645195976.0	hxg9t89	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxg4e66	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxg9t89/

Yes, it's imperialist but we're talking about an entire country loosing it's sovereignty to a fascist nation trying to Annex it. Annexation is not justifiable and we should not appease fascism.

17molnx9	No NATO is not imperialism. It's a voluntary defense force because Russia kept threatening Europe and if anyone claims being in the east during the cold war was somehow better they are wrong. American imperialism is a problem but this is just asinine thinking.   Most US bases overseas are with the express permission of the local governments. Even if Americans are wildly unpopular, these governments take full advantage of the economic support these bases dump into their local economies. If a country such as Japan wanted to stop or get rid of US bases in their territory they would, but they won't because then they'd be worried about the Chinese putting bases in their territory and believe me we're friendlier than the Chinese. People act like the US is Belgium during the scramble for Africa when it's not.  You know what would be the number one place for the US to put troops to fit this always at war mentality, Mexico. Mexico has continuous gang violence to the point the country might as well be a war zone in some places. They are considered a threat (not saying I agree with that), by many in the states. And Mexico is the source of many natural resources the US relies on. But we don't, because Mexico probably wouldn't want that so we find other ways to work with them such as co-operative law enforcement.  You can critique American imperialism all you want, lord knows we deserve it. But this isn't the same country as 100 years ago we're not starting another Spanish war to start picking up some islands here or there. But even on our worst days I'd still rather be American than stuck in Russia or China. Our imperialism only exist as it does today because we make better friends than they do and that is an absolute fact.	1645197749.0	hxge3k5	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxg7phy	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxge3k5/

They actually still engaged in cyber-attacks and sent propaganda directly to Ukranian phones and released a false flag video the day the US said they’d invade.

I'm not a fan of hyperbole, and I don't think it'll go that far, but it's a bit similar to how Germany acted in the build-up to WW2. Crimea and the eastern provinces of Ukraine are the new Sudetenland...  What people are missing is that it's really not about the troops.

isx3s	I'm not the previous commenter, but you basically did do exactly that. "the US isn't invading its neighbors" as a defense against accusations of US imperialism demonstrates a total denial or ignorance of the way US imperialism works.  The US isn't currently invading its neighbors because it already controls or isolates its neighbors to a satisfactory degree.   Take Mexico. There is no need to invade Mexico and annex it, because the benefits of annexation to the empire would be limited, and the cost of any war to achieve such an end, not to mention the eventual enfranchisement of the Mexican people would substantially outweigh what limited benefits there might be. The US already has more than enough influence over Mexico through monetary means to achieve its aims.  It's incredibly easy to see which countries currently fall sufficiently under its influence by simply identifying which ones US officials and media are critical of. Cuba, for example, is emphatically not in the club. So we punish them by a failed invasion, by permanently strangling their economy, and by more or less constant little projects to attempt to demonize and undermine the authority of their present government.  Or Bolivia. We don't like the party in power very much because they're not fond of bending over for American business interests, so we back false narratives questioning the legitimacy of their elections, which independent investigations have subsequently completely debunked. Then we back a right wing military coup on the pretense that those elections we helped delegitimize were fake. Fortunately for Bolivia, pressure from the people convinced the Bolivian military to compromise on just removing Morales (whom they fear) from power, but allowing elections to take place again as long as he couldn't run (despite the fact that both the people and the courts favored altering the constitution to allow him to do so).   These are just a couple of the myriad publicly known ways American imperial power is actually deployed. It seldom requires invasions. The fact that Russia has to rattle their sabers manually and the US doesn't is merely evidence of greater and more sophisticated American imperial power, not some fundamental moral difference.	1645200595.0	hxglc2h	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxgg3d1	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxglc2h/

I didn't known that it was all Nazis who stormed the parliament, is Ukraine controlled by fascists now?   I do think banning a language is bad and inherently oppressive.      Just say what you mean, this "curious" doublespeak is annoying.  Also nobody wants war.  Russia is the clear aggressor, they already took Crimea.  Look what happened in Georgia in 2008 this feels like the same playbook.    The people of Ukraine should decide their own destiny and not have to fight off an invasion by a larger nation.  How is it controversial that a far right oligarchy run by an ex-kgb/gangster is bad when it threatens to invade its neighbor after they dipose of their own oligarch leader?	1645202448.0	hxgq7p7	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxg7rsq	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxgq7p7/

Yes both russia and us are imprerislist and i presonally hate them but not everything that opposes russia is us sponsored secret operation. Sometimes people just have enough old corrupt authoritarian and rise. Also being an "ally" of russia always means you wil be an old authoritarian regime drained from resources by motherland and forcefully russified population. Being "ally" of US means that ur have a milion mcdonalds but show me an us ally with a authoritarian pro us regime sponored by usa. Poland was 2 times russian "ally" and well lets say it was naver a plesnent experiance. You sound like no other nation counts its just russia and us if u oppose russia ur bribed by us NATO coup and a secret operation.

clr0mszy	I think you're mostly right, but what country is group A saying the US needs to invade? Imo that's misleading framing as Russia is literally poised to invade Ukraine. The question is whether or not it's justified for the US/NATO to provide military support to the Ukrainian state as it defends itself from Russian imperialism. I think it's a shitty take to pretend that this is analogous to other US invasions of the 20th century.   And it's kinda a privileged view to get all caught up in which country is the worse imperialist isnt it? Actual Ukrainian lives are at stake here.

If you want me to think NATO is the driver for modern-day imperialism you'll have to try again.  Capitalism is the DRIVER of US imperialism.  The IMF is a tool to maintain that imperialism.

In no scenario will Ukraine be acquired by Europe or the US via military action. Whereas, there are many possible scenarios where parts of Ukraine become acquired by Russia via military action.	1645209380.0	hxh8ipa	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxh382t	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxh8ipa/

8a3alu7h	No one lied about North Korea. They attacked first. The gov also didn’t lie about Germany. Germany amassed troops on the borders of their targets just like Russia is now. We’re not talking about America wanting to go on some bullshit crusade into Vietnam or snatch up all the Middle East’s oil. Russia is threatening Ukraine, and have been doing so for a while now.   You don’t have to support American imperialism to oppose Russian imperialism. *If* Russia makes a move I would support U.S. intervention to protect the Ukrainian people from an autocratic dictatorship ravaging their country. But *if* the U.S. uses tensions to build a hundred new military bases along the Dnieper then I’ll oppose that. Why are so many people on lefty subs so goddamn binary?	1645210373.0	hxhb2i5	t3_sv9d03	t3_sv9d03	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxhb2i5/
1ugw4o4o	>Every other war, every other time, we find out later that the US lied.   I don't think this is true. I would say that the Korean War was pretty open in regards to why we were there and what was occurring while it was occurring. Many of the other wars listed had a whole lot that was lied about, I agree.   Further, simply because 1 or 15 wars were led about doesn't mean that this was (which isn't even a war and the US seems to be attempting to avoid it at all costs, including abandoning Ukraine).  >It's like the Iraq War just never happened for some of you people.  I'm probably older than you and I've known many people who went to Iraq. The war was very real for me as was the one in Afghanistan.   We can talk about those wars in particular if you'd like, the US did plenty wrong in both places but there is more nuance than many give it, but the discussion is about Ukraine.   As far as I can tell, Ukraine desires closer ties with the EU and NATO for their own reasons and Russia doesn't like that. It's not okay, even when the US does it, for a sovereign nation to not have the ability to make decisions for itself. There's lots of things that the US does that we shouldn't support, but that doesn't mean that everything the US does is wrong.	1645210426.0	hxhb7di	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxh6g45	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxhb7di/
9hedets5	No more sanctions??? Freezing assets of the Russian oligarchy are starving its people? I get your point with sanctions that affect like with Iran but there are multiple ways to do sanctions.  Right, war is not good.  Hence, releasing intelligence to put Russia in a box and hold off war.  There is no scenario where the US or EU instigate conflict here.  This isn't Iraq, Ukraine is autonomous.  The US and EU are not the ones infringing on that sovereignty.	1645210855.0	hxhcayh	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxham3b	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxhcayh/
adzvk	This is misinformation by definition. All political memes are, even if they represent objective facts. Simply because there is no mechanism to verifythat what youre saying is true. This tweet is just sowing doubt for the sake of it and sharing it is just amplifying the message. It is arguable disinformation by the tweeter. You want people to believe the us gov less. Its a compelling point and supports the notion of skepticism.

7tm2g3et	a couple things...  look at the poling in Ukraine. They don't consider 2014 an illegal coup. also it was supported by the parliament (kinda interesting that the first thing the ex president did was go to Russia). The idea that the EU or US organized a revolution seems dubious to me, but if you have sources I would love to read them.  No I don't think annexing the Crimea was was an issue of sovereignty. Crimea was part of Ukraine. did it have a bunch of Russians? yes, if it left via legal secession then its fine but that's not what happened. troops were sent. Now Crimea is Russia.  And once again Russia amassed troops on the boarder to threaten to invade. I'm sensing a pattern here. do they have the right to do that? sure, but if the idea is to threaten a country into doing your bidding that's kind of a shitty thing to do. and taking over a country because you don't like Europe is a shittier thing to do. Seems like it makes the protection of joining NATO all the more appealing for Ukraine.  NATO is defensive that's the whole point. If Russia hadn't invaded Crimea maybe they would still be buddies. but as it stands the only one who has been aggressive is Russia. you can try and justify what they do but it doesn't change the fact that they are being bullies.	1645211254.0	hxhdbfs	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxh0urm	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxhdbfs/
1ugw4o4o	I've heard their words. They believe that if Ukraine is added to NATO that it will be one step further to their borders, just like the promise NATO made and reneged on in regards to Poland. They think NATO is a threat to their sovereignty.   Here is the problem that I have. Russia isn't standing up for freedom and choice. They aren't standing up for communism or socialism. They're standing up for their want of swinging around their power. A bully is not something anyone should stand with.  Further, if they weren't constantly interfering in other countries, they wouldn't have sanctions imposed on them from NATO. I understand they don't want the US interfering in their country and I agree with that part. Let them make their own choices within their own borders. However, when they essentially pay to invade another country, someone ought to stand up to them. When the US does something similar, we ought to stand up against our government. These ideas aren't mutually exclusive. We can think that the US interfering is wrong and it's wrong when Russia does it.   The last thing I'll say is that I'm all for peace with the Russian people, but I'm not for cooperation with Putin. He's a dictator who has done terrible things to his own and other nation's citizens. There ought to be a line that if crossed has consequences, otherwise we let the bullies of the world succeed.	1645211711.0	hxhehfk	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxhbtud	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxhehfk/
9hedets5	Wait, your argument that NATO isn't defensive is that they denied the Soviet Union for being undemocratic?  Turning down that application was equivalent to invasion? Did they really reject Russia in 1999?  Or are you referring to NATO's response to the slaughtering of civilians in Kosovo?  And as for imperialism, thank you for being Reddit's expert on the subject. And I'm fascinated how only one source will lead me to an unbiased viewpoint.	1645211814.0	hxheqo3	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxh9803	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxheqo3/
8txxc	> I read the article and I didn’t see a mention of the US supporting extremists, just the Ukrainian government. That’s not good, but it didn’t seem to be the US that did that.  I shared five articles. Two from a Canadian lens as part of a broader NATO action but I doubt you intend to argue that the U.S. was at all disconnected from that.  > I can see your point, but it’s also reasonable to believe that some protests are initiated and funded by the people who believe in them.  It is both. Most coups do not occur with zero public support. And in this case I could even probably buy into it being a majority position, but simply placing a thumb on that scale can have significant and harmful effects.  > The change that took place in 2014 didn’t seem to have anything to do with Ukraine desiring closer ties to the EU and NATO as that endeavor proceeded it.  Not reading you on this. E.U. I guess can set aside since that ostensibly kicked off the protests and so you could demarcate it in that way, but NATO not so much.  > Perhaps because they don’t feel as though their government can make decisions as a sovereign state.  Again not reading you on this, but to clarify my position, I was gesturing at “the average Ukrainian” perspective being primarily nationalist. Hardly unexpected because most people have nationalist impulses, but the ways those factor into our portrayals are not really good arguments from a *socialist* lens. Like, Spaniards would broadly be upset if Catalan formally broke off. Canadians and Québec. Brits and Northern Ireland (reunifying with Ireland proper). But that does not really make any of those *wrong* were they to happen.  > I won’t argue that the US hasn’t been imperial in the past and perhaps in the present. But as far as I can tell, they aren’t being imperial in regards to Ukraine.  I think encouraging a revolution to suit your own interests and then using the results of that revolution to establish a foothold in that country and start provoking conflict with one of the key opponents to your global hegemony is in fact imperialist, just not the *hard* imperialism people like to limit to specific invasions and extractions of resources.  There is also the more speculative view that the Ukrainian economic hit resulting from American hysteria will be used to further neoliberal pursuits in the country as part of a “recovery”, and although it is indeed speculative it is not really any more speculative than the past months of “Russia is about to seize Ukraine!!!”  > Ukraine seemed to want to improve relations with “the West” all in their own for economic and security reasons.  This is again a weirdly anodyne framing. Immediately before the coup you may as well say Ukraine wanted to prioritise Russia for the exact same reasons. But in any case, once again that does actually justify anything unless we pretend the Ukrainian lens is the only one worth analysing, because: **a.)** that is not a justification for NATO to be expanded (or even to exist at all); **b.)** that is not a counter to Russian fears over what NATO would mean for *its* security interests; and **c.)** the idea that NATO does anything to advance Ukrainian safety interests seems to have been completely repudiated by the fact that the past eight years of Russian conflict have all been tied to NATO expansion (which the world already saw with Georgia in 2008).  > The US has done terrible things, some of them mentioned in the OP. The situation in Ukraine doesn’t seem to be one of them.  Only you take it as a given both that the U.S. deserves global military coverage and that its efforts further fomenting this conflict past that do not qualify as “terrible”. While the situation in Ukraine is certainly less direct that most of the examples in the OP, it is a close and foreseeable consequence of its imperialist actions.	1645212212.0	hxhfqxe	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxh96wq	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxhfqxe/
2ntjryzf	This is a real bad take. First off, the US isn't getting involved as it doesn't really have reason to, secondly I doubt russia is the one we are supporting.

1ugw4o4o	I apologize firstly as I did not see that they were five separate links, though I did think they looked weird. I'll take a look at those other ones.   It seems like our disagreement stems from whether everything the US does is imperialism or not, characterized by this statement:   >just not the hard imperialism people like to limit to specific invasions and extractions of resources.  Unless you believe (and perhaps you do) that capitalism is always imperialist, then I don't see how this could be the case. If one country wants closer relations to another country, it doesn't mean the first country was imperialist. And the only reason that everything the US does is imperialism (under this reasoning) is because it is mostly capitalist.   Why does Russia fear for its security? Russia and the US got along pretty well until Putin came into power a far as I can recall. There doesn't need to be a dichotomy of power. The people of Russia don't need to be opposed to the people of the US and vice versa.   Russia isn't fighting for Socialism or Communism, they're fighting for power. If two people who are wrong are fighting over a third, then it's the third person's opinion that matters. That opinion appears to favor the US and NATO.	1645213575.0	hxhj5wq	t3_sv9d03	t1_hxhfqxe	/r/socialism/comments/sv9d03/for_real_this_time_we_swear/hxhj5wq/
