That resulted in Soviet Union having no other options anyway. I mean, we can imagine a thought experiment where the wars never happened - perhaps the graphs would look similar. But this is precisely what it would have looked like as it did happen, and it's likely it's a huge factor at play here.	1642713491.0	htiexqv	t3_s8s37u	t3_s8s37u	/r/socialism/comments/s8s37u/wonder_why_eastern_europe_was_on_top/htiexqv/

bxap9g57	First of all, China is not a "leading country," though it has came a long way since 1978, when 90%+ lived in absolute poverty. Though the living standards in China is far higher than countries with similar GDP per capita (Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, etc), it is still a developing country by many metrics.  Second of all, there is no magic light switch for Socialism. You can't just turn it on and say well, all foreign investment goes out the window, the State nationalizes all the foreign factories and whatnot (might be useless without the technicians who knows how to use them) no more diplomacy with capitalist countries, all private business shuts down immediately and is confiscated by the state, all home owners now live in a state owned property, etc.   The real world is complicated and messy, anyone who even ask such a question I would assume is someone who never worked a day of his life before.   I'm sure everyone has their "perfect vision" of what Socialism "ought" to look like, or how a perfect novel ought be, or how a perfect software ought to be. When you try building that utopian vision of yours, you realized, the world is really complicated, and you run into all sorts of contradictions.  It is like those who criticize China and Vietnam as not really socialist because they don't have universal healthcare and everyone living in pent houses in Shanghai 10 seconds after the revolution (like how many doctors that is trained in modern medicines are there in 1949 China??).  A revolution is not an event, it is a process, a struggle between the old world (China being dirt poor and dominated by foreign interests), and a socialist China (everyone lives moderately well, the contradictions of capitalism handled by the State dictatorship over the means of production, without looting from the Global South through imperialism).  If you are a Western (armchair) "socialist" who is more concerned about how China is not socialist, and you have far better policy suggestions for them on what the State should do, even better than the people who actually lives in China and understands the material contradictions of China far better than you do, then I'd suggest you get rid of your colonial mindset. Your criticisms will have 0 effect in China since the people who actually live there won't listen to you.   If you are so smart at knowing what socialism is, then build socialism in the West. Show the Chinese why they are wrong.	1642784900.0	htmcpy8	t3_s8r6ex	t3_s8r6ex	/r/socialism/comments/s8r6ex/why_hasnt_china_abandoned_there_mix_economy_yet/htmcpy8/
g22lrree	You don't.  The concept of arming the public is a flawed one and the second amendment of the US constitution should be read how it really is: to arm well-regulated militias, which is the only context in which your right as a person to be armed is valid.  If that isn't the case, then why have that opening statement about well-regulated militias?  It's like saying you have the right to expose your breast in public in a general sense when the real law states "Given the purpose of breastfeeding a young child, the right to bare a breast in public should not be infringed."  And if people want to continue to misread it, then the second amendment should be amended or repealed by another amendment.  Guns are too dangerous and people are too unhinged and unpredictable to allow general arming of the public.  I realize that there's some sort of "socialist ideal" that imagines a glorious armed public to ensure government cooperation, but let's face it -- against any government, you're going to fail because they can afford more and better arms than you.  It's a trick by governments to enable even more class warfare and social unrest so they can gain even more control over us.  Maybe at one point in our history when governments were not so well-organized and militant as they are now were weapons a tool for change but now?  Now they only serve to divide us, harm us, and allow governmental oppression.  Throw your weapons in the fire and win hearts and minds with the most powerful weapons of all: your words.  Someone with a gun isn't going to change the world, because a government with guns just waiting for retaliation is going to keep that society down.	1642786290.0	htmgii0	t3_s9c35u	t1_htm4gw1	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htmgii0/

2krb31d2	Note: I am not a Ukrainian, but I was born in the USSR and my grandmother as well as her family come from Crimea. They lost everything during the October Revolution and many members of my family were murdered by the Bolsheviks. They considered themselves Russian yet they liked the Ukrainian culture and language more. I used to see myself as a Russian because that is the culture and language I grew up with, yet I am so utterly disgusted by what Russia is doing that I do not consider myself Russian anymore. Fortunately, I do not live there anymore either.   Now about the Ukrainians and Russians:  The relations between Russia and Ukraine have never been good. In short, Russia stole Ukrainian history and has been mocking the Ukrainians as some kind of simple-minded "brotherly nation" for several centuries in a row. The reality is that Ukraine is pretty much the birthplace of Kievan Rus as Kyiv was its capital.   Over time, Kievan Rus collapsed and was divided between different entities whereas some parts, mainly Novgorod and Muscovy, managed to survive on their own despite paying a large tribute to the Mongols. After the Mongols were beaten back several centuries later, Muscovy conquered the Novgorod Republic and then kept adding more territories transforming itself into Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire. The Russians began to view themselves as the "Great Russians" while Ukrainians were referred to as "Little Russians". The modern explanation is that this simply refers to the difference in size and population, yet I doubt you want to be referred to as "little + your people's name" by another nation. Because of the imperial past, many Russians are still very chauvinistic which you can easily understand if you speak the language.   In the Russian Empire the use of Ukrainian was forbidden. In the USSR it was discouraged and active Russification of Ukrainians (as well as all peoples of the USSR) took place. The Ukrainians were never truly fond of the Russians during the Soviet times but the gradual Russification and replacement of the ethnic groups by the Russians did make it seem that the relations were good.   After the collapse of the USSR, all the former Soviet republics had this brief moment of euphoria when they thought they would start living better because life in the USSR was absolute shit. People were extremely poor, yet the Soviet elite lived far better. In reality, the October Revolution changed nothing: they just replaced the Tsar with the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and the nobility with various top decision-making members of the Communist Party.   People were fed up, but nobody really knew how to transform their economy to become more productive and competitive in the global market. Remember, we did not participate in the global economy for decades and prior to that the Russian Empire was a backward agrarian state run by monarchs with absolute power. Just like most other post-Soviet republics, Ukraine was suffering from endemic corruption, poverty, inefficiency in virtually every sector of the economy, but this made it easier for the ultra rich business people and corrupt officials to maintain control and enrich themselves even more. Since all of them were still economically tied to Moscow due to the way the Soviet economy was built, they kept doing what Moscow told them to do.   In the early 2000s people got fed up with this situation and they demanded changes. This is why the Orange Revolution happened. The same things happened in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and to a lesser extent in Armenia. The Russians, however, felt betrayed, and who is easier to blame than the US and EU? Yes, the US was involved because it was the only unchallenged superpower left - can you imagine it ever staying away from such an  opportunity? But it played a rather minor role of advising and trying to limit the chaos, it did not start the revolution. The people themselves were fed up with the old ways of living.   Unfortunately, there is no quick and painless way to transform your poor country into a developed one when it had been an integral part of an autocratic regime for centuries. So they failed and this led to Maidan in 2014 with all the mess that we see today. Russia is paranoid about losing control over its former republics because Putin fears the same events happening in Russia itself. NATO, US, EU - these are all boogeymen created by the paranoid minds of the Soviets and kept alive by Putin and his team of kleptocrats.   The events in Kazakhstan are just the continuation of the story. People want changes while Russia and its puppet governments in the former Soviet republics want to maintain a firm grip and continue stealing. The West and especially the US have actually been very disengaged from the whole process. Maybe it is for the best but right now Ukraine does need help as they do not want to be with Russia and there is no chance they will forget what the Russians did there.	1642794686.0	htn3cjj	t3_s9hcwj	t3_s9hcwj	/r/socialism/comments/s9hcwj/opinions_on_ukraine_and_russia_conflict/htn3cjj/

30qo4h8a	That's really the easiest-to-answer question you could have asked. Depending on what exact conceptualization of socialism you adopt:  (1) Social Democracy -- Tax the rich.  (2) Democratic Socialism -- Tax the rich, tax the co-ops, surplus from state owned enterprises.  (3) Marxist-Leninists -- Tax the rich (if, for whatever reason, they're allowed to continue existing), tax the co-ops (insofar as privately-run institutions are allowed to exist), surplus from state-run industry/enterprises.  (4) Anarcho-Communism -- Money is an outdated concept, we already have the industrial capacity for communism to exist.  ***The question you should be asking yourself, is "how does Jeffery Bezos pay for 30 second rocket-rides to space?"***	1642909675.0	htu33hn	t3_sa5z39	t1_httl3o6	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/htu33hn/

73jcjyjg	First of all, I have no clue why this is in my feed, but say I'll bite. I'm baffled that socialism is actually a thing in America but I guess I shouldn't be since you guys have very little clue about how life was in post communist countries. Im from Eastern Europe, specifically Romania. Let me give you an example of how life was before 89 for us. Lack of food, you literally had to wait in line at 7 am to get your daily rations of bread and a few other goods that were given to you based exactly on how big your family was. The money you earned was so little that you could barely afford much, except for the higher paying jobs which allowed those to get a little more. You couldn't express your opinion unless they were pro communist otherwise you risked jail together with your family. I've met someone who was kicked out of highschool and wasn't allowed to join any other highschool ever because his father was against the regime. He ended up working as a construction worker for the rest of his life. The poor were still very poor and those with higher education were only doing slightly better. To quote my dad "in democracy, I am rich and you are poor, in communism I am poor and you are poor". The only people who were really doing very well for themselves were those involved with the communist party (what a surprise). Not even the Russian population were doing well, most of Russia entered a food crisis too because of mismanagement. I'm disgusted to see people still believe that this garbage ideology is actually any good. It works well on paper, it worked terribly in practice. The educated will always abuse the uneducated, this is the truth, whether you like it or not. I don't like it, but it is the way things have been, whether in democracy or in socialism. But hey, at least you people have the right to agree with each other and not go to jail. How great is that right? I wonder what that's called.	1643311554.0	huh9df0	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huh9df0/

i96rdp93	That's geopolitics man, taking control of strategic resources or territories. And the sanguinary part that you named is neither American or cold war history, is just history, human nature. After the germans raped the territories of USSR, the soviets did the same with the german people, and something similar happened with the French troops. In the pacific the Japanese  where mounsters with the people that "libereted" and the americans had their own war crimes, not as horrible as the Imperial army. It is not generally a Ideological reason what motivates people into doing this sort of things.  The other thing that surprises me is the call for revenge or hatred towards other nation, I know that a nation should not forget his history, but if it doesn't progress from it will fall into chauvinistic rhetoric (just see the balkans, especially Greece vs Turkey), and that's not really socialistic.	1643312878.0	huhcz4z	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huh94uk	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhcz4z/

11em70	while i do think he interrupted this person a lot thats what they all do on both sides. I would have just let him dig his own hole.   The problem with socialism and communism is all the real hard core ones always think theyre going to be the new elite and not the ones digging holes, and trust me there will need to be hole digger. I always ask the same question  "what will be your place in the new socialist uptopia?"  Their answers are always some kind of intellectually skilled position. I re inform them they will be digging holes and we dont need anymore of "those people in those positions right now, but we will gladly put you in a list for re examination at a future date. Here is your shovel, Javier over there is your supervisor, do what he tells you.   Socialism is built on the premise that everyone will be happy to work, happy to work where and when ever they are placed and never want more. Their will never be envy or desire or greed. You can not eliminate the human ego. If this was so there would be socialist hippy compounds everywhere but there arent. The ones that attempt fail because there are always more people wanting to be cheifs than indians. the ones that come close generally turn into cults. In the end it will still work like capitalism. It will rely on luck, skill and nepotism with nepotism skyrocketing. Sadly a lot of the people I speak with on this dont actually know how the world or economy works.	1643319762.0	huhvmfn	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhvmfn/

ivn7kgao	I'm a clinician. Far fewer people in the US are able to receive early treatment before their cancer progresses. Therefore those who don't have early access to care affect survival rates of the US compared to other countries. Even those with health insurance can't pay because of an insanely high deductible.  It's called the cycle of poverty for a reason.  By law with EMTALA, hospitals are not able to deny care in life-threatening situations. The people who don't have access to early interventions often seek care far too late (because they didn't have much of a choice).  Then they're saddled with medical debt they cannot. Which does (by the way) have ripple effects on the economy and country at large.

elofzgj3	Serious question here (and I hope I don't come across as rude as that's not my intention).  Since many of us who've been on the planet for decades saw what socialism did to countries like Cuba, Russia, China and Venezuela, that's going to be our go-to with referencing Socialism.  I kept waiting for a relatively concise response from Mimi but he didn't seem to be prepared for that.  What is the answer to why those countries shouldn't be viewed as examples of socialism that didn't work?  I think people would be more open to learning about socialism if someone could provide a concise overview of that to the average person.  I don't know that socialism is the answer, but I would like to understand where people who support socialism are coming from without having to do a lot of in-depth reading.  It seems overly complicated and I'm an intelligent person.  Please understand, I'm not saying socialism is bad or wrong.  I don't know enough about it without going on a research bender.  I'm looking for cliff notes to determine if I'd want to do that level of research.  I respect beliefs that are different from my own and it's not my place to judge, especially since I don't understand an alternate viewpoint.  I'm just wanting to learn more.	1643326855.0	huidrho	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huidrho/

2t8tcu3c	Honest question: if I made a million dollars but my take home was only $300k, why would I work that hard?  I really don't understand this.  It takes more work to make more money. If the tax rate on a lower income is less, doesn't this encourage taking jobs of a lower income?  Lets say you have to work 60 hours a week to make $100k which is taxed at 50%, or work 40 hours to make $75k which Is taxed at 25%  You'd make more money working 40 hours.  So what's the incentive to work harder?	1643327053.0	huie8kq	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huie8kq/

h87n3u1u	I’m new here, but what the hell is the point of having a sub if you bring literally no constructive discussion? I’m not a socialist or a communist, so I should just be banned? All you hear is what you want to hear?? Nonsense.   Anyways. What’s the point of being anything or doing anything if 70% of your success is axed? If I was making a video game, and I was projected to make a million, but taxes were gonna take 70% of it, why the fuck would I do that??? I’d rather move somewhere else so I don’t have to get ridiculously taxed on something I made.   Venezuela is a perfect talking point. Why are immigrants from all over the world flocking to America? It’s because they can make good money doing hard work. They’d never go back, yet all these liberals and socialists are all “I want to open a coffee shop in (insert nice European place)” or “those socialist/communist countries are better” THEN MOVE. GO LIVE THERE!  If your life is seriously so withholding here in the states, go free.    I just don’t get it. If you guys want to live this free and anti work lifestyle, get income generating assets that outweigh your liabilities.

78glbcb5	Honestly the interviewee didn't even get to make a distinction between democratic socialism and authoritarian socialism, which are completely different concepts - fox guy just cherry picked a couple of authoritarian options.   A secondary consideration is to question whether without embargoes and extensive intervention, socialist countries would've further militarized, or channeled the resources as intended into social programs. I'm totally unsurprised the fox guy kept interjecting and going straw man but these are all valid considerations when comparing socialist countries to heavily capitalist ones.   Soviet economy collapsed because it was politically bound to a bipolar world in which they had to constantly re arm in a planned economy.   Cuba has been throttled since it's revolution by embargoes, and has never been afforded the opportunity to prove whether it could succeed or not, and has surprisingly STL developed world class doctors and education.   Venezuela was a mess long before maduro or Chavez. It was made More so so by embargoes, which hardened their stance and forced them into the arms of authoritarian. Bolivia? Well that ended in military takeover.   Comparatively, China is used as an example, and is not a purely socialist country, it follows its own characteristics and applied full market economics with an authoritarian ruling model, built on the skeleton of the old politburo style system of communism. This is all important to consider, and is relevant to the discussion when considering how to counteract authoritarian states. Being smug and believing you're the best is what crashed every empire in history, pure arrogant complacency. It's in growing and adapting that you get progress, and that is 100% not visible on fox news because there is no vision for a better democratic future, only visions of some glorified past.	1643332189.0	huiqivc	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huiqivc/

7xq039ti	When commies start talking about their commie dream you really just have to ask them of commie success stories on large scale.  There are none.  Commie often reach for Europe but every successful European county is capitalist in nature. But unlike US, they use fruits of capitalism to fund welfare programs that actually help the citizens.  So you can go to good school just by studying hard. You don't have to worry about bills when you go to hospital. And when you can't find work they will supoort you as long as you are willing to look for one.  All that crap about owning means of production - who is stopping you? Gather 1000 people. Start a factory. If what you are preaching is better then you will be nr 1 and you way will become THE way.  Problem with commies is that they are preaching things that are not grounded in reality. It's why it's called utopia.	1643332761.0	huirv8f	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huirv8f/

wvl5j	Holy shit people. I know this guy did pretty well at combating the "smarmyness" of fox news, but even on the basic facts hes not as effective as he could be.  "has socialism ever worked before?"   answer: Yes, in America. Public libraries, military, police, highways/roads, electricity and internet (in come counties), schools!!!, national parks, our government (senators, local, etc), the list continues. Im blanking right now on other things, but the point is we have socialism in the US RIGHT NOW. Certain markets are fit for socialism and certain markets are not. There is no such thing as full socialism either. You wouldn't socialize restaurants. But you might do for basic groceries (o wait, like when the AMERICAN government gave every AMERICAN cheese+). And looking at our country, you should certainly work towards socialized healthcare.	1643332847.0	huis2jd	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huis2jd/

g90pr	Cuban here, in all fairness Cuba is the worst example to use for socialism. There is no resources, and everyday is about survival. Socialism was not practiced in Cuba, there was a moment where things seemed to be going in the right direction before the Castros kept the resources to themselves and everyone got paid the equivalent of 20$ per month. They got a small bump recently but basically the families in Cuba survive off of what people in America send to Cuba whether thats money or food.

hzsosi0z	Most western European countries incorporate socialist ideas into their political system. This is closer to what is known as "social democracy", but the results are good, much better compared to the pure-capitalist US. The "Nordic model" refers to the collection of policies implemented by Northern-european countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. These countries are by many metrics considered to be some of the best countries in the world to live in, they have high social moblility and relatively high social equality, low crime rates, free education, strong labor unions, etc. They aren't explicitly "socialist", but they're the closest we have to socialism in the modern world.	1643336732.0	huj14qv	t3_seefes	t1_huiyf3m	/r/socialism/comments/seefes/can_someone_help_with_defending_points_of/huj14qv/

Because democrats time and time again deny children the choice of their school selection and a free market. Housing. Mostly because democrats make policies where they run from and infect other states. Bringing in large amounts of money and buying political influence, in turn creating the same policies they ran from. Sad how you delete anyone whom speaks out against all in favor of not having your feelings hurt. Notice Right wing subs aren't out right banning others for the sake of their beliefs.

Capitalism, on the other hand, focuses more and more wealth and political power into the hands of fewer and fewer people. That is antithetical to a representative democracy.

Chavez was a corrupt but charismatic populist that maintained the tradition of failing to incentivize a broader economy apart from oil, while stealing as much as possible for himself and his cronies.

Why should they have to pay 70 percent more than someone else because they worked & sacrificed for a dream they had & it became successful.

35p2b	I'm sure I'll be banned soon after my comments, as has been the case with every Marxist based sub...but you do realize that bringing up Venezuela, China, USSR, in addition to other countries like Vietnam and Cuba is totally legitimate, right? These are, in fact, failed socialist states.   And China is succeeding quite well at the moment because they allowed a large proportion of their economy, at least 40 to 50%, to be private controlled, free market. Plus they trade heavily with the US, a capitalist state.   If you're goal is to convince people that socialism is worthwhile to pursue, by either avoiding the question or stomping your feet when it's brought up doesn't serve your goals at all... it just makes you look like you shouldn't be listened to... ever, like never ever.   All that aside, i.e., the fact that you're not addressing these technical, totally factual issues, you bring in ethical arguments which are completely transparent. You wouldn't sacrifice the things that you care about for others well being... why should anyone else?   I mean, this guy is your leader? Really? Why in all that is holy would I ever listen to that guy? Lol.

4o4ibi3b	This just popped up in my popular feed, I'm not a socialist.  But it seems to me that messaging from him could've been better. I'd make the argument that pure socialism doesn't work, it typically leads to authoritarianism and puts too much faith in the competency of government.  That being said, pure capitalism doesn't work either. It leads to wide spread suffering and corruption. (both statements are pretty generalizations but I think hold relatively true)   Couldn't a better message for the socialist party be, "we don't want America to be a socialist country, but we want more socialism in America. It should be the battleground of ideas. Pure socialism doesn't work, neither does pure capitalism. But it's my opinion that a hybrid of the two is the best option for the welfare of all."??

a2qr27uk	I can think of 6 extremely successful socialist countries operating today. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, & Oman.  The tax rate for these citizens is zero.  Yes, ZERO.  Because the government owns the natural resources (oil), they keep a small percentage for their countries needs and sell the rest on the world's market.  Except Bahrain.  They don't drill their own but do refine the product for the other 5.  Armed with this money, belonging to the citizens in the same way the natural resources do, the government build and pays for the roads, schools, military, hospitals, health care, etc.  There are some hotel taxes but that is designed to get foreign visitors to chip in.  They also enjoy massive subsidies on their energy needs whether it's cooling your home or filling up your car.  Roughly .55 per gallon last time I checked.  I find that the greatest misunderstand lies in the fact that most make the mistake of conflating government and economic systems.  Anything other than democracy is autocratic.  It's autocratic regimes that do the damage (usually).  I don't want to live in any of the countries listed above due to racism and extremism, especially towards women.  I just make sure to never confuse that with their economic system.	1643389910.0	hult0pp	t3_sebvj3	t3_sebvj3	/r/socialism/comments/sebvj3/to_say_socialism_has_never_worked_is_just_as/hult0pp/

a9cknhe7	I find it hilarious you all think this is some epic win when the guy mentioned socialism would be taxing high earners up to 70% of their income to redistribute to others. What incentivizes people to actually work and do important things when you punish them so hard like this? Were all born into this world and responsible for ourselves. Your lot in life is directly proportional to the effort you choose to put in for most.   Your ideal utopia goes against human nature and instinct. This working in a few dozen hippie commune does not mean it will work at scale. 70% of my hard earned work goes towards lazy entitled little people so they can stay at home doing art, blogs, and musing about philosophy?  Fools. Look at anyone who escaped Cuba or Venezuela. They all say the same thing, its a bad place. Dont care what things look like on paper. Plenty of footage out there too showing people living in ruins, fighting for food and gas. No wonder train-w0m3n are usually commies, you need to have a certain level of wack to think socialism/communism works and that train-w0m3n are real w0m3n.	1643392926.0	hum189q	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hum189q/

a83mcjer	I think you are totally right about the Venezuelan argument. As for Cuba and Soviet, they were more on the communist side than socialism. Since you seem well versed on socialism. Could you enlighten me on what does success for a society means to you?  And how would you solve the inequality in the work and value that you bring? For example, if 2 workers do the same job buy one is better the other not because of process or technique but just because of laziness, what would you do to make it fair? Would someone own more of the money or get more as a compensation which would bring make it lean more on capitalism side.   Really struggling with that part about socialism	1643395927.0	hum9anq	t3_sebvj3	t3_sebvj3	/r/socialism/comments/sebvj3/to_say_socialism_has_never_worked_is_just_as/hum9anq/

dkq7klos	No they aren't. In any way shape or form.    Again, they didn't challenge any of capitalism's features. Nothing to do with being dogmatic. They're not even proletarian dictatorships, and don't domenstrate being so in any way either.	1643397025.0	humc8a0	t3_sebvj3	t1_hulufzl	/r/socialism/comments/sebvj3/to_say_socialism_has_never_worked_is_just_as/humc8a0/
