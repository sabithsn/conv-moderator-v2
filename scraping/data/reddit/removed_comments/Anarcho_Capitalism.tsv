4zljy82m	Interesting take, but then if the fascist continues his statement beyond just criticism of capitalism and communism, you'll see that he will claim that true meaning and spiritual revival of the nation is not through materialism but rather through a convoluted and pseudoscientific view of race, blood-nation, and the sacred order of "natural hierarchies" engaged in perpetual conflict with one another until the strongest survives. So, the fascist does make some compelling points against economic materialism, but then devolves into replacing the emphasis on materialism with some convoluted mystical folk belief type thing. It's almost like you could see this quote replacing materialism with some type of transcendent religious or spiritual offering focused on love of one another and/or love of God, etc., but that's not where Fascism goes. It's usually about love of nation, state, tribe, etc., and then often resorts to uncritical love of the cult of personality around a single leader, which is hardly appealing to most people who are used to living in a free society.   Not to mention that Fascism has at least historically tended to find support among the wealthy elites of society, industrialists and oligarchs and the like. So while in principle this dude might be opposed to economic materialism, on practice most Fascist governments have ended up courting allies among those that dominate the economic system. In rhetoric, it's all good to be anti-materialist and strive for something more transcendent in society. In practice, ask those wealthy industrialist and aristocratic apologists who aligned and supported Fascism how they would feel if their position on the economic materialist hierarchy were upended. I'd bet they would be asking for their economic material wealth back pretty quickly.	1642820718.0	htoy6dk	t3_s9s2cj	t3_s9s2cj	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htoy6dk/

fs6u60vl	what's so bad about the government that rednecks always want to get rid of it?  do they simply live so far from civilization that they don't see the benefits the govt provides?  wouldn't it be better for u to move to civilization from the booneys so u can enjoy the benefits of  society	1642957837.0	htwfjw2	t3_saxydo	t1_htwf8m7	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/saxydo/conservative_logic/htwfjw2/
fs6u60vl	why do *you* hate brown people?  Seems that this anti-government Sovereign citizen movement didn't really exist until the Civil War period. It traces its roots back to Confederates hating the government because the government wanted to ban slavery  the entire "anti fed" sovereign citizen movement was because you guys were scared the govt might ban slavery  that's the first time we ever heard the "states rights" argument in america  Because you confederates didn't like that the federal government was banning slavery	1642958086.0	htwg7q3	t3_saxydo	t1_htwfuo4	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/saxydo/conservative_logic/htwg7q3/

fs6u60vl	and what happens when they can't afford to move?  It seems some people have developed a strategy of organizing the country in which even it's most poor and desperate people can afford to live happily.. and then people like you don't want that to happen and fight like hell to make sure that the poor suffer more than they have to	1642958544.0	htwhfgn	t3_saxydo	t1_htwgkoj	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/saxydo/conservative_logic/htwhfgn/
fs6u60vl	But you don't have to do what they say. For example taxation is 100% voluntary. If you don't have a job and you don't own property you don't pay taxes.    You *chose* to have a job and you chose to own property and that's what makes it voluntary  But you can stop paying taxes anytime you want by simply quitting your job and not owning property  Capitalism is not voluntary. Most people don't want to work it in jobs but they're forced to anyway. Capitalism employee slave labor in foreign countries. Forcing kids to dig for blood diamonds and kids in other countries to dig in Cobalt mines  capitalism *requires* non-consent	1642958674.0	htwhrv1	t3_saxydo	t1_htwhh12	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/saxydo/conservative_logic/htwhrv1/

fs6u60vl	I don't see any Democrats advocating for slavery or Jim Crow laws    I do however see PLENTY of conservatives and right-wingers declaring that they think the civil rights act should be repealed and a version of him crow laws to be enacted..

fs6u60vl	Just because you don't benefit from the government doesn't mean nobody does. The problem is that you reject Jesus teachings and only care about yourself.

fs6u60vl	what YOU describe is the opposite of consent  nobody consents to paying half their paycheck to a landlord  Nobody consents to really low wages at their job period they are forced to take those wages periodically they are forced to work that job period they don't have a choice period capitalism requires non-consent and actual literal slavery period	1642959067.0	htwis5m	t3_saxydo	t1_htwiiro	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/saxydo/conservative_logic/htwis5m/
