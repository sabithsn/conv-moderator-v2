4l0x27dk	it's not an unpaid day off work lol. you don't need a whole day off work to go vote. employers must allow employees to leave to go vote.  and no, $30 is not much money at all. your telling me, that there is an excuse for someone to not have $30 by the age of 18 to go get a standard ID that's required for mostly everything in life, besides voting?

4agkycb3	Lol, last I looked, the post is up by 32, champ. My fellow lefty friends also found it funny, not because it’s trying to make profound and articulate sentiment on a political humor sub, but because it encapsulates a common mis-conception with the bad-luck Brian meme on a political humor sub. But of course you and a couple other mouth breathers with the self awareness of rocks, got triggered like basement Magats. Grow some fucking skin, you peach blossom. Stop with the victim hood. Not everything poking fun at the left has to include a disclaimer showing that the alternative is a complete shit show.	1642712543.0	hticbcx	t3_s8d29l	t1_hthzijc	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8d29l/fool_me_once/hticbcx/

5xhezl84	It does make them untrue; if he has no right to defend others property, he couldn’t have been there to defend property.  If he has no medical aid training or means to administer medical aid, then he couldn’t have been there to administer aid.  You’re right, the law as written means that has no legal bearing.     But, it’s established the rules of engagement going forward.  So when some leftist goes to a Trump rally to “administer aid” and blasts three people, they can simply use the Rittenhouse defense, and it’s all kosher.  Which is fine by me.	1642715976.0	htiluan	t3_s85mjs	t1_htibo6l	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s85mjs/dont_underestimate_the_enemy/htiluan/

6l4z3	Hello! Thanks for your comment. Unfortunately it has been removed because you don't meet our karma threshold.   You are not being removed for political orientation.  If we were, why the fuck would we tell you your comment was being removed instead of just shadow removing it?  We never have, and never will, remove things down politicial or ideological lines. Unless your ideology is nihilism, then fuck you.     Let me be clear: The reason that this rule exists is to avoid unscrupulous internet denizens from trying to sell dong pills to our users.  /r/PoliticalHumor mods reserve the RIGHT to hoard all of the dong pills to ourselves, and we refuse to share them with the community.  If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator. If we shared the dong pills with the greater community, everyone would have massive dongs, and like Syndrome warned us about decades ago: "if everyone has massive dongs, nobody does.""    If you wish to rectify your low karma issue, go and make things up in /r/AskReddit like everyone else does.    Thanks for understanding! Have a nice day and be well. <3    You can check your karma breakdown on this page:    http://old.reddit.com/user/me/overview    (Keep in mind that sometimes just post karma or comment karma being negative will result in this message)    ~  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was a patriot who wanted America to be better and to dominate the world, BLM despise America and want to destroy it and help America's enemies. He wouldnt support black people like Michael Brown that tried to kill cops who were just doing their job.

8ickh	Dude, even if we humored your transphobic nonsense, the concept of changing your name isn't even necessarily a trans issue.  Cis people change or go by different names all the time.  If you grew up with some girl whose parents named her Bertha and you overheard her later introduce herself as Beth, you wouldn't start "correcting the record" and telling everybody that she lied and her name is actually Bertha, right?  No, at most you would probably say she used to be named Bertha.  Even if the same hypothetical girl changed her name from something common to something you thought was ridiculous (but still feminine/neutral), you wouldnt say that isn't her name.  So then why the hell are you so obsessed with what this person's name is to the point that you not just disagreeing with the choice but outright saying it's not their name?  Don't you think that is at least a little weird?	1642743838.0	htkb7yc	t3_s8w9pr	t1_htk85kv	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8w9pr/do_as_i_say_not_as_i_do/htkb7yc/

There were assholes in the store recording her breakdown. The breakdown assholes like you caused, and that assholes like you laugh at to this day.  She’s a friend of mine and she’s a much brighter person on her darkest days, than you ever ever capable of being.

5jqx2y	You should chill. Trans people aren't a threat to you. You're not being held at gunpoint, no one is threatening to force you to transition, you don't have to go to pride parades if you don't want to, you are free to have whatever beliefs you like and shit on people irrationally who have nothing to do with you. All good, don't expect LGBT people to like or tolerate you but by all means continue getting off on obsessing about minorities.  The least you could is treat trans people with the same respect you afford anyone else, hell even the same respect you afford dogs would still be a step up. That's not her name, she does not go by that name. Anyone can change their name, it has nothing to do with biology. She has also expressed that she identifies with womanhood and would like to be referred to with female pronouns. A lot of words to explain a very simple process by which you can show respect for her and her mental health.  No one is saying that chromosomes don't exist. No one is saying we can change all the chromosomes in the body. Kind of the whole point of being trans is having an identity that doesn't match how you were assigned and raised and feeling distress depression and discomfort with your body and how people perceive you. Plenty of other illnesses that have similar problems and you don't have much trouble respecting them. You don't insist on referring to married people by their maiden names just because "biologically your DNA is of the family you were born in so I outright refuse to change how I refer to you because its not scientific" even though that argument holds exactly the same principal to it.  If you won't afford people your basic respect, then your just showing your hand that you have no actual argument scientific or otherwise and are in fact just stubbornly continuing to dismiss people based on something you clearly don't understand. Maybe actually talk to a trans person, read the experiences of trans people, actually listen to them when they talk about how they feel. It really doesn't take much.	1642746282.0	htkfeo9	t3_s8w9pr	t1_htkc6fv	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8w9pr/do_as_i_say_not_as_i_do/htkfeo9/

Senators are not.   I don't mind if Democrats win every election, in fact I'm in favor of it. But if you think that's going to change the status quo, you're deluding yourself. We can't even get the speaker of the house (A California sweetheart) to agree to stop insider trading, and we've got Democratic senators seen shaking hands with Republicans after defeating the attempt to quash the filibuster so we could pass laws protecting voting rights.

16nr8n	100% you nimrod:  > Finally, more cohesive groups did render poorer quality decisions as group size increased.   https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Driskell/publication/239934322_Group_Cohesiveness_and_Quality_of_Decision_Making_An_Integration_of_Tests_of_the_Groupthink_Hypothesis/links/548710910cf268d28f0705f9/Group-Cohesiveness-and-Quality-of-Decision-Making-An-Integration-of-Tests-of-the-Groupthink-Hypothesis.pdf  > These figures give some suggestion of the importance of group size: one of the two cases where groupthink was avoided was the smallest group, and the group responsible for the other case of groupthink avoided (missile crisis) was smaller (13 vs 18) than the similar group responsible for the prototypic groupthink case (Bay of Pigs). Across the seven cases, group size is correlated r(5)=.48 with absence or presence of groupthink. (Group homogeneity, group insulation, and promotional leadership are correlated .55, .55, and .73 with presence of groupthink across the same seven cases (see Table 1 of McCauley, 1989)). There is considerable experimiental evidence that group size affects group product. Perhaps the most studied aspect of group dynamics since the 1950s is the phenomenon of group polarization (Brown, 1989, Chapter 6; see especially ’tHart, 1990, on groupshift in relation to groupthink), and the size of the risky shift was found to increase as group size increased from 3 to 8 (Teger & Pruitt, 1967). In the metaanalysis of groupthink experiments cited above, Mullen et al. (1994) found that the correlation of cohesion and decision quality became more negative with increasing group size. That is, high cohesion conditions were more likely than low cohesion conditions to produce poor decisions when group size was relatively large. This and other research by Mullen (1987, 1991) indicates that group size is “a potent predictor of group phenomena” (Mullen et al., 1994, p. 200).  https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/66344838/obhd.1998.275920210420-10126-1jh5uox-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1642787085&Signature=C4a4fdcF~FWFQSNkJERt0jA-aRyw97LyjKv~o4UI2~px6vev5HcmDbcHWqYmq1g8k5dqpT3yW5yKTmo3F2-6dF3rxIkLypQoPSajDTTRrXkuUeSWDWgd2UKdhKyZo8Pof-I-EphI3DY1ROrkIWgWZJEMi7gv5OgqlrJdDorBzahLoqRyaitnUboElh9LMpuHfbpfIhoVjhBu3uRLpxGSObg8r7IMss0cKjgTJlBYOH-4jeCJ2wIi8CeqG3lR1yBohAU1jr2mwyjljAffn7rerLl-QjLp3oQFWq75NOqajDtT37SrwzkZGIgf~9DwZHY2ZrhjYJbnLhnOiSl3yPIICQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA  Sit the fuck down you ignoramus.	1642783615.0	htm97kx	t3_s9agk7	t1_htm8opw	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htm97kx/

fxjh1ov5	America is the nation in this reference not the continent. But lets explore which tribes decided to name the land they live on after an Italian explorer...  Did the Lakota call the land they lived on America? Oh they didn't?!!?!?! A'fucking'mazing! Neither did the Ojibwa, or the Potawatomi or the Iroquois or the Algonquin, or the Cherokee or Navajo, or the Comanche or the Kickapoo....no native population called the continent of North America, America. This is an undisputable fact.  And 25,000 years ago there were literally no human beings living on the continent that Europeans named North America. So again, facts getting in the way of your reality.  I have a suggestion where you can put that link...feel free to infer...	1642803579.0	htnrxed	t3_s9fw3i	t1_htnoujl	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9fw3i/longer_than_you_mitch/htnrxed/

Not sure what sort of tangent you’re going off on, but this article states fox changed its policy in response to the city’s mandate.  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/business/fox-vaccine-mandate.html  I don’t live in nyc, I don’t work at fox, and frankly I don’t give a shit about either one. But until anyone in here posts evidence to counter the article I posted, then I’m going to believe that this is just a gathering of liberals who are just looking for reasons to get upset.

6x3fvn9i	Wow, I thought the video was sped up cause that douche bags voice was so high pitched and whiny. Nope, just his normal voice and tone.   This bitch wouldn't know what to do with a platform if he had it. It's easy to criticize anyone in leadership positions, but Theodore Roosevelt said it best...  It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world.	1642833561.0	htpnx51	t3_s9hozr	t1_htntoag	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9hozr/is_this_going_to_be_all_they_got_for_the_next_3/htpnx51/

NYC last month mandate came into effect after Fox had their vax mandate for nearly 2 quarters. And 90% of their employees are vaxxed as their host question those vaccines and mandates.   Also Biden is a shit weasel whose good mandate was fucked over by the Supremecourt already.   Only change in Fox's mandate that happened was they removed the daily testing.

6jycn31n	First things first. Downvotes mean nothing to me because I only come here when redirected by a /pol/ thread. Second, you couldn't be more wrong. The reddit downvote system is specifically designed to encourage people to all think the same. It causes people to be influenced by what someone else thought of a comment without even giving it proper judgement. It also discourages people from going against the grain because a majority on this site absolutely care about upvotes. Human nature is that people want external validation, and that's exactly what the up/downvote system does.  In regard to my comment being mean spirited, it was meant as a reply to someone else, I just messed up submitting it, but more importantly, to hell with your feelings.	1642840661.0	htpyo92	t3_s9q0sn	t1_htpxwgv	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9q0sn/conservative_irony_not_funny_ha_ha_but_funny_sad/htpyo92/

6l4z3	All posts and comments that include any variation of the word retarded will be removed, but no action will be taken against your account unless it is an excessive personal attack. Please resubmit your post or comment without the bullying language.   Do not edit it, the bot cant tell if you edited, you will just have to make a new comment replying to the same thing.   Yes, this comment itself does use the word.  Any reasonable person should be able to understand that we are not insulting anyone with this comment. We wanted to use quotes, but that fucks up the automod and we are too lazy to google escape characters.  Notice how none of our automod replies have contractions in them either.   But seriously, calling someone retarded is only socially acceptable because the people affected are less able to understand that they are being insulted, and less likely to be able to respond appropriately.  It is a conversational wimpy little shit move, because everyone who uses it knows that it is offensive, but there will be no repercussions. At least the people throwing around other slurs know that they are going to get fired and get their asses beat when they use those words.   Also, it is not creative. It pretty much outs you as a thirteen year old when you use it. Instead of calling Biden retarded, you should call him a cartoon-ass-lookin trust fund goon who smiles like rich father just gifted him a new Buick in 1956.  Instead of calling Mitch Mcconnel retarded, you should call him a Dilbert-ass goon who has been left in the sun a little too long.   Sorry for the long message spamming comment sections, but this was by far the feature of this sub making people modmail and bitch at us the most, and literally all of the actions we take are to make it so we have to do less work in the future.  We will not reply to modmails about this automod, and ignore the part directly below this saying to modmail us if you have any questions, we cannot turn that off.  This reply is just a collation of the last year of modmail replies to people asking about this.  We are not turning this bot off, no matter how much people ask.  Nobody else has convinced us before, you will not be able to either. ~   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I get 3+ shots, wear 2+ masks, only pull the masks down to eat or drink and stay 3' away from others, I MAY not get covid. if I do get Covid though, I have a 99% chance of surviving it. And if I do all the above, I may or may not spread Covid. But, if I live in the UK, I don't have to follow all the science. Am I right so far? Tell me, if Fauci (the science) says put your right foot in and shake it all about, shall I do that too? And lastly, the science says this is slowing down. So when all is said and done, and it possibly disappears, and you've followed all the rules and took all the shots, and still got Covid.....what will you think?

41dltdvq	So far he has been. Our allies don't hate us. He isn't empowering tyrants. Biden deserves to be raked over the coals for his handling of his domestic policies, other than getting people vaccinated. He doesn't have brain damage or a personality disorder. He isn't abusing presidential power. He ended the war. Cut childhood poverty, expanded food stamps for the needy. Pretty normally shit for a president all in all but commendable nonetheless. Plus the economy is doing better. Although that's probably more about Covid than Biden. Other than that he's just another useless douche filling the void. But there's a big difference between a useless douche and someone doing active damage to the foundations of American life. Biden sucks pretty hard imo but he isn't a threat to our system of government or our way of life beyond apathy to it's problems. Again, not the same as actively damaging those systems. It seems to me the primary difference is that a very solid majority on the right is so partisan and disconnected from reality that they're incapable of assessing an individual on the merits of their performance or situations on the facts of that situation without having that partisanship taint their conclusions. They hate Biden because he is a Democrat. Not for what he's done. His approval ratings back that up. They've hated him since before he was in office and have never judged his performance on the merits since. I haven't liked Biden since before he was in office but I'm fully willing to commend the good things he's done. Same goes for Trump. I didn't like the guy but he was all bad. He did do a few good things. There were just far more bad. That right wing hate from the get go for Biden has flowed into every opinion they've formed since. You've got people on the right suggesting the public drink piss to cure Covid, thinking JFK is coming to save them, that there's some massive election scam when there's zero evidence for it. From a non policy perspective the right has fostered a culture of anger, intolerance, belligerence, authoritarianism, silence and irrationality. I don't agree with a lot either party does but when you weigh the metrics of each of there's no real comparison here. One is flat out insane and the other is just ineffective and annoying from time to time. I'm not saying there aren't nuts on the left or that they don't cause problems. But they aren't generally institutionalized into the power structures of the country or party. I don't generally need to worry about some BLM rioter seeking office and then being held up as some kind of hero. Being given financial backing from the countries power brokers or a national media spotlight with which to launch their insanity into office from. I don't need to worry about the Democratic party attempting a coup. The left is annoying at times. They sometimes go to far with their Covid bs and woke nonsense but their hearts are in the right place. That's a normal disagreement about policy. There just is no real comparison here. The actions and motivations for them are night and day.	1642892629.0	htsz4cu	t3_sa108o	t1_htryenw	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sa108o/liberals_sharing_unironically_lmao/htsz4cu/

Anyone could have wrote it. Just like the Russian dossier. The entire pretext to Russian collusion has been 100% confirmed to be fabricated. If you expect me to take it seriously then you're going to have to do better than allude to the fact that you still believe in an obvious lie like Russian collusion.	1642895175.0	htt593v	t3_s9hozr	t1_htt4nsj	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9hozr/is_this_going_to_be_all_they_got_for_the_next_3/htt593v/
9658r	If your opinion is anything but the official, confirmed report that the Russian dossier is fake then I would love to hear your opinion on the matter.

But Rodgers released that holier than though statement around “independent thought” and how he’s just a skeptic who wants to learn as much as he can. He made it a point to say he follows both anti-vax scientists ) as well as those who think “vaccines are the greatest thing ever. That’s rich. I find it funny that he had no problem rattling off several names of nutjobs that are anti vax but conveniently didn’t list any of the scientists or the papers he’s read that show csccines are safe and effective.

Regardless of where you stand, that was a win for conservatives. Funnily enough, Biden is currently building the wall. Our new justices slapped down Biden’s tyrannical vaccine mandates for businesses and federal workers. Big W. Hopefully they get Roe v Wade too. He showed how the media pumped out fake news. News outlets and social media intentionally mislead the public on the Covington kid for example. Bunch of liberals then practically wanted to lynch him. Another recent example is how the media and social media treated Rittenhouse. If you went by them then you’d believe that he mowed down an African American crowd. Thankfully he’s free and those pedos are dead. His policies resulted in the creation of 1.2 million domestic construction and manufacturing jobs. Additionally, his economic strategies $1.5 trillion being repatriated into the US from overseas. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is fucking up our inflation among many other things.  I also find it funny how despite having all this power right now, Dems can’t even pass progressive policies. In fact, progressives are losing ground at the courts. 2022 is looking to be a red tsunami, which will further impede progressives.

3snjwcij	So far those "conspiracy theorists" have called near everything that you never thought would be possible.  And believe me, they have done more research and pull from more sources than you.    I used to think they were off their rocker.  They said they would lock the country down, milk would be dumped, animals euthanized, and frickin toilet paper would be hogged of all things.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  And then it all happened and then some.  They even said which I began to support that they would demand proof of vaccination and that covid would require more than one shot because this wouldn't over until at least the end of 2022.  All the people who argued with me about the likelihood of vaccination have never argued with me again. That last thing about the end of 2022 remains to be seen but we're on track.  They're already talking about preparing for the next variant.  But you will fall in line and think it's best.  I just can't.  The lies are just too apparent for me.	1642977287.0	htxu0q0	t3_s8wtoo	t1_htuhxyv	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8wtoo/republican_congressman_needs_instructions_to_put/htxu0q0/

b2xjq8w8	Vaccinated & boosted people still get Covid.   You only have a 1-5% chance of being hospitalized form Covid per CDC and less than 2% chance of dying from Covid per CDC.   The odds of getting hospitalized and dying are so small already.   So without the vaccine you have a 95-99% chance of not being hospitalized and a 98.2% chance of not dying per CDC.  If you get vaccinated let say you get like 1% bump in protection against death so now 99% vs 98.2%. We know some vaccinated people have died so it’s not 100%.   Maybe it gives you 2-3% bump against hospitalization.   That’s pretty much it.   Vaccinated and boosted people still spread it. We are the most vaccinated we’ve ever been but cases are the highest.  The people really affected by Covid were the obese (3x more likely to end up in hospital) and the elderly.  Time to move on, we have a lot of shit to do and trying to force people to stay in despair over this is getting in the way of the work we need to do.	1642994303.0	htz0gf7	t3_sb994x	t1_htyul1y	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb994x/_/htz0gf7/

11gidr	I don’t understand the downvotes (then again it’s Reddit)  Ever since I could remember, where I live, Uncle Tom was considered a slur towards black men.  It was a racial based slur.  Maybe this guy is the scum of the earth, I’m not American so I don’t know and honesty can’t be bothered to look him up.  I’m just wondering if it’s wrong to use a racial slur,  are you allowed to use racial slur against bad people no matter their race?  If so, would it be better or worse towards the elimination (or limitation) of racism.

When people always assume you're pro-Trump, just because you are critical of Biden, you can see they have fallen for the 'them, vs 'us' bullshit the media have sold them - ironically, often whilst criticising people for believing Fox News - and proving Biden has failed on another thing, the "unity" the country needed. Tragic.	1643000021.0	htzcndz	t3_sb7vyz	t1_htzbuqp	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb7vyz/turning_a_tabloid_into_a_news_channel/htzcndz/
3mmq6	> A far simpler explanation is that Bernie ran as an outsider and wasn't even a member of the Democratic party until it was necessary.  We all should recognize the DNC and RNC have a stranglehold over a critical part of our government.  A functional, consensus-based government would not choose the candidates our process chooses.  Can we mutually agree that it's a dysfunctional process that doesn't lead to good governance, good policy or the effective promotion of laws that are adopted by consensus?  > But organizations like the DNC are made up of people and those people will invariably favor the people they know and who have put in the time. First time around that bias was pretty clear, not great, but hardly surprising. Second time around there were a lot more Bernie people in the party putting in the time and the DNC was a lot better.  I think "putting in the time" has a lot implied and not stated and Bernie Sanders has been advocating for working people for many decades.  Can you describe what "putting in the time" actually means to you?  > Didn't change that the bulk of the party and candidates weren't on the left wing of the party. Nothing about any of this is sinister and is pretty obvious if you have spent any time around any organizations decision making, it's politics.  You focus on the fact that Bernie was an outsider.  What quality of insiders among Democrat leadership should be esteemed? What are regular party members holding onto that only leadership can be trusted with?  I don't think an ineffective process that leads to terrible outcomes has to be "sinister" to persist.  At the same time, we as regular, unprivileged primary voters should be able to recognize the efforts to keep this process as dysfunctional and corrupted by campaign financing as possible aren't in the best interests of voters no matter what party or leadership says.  It's just common sense, isn't it?  So instead of recognizing Bernie's outsider status (he had caucused with Democrats practically his entire time in Congress) and how he wasn't a part of the campaign-finance leadership, we could be recognizing that Democrat leadership's cupboard was so bare of established and well-known leaders after the Clintons that this outsider had favored polling status among the general electorate.  The reason he had a shot was because Democrats had maintained a reputation for failure and an inability to hold corrupt executives accountable for at least two decades.	1643000464.0	htzdhan	t3_sb0qgj	t1_htz6md1	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb0qgj/wooderson/htzdhan/

And then perhaps we can select the one which actually delivers consensus instead of the campaign financing which leadership is beholden to.  So long as you continue carrying water for a cadre of failed leaders with a reputation for overlooking corruption and an inability to hold corrupt executives accountable, Democrats are not going to look much better than Republicans.

You only have a 1-5% chance of being hospitalized per CDC and less than 2% chance of dying from Covid per CDC.    The odds of getting hospitalized and dying are so small already.   So without the vaccine you have a 98.2% chance of living per CDC.  If you get vaccinated let say you get like 1% bump in protection against death so now 99% vs 98.2%. We know Vaccinated people have died so it’s not 100%.   Maybe it gives you 2-3% against hospitalization.   That’s pretty much it.   Vaccinated and boosted people still spread it. We are the most vaccinated we’ve ever been but cases are the highest.  The people really affected by Covid were the obese (3x more likely to end up in hospital) and the elderly.  Time to move on, we have a lot of shit to do and trying to force people to stay in despair over this is getting in the way of the work we need to do.	1643032433.0	hu0oa8f	t3_sb994x	t1_hu032n4	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb994x/_/hu0oa8f/

8c1dykp5	Idk if this is a Dem subreddit or not but I am a leftist, far from the center right where Biden is. Let me give my perspective.   I think Hunter Biden is a criminal too. Why do we let this slide by us: Hunter Biden had no experience whatsoever in Eastern European affairs or in the energy sector, and after VP Biden went to one of the most corrupt countries in the entire world (Ukraine, while claiming to be on an anti-corruption mission) his son ends up with a job in the Ukrainian energy sector, bringing home millions?  Everytime I bring this up to Dems, they brush it off as just a fluke or something (leftists I know think he's a criminal, especially non-Americans). The media went on about Trump who is undoubtedly a criminal, but barely covered the Hunter Biden story, and when they did they called it a conspiracy theory.   Well I wanna know how someone with no experience in Ukraine or energy made hundreds of thousands in a no-show position on an energy company. I wanna know why someone who never painted professionally is able to auction paintings of for thousands.  Do I want Trump and his kids tried for crimes? Absolutely. But I don't want us to pretend it's just Trump. There is some SERIOUS dirty laundry that needs to be aired out on the Democratic side. And whenever you say that you just get called a traitor or a Russian bot or a Bernie Bro.	1643040100.0	hu167iz	t3_sboprz	t3_sboprz	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sboprz/the_same_kids_who_he_put_in_office_that_are_being/hu167iz/

Let me guess, you would also be ok with terminating people who refused to get vaccinated.  I am sorry, killing a baby because you were too lazy to use birth control is sickening. Killing a baby at any age is murder. Sorry if that doesn’t fit your vocabulary, but I didn’t create the word murder. Don’t shoot the messenger (or kill the messenger).	1643055127.0	hu2abnp	t3_sbmqqk	t1_hu241vj	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sbmqqk/no_lies_detected/hu2abnp/

er9mtkfu	I think British common law disagrees. Murder is murder. Sorry if you made a mistake, forgot to take birth control, or feel your career is too important. Unless your child was from a virgin birth, you could have prevented the pregnancy, 100%. Instead, you seriously justify murder because it’s “your choice” and inconvenient to be accountable for your own actions (or lack thereof).	1643055412.0	hu2b2bo	t3_sbmqqk	t1_hu29jbf	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sbmqqk/no_lies_detected/hu2b2bo/

7uahh9xn	"that shit is right wingers in disguise" is literally the dumbest shit i've heard in a long time. Like, do you live in the US or have any liberal friends from the us? Cause they all participated in that shit. I live in seattle and had teachers that encouraged us to go out and protest. I had friends judge me because i didn't go to capital hill. Like why would you even say this? Do you even know you're talking out of your ass? I literally can't wrap my head around how fucking stupid what you said is.   And yeah like i said, conservatives don't protest often but when they do it's big and extremely disruptive, like how a good protest should be 👌. Like, why don't liberals storm the white house? I'd like to see that shit, targeting the actual problem, instead of burning down local small businessess. I got parents in Tacoma that couldn't go to their local cupcake shop and get cupcakes cause it was looted. There're no conservatives in tacoma! There're no conservatives in seattle! There're no conservatives in portland. Or st. Louis where my brother went to school, even there they were looting their local corner stores.   Im typing alot because what you said is seriously so fucking stupid. You really think it was a bunch of white christians or rednecks that were looting shit? God you're fucking dumb. Nah, my liberal friends who i love ❤️ and aren't ashamed of what they did, were the ones doing that shit and that's fine cause they take responsibility and stand firm against anyone who says what they did was wrong. That's admirable. What's not admirable is you here denying what happened. I have family members and friends who are conservative and who i love ❤️ who wanted to storm the capitol too. I respect them unlike you cause they never hid their intentions. My liberal friends posted themselves protesting and breaking shit and i respect that. Like i really dgaf if you think im stupid, im stupid. Im a dumbass. But i need you to know you're fucking dumb, and you talk out of your ass. I respect the first thing you said, the first thing you said is correct. Just don't say absolutely incorrect things again ok? There's nothing wrong with either side protesting, i simply prefer the conservative way of protesting alright?	1644884693.0	hwz2aoy	t3_srjt46	t1_hwwaaph	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/srjt46/how_the_turn_table_turns/hwz2aoy/

b1qwkgn1	Yes. your life has a exactly the same because the long term ramifications of Biden’s feckless policies have yet to happen.  Do you remember when Obama was President the news was full of images of ISIS chopping peoples heads off.  We had numerous terror attacks at Ft.Hood, the Boston marathon, San Bernardino, and the Pulse nightclub .  Not to mention the attacks in Europe.  Charlie lHebdo, the Paris nightclub, the Belgium airport and an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.  Did you see ANY of that under Trump? NO.  Because he wasn’t a politically correct pussy.  He went in and  destroyed ISIS in the first 8 months of his Presidency.  Biden has been President 1 year. He is allowing MILLIONS of people from 90countries just pour across the border.  Mark my words, we will start seeing the effect of Biden’s incompetence within 5 years and probably sooner if we don’t have WW III in Europe because of his weakness and incompetence.	1644896422.0	hwzqpwb	t3_ssr08d	t1_hwzo8qp	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/ssr08d/pure_insanity/hwzqpwb/

[Truckers attack ambulances and healthcare workers, while slowing them down.](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/ambulances-pelted-with-rocks-during-protest-health-workers-patients-face-added-stress-delays)  Reading the article, it looks like this is an isolated incident involving a single paramedic. This kind of behavior isn't acceptable, but this isolated event is far from representing the entire group of protestors.   >[US citizens flooding 911](https://globalnews.ca/news/8609284/ottawa-trucker-convoy-airport-disruptions/)  I heartily agree that this is inappropriate. In the article, it says that a *significant amount of calls that “almost jammed” the city’s 911 phone system*, so it seems like legitimate calls were still able to get through, but still... not cool.   >[Urinating on war memorial](https://metro.co.uk/2022/01/31/war-memorial-urinated-on-by-anti-vaxxers-as-canadian-police-launch-investigation-16018874/)  Also disrespectful and inappropriate. I'm having a hard time finding any details about this because all of the articles are coming from blogs and small outlets, but it's hard to imagine that such an underreported incident involves a significant portion of the 5,000 protestors.   >[Soup kitchen](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/convoy-truckers-canada-soup-kitchen-b2003765.html) Forgot they assaulted a security guard, too.  Another example where the behavior is inappropriate.  The article is locked behind registration, but the part that's available is vague about the details. I feel safe in assuming that this is another isolated event because it sounds like it's only happened once.   Overall, reviewing your sources, it's hard to argue that a protest consisting of 5,000 people that has lasted for two weeks is actually as disruptive and destructive as implied. Really the most disruptive thing that's been going on is just the traffic from so many vehicles that wouldn't normally be there	1644902634.0	hx024iy	t3_sspk38	t1_hwzvn78	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sspk38/ma_freeeeedumb/hx024iy/

You word vomited because you don’t have a point   I already addressed this possibility. IF your original message was not meant to mock BLM, then it’s even dumber. The entire sentence structure is meant to contrast the revolutionary war with the BLM movement. You are mocking one or the other. And if you aren’t, that is the proof that you are mentally deficient. What was your original point? You’re so fucking dumb, all you care about is getting people to react because you think that validates your existence. Spoilers.

Should we force everyone to get a yearly flu vaccine? Should we forcibly quarantine everyone with a communicable disease because some people are immunocompromised?   Should we ban people from driving cars because it’s an inherently dangerous activity that kills hundreds of thousands of people? Should we prohibit people from eating sushi because pathogens can’t always be detected?  Believe it or not, you do very dangerous things that put others at risk daily. Freedom means that we accept a level of risk. If you want to force people to get a literal injection, you don’t support the concept of freedom.

az4xgk	Conversely, the people supporting the blockades now are, coincidentally, the *exact* same people who were losing their shit during the BLM protests 2 years ago.  You know, the ones who went out of their way to dig into every facet of George Floyd's life, along with every other black person murdered extrajudicially, trying to bring up anything they could to justify the murder and explain why they had it coming.  The ones who were frothing at the mouth for the ex president to institute martial law, cheered when he told cops to beat protesters and were ecstatic when he promised to shoot looters.  Who saw unidentified military men shoving people into unmarked vans and thought it was great.  Who saw demonstrators outside the White House get shot with tear gas and rubber bullets because someone wanted a photo OP.  The ones who, after Boogaloo members Steven Carillo and Robert Justus murdered 2 police officers and injured 4 others to kick start a race war, decided to blame "BLM and Antifa." They were arrested in early June 2020, and yet by the RNC in August, Pence and and Trump were *still* claiming radical left activists at a Floyd protest were "terrorists" who carried this out.	1644918473.0	hx0nbbt	t3_sspk38	t1_hx0gewf	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sspk38/ma_freeeeedumb/hx0nbbt/
5ega173p	It’s not a theory, it’s actual conspiracy. The Clinton campaign engaged in actual espionage or at least paid for it to happen. Just because information was corroborated by those who sought for it to be, for 4 years…doesn’t make it true, namely the supplanted “evidence” Trump was a Russian operative. It’s not republicans investigating anything that the mainstream democratic media machine allows to be told. That’s not the case at all, binary affiliates are a minority in reality. Rather, there are decent and rational individuals at the justice department who are carefully proceeding and thoroughly aligning a proper case that in function and practice meets the standards leading to conclusivity, thus irrefutability.   A good analogy would be to find you have cancer after dropping everything to become a personal trainer. Just a because you thought a career as a physically fit and healthy model for others was destined, doesn’t relieve the possibility that one gets a cancer. Denial is fickle. The best we can manage as dedicated, decent, human beings is to  be honest. Always. No exceptions, or at least try to be open to all possibilities, but to stand up for what is known to be right given all other possibilities.

Like - why would you lie it didn't happen when it is so easy to prove you wrong - all it takes is less than a minute long google search, lol.  &#x200B;  And dunno dude, being black doesn't put your life in danger. Being a ghetto rat that doesn't know how to act (especially in front of police) can cause that, however. I honestly used to think that blacks were set back by the US system, but BLM really showed that it's also a lot about blacks refusing to take responsibility for their lives and their communities to make them better. But I guess it always is easier to blame everyone and everything else than take responsibility for their actions.     As for your edits - why are you lying about truckers being prepared to riot? They are peaceful people, protesting in peaceful manner. As for taking a test - why would they do that, when the same rule doesn't apply to vaccinated people? In regards to Omicron the vaccines have been proven to have little-to-no effect on the transmission of the virus.

iehyi7u1	Wait, I think you confused what you yourself assumed with what I assumed. At no point I said that everyone supported the violence.

iehyi7u1	Not sure what proof you are expecting as any internet comment I would link you would just get you to say "it's just one troll". Considering that there always are people who support both extremes of an argument, it is impossible that there wouldn't be people supporting the violence. Especially coming from a group that makes up \~14% of the population, yet account for 80% of the violent crimes.	1644933589.0	hx1ae7v	t3_sspk38	t1_hx19423	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sspk38/ma_freeeeedumb/hx1ae7v/

39fir	Ah yes it's the truckers fault that the medical system is in shambles. I would love to see how you connect those dots.    ------------  This has been fascinating to watch. I'm old enough to have seen the left and right fight over the propaganda controls and have seen it when both are in control of them.   Most just go along with the government programming. It used to be right wing talking points were all you could see and most people just repeated them and when they didn't make sense they would just stare and not talk and then  repeat them again. I fought hard against that decades ago. Now it is the same thing but it is leftist marxism being spouted and the exact same people are eating it up. Amazing to see. Doesn't exactly give me hope for the future.   I used to think that all the left wing free speech and freedom protests and political groups would usher in a society where people are judged by the content of their character and not their race, creed, religion or similar. I was dead wrong as we have all learned. The left just decided that since they have the power they will use it just as unethically as the right. I really believed they would take the high road but I was foolish to say the least.   The pendulum swings back and forth. The right really pushed it their way, and now the left has it and is going even further in their own direction. Like they think they can have some sort of "final victory" where half the population never gets to speak again and are totally barred from having any political input or representation in any way shape, or form. That should end well. I mean it is at a point where the left wing is regularly calling for violence and death even to children. They are already saying if trucker kids are killed it is their own fault.	1645027840.0	hx6roj4	t3_stltd8	t1_hx61dag	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/stltd8/period/hx6roj4/
h35zzw1z	Yeah well it’s also been about common sense - if my kid is sick I keep them home and have homework sent home by teacher via email or classmate.  I don’t develop untested vaccines and force kids to get them, make the whole class mask up with 4 N95s on their face and plexiglass shield all the desks.  Nor did the teachers walk out, refuse to teach until they got more money for their pensions, upgrade the school ducting to hospital grade bio filtration and then have those very same teachers refuse to get vaccinated, but insist that every child does- before returning(looking at you LA Unified).  At some point OP is right there was a common sense tradeoff, but now it’s about crazy knee jerk reactions, union/woke folk controlling policy and refusing to let go	1645027870.0	hx6rrbs	t3_stltd8	t3_stltd8	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/stltd8/period/hx6rrbs/
39fir	None of this was a problem until a lab created viral pandemic started and we had to roll out a vaccine with radically reduced testing requirements. Unless you really believe drugs normally are only tested for 56 days like this class of vaccines was.   Johnson and Johnson, one of these companies we should clearly trust blindly since they are a corpo-pharma group, was just forced to no longer sell regular talc baby powder. Why? Because they knew for the last 20 years it was full of asbestos.    This was in the last few months. Why is it not bigger news? I suspect it is because they make vaccines and they would rather people not think about it.	1645028105.0	hx6sdpi	t3_stltd8	t1_hx63glj	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/stltd8/period/hx6sdpi/
