The walk is because all of your makeup, filters, slim waist pants, angles and what not that make girls that aren't hot look hot in pictures. Among my friends, anyone who is "worth dating" wouldn't take a random girl from a dating app straight to a fancy restaurant. Really, I advice you to reconsider this position and accept that a quality guy who wants to take you on a date will want to see you IRL first. Otherwise, you should expect to be dating below your own standard.	1640885038.0	hqkhg5m	t3_rs5nro	t1_hqkdlqj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqkhg5m/

hj6penur	I've been reading it too and it's amazing! Especially that you can find out many celebrities and people in your life who use those laws.   One of my favourite laws is conceal your intentions and I think you can apply it to FDS. It's better to not be open and direct about your FDS ideology and feminist beliefs. Sharing them and showing off how you don't need any men can be dangerous. People don't like being called out on their misogyny and LVM and pickmes will try to show you "your place".	1640890356.0	hqkvipm	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqjkosb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqkvipm/

fmxwzjyb	Wow you definitely did the right thing. Any man who can't understand a lone woman locking their door in this situation isn't living fully in reality. His immediate aggression is an obvious sign he was up to no good. I've been the man in situations like that and my immediate response was to communicate the situation without aggression if it was important enough and to make sure i was being as nonthreatening as possible. Cuz I'm 200+ pounds and bearded i already look crazy üòÜ in any case just to add to the tip about the window. Don't roll it down even a crack. Once closed it creates a sort of seal that strengthens the integrity of the glass.

hys5kov9	I‚Äôm new to Reddit. I was seeking out feminist subreddits and saw FDS being bashed as being extremist, so of course, being curious, I had to see for myself. Far from seeing hate-filled discourse, I was pleasantly surprised to find like-minded women, taking back their power and creating a space for themselves in an oppressive and misogynistic online world.   I‚Äôm not dating, so at first I questioned whether I should even be here but I‚Äôm so encouraged to see women here knowing and respecting their worth, it has ignited a small flame in my heart. In the short time I‚Äôve been participating in this group, I‚Äôve learned concepts and language for things that I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate in my entire 57 years of life.   Someone on here recommended the book ‚ÄúHow He Gets into Her Head‚Äù. I grew up in the context of a family where DV occurred. I questioned why my mother stayed and settled upon lack of financial resources and social supports (it was the 70‚Äôs) as being the reasons. I never really understood what psychological processes might be going on. I‚Äôm 4 chapters into the book and light bulbs have been going off over my head like crazy.   I learned term ‚Äúp0rn sick‚Äù here in FDS. I‚Äôll be forever grateful for learning a term and defining a concept for something I‚Äôve been grappling with ever since I was exposed to p0rn0graphy as a young child when my father‚Äôs Pl@yBoy  magazines were kept in stack in the bathroom. Even as a young child, I felt a sense of shame and devaluation that was something I couldn‚Äôt define in words.   I‚Äôve been learning other concepts here and re-examining my life choices in light of them. Probably not a lot I can change about some circumstances in my life at this point, but I can change my mindset. I can also pass on knowledge to my daughter and my female co-workers.   I‚Äôm grateful for FDS and the work the moderators do to keep this a protected space. üôè	1641158370.0	hqzgxmg	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqzgxmg/

cy48uble	I‚Äôm 23 and I recently dated a 28 year old man and then a 31 year old man for very brief periods of time. I realize that the age gaps are not extremely socially taboo, but it felt quite significant to me at the time and since they were the first ‚Äúolder‚Äù men I explored. Since cutting them off and finding FDS, I‚Äôve decided from now on I‚Äôm not going to date someone more than 3-4 years older than me, at least until I‚Äôm a little older myself. I don‚Äôt know why young women are taught ‚Äúolder automatically = better‚Äù when it comes to men when in reality I think it should be treated at the very least as an automatic drawback, if not a dealbreaker entirely. The types of men who date significantly younger women are not actually more mature, but instead using these kinds of relationships as an excuse to get way with being emotionally immature. It is burdensome and exhausting to be dating someone using you to feel ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, and that feeling is even more exacerbated if the younger woman feels some psychological need to prove that she‚Äôs ‚Äúmature‚Äù. When I dated these guys, I was fresh out fo college and felt like I was constantly struggling to establish myself as an adult in society for the first time, but meanwhile these older men seemed to give themselves permission to be childish just because they had a younger woman by their side. They never gave me any of the so-called mentorship and guidance that society told us that older men can allegedly give you, and honestly speaking were not that much more mature/intelligent/generous compared to the younger men I had dated (in fact, they were probably the dumbest ones). If you want real mentorship, just find older women you admire and seek them out, there is just no real need or automatic benefit to dating men older than you.	1641173765.0	hr0j7zw	t3_rul2wn	t3_rul2wn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr0j7zw/

5u126usi	I dated this avoidant man on and off for 7 years. He would come back into my life, things would be amazing, then as soon as I started putting in the effort and showing my feelings he would pull away. Never ghost, but would get distant. Would take forever to reply, didn‚Äôt get me direct answers, and wouldn‚Äôt really commit to plans. I‚Äôm not am anxiously attached person, but this gave me soooo much anxiety.   After not seeing this man for 2 years, I run into him again this past summer and I truly thought he had matured. He texted back enthusiastically, initiated conversations, liked my social media posts, and even planned actual dates.   Then there suddenly was a shift, I tried to plan a weekend with him and he cancelled last minute because of work. Then every time after that, whenever I tried to make plans, he was very noncommittal. I asked if he was still interested, he said yes. But I was still so anxious.   Anyways, a few weeks ago, I realized enough is enough. I shouldn‚Äôt feel this confused or anxious about a man. This many negative feelings is not healthy in any relationship. So I point blank told him I noticed his actions weren‚Äôt matching his words, and that I was confused. He was quick to text back. I asked what his intentions were, and made mine clear. That after 7 years, if we‚Äôre going to see each other then we need to actually date and work towards a relationship. He told me he just wants to hang out when it‚Äôs convenient. So in the first time in 7 years, I told him we should stop seeing each other. Every other time, he got avoidant and left, only to come back into my life when he felt like it.   What I learned, is to be really direct and upfront right off the jump. If you clearly state that you are dating for a relationship, and not casual sex, then I‚Äôm sure an avaoidant man will leave then. However, when we don‚Äôt share our expectations it leads to disappointment and painful months of being breadcrumbed and strung along by avoidant men. Plus it just hurts way more in the end.	1641181781.0	hr120bz	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr120bz/

I am A Wife. And, not altogether incidentally, I am a mother.  Not too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the scene fresh from a recent divorce. He had one child, who is, of course, with his ex-wife. He is obviously looking for another wife. As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that I, too, would like to have a wife. Why do I want a wife?  I would like to go back to school so that I can become economically independent, support myself, and, if need be, support those dependent upon me. I want a wife who will work and send me to school. And while I am going to school I want a wife to take care of my children. I want a wife to keep track of the children‚Äôs doctor and dentist appointments. And to keep track of mine, too. I want a wife to make sure my children eat properly and are kept clean. I want a wife who will wash the children‚Äôs clothes and keep them mended. I want a wife who is a good nurturant attendant to my children, who arranges for their schooling, makes sure that they have an adequate social life with their peers, takes them to the park, the zoo, etc. I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school. My wife must arrange to lose time at work and not lose the job. It may mean a small cut in my wife‚Äôs income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate that. Needless to say, my wife will arrange and pay for the care of the children while my wife is working.  I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean. A wife who will pick up after me. I want a wife who will keep my clothes clean, ironed, mended, replaced when need be, and who will see to it that my personal things are kept in their proper place so that I can find what I need the minute I need it. I want a wife who cooks the meals, a wife who is a good cook. I want a wife who will plan the menus, do the necessary grocery shopping, prepare the meals, serve them pleasantly, and then do the cleaning up while I do my studying. I want a wife who will care for me when I am sick and sympathize with my pain and loss of time from school. I want a wife to go along when our family takes a vacation so that someone can continue to care for me and my children when I need a rest and change of scene.  I want a wife who will not bother me with rambling complaints about a wife‚Äôs duties. But I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies. And I want a wife who will type my papers for me when I have written them.  I want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life. When my wife and I are invited out by my friends, I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements. When I meet people at school that I like and want to entertain, I want a wife who will have the house clean, will prepare a special meal, serve it to me and my friends, and not interrupt when I talk about things that interest me and my friends. I want a wife who will have arranged that the children are fed and ready for bed before my guests arrive so that the children do not bother us.  And I want a wife who knows that sometimes I need a night out by myself.  I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it, a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied. And, of course, I want a wife who will not demand sexual attention when I am not in the mood for it. I want a wife who assumes the complete responsibility for birth control, because I do not want more children. I want a wife who will remain sexually faithful to me so that I do not have to clutter up my intellectual life with jealousies. And I want a wife who understands that my sexual needs may entail more than strict adherence to monogamy. I must, after all, be able to relate to people as fully as possible.  If, by chance, I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life; my wife will take the children and be solely responsible for them so that I am left free.  When I am through with school and have a job, I want my wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife‚Äôs duties.  My God, who wouldn‚Äôt want a wife?	1642532102.0	ht7n3na	t3_s6wu1r	t1_ht7ktn3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6wu1r/we_dont_do_that_no_more/ht7n3na/

There is no other explanation. No one deserves to be caused harm deliberately, regardless of the circumstances. I would also argue the hot sauce was chosen to humiliate her, or ‚Äúteach her a lesson.‚Äù Baby trapping is horrible, but even if she had succeeded, Drake wouldn‚Äôt have suffered physically for it. That‚Äôs a big difference. Also, condoms aren‚Äôt even 100% effective. So idk where Drake gets off on being Mr. Responsible. He obviously hates the women he has sex with, and overestimates his grandeur, importance and value as an individual human being.	1642540142.0	ht88xsf	t3_s6j7kx	t1_ht5oiqm	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6j7kx/can_we_talk_about_drakes_hot_sauce_condom_incident/ht88xsf/

61vs699a	I would advise that you be a little more kind to your friends. Rejection hurts, especially if it's from someone they know in their hearts is not worthy of their time. Internalized misogyny creates these problems, and frustration (while natural) won't loosen the hold it has on women.    It's true that it's "not all men", but you can say that it's MOST men. If someone says "not all men" ask, "What men have you known that haven't done these things?"    Ultimately I think we all need to be nicer to one another. There is no way we can convince women to give up toxic men when their female acquaintances are just as toxic, sometimes more so. Even in this subreddit we are quick to label people (look at my flair) as bad when they've said one thing out of line without acknowledging the countless other things they've said and done that perfectly mirror what we all want.    Women turn to abusive relationships (and I believe "not all" but MOST heterosexual relationships are abusive, or exploitive at best) because they're searching for something: companionship, validation, security, etc. We need to ask ourselves what we're doing to build each other up. Men will promote, befriend, buddy up with the lowest of the low and make excuses for them, but here we are shaming women who WE feel should know better.    We've ALL been "pickmes" at some point. You said yourself that you sure were. Maybe ridicule and derision worked to bring you around, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. We all need to try showing women how we're SUPPOSED to be talked to and treated (imo being called names in what's supposed to be a "safe space" by women who are supposed to help lift you up is counterproductive) so that women who are still in a vulnerable state don't fall through the cracks and lose hope at finding someone that values them.    Just my two cents ...	1643186620.0	hu9sx3v	t3_sd0uw1	t3_sd0uw1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sd0uw1/my_friends_keep_telling_me_not_all_men/hu9sx3v/

I want to make it very clear that I love FDS, and I pledge my allegiance to them and all that, cross heart, hope to die, but it's not the nicest space. We don't owe MEN any accomodations, but we should definitely be nice to one another.    If I could change one thing about this sub it would be that we gently guided and corrected people who showed a genuine desire to be here. Some of us use our real names, accounts, professions, etc to bring awareness, and some of us are hesitant to speak out. Every woman should feel safe here.    In an ideal world a pickmeisha would be someone that needs extra care.

So we're degrading women? How is this different than using any other slur? We literally defend "good" men more than we champion damaged women!    Men are out there finessing girls left and right, telling vulnerable people what they want to hear. We're sat in this echo chamber patting ourselves on the back because we're "better" than that. We're just as vicious and unbending as the worst of men, and it's not a good look.    We can do better! We know the struggle, and we know how to show compassion. It's what makes us better.

Plus, knowledge can be searched for - google, duckduckgo, books or whatever you prefer - and be learned. >!Don't even scoff at wikipedia, the articles about medication there are top-notch and easier to read than that leaflet in the package - at least in my native language where those leaflets look like they're designed to confuse the heck out of anyone below a 150 IQ by burying the info they're looking for under whole mountains of info they're most definitely not looking for. Also, many of the medical articles (including physiology and anatomy) are much better quality than what you find in specialist literature. (Been there, done that - I work in health care, too!)

Six months should be more than enough time to pick up on something like this.   He was out of line for sending that expect nothing.   Sounds like there were other issues tbh. Asking someone what they want as a present.. not entirely a red flag, just kind of means you haven‚Äôt been paying attention to their interests or needs.   So. In conclusion, over reaction? Just depends on what was made known. If he knew: then no. You did not over react. If he did not know(which he should have after six months) then yeah just a little.   Sounds like you made the right decision though.	1643373222.0	hukp7xd	t3_seg6ai	t3_seg6ai	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/seg6ai/i_dumped_the_guy_i_was_vetting_over_the_birthday/hukp7xd/
j3qz5rhy	So, a "lurking Scrotum" here. I'll admit. This is a test, and I don't even think my reply will be posted. That's okay. It really shows how close minded and truly ignorant you ladies are; which is as I expect. Because many red pills are that same way about¬†ladies.  I'm not going to weigh-in on any of you ladies opinions. Or your thoughts on the male side of the race. I'm only going to share my personal life experience. You ladies can do what ever you'd like with it. Censor and ban it I suspect.  I'm a Divorced Father of 2 girls.  I am a combat veteran.  I have 2 college degrees and I am working on my masters; no, none of the degrees are english majors, or (soft majors)  I am almost 40 and I am in the best shape of my life. About to have a 6 pack and I'm not talking about the ones purchased in a liquor store.  I am 6'1 and routinely practice Jujitsu with my daughters and am an Avid Obstacle Course Racer.  The above is not me bragging; Although I am sure it will be taken that way. These are just facts about my life.  6 years ago my wife of 9 years wanted a divorce. I had spent my 20s supporting her and my first daughter while I went to college.  Why was she pregnant in college you ask? Because she changed/stopped using birth control without telling me.  Not that it Mattered. ( It actually really does)  However, I was certain the child was of my linage and I had no problems caring for my family.  But after 9 years and 2 kids my wife was done. And to be fair to her. Our relationship was really unhealthy. While I never touched her, the amount of screaming and rude words and actions that both of us visited upon the other were unacceptable.  In the 6 months leading up to our divorce I pleaded with her to attend marriage counseling with me; too little too late. She never did and I attended them alone.  On October 25 2015. My former spouse with the help of her Girlfriend..who was also an ex of mine. With her help my former wife Filed Domestic violence charges on me. 8 police officers armed with low grade civillian M-16s or AR-15s surrounded my home. I was¬†arrested in front of my children.  Of I course fought the charges. But domestic Violence laws don't just apply to actually hitting a female. (As the name of the laws Presume)  See, I slammed a door, I yelled And I am a combat veteran. That is all the evidence they needed.  (no, that behavior was not okay. Nor was hers. Why was I the only one arrested)? I had not hurt anyone.  I was stripped of my freedoms. (Yes I was jailed). I was stripped of my family, and I was forbidden to return to my own home.  The fact that a divorce hearing happened to be going on concurrently with a criminal D.V. case didn't even give the courts Pause.  I was declared a danger to my children and was stripped of all legal authority over them; Along with any rights to see them. At the same time I was orders to pay child support. Oh, and My veterans disability... That was considered "income". To which As of¬†this moment 6 years later has helped to pay almost 30,000 dollars in child support.  I didn't survive hell in the cradle of life just so a Feminist Tyrannical government could steal my family and call it justice. After roughly $20,000-$30,000 in court ordered therapy and lawyers. I have almost half custody of Both my little girls. (so much¬†for me being a danger)   Now, all of you ladies can talk all the trash you like about how "the system is broken" and How "I don't deserve my kids back".. especially if all I have to do is pay money. You might even be right.  But you know who does really love that I'm back...Both of my daughters. Every time they are over here.  As my older one is going through the trials of puberty. I am explaining the male mind to her. I am showing her evolutionary Psychology and how it frames the decisions of both genders.  But most importantly I show her All the damage that her selfish mother has done by her behavior. I show my daughters how much I love them and how important they are. And both of my girls see it.  They see it because, I serve my daughters. Much like I served their mother..Almost hand and foot. However, Yes I also teach them that they should submit to the man because he is the leader, A servant leader. Most people outside the military have never seen¬†one of those. So it wouldn't surprise me if none of you know or care what that is.  Now to the delusional point made by the O.P.  You can try and emasculate me or insult me all you'd like. But all your insults will fall short.  I have "Struggled" through a life that has proven every snarl you could spit is a lie.  Did I really think that my wife would struggle with me..help me improve our lives together? Yes I did. Was that foolish of me? Yes, it was.  But here is the funny part. It is my desire to "Struggle" and grow that has lead my life to where it is now, A much better place.  Sadly, While my former spouse has remarried and is doing very well with money. She is miserable and is physically deteriorating more as the years pass. What's more our Daughters see it.  Meanwhile.. now that she is gone and I have FULL CONTROL over the situation..my life is slowly...improving again.  But I won't date any woman that isn't interested in growing with me and improving herself on her own also...and As of this moment, I am still single. And I am liking it more as time passes.  You ladies can have your field day with my post.. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.  You Sub is a boon to my point as well. As my older daughter has read some of the horrible posts that many of you women put on here about men.  She is really starting to understand her Dad's view point. So Thank you for the help ladies and keep proving me right.  Have a wonderful Morning. üëç And do try to be a little happier and better each day   -D0rqfish.	1643376354.0	hukv486	t3_semvji	t3_semvji	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/semvji/beware_of_stable_families_who_will_judge_you_for/hukv486/

co5d6zd0	Stocks, especially penny stocks which is what I‚Äôm assuming he lost 40k+ on in a year, is a wet dream for a gambling addict. So many middle-aged men in America think they can do it with absolutely no experience in stocks or business. They can do it right from their smartphone. They think it‚Äôs a get-rich-quick thing whenever it‚Äôs really not and never will be. If they want to be a stock broker then they should get certified and do that as a career instead of trading from their moms basement until they lose all their $. I will never ever support someone like that as a life partner.

What a weird degrading thing to do to make it seem like you have the power in the relationship. He did a nice gesture and you escalated to the point of breaking up instead of politely letting him know.

dx4ibx8	I can resonate with this so much. My ex broke up with me last year out of the blue (to me, he had been apparently thinking about it for months), no communication, just withdrew and said he didn't love me anymore a few weeks later after we were online ring shopping (red flag). We had to live together for six months after that since we were both out of state from other family/friends we knew at the time, and he was on the lease (never repeating that mistake again). As time went on he broke every roommate guideline we set multiple times, and in general just became a total asshole. It eventually came out he had left me for his coworker, and most likely cheated on me, which obviously made things worse between us as everything he had told me about us and the breakup was a pure lie. I knew it was her from the beginning, and he just lied and manipulated and gaslit the shit out of me. I could go on, that bastard really went out of his way to be a scumbag, and it took me months to nearly a year to heal from it. Before the breakup, we had a really good relationship, never really argued and were able to settle disagreements well...it was a complete 180 degree shift after the breakup.	1643388347.0	hulos4f	t3_sern3y	t3_sern3y	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sern3y/if_you_wanna_see_a_mans_true_character_break_up/hulos4f/
6svrahm	True, it was like a switch got flipped with my ex too. I had always known him to lie about little things, saying he had plans to get out of going to some family event for example, but suddenly he was lying about very major things, telling people I had a 3 year long affair, had tricked him into conceiving our daughter, was abusive to our kids, etc. I was shocked that he could say these things about me after we'd spent 10 years together. He was trying to justify ending the marriage instead of just admitting he'd fallen for somebody else. That divorce was so traumatic because I felt like I was constantly having to defend myself. I had PTSD symptoms, always on edge. It didn't have to be that way. If he had just been honest I would have let him go and we could have had a peaceful divorce. Instead he had to make my like a living hell, as if I was the one who had ended things.	1643390336.0	hulu5p2	t3_sern3y	t3_sern3y	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sern3y/if_you_wanna_see_a_mans_true_character_break_up/hulu5p2/

ekaxgf7k	I‚Äôm not originally from the south but I‚Äôve lived here for the last 10+ years. The country I grew up in men would creepily call women ‚Äúbaby‚Äù flirting with and catcalling them, so right off the bat I didn‚Äôt have good first experiences with pet names. Then during one of my relationships my ex would call me a multitude of pet names. I honestly hated all of them, they made me cringe and I just wanted to be called my name. I was always ‚Äúnitpicking everything he did‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt even bother to try to get him to stop. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we like it, it only matters that they do‚Ä¶evidently. Since then I‚Äôve only hated pet names more. Here in the south it‚Äôs not too bad for me, but I also think I might be a little desensitize to it now. I don‚Äôt mind women doing it because it‚Äôs not creepy. And I‚Äôve had guys use it in a patronizing way when trying to correct me üôÑ THE worst. ‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶bb‚Ä¶sweetie, that‚Äôs etc etc.‚Äù Oh then they deny it ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a pet name.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if I would ever be ok with pet names for me in a relationship.	1643400648.0	humltl0	t3_seuhhm	t3_seuhhm	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/seuhhm/what_do_you_all_think_about_familiarities_i/humltl0/
