6y3loc6r	Yes. I recently moved to a new apartment and my neighbors (who are a couple that live together) met me while I looked like trash‚Äî no makeup, hair in a bun, sweatpants. They were super nice and invited me out for drinks a week later and I showed up looking completely different‚Äî I wore a nice outfit, did my makeup, etc.   The girlfriend kept giving me weird looks the entire night, and the boyfriend ended up making a fake Snapchat the next day and trying to cheat on her with me.   Now I don‚Äôt take to any of them, and they unfortunately still live right next to me.

xvt62lr	 I hate to say this happens in the reverse too.  My bf works with mostly women and is generally a really good conversationalist, and mywe women love to vent (I joke he‚Äôs like the hairdresser of his school).  He‚Äôs had a few women mistake him engaging in convo with them for being interested when he‚Äôs really just being polite.

hys5kov9	I‚Äôm new to Reddit. I was seeking out feminist subreddits and saw FDS being bashed as being extremist, so of course, being curious, I had to see for myself. Far from seeing hate-filled discourse, I was pleasantly surprised to find like-minded women, taking back their power and creating a space for themselves in an oppressive and misogynistic online world.   I‚Äôm not dating, so at first I questioned whether I should even be here but I‚Äôm so encouraged to see women here knowing and respecting their worth, it has ignited a small flame in my heart. In the short time I‚Äôve been participating in this group, I‚Äôve learned concepts and language for things that I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate in my entire 57 years of life.   Someone on here recommended the book ‚ÄúHow He Gets into Her Head‚Äù. I grew up in the context of a family where DV occurred. I questioned why my mother stayed and settled upon lack of financial resources and social supports (it was the 70‚Äôs) as being the reasons. I never really understood what psychological processes might be going on. I‚Äôm 4 chapters into the book and light bulbs have been going off over my head like crazy.   I learned term ‚Äúp0rn sick‚Äù here in FDS. I‚Äôll be forever grateful for learning a term and defining a concept for something I‚Äôve been grappling with ever since I was exposed to p0rn0graphy as a young child when my father‚Äôs Pl@yBoy  magazines were kept in stack in the bathroom. Even as a young child, I felt a sense of shame and devaluation that was something I couldn‚Äôt define in words.   I‚Äôve been learning other concepts here and re-examining my life choices in light of them. Probably not a lot I can change about some circumstances in my life at this point, but I can change my mindset. I can also pass on knowledge to my daughter and my female co-workers.   I‚Äôm grateful for FDS and the work the moderators do to keep this a protected space. üôè	1641158370.0	hqzgxmg	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqzgxmg/

cy48uble	I‚Äôm 23 and I recently dated a 28 year old man and then a 31 year old man for very brief periods of time. I realize that the age gaps are not extremely socially taboo, but it felt quite significant to me at the time and since they were the first ‚Äúolder‚Äù men I explored. Since cutting them off and finding FDS, I‚Äôve decided from now on I‚Äôm not going to date someone more than 3-4 years older than me, at least until I‚Äôm a little older myself. I don‚Äôt know why young women are taught ‚Äúolder automatically = better‚Äù when it comes to men when in reality I think it should be treated at the very least as an automatic drawback, if not a dealbreaker entirely. The types of men who date significantly younger women are not actually more mature, but instead using these kinds of relationships as an excuse to get way with being emotionally immature. It is burdensome and exhausting to be dating someone using you to feel ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, and that feeling is even more exacerbated if the younger woman feels some psychological need to prove that she‚Äôs ‚Äúmature‚Äù. When I dated these guys, I was fresh out fo college and felt like I was constantly struggling to establish myself as an adult in society for the first time, but meanwhile these older men seemed to give themselves permission to be childish just because they had a younger woman by their side. They never gave me any of the so-called mentorship and guidance that society told us that older men can allegedly give you, and honestly speaking were not that much more mature/intelligent/generous compared to the younger men I had dated (in fact, they were probably the dumbest ones). If you want real mentorship, just find older women you admire and seek them out, there is just no real need or automatic benefit to dating men older than you.	1641173765.0	hr0j7zw	t3_rul2wn	t3_rul2wn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr0j7zw/

5u126usi	I dated this avoidant man on and off for 7 years. He would come back into my life, things would be amazing, then as soon as I started putting in the effort and showing my feelings he would pull away. Never ghost, but would get distant. Would take forever to reply, didn‚Äôt get me direct answers, and wouldn‚Äôt really commit to plans. I‚Äôm not am anxiously attached person, but this gave me soooo much anxiety.   After not seeing this man for 2 years, I run into him again this past summer and I truly thought he had matured. He texted back enthusiastically, initiated conversations, liked my social media posts, and even planned actual dates.   Then there suddenly was a shift, I tried to plan a weekend with him and he cancelled last minute because of work. Then every time after that, whenever I tried to make plans, he was very noncommittal. I asked if he was still interested, he said yes. But I was still so anxious.   Anyways, a few weeks ago, I realized enough is enough. I shouldn‚Äôt feel this confused or anxious about a man. This many negative feelings is not healthy in any relationship. So I point blank told him I noticed his actions weren‚Äôt matching his words, and that I was confused. He was quick to text back. I asked what his intentions were, and made mine clear. That after 7 years, if we‚Äôre going to see each other then we need to actually date and work towards a relationship. He told me he just wants to hang out when it‚Äôs convenient. So in the first time in 7 years, I told him we should stop seeing each other. Every other time, he got avoidant and left, only to come back into my life when he felt like it.   What I learned, is to be really direct and upfront right off the jump. If you clearly state that you are dating for a relationship, and not casual sex, then I‚Äôm sure an avaoidant man will leave then. However, when we don‚Äôt share our expectations it leads to disappointment and painful months of being breadcrumbed and strung along by avoidant men. Plus it just hurts way more in the end.	1641181781.0	hr120bz	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr120bz/

I am A Wife. And, not altogether incidentally, I am a mother.  Not too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the scene fresh from a recent divorce. He had one child, who is, of course, with his ex-wife. He is obviously looking for another wife. As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that I, too, would like to have a wife. Why do I want a wife?  I would like to go back to school so that I can become economically independent, support myself, and, if need be, support those dependent upon me. I want a wife who will work and send me to school. And while I am going to school I want a wife to take care of my children. I want a wife to keep track of the children‚Äôs doctor and dentist appointments. And to keep track of mine, too. I want a wife to make sure my children eat properly and are kept clean. I want a wife who will wash the children‚Äôs clothes and keep them mended. I want a wife who is a good nurturant attendant to my children, who arranges for their schooling, makes sure that they have an adequate social life with their peers, takes them to the park, the zoo, etc. I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school. My wife must arrange to lose time at work and not lose the job. It may mean a small cut in my wife‚Äôs income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate that. Needless to say, my wife will arrange and pay for the care of the children while my wife is working.  I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean. A wife who will pick up after me. I want a wife who will keep my clothes clean, ironed, mended, replaced when need be, and who will see to it that my personal things are kept in their proper place so that I can find what I need the minute I need it. I want a wife who cooks the meals, a wife who is a good cook. I want a wife who will plan the menus, do the necessary grocery shopping, prepare the meals, serve them pleasantly, and then do the cleaning up while I do my studying. I want a wife who will care for me when I am sick and sympathize with my pain and loss of time from school. I want a wife to go along when our family takes a vacation so that someone can continue to care for me and my children when I need a rest and change of scene.  I want a wife who will not bother me with rambling complaints about a wife‚Äôs duties. But I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies. And I want a wife who will type my papers for me when I have written them.  I want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life. When my wife and I are invited out by my friends, I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements. When I meet people at school that I like and want to entertain, I want a wife who will have the house clean, will prepare a special meal, serve it to me and my friends, and not interrupt when I talk about things that interest me and my friends. I want a wife who will have arranged that the children are fed and ready for bed before my guests arrive so that the children do not bother us.  And I want a wife who knows that sometimes I need a night out by myself.  I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it, a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied. And, of course, I want a wife who will not demand sexual attention when I am not in the mood for it. I want a wife who assumes the complete responsibility for birth control, because I do not want more children. I want a wife who will remain sexually faithful to me so that I do not have to clutter up my intellectual life with jealousies. And I want a wife who understands that my sexual needs may entail more than strict adherence to monogamy. I must, after all, be able to relate to people as fully as possible.  If, by chance, I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life; my wife will take the children and be solely responsible for them so that I am left free.  When I am through with school and have a job, I want my wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife‚Äôs duties.  My God, who wouldn‚Äôt want a wife?	1642532102.0	ht7n3na	t3_s6wu1r	t1_ht7ktn3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6wu1r/we_dont_do_that_no_more/ht7n3na/
3bii2bnm	Yes THANKYOU   And a reminder: FDS is not here to coddle Pickmeisha‚Äôs who shit on other women.  This isn‚Äôt Side Plate support club.  Here to coddle women that knowingly sleep with taken men & make a million excuses for it. And put other women at risk to psychological damage & STIs.  Pickmeisha‚Äôs need to get out of scarcity mode trying to fight other women for their chance to be clowned by some regular cheat.  Mental health problems and low self esteem aren‚Äôt an excuse to shit on other women either.  Your esteem & mental health is your responsibility to handle.   This is ‚Äòget your shit together & don‚Äôt be stupid‚Äô zone.   The problem is with this type they tend to have a fragile ego and can‚Äôt process shame.  They try to find a million excuses to avoid the shame of shitting on other women.  When actually that shame has something to teach them.  Because secretly they enjoyed shitting on other women and being temporarily put on a false pedestal by men.   Take responsibility for your actions.   Don‚Äôt do to others what you don‚Äôt want done to yourself.   Some side plates are out here publicly gloating about the married men they sleep with on tik tok   Then in the next breath‚Ä¶. trying to get sympathy saying ‚Äòput a leash on your man‚Äô or making excuses for their actions.   Blaming the girlfriend for not knowing he‚Äôs got other women.   Sorry but last time I checked the point of cheating was to hide it.  So he‚Äôs deliberately hiding it‚Ä¶.& the Pickmeisha is playing along with it   So her not knowing is not a justifiable excuse for the Pickmeisha to keep servicing him.   If you‚Äôre making yourself available 3 hours a week to sleep with a married man‚Ä¶you‚Äôre clowning yourself.  You‚Äôre the one who is playing into it, coming to his house when his girlfriend goes to the gym for an hour.   Sorry I‚Äôm not buying it when the Pickmeisha knows he‚Äôs married, makes a habit of that BS & acts like a victim cos he does the same to her.  How you get them is how you lose them.  If he will cheat WITH you, he will most definitely see you as an even bigger clown and cheat ON you.   This is simply a way for trifling Pickmeisha‚Äôs to offload blame. And cry victim.   You can‚Äôt be complaining about these cheating disrespectful men whilst AIDING them to shit on us.  The minute you know he‚Äôs married - that should be the END of it.	1642535423.0	ht7w2s9	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht5u5ky	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht7w2s9/

3bii2bnm	They will feed her lies and the Pickmeisha falls for it thinking she‚Äôs getting this great unappreciated guy  He‚Äôll say ‚Äòshe doesn‚Äôt give me attention‚Äô  ‚ÄòI did x y z & she doesn‚Äôt appreciate me‚Äô  Idk why Pickmeisha‚Äôs fall for this when we know 98% of men are liars. Nowhere near what they claim.   The chances of them magically getting an amazing guy, who is also cheating on his wife‚Ä¶.is ridiculously slim.   Yeah cos he exhausted her with his gaslighting, negging, belittling, incompetence & ogling other women.   He‚Äôs not telling her that part.   That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs deflated & lost the will to try with him. Because he‚Äôs strung her out.   He strung her along pretending to be different when he wasn‚Äôt.   He‚Äôs exhausted that woman‚Äôs patience. Or desire.  That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs lining up his ducks to cushion the fall.  He will seek out an immature woman to pump his ego up b4 she ditches him.   Bc he can‚Äôt face being alone.   As he can sense she‚Äôs had enough.   He wants to be the one that moves on fast and punish her some more. Rub it in her face.   Most times the wife has brought up them ending things multiple time‚Äôs in a fair manner‚Ä¶but he refuses & claims he loves her. Gaslights her. Guilt trips her. Claims he‚Äôs not cheating, she‚Äôs paranoid.   So he‚Äôs the one REFUSING to end it,  yet making out the wife won‚Äôt let him go.  They‚Äôre both still in the puppy stage, Pickmeisha barely knows him as she only sees him 3 hrs a week at most.   The side plate is just damage control.   If she was so terrible, he would of left.   The wife may be hesitating bc she‚Äôs tired of going through that process as it‚Äôs exhausting to keep putting your energy into liars.   But at the point he‚Äôs cheating, he knows she‚Äôs on her way out. He knows she left the building .  But he won‚Äôt leave bc he wants to punish & harm her.  He wants to drag it out & hurt her.  He‚Äôll use a side plate Pickmeisha to humiliate her some more.   Side plates are literally being used as a tool to punish women who won‚Äôt take their shit.  It‚Äôs just laughable they pass it off as ‚Äòwinning‚Äô  Winning what? Someone‚Äôs sloppy seconds?   He‚Äôll try manipulate the main to stay.   Whilst telling Pickmeisha ‚Äòshe‚Äôs obsessed with me I can‚Äôt get rid of her‚Äô or ‚Äòshe needs me‚Äô   Lies, he‚Äôs the one gaslighting her to stay. Dragging things out.  Side plates have this immature mindset of ‚Äòhe picked me when he has with her! I must be so special!‚Äô   When a harsh reality check is‚Ä¶  Men tend to go for low value women when choosing an ongoing side plate.   Because they know high value women aren‚Äôt going to knowingly settle for that clown position. Or play hush.   Someone who‚Äôs not that bright, has low self esteem, is desperate, immature, low morale & willing to lie.   That‚Äôs not a compliment, but side plates think it is.   You have to ask yourself, if she‚Äôs so bad why hasn‚Äôt  he left?   The reason is because there‚Äôs plenty benefits to him staying. They don‚Äôt want to leave.	1642538298.0	ht83wi5	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht6yv62	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht83wi5/

There is no other explanation. No one deserves to be caused harm deliberately, regardless of the circumstances. I would also argue the hot sauce was chosen to humiliate her, or ‚Äúteach her a lesson.‚Äù Baby trapping is horrible, but even if she had succeeded, Drake wouldn‚Äôt have suffered physically for it.

7rbqon55	I think my problem is that I haven't found a man that could ever be "someone special", they're all kind of bland or outright awful, so I settle for a small amount of entertainment instead.

owunw4l	>I tend not to get emotionally attached either  I relate to that, I also have no emotional attachment after sex. Although I'm straight, I definitely act more like a man when I comes to sex.

is7asrqa	I don't know how to explain how of an idiot she is lol  It's not even her boyfriends fault right now. He got horny and probably naturally attracted to the friend.   It's so embarrassing to her. My ego would be so hurt I wouldn't be able to remain in that relationship nor look at him in his eyes.   She probably didn't expect that but... Still... People get attached. It can happen when there's chemistry. I've been the dumb idiot too who thought that you didn't get attached to a guy after having sex with him. And I also didn't listen when others told me that I would get attached to a guy if I had sex with him. It really did happen and it completely sucks.   So yeah. You have to be really careful with these things but she literally opened the door for him leaving her for the friend.
