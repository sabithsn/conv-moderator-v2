They don’t cost much (between $15-$20 a month) and they contain all the latest scholarship on any given historical topic.	1642691439.0	htgseua	t3_s7kat3	t3_s7kat3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7kat3/how_to_become_knowledgeable_on_a_certain_era_of/htgseua/
jduzx	I don't think there is any numbers on _how many_ historians "take it seriously," but Marxist historiography is alive and well; I count myself in the tradition. Plenty of recognised and important historians nowadays are Marxists; but, I know it doesn't bode well for my point, think about a name such as Eric Hobsbawm(died 2012), one of the most important and influential historians in recent years. Eugene Genovese, who died the same year, was also a hugely influential figure. Robert Brenner, he is still alive and well, and also a key figure in history, even having a whole debacle named after him, i.e. "the Brenner Debates." Perry Anderson, also an important figure, still alive. Dave Renton, an important historian when it comes to fascism, is also a Marxist. Enzo Traverso is also a Marxist who has written extensively and important works. Edgar Hartwig is a German name I could mention. Gerald Horne is a contemporary and active American name. Chris Wickam is another name that has some weight to it.  But the short answer is, that yes, Marxism is still alive and well among historians nowadays. It is taken serious by most, even among non-Marxists, and Marxists are recognised in ways such as receiving positions and awards regularly.	1642700589.0	hthgz56	t3_s8nnvk	t3_s8nnvk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/hthgz56/
gh16flt8	It’s important to remember that Germany was newly unified (1871) anyway, during which there was a movement to make Austria part of Germany (pan Germanism). So many contemporaries would not have seen it in such stark contrast as Germany / Austria, as it can seem to more modern observers. And, though Austria had a large multi-ethnic contingency, the Austrian Germans would have been viewed, for the most, to be as ‘German’ as Saxons, Bavarians etc, which had all until recently be autonomous states, like Austria was (until 1938).	1642702234.0	hthlioa	t3_s7ogpy	t3_s7ogpy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7ogpy/why_did_the_germans_not_mind_that_adolf_hitler/hthlioa/
g8w9r6nt	So this a weird one. Some Muslims were honorary Nazis. Sadam Hussian’s uncle was pro nazi because of them fighting the British. That doesn’t mean Hitler would have loved him back.  But also over 2.25 million Muslims do fought for the allies. Mostly fighting under the British.  12,000 People from Palestinians volunteered to fight for the English and defend North Africa   The only thing a lot leaders had in common with Nazis was Israel. To the Arab world Israel and losing land was their biggest issue.   But also remember the Middle East is where a lot of Jews went for refuge.  In short. Hitler needed every ally he could get with the amount of conflicting facts it is safe to assume he just tried to manipulate them into fighting for him but it didn’t work well. He was a master manipulator. Same with what happened in Japan. Pretty sure Hitler hated Japanese people but he needed help. He thought of Arabs as no different to semites, he liked European Muslims like modern day Bosnians. He liked Islam with the history of fighting against invaders like the crusades or Afghanistan. Islam is the best example of fighting against invaders. His tactic was to use hatred Arabs had for Israel and the British to manipulate them. He did hate Muslims for not being white, because that didn’t side with him. Hitler thought the enemy of my enemy is my friend but it didn’t work out very well.  Islam is was the ww2 version of the Zimmerman telegram. “Hey guys fight for us and we will give you some things that you might want”.

cml4w8s	Something to keep in mind is that suicide as it is today was not very common at all until after the first worldwar and even then it still wasn't common until much later.  Have a thought experiment. You're in the trenches in Verdun or Yerpes, You've miraculously survived enough assaults to be reasonably effected by PTSD, now some key things, for the most part, chances are you volunteered, you're a young man with a 19th century mindset out to show how you're a man. To do so you need to come back home (preferably alive) to your wife or fiancee or family. You have a reason to keep staying alive even when things look bleak. Most people who have something to live for don't commit suicide (cross culturally).   Now if you'd received word from home that your wife/fiancee was sleeping around or died, then suicide would be a major risk but in those cases you were almost always given leave or in some cases letters would be censored. The former situation (leave) would usually lead to desertion so you wouldn't go back to the trenches anyways.  Overall the main factors causing the historic suicide rates today are a general feeling of hopelessness and a common feeling that "nothing is worth it" both *terrifying* indicators of societal collapse... Which magnifies the stress, which magnifies the feeling of apathy and hopelessness which magnifies the... And it goes on and on. Society today has a high suicide rate as a result of the culture and values unique to today. Almost any other time in history the fundamental value of "I'd like to stay alive" was more than enough to keep you from killing yourself because of stress or apathy.  Tldr. Suicide today is really unusual from a historical perspective and it's causes today don't translate well to the culture of the Early 1900s	1642707268.0	hthz6rx	t3_s8dc4j	t3_s8dc4j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8dc4j/what_were_suicide_rates_in_the_trenches_during/hthz6rx/
f8jum7xb	Thanks for the answer! I'm aware of Hobsbawm and Brenner, but I've never read them unfortunately. That might be a huge question, but what does their marxism amount to? Surely, they don't refer to marxian value form analysis in their historical research. Do they actually subscribe to historical materialism as laid out in Marx's German Ideology? I.e. do/did they believe in the existence of a certain number of stages of development according to which human history progresses?	1642707605.0	hti03ut	t3_s8nnvk	t1_hthgz56	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/hti03ut/

fjkx0xqo	If it succeeded. Yes.  Japan didn’t have natural resources for war so taking out the only threat in the Pacific Ocean would’ve been great for them, if it went as planned. This is why they invaded islands throughout the ocean.  And when this occurred the military might of the United States was not the top in the world. We were far behind England and Germany and a (large) handful of other countries. In fact it was England who gave us the schematics and whatnot for weapons so we could help them out (due to us having so many resources).	1642707900.0	hti0wte	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/hti0wte/
jduzx	I'm not sure if I understand you, so please tell me if you meant something else.  Yes, most Marxists subscribe to the idea that the conditions of a society's production, or in Marxist terms a society's productive forces and relations of production, fundamentally shape and influences society's organisation, including the political commitments, cultural ideas and values that dominate in any society. And yes, while some ideas, like "the Asiatic mode of production" have fallen out of favour, rightfully so, most Marxist's agree on, if we agree that we are talking simplified and generalised, a progression from pre-civilisation over despotic or slave societies, into feudalism, into capitalism. Ofc. these distinctions are not set in stone, there are variations, and the progression isn't as linear as I make it sound here, no Marxist would claim so.  And ofc. Marxists may refer back the Marx's value form analysis, if it should it be relevant. It is part of the broader Marxist analysis, and important when discussing capitalist society.	1642708259.0	hti1wbu	t3_s8nnvk	t1_hti03ut	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/hti1wbu/

gh16flt8	The problem for Japan was their commitment to the war in China, in which they were bogged down and extremely low on resources (there are very few natural resources in Japan, and they relied on imports for their war effort).  But, America had put a coal and iron ore embargo on Japan, amongst other economic sanctions in order to curtail their expansion (desiring free trade with China).  The position Japan was in was therefore untenable. They could either discontinue their war in China (which the Japanese military industrial complex was already committed), or take the materials by force, namely, from oil fields in the Philippines (under US mandate in 1941). This obviously meant war with America.  The idea at pearl harbour was to knock out the US pacific fleet, at which they believed America would then sue for peace, being what they perceived essentially to be a ‘decadent’, liberal democracy, with no stomach for war - this obviously proved a massive underestimation.  So in hindsight, although this seemed suicidal, and in truth, perhaps never winnable in the long term, the important thing to remember is that it didn’t come out of the blue, Japan had their reasons.

ugjki	My understanding is, IF the Japanese intended to start beef with the USA, then the attack on Pearl Harbor was strategically necessary. The reason it was NOT a good decision overall is that Japan had no real way to win a war against the United States in the long term.

lpht4c8	It still would have been a big mistake. It would have delayed US operations by maybe about 9 months. The US had launched three of the new *Essex*-class carriers in 1942, five more in 1943, and ten more in 1944. There was simply no way for Japan to keep up with US surface fleet production   And that’s ignoring the submarine campaign. US submarines sank 89,000 tons of Japanese merchant shipping in 1942, 1.3 million tons in 1943, 2 million tons in 1944, and 415,000 tons in 1945. The jump between 1942 and 1943 was due to the *Balao*-class submarine joining the fight in late 1942 (phasing out the *Gato*-class, which remained in service until 1944) and fixes to the infamously poorly designed Mark 14 torpedos. By the end of 1944, more than half of the Japanese merchant marine had been sunk, and the American submarines were having such a hard time finding targets that they would sometimes come to the surface and use machine-guns to sink wooden fishing boats.   When you combine the US’ ability to pump out ships (between Pearl Harbor and the end of the war, the US would add to its fleet roughly 6 battleships, 18 fleet carriers, 64 light/escort carriers, 24 cruisers, 370 destroyers, and 200 submarines), the effectiveness of the submarine war and Japan’s failure to adequately address it, and the fact that China was continuing to suck Japan’s resources, there was no feasible way for Japan to have won.   Ian W Toll’s *Pacific War* trilogy is an excellent read.	1642722006.0	htiyzkj	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htimgqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htiyzkj/

4250ypmu	Sorry I took so long to answer. I didn't have much time between work and study.   My answer will be mostly based in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJlXW988nY (all the information in this video seems pretty correct if I correctly remeber most of my classes about Brazil's history during high school. The reporter also interviewed historians, transport engineers and other speacialists and the informations she collects are well contextualised). Unfortunately there are no english captions for it.  She cites 4 major reasons for train network declining in Brazil. But before explaining those reasons I suppose it would be good to contextualize Brazil's colonization and how it was populated:  Brazil was a colony of Portugal from 1500 (when it was "discovered") to 1822 (when it became part of the Portuguese United Kingdom, together with Portugal and Algarves, due to the Portuguese Royal Family fleeing to Brazil from Napoleon attacks in Europe).   From the discovery on, the modus operandi of Portugal's goods extraction (for its colonies) focused mainly on the coastal areas. In Brazil that was caused in part due to the difficulty for inland migration, since a huge and dense forest bordered virtually all the Brazillian coast what made inland movement very difficult, in part due to indigen resistance to invasion of their lands, in part due to Portugal specialization to movement in waters. The main area targeted during this period (from 1500 to the end of XVI century) was Brazil's Northeastern and Eastern coast.   Then Brazil's major economic activity became sugarcane production (from XVI century to middle XVIII century) focused also on Northeastern coast due to its suitable climate and soil.   During XVII century Brazil started its interiorization policies but it worked mostly in its Southwest Region.    In the end of XIX century Brazil prompted its emmigration policies that populated mostly Southwest and South Region.  Those are the major reasons Brazil has this population distribution today:    [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco-Costa-4/publication/310487406/figure/fig6/AS:503062697189380@1496950901357/Population-density-of-Brazil-inhabitants-per-km-2-Source-wwwibgegovbr-censo.png](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco-Costa-4/publication/310487406/figure/fig6/AS:503062697189380@1496950901357/Population-density-of-Brazil-inhabitants-per-km-2-Source-wwwibgegovbr-censo.png)  Since Brazil has such an unequal distribution in its population density, its road networks and railway networks focused mostly on joining those areas and spreading in and around them (and connecting good producing areas to ports and therefore to the coast). That seems to be the reason Brazil's never had a railroad network as extensive as its counterpart nations.   Brazil reached its railway network extension peak in 1960 (38000 Km or about 23612 miles) but it started shrinking after that year and from 1970s it just stagnated.   Reasons for railroad decline in Brazil (that's the part where the video really talks about):   Reason n.01- The Coffee Crysis.   The coffee production was the main reason for the construction of railroads in Brazil, during XIX century. The first Brazilian railroad was the "Estrada de ferro Mauá" ("Mauá Railroad", launched in 1854) used to transport coffee from the Paraíba Valley to the Bagé Harbour in Rio de Janeiro. During XIX century and the beginning of XX, coffee was the main commodity in Brazil. It  made up to 50% of Brazilian global exports. Because of coffee, the railroad increased during this period to almost 30000 Km in 1920s. During that expansion, railroad started to carry around not just goods but also people.  Then the Great Crash happened in 1929. The USA was the biggest coffee buyer and the Great Depression caused a huge declining in coffee buying (and therefore in its price). Most railroads in Brazil were private and its owners stopped investing in them as they were not profitable anymore. That caused a long and slow period of decadence for railroads so that they wold eventually became state owned, about two decades after the crysis.  Reason n.02 - Cities growth   During 1940s Brazil starts changing a lot as it transitioned from an economy mostly agricultural to an mostly industrial one. This changing caused many cities to grow and the areas in between them start having less people what caused a decrease on the demand for trains connecting cities.   Reason n.03 - Cars popularization   In 1956, Juscelino Kubitschek wins the presidential election in Brazil and he chooses the automotive industry as the major part for his development plan for Brazil, called "50 anos em 5" ("\[progressing\] 50 years in 5"). Some experts suggest that this is the begining of Brazilian focus on road network (instead of any other transportation network). There are some reasons for choosing automotive industry as a central part in a development agenda: automotive industry has a long production chain which has a multipling effect on the economy and it employs qualified workeforce. That workforce also can become relevant consumers. It's also relevant to cite that during this period, in the Cold War context, the USA transfered part of its automotive technology to strenghten its bonds with Brazil (so to avoid USRR influence over Brazil) what made possible Brazil not just assemble cars parts, but properly produce them.  In addition it's cheaper to build highways than railroads, and in the 50s and 60s petroleum was very affordable, what made car transportation a way more advantageous approach than trains at that moment. This also impacted in the reason n.02 ("Cities growth"), since roads have better capillarity inside the cities than railroads.  For all that, during Kubistchek government (just 5 years) road extension in Brazil tripled. In the mean time railroads continued to be broken up.  Reason n.04 - Passanger lines extinction   The beginning and middle of XX century  faced many changes in globalwise transport. In Brazil, specifically, there were a lot of changes in transportation demand for goods and people, including the advent of airplanes, development of automotive industry, mass migration to cities, new worker legislation, etc, so the original bussiness model for Brazilian railroads couldn't cope with all that.  Some specialists argue that it wasn't just Brazil that faced all that changes but that railroad networks suffered such a strain in many countries. But the major difference was how the governments answered to those changes and what public policies were implemented on those countries. The countries that still maintain most of (or all... or even more than) those original railroad invested in railroad DESPITE their lower profitability. That means it was an active public policy.  That was the case of the USA, Germany and France for example. Those countries statized the railroads and took on the economic losses caused by the railroads and that made them still active until today. Since Brazil prefered not to take on those losses, most passenger lines became extinct up to 90s. So from 50s on, railroads in Brazil are more and more focused to transport only goods. And those are the ones still active today (we do still have very few to trains to transport people, but they are mostly small ones and located inside cities or that transport between very close cities. And I do mean when I say they're small one as from 38000 km of current railroads, only about 1000 km are for passengers).  Nowadays 70% of Brazilian railroads transport iron ore and about 12% transport soy.	1642723340.0	htj27vs	t3_ru8b5y	t3_ru8b5y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ru8b5y/many_latin_american_nations_once_had_extensive/htj27vs/

You can also look at economic factors involved in the first time a children's book series was being filmed at the same time it was being written, how financial interactions at Harry Potter world have been made "magic," and marketing techniques in different countries, to different groups, or to different ages (once it became clear that adults were reading the books, too).	1642727066.0	htjazpk	t3_s8nnvk	t3_s8nnvk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htjazpk/

ysax7	It was the best idea they had at the time. Japan's overall mission was to make themselves self-sufficient. The Japanese home islands were poor in natural resources, so they needed to accumulate territory and the loot therein to make that possible. In the Pacific, that put them at odds with China, European colonial powers,  maybe the Soviet Union, and the United States. Of those, only the United States had the resources to come at Japan and attack because of their geopolitical landscape - they were safe on their own continent (they COULD get interested in Hitler but didn't HAVE to because there was an ocean of separation) and had the industrial capacity to strike if needed and keep the hits coming. The European powers wouldn't risk the bulk of their militaries in a colonial conflict when they had fascism and communism to worry about closer to home. The Soviet Union might have the motivation to fight back but not the logistical capacity - most of its factories were on the other side of the country (de facto the other side of the world) and linked by one rail line to their Pacific territories. China could fight back if attacked but didn't have the strike capacity to launch an attack on their own, and there was a civil war between Communists and Nationalists that would keep their eyes focused inward.  Japan never realistically entertained the notion that they could defeat the United States in a protracted war if it came to it. Their hope was that if they wiped out most of our strike capacity at the beginning of the war, it would end the war before it ever got rolling. They didn't think we had the willpower to rebuild an entire navy from scratch if they sank the bulk of what presently existed, that we didn't have the stamina and motivation to fight our way island-by-island across the entire Pacific Ocean, and that they could catch our carriers at port at Pearl - they were wrong on all counts. If we dropped out of the fight, the rest of the Pacific would have been theirs for the taking. If anyone else came back to take what was theirs, Japan would have a huge chunk of the world to defend and pull resources from to fight back.  Pearl Harbor looks like a bad idea because it was the beginning of a four year war that Japan was destined to lose almost as soon as it started. Risk/reward - the risk was that we'd get pissed and stay pissed long enough to finish the job, but the reward was about a third of the world. Pearl Harbor was intended to be the only major event of a war that started and ended in December 1941, and had it gone according to plan it would have been a brilliant plan.	1642727361.0	htjbo7f	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjbo7f/
9vakt	I'm going to try to take this in a slightly different way.    By attacking Pearl Harbor, they set in motion their complete and total defeat.  By being so militarily devastated after the war, the Japanese were able to rebuild and focus their economy on industry and technology, without having to spend excessive amounts of money that would have been needed during the Cold War on their military, thus putting them in position to be one of the largest economies in the world by 2000.	1642727970.0	htjd2m3	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjd2m3/

Admittedly, the middle two weren't ideal choices, but they could have tried to serve as a stopgap until the US started spamming Essexes and Independences.  Remember, by the end of 1943, the US Navy churned out 7 Essex and 9 Independences with more on the way.  Not to mention, ok, you sink a few of our 21 kt, 14" armed standard type battleships.  Congratulations, here's 2 North Carolinas, 4 South Dakotas ready and 3 Iowas in the water by 1943.  That's 9 battleships commissioned or launched by the end of 1943.  Japan built 2.

dxy7h	(Not a top-level answer ...)  Most of the answers here seem to be guilty of "resulting," i.e. judging a decision by its actual outcome, rather than by the reality of the time.   The reality of the late 1930s is that Japan, a nation with few natural resources and reliant on imports, was in a near economic blockade by the US and other great powers. They had to do *something*, and after [losing to the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol), decided to instead to fight the US. Was Japan favored to win? Perhaps not. Could they conceivably have won, and would they have prospered from winning? Yes. Were there other alternatives to going to war? Maybe - I'm sure professional historians argue about this.  I contrast the attack on Pearl Harbor with Brexit, where *all* conceivable outcomes for the UK are negative. That's what I call a "bad decision"	1642728938.0	htjfb7y	t3_s8r0wm	t1_hti11bo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjfb7y/
ba5atljj	Now I'm no admiral, but just having more industrial capacity shouldn't be a game changer if you're now drastically weaker. Anything you pump out is still hilariously outnumbered, even if you're pumping 5x as much as the enemy. This is why the strategy before Midway on the American side came off as so desperate. The guy running the show had to make sure that the Japanese were not allowed to utterly dominate, because if they did, it wouldn't matter how much America could pump out since it would just be sunk immediately.  &#x200B;  And if America just retreated from the Pacific while they built their forces up, they'd essentially be leaving the entirety of the mainland up for bombing and an unlikely invasion.	1642729153.0	htjftaf	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjeqey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjftaf/

In perfect communism everything is decided for you: education, work, law... One country one voice and that going from the top to the bottom. You not only can't complain also you can't be smarter than people one step over you in the communist hierarchy - any thing makes you dangerous for the party or leaders. Who is who is decided. You can be genius in some field but party may need your skills in the factory line or in the army.  In Soviet or any perfect communist state is enough that in Trotsky's case Stalin feel paranoid about him and that was enough. No one can be smarter than leader and collective party.

If the US had looked at the defeat at Pearl Harbor and thought “we can’t beat these guys”, or even “this fight will be too costly, let’s make a deal”, that would have been a victory for Japan.   That was more or less the goal of the attack, to blunt the US ability to counterattack long enough to conquer and consolidate a new empire, and force the US (and Britain and Netherlands) to accept a new status quo at the bargaining table.   Unhappily for them, they made some combination of misjudgments about the US response to such an attack. Rather than intimidating the US government or people, the attack solidified their resolve to fight rather than negotiate. Unless that resolve could be broken, a war of logistics against the US was a bad game for the Japanese to play.	1642730233.0	htjiahn	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htimgqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjiahn/

i8q6y	The best analysis of this is in michael barnhart’s “japan prepares for total war”   Japan’s govt was searching for economic protection and took advantage of chinas internal conflicts to build an empire in china  This war was so massive that it required more resources and empire to keep it going. Japan thus invaded south east asia to gain access to indonesian rubber and oil fields.   Problem was the usa naval base in the phillipines which could, in war, easily destroy the trade routes. Plus american economic embargo was ruinous. It was 75% of japanese trade and 90% of oil.   The result was japan needed to occupy the phillipines. The problem was the big fat american fleet in hawaii which would just stream east. So, attack pearl harbor. Occupy the phillipines. Win the war in china. And then negotiate an ceasefire with america before they rebuilt their fleet. (Essentially recreating the russo-japanese war plan of a sneak attack and then, hopefully for japan, a battle of tsushima type victory at midway.  In short, for japan to win the war in china it would have to fight the usa.	1642733936.0	htjquly	t3_s8yukr	t3_s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/htjquly/

7gjek3q	I hate Marxists so much it’s unreal. Philosopher of science Karl Popper, in The Poverty of Historicism and Conjectures and Refutations, critiqued such claims of the explanatory power or valid application of historical materialism by arguing that it could explain or explain away any fact brought before it, making it unfalsifiable and thus pseudoscientific. Similar arguments were brought by Leszek Kołakowski in Main Currents of Marxism. Marx’s historical materialism famously inverted Hegel’s philosophy. For Marx, history was a succession of economic and political systems, or “modes of production” in Marx’s language. As technological innovations and new ways of organizing production led to improvements in a society’s capacity to meet human material needs, new modes of production would emerge. In each new mode of production, the political and legal system, as well as the dominant moral and religious values and practices, would reflect the interests of those who controlled the new productive system. Marx believed that the capitalist mode of production was the penultimate stage of human history. The productive power unleashed by new technologies and factory production under capitalism was ultimately incompatible with capitalism as an economic and political system, which was marked by inefficiency, instability and injustice.  Marx predicted that these flaws would inevitably lead to revolution followed by establishment of communist society. This final stage of human development would be one of material abundance and true freedom and equality for all.   According to Popper, though they disagreed on the mechanism that directed human social evolution, both Hegel and Marx, like Plato, were historicists because they believed that trans-historical laws governed human history.  This was the key point for Popper, as well as the key error and danger.   The deep methodological flaw of historicism, according to Popper, is that historicists wrongly see the goal of social science as historical forecast—to predict the general course of history. But such prediction is not possible, Popper said. He provided two arguments that he said demonstrated its impossibility. The first was a succinct logical argument: Human knowledge grows and changes overtime, and knowledge in turn affects social events. (That knowledge might be, for example, a scientific theory, a social theory, or an ethical or religious idea.) We cannot predict what we will know in the future (otherwise we would already know it), therefore we cannot predict the future.  As long as it is granted that knowledge affects social behavior and that knowledge changes overtime—two premises that Popper considered incontestable—then the view that we can predict the future cannot be true and historicism must be rejected. This argument, it should be noted, also reflected Popper’s judgment that the universe is nondeterministic: that is, he believed that prior conditions and the laws of nature do not completely causally determine the future, including human ideas and actions. Our universe is an “open” universe, he said.   Popper’s second argument against the possibility of historical forecasting focused on the role of laws in social explanations. According to Popper, historicists wrongly believe that genuine social science must be a kind of “theoretical history” in which the aim is to uncover laws of historical development that explain and predict the course of history (Poverty of Historicism, 39). But Popper contended that this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of scientific laws. In fact, Popper argued, there is no such thing as a law of historical development. That is, there are no trans-historical laws that determine the transition from one historical period to the next.  Failure to understand why this is so represented a deep philosophical error. There may be sociological laws that govern human behavior within particular social systems or institutions, Popper said. For instance, the laws of supply and demand are kinds of social laws governing market economies. But the future course of history cannot be predicted and, in particular, laws that govern the general trajectory of history do not exist. Popper does not deny that there can be historical trends—a tendency towards greater freedom and equality, more wealth or better technology, for instance, but unlike genuine laws, trends are always dependent upon conditions. Change the conditions and the trends may alter or disappear. A trend towards greater freedom or knowledge could be disrupted by, say, the outbreak of a pandemic disease or the emergence of a new technology that facilitates authoritarian regimes. Popper acknowledges that in certain cases natural scientists can predict the future—even the distance future—with some confidence, as is the case with astronomy, for instance. But this type of successful long-range forecasting can occur only in physical systems that are “well-isolated, stationary and recurrent,” such as the solar system (Conjectures and Refutations, 339). Social systems can never be isolated and stationary, however.	1642735492.0	htjucs4	t3_s8nnvk	t3_s8nnvk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htjucs4/
8rsxo	To OP's question, it may be worth at least discussing America's naval/military readiness in 1940/41. I mean, obviously the production capacity that carried the day should have been pretty apparent, especially as the US was already producing material for the other Allied powers. But everything I've read (Toll and Atkinson specifically) leaves me with the sense that our armed forces were far from considered world powers at the time. Not to mention, there was a sentiment in the population towards isolation which the Japanese were banking on.  It was a wrong strategic decision, but to at least flesh it out - the logic was a decisive blow would cow the American public away from wanting to join the fray. And since the military would requirel time to build-up, I think Japan figured they could quickly grab the territory they needed (which to a large extent they did) and take the US's surrender forced by an impatient and fearful public before the production gap played a factor.   Again, I agree that it was obviously the wrong call, but for the sake of OP it's worth noting the context of America's global position at the time. We were not the military (and cultural) world leader that we became post WWII. Not to mention the level of militarism and dysfunction within Japan's leading strategists, allowing more fanciful world views to be entertained for planning.	1642733887.0	htjqqjz	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjho80	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjqqjz/

ca1lk	Wouldn't the answer just be a generic supply nd demand issue? Towns get rich when they have natural resources to sell. Then craftsmen like blacksmiths, tailorers, construction builders come and cater to these towns, living off the wealth that these natural resources give, then natural resources run out and craftsmen turn to manufactoring to make products in exchange for the natural resources they buy like food and lumber. Population expands and follows the resources and diminish when resources run dry. That's why so many boom towns across america are husk of their former glory because China supplied the natural resources like coal and iron for cheap.	1642739288.0	htk2id7	t3_s8sd13	t3_s8sd13	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8sd13/is_there_any_wellestablished_reason_why_the/htk2id7/

3hkhei4r	This is going to be a difficult question to answer, because the Marxian tradition is, by its nature, extremely political; so your stance on Marxian politics is obviously going to affect your opinion of the Marxian historical method. How do you feel about Marx and his many, many interpolators? Do you like any of his ideas? You may like some historians who have drawn on him theoretically. Do you think it’s all a load of bull? You’re probably not going to like those historians.  Another wrinkle: there are as many different types of historical materialism as there are Marxists to espouse it, and no-one beefs harder than two Marxists disputing the dialectic. A classic example of this is between two (extremely esteemed, highly distinguished and decorated) historians who both called themselves Marxists, Perry Anderson vs E.P. Thompson. For Anderson, historical materialism is about interpreting and ordering the struggle between different social classes and interpreting economic, political and social data inside of that framework (eg lineages of the absolutist state). for E.P. Thompson, historical materialism is more about detailing the lifeways and social practices through which people make and remake class societies (e.g. the making for the English working class). Both of these historians are or were Marxists, yet they argued terribly over the meaning of their shared tradition. Are they of relevance? a hell of a lot of people seem to think so (Anderson is still a distinguished faculty at UCLA and Thompson is widely revered despite his passing). But again, if you scoff at the idea that class struggle plays a formative role in human history, you probably won’t like either of them.   So, with all that being said: what is Marxian historical materialism? To quote Marx (lol):  “[H]ere we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting-point is consciousness taken as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness.”  So basically, he’s saying: let’s not start from pre-conceived notions of what the right categories and subjects of history are, but instead observe and appreciate our world as it is first and build our histories off of that. I, personally, think that is still an admirable and potent guideline for a so-inclined historian to follow.	1642741972.0	htk7s2c	t3_s8nnvk	t3_s8nnvk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htk7s2c/

3ayla62b	I may be wrong but from my understanding, Lenin during the end of his time realised that Trotsky would be a better leader. I think he wrote letters voicing this opinion as well, which Stalin intercepted and it is believed to be destroyed. Stalin was the link at the time connecting Lenin and the Party Leadership, using his power in the Party he had installed people he preferred in high places of the government.   Later on after the death of Lenin, Stalin consolidates power and he is paranoid about his enemies will plot against him, to overthrown him and he must have believed that Lenin preferring Trotsky would give him some claim over Stalin to be the leader.

This is one of the reasons why the Japanese invaded the region.  Their expansionist actions however put quite a few nations against them. The USA joining the war against the Japanese became more and more likely. The Japanese, quite concerned with the looming threat the USA was becoming searched for options to deal with this.  They concluded that a preventing the USA to interfere in the war was not possible. So with the assumption that the USA would fight them, they searched for a way to make the USA a smaller threat.  Their solution: Disable (or even better destroy) the US Pacific fleet so they have no weapons with which they could fight the Japanese. This fleet was stationed at Pearl Harbor, which is why they attacked it.  Now, their attack didn't do what they wanted. The US fleet wasn't all present, so a portion of the fleet was completely undamaged, but the part of the fleet that was present wasn't as damaged as the Japanese had hoped.	1642771168.0	htlesmy	t3_s8yukr	t3_s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/htlesmy/
itaexggd	Yes, and yes.   According to Library of Congress [1],  > These are specimens of the earliest known movable type. The first font was cast in the 1230s, some two hundred years before Gutenberg "invented" movable type in Europe.   I ventured no further than the Wikipedia page on movable type [2] to find this source. The fact that Gutenberg was not the first inverter of movable type may be somewhat surprising to a Western layperson. To a Korean, this conclusion is absolutely unremarkable, since the invention of metal movable type is included in the national history curriculum.   See: [In school I was told Gutenberg invented printing, my Chinese friend tells me china already had invented it before](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7v72u6/in_school_i_was_told_gutenberg_invented_printing/), [I read that the Mongols were mass producing texts in the 13th century using a moveable block type printing method.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rcacjf/i_read_that_the_mongols_were_mass_producing_texts/). This topic has been trodden before on this subreddit.   The Wikipedia sources that you link [3] are more amusing to me. Tracking down the source from Federation of Busan and Science and Technology gives us a better picture of why the page disappeared from the internet, only accessible through a Wayback Machine archive. The series of articles was written by Sohn Dongwook, a professor of science policy at the Pukyong National University and a previous standing director of the FoBST. The series, titled "Jang Yeong-sil, Busan's Scientist", were compiled into a 2007 book [4] with the same title. It's subtitle? "To Give a View of Science to Children." That's right, Wikipedia quoted a children's science education book. It is no ordinary children's science book either. A glance at the book's descriptions reveals that "its purpose is to rouse teenagers' pride in the [Busan] region and interest science." The other source is easier to track down. Woongjin Wi-in Jeon-gi is the biography (jeon-gi) of great men (wi-in) from the Woongjin publisher - a children's book series.   I bring this up to point out how difficult it is to escape nationalism when researching Korean history from Korean sources. The first source has an overtone of regional pride. The second source's, and many others', use of the term "great men" is criticized for its tendency to glorify historical figures, often under a nationalistic lens. The primary school textbook of social studies, for instance, an unfounded claim that Jang Yeong-sil used a waterwheel to defeat drought. To quote a Seoul National University professor, "there is no evidence that water wheels were successfully used to combat drought in Korea." [5]   The Encyclopedia of Korean Culture is a more reliable source for Korean studies than the aforementioned children's books. Yet, as I explained, it is difficult to escape nationalistic bias. This is especially the case since many Koreans take pride in the fact that movable type press was first invented in Korea. See the following passage from EoKC's entry on Goryeo metal press:   > Although the technology [of Goryeo metal press] is less precise, [the Gutenberg press] was invented 200 years later than Goryeo's. Considering how early Goryeo metal press was invented, and how diverse the press types were through continuous improvements, we were undoubtedly at an unrivaled position, and that is our number one pride as a culture and ethnicity. [6]  The EoKC, which has the benefit of being a secondary rather than a tertiary source, confirms earlier conclusions.   > The *Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun* published by Choe Yun-ui during Gojong's rule (1234), is the earliest book known to have been printed by the metal press, yet it is lost today. [7]  > The Gabinja was a metal press developed in 1434 by royal decree as the letters of the Gyeongjaja made in 1420 was too thin. [8]  Why, then, did movable type press not become widespread in Korea? The reddit threads I linked above explain the linguistic reasons why. (In short, Chinese written language is too complex, and Korea would not have an alphabet until a decade before Gutenberg.) Korean sources further elucidate why. Due to the small demand for books in Korea at the time, metal press was utilized to print a wide variety of books, each with a small number of copies. Mass printing was achieved through wooden press instead. [9]  [1] World Treasures: Beginnings. The Library of Congress.

She was a "coveted political asset" and the center piece of Roman politics for over 20 years, during various germanic invasions.	1642775660.0	htlokr4	t3_s98aq7	t3_s98aq7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98aq7/has_any_real_life_historical_princess_ever/htlokr4/

2rzmr8ac	Yes.  Recently several times.  I'm sure many times in the medieval period.    Ruler of Dubai's daughter was missing for a few years.  Princess Latifa al Maktoum.  She re-surfaced again last year.   In August, Princess Shamsa (again, Dubai) was kidnapped off the street in Cambridge and taken back to Dubai.    In 1974, there was a kidnapping attempt of Princess Anne in England off the streets in London.    In the 1100s, Eleanor of Aquitaine was a very desirable wife because she was rich and had lots of lands. She was abducted two or three times (depending on how you count them) in attempts to force her into a marriage (so the kidnapper could take control of her lands).  After her first marriage (to the King of France) fell apart, she became very close to her Uncle Raymond (ruler of Antioch), there was talk of "excessive affection," and she consented to his abduction of her but that never happened.  A few weeks after her first marriage was annulled, she was traveling with her entourage.  Two different lords (Theobald (a French count) and Geoffrey Plantagenet (aka Geoffrey of Anjou),  (the brother of Henry II, Duke of Normandy) each tried to separately kidnap and marry her to take her land.  In a defensive move, she sent her messengers to Henry (future king of England), to ask him to marry her.  He did, and they got married about 8 weeks after her first wedding was annulled.  This also prevented anyone else from kidnapping her.  She thus became Queen of England.  I think they were third-cousins.  She was thus both the Queen of France and then later the Queen of England.	1642777342.0	htlspcp	t3_s98aq7	t3_s98aq7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98aq7/has_any_real_life_historical_princess_ever/htlspcp/

17qwnqfy	I cannot answer the actual historical question, but I think it's interesting that the premise of the question is the basis for a very old Zen koan. There seems to be an inherent mystery in why a Buddhist patriarch would leave India to bring teachings to China (and then from there to Japan). See the Blue Cliff Record Case 17 for one example of this koan. The Patriarch, or Bodhidharma, is considered the founder of Chinese Cha'an and Japanese Zen Buddhism.  http://www.buddhism.org/Sutras/2/BlueCliffRecord.htm	1642778776.0	htlwdeg	t3_s974xa	t3_s974xa	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s974xa/how_did_buddhism_spread_to_japan_and_china_while/htlwdeg/
4d7o8msd	In a word, no. In one sense it wouldn't be hard for any medieval person to design a house, as at most levels of society houses were very formuliac and heirarchical. They were based around an open hall, often served by a buttery and pantry at the low (or service end) and a private parlour accessed from the high end. Above either of the rooms at either end you may also have had chambers (bedrooms).   Whilst every medieval person would have been familiar with the layout of a medieval house and where they fitted into it, houses were built by skilled craftsmen. For example there are countless examples of surviving medieaval houses in the Weald of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. These are mostly timber-framed and were built by skilled carpenters. Some of them have been dismantled and re-erected at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum.   If you're interested in learning more there is a huge amount of literature on the subject, but it's a very diverse topic as medieval architecture differs a lot by region. RW Brunskill's *Vernacular Architecture* is a good starting point.  *The House Within: Interpreting Medieval Houses in Kent* by the RCHME demonstrates just how sophisticated medieval carpentry was and how localised different building traditions were.  Huge caveat: As with most social history, the lower down the social ladder you go, the less evidence you have, particularly the further back in time you go. For various reasons there are plenty of surviving houses from well-off peasants upwards, but truly humble houses rarely survive above ground. There are a few examples of small low-status houses (such as lady row in York) but these were still built by carpenters.	1642779121.0	htlxa72	t3_s94i4k	t3_s94i4k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s94i4k/would_i_be_expected_to_know_how_to_build_my_own/htlxa72/
i2kk6jsw	King Song Myong of Paekche, a kingdom in the Korean Peninsula, officially introduced Buddhism in Japan. Sometime between 538-552 AD (sources are differing about the timeline), he sent some sutras and monks along with a Buddha image.   According to _Nihon Shoki_, Soga no Umako (belonging to the influential Soga family) who was presented with the aforementioned image,  after building a temple to house this image, he commissioned a former priest to train three women as nuns. These nuns went to Paekche to study more about Buddhism, returning to Japan in 590AD. And _Nihon Shoki_ states this exchange as the beginning of Buddhism in Japan.   After its official introduction, Prince Shōtoku, nephew of Empress Suiko, the first empress in Japan and also a Buddhist, promoted Buddhism. He played an important role in establishing Buddhism in Japan, erecting two temples, one in Nara and one in Osaka, that are still standing tall today.   A little shy of a century later, Emperor Shōmu's government encouraged people to convert,  they built more temples and preached Buddhism.   There are no records of any Hindu missionaries in Japan. It is said that the renditions of Hindu culture that we see in Japan spread through slow immigration or through  travellers visiting India or other parts of Asia(where Hinduism spread) who took elements of this culture back home, which is how Japan has so many Indian deities and you'll find a harmonious blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. However, there was never any active preaching and converting involved.

42bmximc	Galla Placidia, Emperor Honorius' sister, was captured by Alaric, king of the group of Goths who would be later known to history as the Visigoths, during his 410 sack of Rome. She later married Athaulf, Alaric's brother and successor.  Ater the 455 sack of Rome by the Vandals, Valentinian III's widow (Licinia Eudoxia) and two daughters (Eudocia and Placidia) were captured by Vandal King, Ganseric. However, I don't think we could really call this a kidnapping, since the widowed Empress had actually asked for Vandal help. Her late husband had been murdered by the usurper Petronius Maximus, who (forcefully) married the widow and married Eudocia, who by then was betrothed to Ganseric's son (Huneric), to his own son. After the imperial family was brought to Vandal Carthage, Eudocia was married to Huneric, as originally intended.	1642783106.0	htm7th9	t3_s98aq7	t3_s98aq7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98aq7/has_any_real_life_historical_princess_ever/htm7th9/
1oxwnd9	Most of the previous answers are excellent analyses of the balance of power in the Pacific before Pearl Harbor, but the question assumes that pre-war Japan had a rational government making decisions based on their own resources, and deep research into the probable American response to war – much less a surprise attack.        It didn’t.          Modern Japan was a very young nation.  Japan signed the Convention of Kanagawa with the United States 1854, but the ruling class did not generally accept the necessity of Westernization until the Meiji Restoration of 1868, and the constitution only dated from 1890.  So, Imperial Japan was new nation, with an imported form of government, and exactly how the mechanics of government were supposed to work were often hotly debated right up until 1945.         Worse, the goals of the government were also contested.  The Meiji Restoration and a move to Westernization only occurred after conservative Japanese military leaders realized they could not militarily match the United States and the nations of Europe.  So, nearly all of the nation's ruling elites accepted the necessity of adopting Western technology, management, and military organization, but there was never agreement about how much Japan needed Western culture.      Many Japanese, particularly from ranks of engineers and businessmen, exulted in these cultural changes after 1868.  The older elites, who largely still ran the government, were not as entranced.  Some went along with energetically, but others – particularly military and naval officers - did not see the need to fundamentally change Japanese culture to compete with the West.  They wanted Maxim guns and Whitehead torpedoes not top hats and Ferris wheels.          Yes, Japan had the veneer of parliamentary democracy, but policy actually developed out of ferocious give and take among a variety of stakeholders.  Usually, this is portrayed as the Army versus the Navy with the occasional interference of the state bureaucracy, especially the Foreign Ministry, and the industrialists.          That doesn’t do the complexity of the process justice, because there were numerous cliques within each of these power centers.  Each clique had a variety of tools to accomplish its political goals, and gradually violence and the threat of violence became a the most powerful tool in the decision-making process.        There were numerous assassinations during the decade before Pearl Harbor by radical Army and Navy officers.  These assassinations strengthened the power of the “mainstream” military, but there were several coup attempts, most notably in 1932 and 1936, that left the government weak and unable to develop policy or rein in the radicals.         The Sino-Japanese War is the best example of just how weak the official government was.  In 1931 two Japanese colonels of the Kwantung Army based in Korea and guarding the Japanese controlled South Manchurian Railroad staged false flag attacks that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria.          No one in Tokyo, including the generals and admirals who might have agreed with the ultimate goals of the actions, were in control of these operations. Japanese national strategy was set by colonels and lieutenant colonels with muddy boots.   The government had to decide whether to back the troops in the field or risk a civil war at home.  The government in Tokyo prevented a broader war for the conquest of all China for six years, but in 1937 similar operations by Kwantung Army at the Marco Polo Bridge north of Beijing succeeded in pulling Japan into that broader war.        But the weakness of the central government prevented Japan from developing a coherent strategy, because the Navy had never signed on to the war in China and constantly fought against a reduction of resources from the major naval units needed to fight the United States or Great Britain.  The US economic embargo forced the Navy into looking for a way out of the morass of China.          The Navy’s solution was to grab the oil rich Dutch East Indies, and as part of that they believed they had to attack the United States.  The primary driver of this plan was Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku.         Yamamoto thought he really understood Americans.  He had studied English at Harvard from 1919-1921and then spent 1926-1928 as a naval attaché in Washington. He believed that if he could win a series of overwhelming victories in the first six months of the war that the United State would sue for peace rather than fight a long, bloody war to conquer Japan. He was so adamant that the Army accept his plan that he threatened to resign if his plan was not accepted, and, like in 1931 and 1937, such a move would have risked a civil war.  In this instance, between the Army and Navy.          But like the OP, many Japanese officers and civilian officials thought the plan was “a comically bad decision.”  Not only did it ensure enraging the United States, it also brought on war with Great Britain, and opened new fronts in Burma, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, the Solomons, the Central Pacific, and the Northern Pacific which almost ensured strategic paralysis.          Even Yamamoto seems to have had his doubts.  He probably did not say that he had “awakened a sleeping giant,” but he was supposedly depressed the day after Pearl Harbor and thought Japan had a six month window in which to win the war.          So, it was a bizarre decision made by a government that was not really a government in the normal sense of the word.  The emperor was largely a figurehead, but a figurehead everyone tried to appease.  He did not plan Pearl Harbor, but he did give his approval.          Prime Minster Tojo was more involved, but the plan was not his either.  Even the Chief of the Navy General Staff did not create the plan.  Yamamoto was the Commander and Chief of the Combined Fleet, a much higher ranking officer than the young Army officers who pulled the nation into war in China, but the basic outline is similar.          A lower ranking officer in an active command was able to direct national strategy.  It was a disaster in China and a disaster at Peal Harbor.          For general readers I still like John Toland’s *The Rising Sun* for its general overview of Japanese government and life on the eve of war in its first few chapters.  Bix’s *Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan* is a great book and also goes into a lot of detail about the strange role of the emperor who had ultimate power, so long as he never used it.	1642782438.0	htm60uq	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htm60uq/

He lied on his application, and the checks were not very thorough (they wanted as many as possible to sign up, as you can imagine).

4d7o8msd	I can't speak for all peoples and cultures, but up until around 1550 in England people heated their homes and cooked on an open hearth in a hall. This would be mitigated by the fact that the halls themselves were double height and open to the roof allowing the smoke to rise away from people. Houses were extrememly well ventilated by today's standards.  It can be very hard to put yourself in the position of someone from another historical period. Most people in medieval England, rich or poor, had one heated room in their house (the hall) and no glazing to the windows. Most of us would find it impossible to spend a winter living like this but this is all they knew. Smoke inhalation would be the least of your problems if you could die the next week from the plague,  famine, or an infected papercut.	1642784731.0	htmc9bz	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htjci3x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htmc9bz/

7s4rt2oe	Hitler had been living in Munich which was in the Bavarian providence of the German Empire. He had moved there in 1913 and made money painting architectual scenes. Some claim he was doing so to evade conscription in the Hapsburg army, further backed up by Hitler later claiming he did not want to serve the Austro-Hungarians due to their "mixed race" army as the empire was made up approximately 12 different ethnic groups.    He was sent back to Austria to join the army by the Bavarian police but had failed his exam for it in February on 1914 and returned to Munich. When the war broke out in late July 1914, Hitler requested permission to join the Bavarian army which was granted. German states could have their own armies as the Empire was technically a federation of states under Prussia. Author Ian Kershaw in his biography of Hitler states that Hitler was basically let in to serve by accident by the government. He states that Hitler should have been deported and that the matter of Hitlers citizenship was simply not raised when he joined.	1642790556.0	htms6gx	t3_s9esjh	t3_s9esjh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9esjh/why_and_how_did_hitler_fight_for_germany_in_ww1/htms6gx/

7w15rz55	A few anecdotes from the era that shine light on some of the topics raised:  Here is the highly regarded and probably shrewdest foreign policy analyst under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations (had his opinion carried the day there would have been escalation of Vietnam War), George Ball:  >"You never know when the Japanese are going to go ape"...He described the Japanese "as repeatedly unpredictable and irrational".  [http://japanwatching.com/environment/78-dont-cry-for-me-kyoto](http://japanwatching.com/environment/78-dont-cry-for-me-kyoto)  In John Dower's classic, *War Without Mercy*, the Japanese were very quickly turned into "harmless children" (infamous quote of General MacArthur to that effect) under US occupation (shown via cartoons and other depictions), and I was struck by persistence of that stereotype (esp. in enchantment with electronics and gadgets) when I once was browsing through *Life* Magazine's special on 1964 Tokyo Olympics:  >During the war Westerners were told of the "child mind of the Jap conscript." After the war, the same newspapers and magazines spoke of "Seventy Million Problem Children"; and cartoonists had a field day depicting the Japanese as infants in the crib or, more often, children attending General MacArthur's School of Democracy. Such paternalism was unquestionably the essence of MacArthur's attitude toward the Japanese- and Oriental people in general. His guiding philosophy during the occupation, he stated widely in publicized Senate hearings in 1951, after President Truman had recalled him from Asia, had been to treat the Japanese as twelve-year-olds. This was not an incautious remark, for the former supreme commander went on to expound his position at some length, explaining in the process why he believed the Japanese might be more receptive to American-style democratic ideas than the "mature" Germans. "The German problem is a completely and entirely different one from the Japanese problem," MacArthur informed the senators. "The German people were a mature race. If the Anglo-Saxon was say 45 years of age in his development, in the sciences, the arts, divinity, culture, the Germans were quite as mature. The Japanese, however, in spite of their their antiquity measured by time, were in a very tuitionary condition. Measured by the standards of modern civilization, they would be like a boy of 12 as compared with our development of 45 years. Like any tuitionary period, they were susceptible to following new models, new ideas. You can implant basic concepts there. They were still close enough to origin to be elastic and acceptable to new concepts..."

His answer "No" was not very popular in Japan, and the Japanese started giving him bad names.

Even after escaping from this disaster Mao and his communist forces tried to Take the country of Taiwan several times.  It was the Japanese officers with the wartime experience who helped Chiang win several victories against the communists that assured their safety.

fsldsue9	There were Japanese that actually fought on the communist side of the Chinese civil war, mostly technical staff that is harder to source like doctors and pilots, even factory management and other middle level staff, since Japan ruled the Northeast part of China, directly or indirectly for almost 40 years by then. You have Japanese that were resident in those areas and have deep roots while being fluent in Chinese. The Chinese communists were the faction to move in after the Soviets and absorbed a lot of those personnel. Part of the ease of absorbing such staff was that Chinese communists still believed in world revolution and being a "nationless" proletariat worker's party, so they did do some "ideological remolding" in relation to Japanese soldiers and personnel that fell in their liberation zone after World War 2.   This is probably a useful Wikipedia page(in Chinese) to follow up with the sourcing, but most sources on the left behinds Japanese in China are either in Chinese or Japanese. And this is a sensitive enough subject that even those sources are quite scarce with a need to draw on grey/unofficial literature.  https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/日籍解放军  It cites 30 thousand Japanese served in the People's Liberation Army, according to an article in the People's Daily, so not so insignificant an amount, more than your number here of a couple thousand.  I won't be surprised to learn the Vie Cong did the same considering their ideological affinity of copying the Chinese communists in tactics and methods.	1642798633.0	htne9wx	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmmyiu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htne9wx/

There was now a great enemy threatening the US, and the Japanese were among the first and best defensive lines against them.   I think 'defensive' is the key word.

azdqv	Additionally, I've also heard the Japanese interest in Pro Wrestling came about during the occupation. The time frame of rising popularity roughly coincides with the occupation, as Rikidozan and American wrestler Lou Thesz had a series of matches with then unprecedented popularity, propelling Rikidozan to one of the biggest celebrities in Japan and by far the most popular wrestler. (Think Hulk Hogan in the 80s or Stone Cold Steve Austin in the late 90s in terms of popularity, and even that may be understating Rikidozan's popularity. People were buying TVs solely to watch his matches.)  Anyway, the point is, I don't know if the part about it being the result of the US occupation is true. (A lot of people credit Thesz for that, but again, wrestling existed prior to Thesz' first tour of Japan and was gaining popularity. Rikidozan and Thesz just shot it into the stratosphere.)	1642799921.0	htnhvfu	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmgbg5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnhvfu/

The U.S. passed the *Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves* in the same year (full text of that Act [here](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sl004.asp)), but the U.S. did not participate as heavily in the policing efforts put into effect to try to stop the African slave trade.

4y0la	As far as I understand the SS didn’t need a reason to go into a house and they wouldn’t need a warrant. Standartenfuhrur is the same rank as Colonel, so no higher up approval is needed. As far as I know there was no such thing as an illegal search when it came to the Nazi's.   I don’t think they’d be afraid of reprisals from local French farms, most of them were starving and understood if they did attack there would most likely be reprisals. At this time France was either occupied or part of Vichy ; so SS officers would have a free reign over French citizens.    The SS would kill the Jews with in front of the locals if they felt it necessary to ‘teach’ the locals a lesson and make them fear hiding Jews on their property. That goes for the farmers/citizens who hid the Jews as well.    As far as newspapers goes, the local ones most likely would have been German controlled, so unless he had access to illegal newspapers… also as far as I know even the international newspapers didn’t report on the Jews being detained once the war started.   M. LaPadite would have been either killed on the spot or detained and questioned about others in his network hiding Jews. It was absolutely a crime, and he would have been either judged on the spot or at some sham trial. As I mentioned before the government was either a German one or a French/German (vVichy) one; it wouldn’t have mattered, either way he was in for torture or death or both.	1642801343.0	htnlu42	t3_s9fyue	t3_s9fyue	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fyue/inglourious_basterds_first_chapter_french_farmer/htnlu42/

qyjgc	A hut, hovel or otherwise semi-temporary dwelling (or work building, like byre, outhouse or other enclosure) would be well within medieval farmers capabilities, related as it is to hedging and dry stone walling (the latter is useful for building cottages). Wattle and daub is a simple and easy European and African building method. It can be made more substantial with timber framing, lime washing and flooring (pounded earth, mixed with water, ox blood or sour milk for a concrete like effect).  To the crux of the matter. Many, if not all, medieval villages are where they are for obvious reasons. Proximity to water, lumber and clay are the triad. Then, so often, they occupy a strategic position. We surmise from this that many villages are surviving work camps of lost or abandoned chateau or manor castles. A mobile community of technicians employed by these proto castles would be we call architects, and also another mobile workforce of masons and charpentiers, tule makers and potters also present. Then, why is your city there? There is a reason. And that reason will have people infrastructure (monastery abbot). Do you have money? Then borrow it.

29l5u844	The minute, as a measurement of time, didn’t exist.     During the Middle Ages, people used a combination of water clocks, sun dials, and candle clocks to tell time though none of those could tell time to the minute.  While the best water clocks told time to the quarter hour, it wasn’t until the wide use and improvement of mechanical clocks that people could tell time to the minute.        Even though the minute hand may have existed as early as the late 15th century, Jost Burgieven is credited with inventing it in 1577.  Still, it took over a century for the technology to spread as the minute hand wasn’t widely added to clocks until the 1680s.  &#x200B;  source:https://andreacefalo.com/2014/01/29/telling-time-in-the-middle-ages-5-things-you-didnt-know/	1642804201.0	htntl1j	t3_s9a5j3	t3_s9a5j3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9a5j3/would_someone_in_14th_century_france_know_if_2030/htntl1j/

g2ysgndq	I did a course on holocaust studies, and my answer is that the entire LaPadite family would be sent to the extermination camps with the Jewish family. However, in the film for cinematic purposes the family was shot, which is historically innacurate (to service a more cinematic tone and set up Landa's evil). By that time the Einsatzgruppen, Nazi death squads had stopped being used in service of more efficient methods of extermination, such as gas vans and gas chambers. LaPadote in the film was left alive under  Landa's choice just out of his own volition, I believe to psychologically torture the family patriarch for helping kill the family in the end.   As you can see Tarantino too many liberties to make the film better and Landa more evil.	1642806859.0	hto0k98	t3_s9fyue	t3_s9fyue	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fyue/inglourious_basterds_first_chapter_french_farmer/hto0k98/

a107fowh	from: u/EnclavedMicrostate    On top of this, modern East Asian martial arts owe a lot to Japan, in that Japanese martial arts in the early 20th century were perhaps the most formalised and professionalised, thereby setting expectations for martial arts in the rest of Asia, and also in that martial arts became a way for East Asian countries to assert a sense of identity in response to the Japanese ascendancy in the region. Before the term Wushu    (literally 'martial arts') was established as the standard by the Communist PRC, the Nationalist ROC referred to Chinese martial arts as  Guoshu, literally 'national arts' (or 'the national art'). As an aside, a comparable dynamic can be seen with Taekwondo, which, despite its internal narrative of being an ancient Korean art, is functionally a branch of Shōtōkan karate which was given a Korean nationalist rebranding after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, and used as part of the two new Korean states' attempts at nation-building in the post-colonial period.  ...."   This is an almost unknown fact. The Nationalist government officials, many of who had studied in Japan, consciously copied the Japanese use of martial arts training to stoke nationalist fervor and build strong bodies of use to the state, as they did many other aspects of the developmental Japanese state and society.   The role of Japanese martial arts in nation building and physical education was so well known in China that Mao's very first published work, a letter to a local newspaper when he was still a teacher, called out the programs of the founder of modern martial arts, Kanô Jigorô, as an example of successful physical education as a national program and necessity as an education tool.  (And as an aside, Mao staked out a position on the hundreds of years old argument regarding the influence of Chinese martial arts on Japanese *jûjutsu* through the person of one Chin Genping, 陳元贇, a 17th century Chinese immigrant to Japan. You can imagine Mao's position....)    [https://martialhistoryteam.blogspot.com/2020/05/annotating-wayne-muromotos-legacy-of.html](https://martialhistoryteam.blogspot.com/2020/05/annotating-wayne-muromotos-legacy-of.html)      The CCP destroyed the Nationalist *Guoshu* training school and banned the practice of it and use of the term, but replaced it with *Wushu* for the same purposes.   We'll disclose a number of the original players later in The Kanô Chronicles®, including Kanô Jigorô's role in educating many of the Nationalist and CCP leaders in the early 20th century.    [www.kanochronicles.com](https://www.kanochronicles.com)   From: u/XenophonTheAthenian   "Another thing that happens is that many techniques in East Asian martial arts are very old (or claim to be--in reality quite a lot of traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean martial arts is no older than the 1930s), or because of the rapid evolution in fighting styles and warfare the circumstances under which they were developed quickly become irrelevant and the original purpose of the technique or feature of the style becomes obscure. One of my go-to examples is the **tassels traditionally found on spears or swords** in many Chinese styles. Western students often find these things very funny, and it's hard to explain why they're there, practically. The usual explanation, that they serve to distract the enemy, is obvious nonsense. These tassels are, of course, insignia or just plain decorations in origin, but that isn't especially important. What is important is that techniques, often quite effective, have developed around the interpretation that they're there for distraction, long after the practical purpose of the feature has been rendered irrelevant. In that sense, the myth becomes more important than the reality....."  I searched Reddit for the answer and was surprised I couldn't find it, even though there is a very long post on exactly that topic.   As a cadet at the US Military Academy, one of my military history professors answered that question very simply: the tassels serve the necessary function of limiting the stroke of a spear or lance into an enemy's body.

f2whqo6j	First things first you need to understand the depth of what de-nazification means. That topic alone fills volumes so here a tiny little crumb of an overview from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification)   “Denazification in Germany was attempted through a series of directives issued by the Allied Control Council, seated in Berlin, beginning in January 1946. "Denazification directives" identified specific people and groups and outlined judicial procedures and guidelines for handling them. Though all the occupying forces had agreed on the initiative, the methods used for denazification and the intensity with which they were applied differed between the occupation zones.”  As outlined right here Nazis meaning those who would be opposed to teaching German Atrocities were removed from power, at least that was the idea.  The big power players in an education system would absolutely be less of an issue, to remove, but once you get down to a local level like a gym teacher that’s where people become hidden in the masses. At the same time your local gym teacher doesn’t have enough power to generate adequate pushback to be noteworthy. That isn’t to say one gym teacher couldn’t radicalise individual students but at least to my knowledge that never happened so it’s a mute point.  My grandmother (born 1951) tells a story of her German teacher who was a nazi during the ns time. Even after he remained a firm believer in the cause through and through. And he would always get worked up about the allies Atrocities like the bombing of Dresden and the bombing of langen and other hospital towns. Which I’m his eyes were an Atrocity to bomb once the German cities where he lived where bombed. Which true there is a point to be had and a discussion there but let’s not get side tracked.   He though wouldn’t outright deny the crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis. This can be due to several reasons but assuming he believed the crimes to be necessary or righteous in cause he wouldn’t admit to holding those beliefs publicly as he would have to face consequences[consequences (sorry only in German)](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/130.html) back then as much as now.[here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung) from Wikipedia the law while I shared the specific law it is also anchored in the german constitution as the first amendment that everyone is free to live from persecution.   So in short: not really I’ve never met anyone who knew anyone that provides adequate pushback beyond “well the allies did stuff too” on an individual level, in public, and no those put in power by the allies after the war didn’t cause any pushback either as their whole role was to be a force for denazification.	1642813221.0	htogbrs	t3_s9e4ue	t3_s9e4ue	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9e4ue/was_there_any_pushback_by_german_citizens_in/htogbrs/

56fvspbz	Not a historian myself but from what little i know project Manhattan had  no influence over Allies Axis war. As you know bombs were first used on Japan after Germany capitulated   How different would WWII end if Germans got bomb first? I doubt anything would change unless they would get it before 42 because after that they had no way of using it against their biggest enemy Soviets and while using it on England could force them to negotiating table but even then Germany would at most create one bomb due to their lack of meteriel and fact they couldn't just throw millions of marks into project that could not work at all (Unlike us that had both resources and money to waste thanks to them not being threatened by war at all). If England would be forced to pull out of war against Germany all i can see changing is Soviets loosing more man and whole of Germany ending up under their controll   Manhattan project saved 2mln ppl at least that's how many more would die according to plans of Invasion of mainland Japan. But I doubt Japan would keep on fighting after it saw Soviet monster devour Germany and as in our time Started rushing through Manchuria  Hirohito had too much to loose if Soviets captured Japan (Unlike allies communists had no reason to keep him alive once they captured the country)	1642814159.0	htoilyp	t3_s9olx6	t3_s9olx6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9olx6/did_new_mexico_play_a_crucial_role_in_the_outcome/htoilyp/

Beeswax candles are nearly the same as modern paraffin candles in the way that they burn. They burn faster most notably. As for the scent I've been disappointed in the complete lack of smell when burning beeswax more recently (not rona symptoms). The odor being described is no where near unpleasant in its strength or general bouquet.   I've seen an interesting chart showing the cost of lighting over time from oil lamps to LEDs.

7s4rt2oe	Like many places throughout Europe before the rise of Nationalism that followed the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon, countries were mostly formed of smaller regions loosely formed into a national identity. Before the revolution, France was separated into these regional identities. Most of these regions spoke languages that were based on the same family as French but had differences in accents, pronunciations, and even words.    These "langauges" would be things such as Picard, Burgundy, Alastian, Dauphiois, Bearnais, Bressan Champenois, Orléanais, ect. Totalling about 28 or so with some even sharing similar parts with German in regions bordering the German regions. The unification of the French under a common language started doing the revolution. Revolutionary Leaders such as Henri Grégoire reported that around 6 million Frenchmen didn't know the language and another 6 million or so could barely hold a conversation in it. Out of all the departments of France, only around sixth of them spoke French outside of Paris.   Part of Napoleon education policies in the Code Napoleon took steps to unify the population under one singular language as well. This happened through the outlawing of newspapers in regional dialects and the teaching of french in his new education system. This offers some irony as Napoleon famously had a hard grasp of the language himself and spoke with a thick accent due to his lineage and birth in Corsica, which language is closer to Italian. The need for unification under a language and common comprehension  was nessissary to properly rum an empire and military the size of Frances under Napoleon.    A good book that touches on the subject and is where some of my information comes from is Stuart Woolf's book Napoleon's Intergration of Europe.	1642819114.0	htoudna	t3_s9r5do	t3_s9r5do	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9r5do/what_languages_did_people_in_france_speak_before/htoudna/

For example, you could donate to a/the holocaust museum or to organization(s) dedicated to combating fascism, anti-semitism or other forms of bigotry perpetrated by Nazis and their sympathizers.  I know this suggestion probably sounds facetious, but it's not.

4p4fi	I'm sure a museum would be interested in them.   One of the most interesting experiences I've ever had at a museum was in the Halifax war museum (in the old fort there). They have a WW2 room with lots of Nazi stuff. The thing in there that really caught my attention was a soccer jersey worn by a German player when the Nazi's were in power. My family was driven out of Europe by the Nazis, many of them died, I really don't like Nazi's. But seeing that Jersey made me consider all the average Germans, many of whom may have not been very political at all, who ended up as Nazi's by association. People who were just pursuing whatever (soccer, science, etc.) and happened to come of age at the time of Nazism would have become associted with it in a sense, regardless of whether they were really Nazi's or not. I had never really thought about it, but that soccer jersey made it feel very real for me.  Trivial stuff can give you a lot of insight into history I think. If you don't want it it should go to a museum.	1642821583.0	htp073y	t3_s9qsbu	t3_s9qsbu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qsbu/how_do_i_ethically_get_rid_of_inherited_nazi/htp073y/

e7k4p	No, Bond is absolutely stereotypical Russian drunk.  It's absolutely absurd how much he drinks.  And yes, Bond is technically a spy.  His double-0 number and license to kill mean that he is allowed to make the call on if people need to be killed in the course of his duties (it's not necessary to have to to be assigned an assassination mission, he got it after completing of them), but his actual missions are based around intelligence activities, primarily espionage and sabotage. His first book was "We need you to go beat this guy in a game of cards to beat the commies". Various enemies point out how completely useless it is to have agents 'licensed to kill' in an agency that very rarely uses assassination, as opposed to the Russians having an entire dedicated agency just for that purpose.  On the other hand, he does kill a lot of dudes for varying reasons.  He also has a military rank (technically a holdover from his time in the navy during the war) and can call on British, NATO, or other allied military assistance when necessary, as long as he's not pretending to not be in their country.	1642823377.0	htp4a3a	t3_s99rlz	t1_htp3220	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htp4a3a/

One of the issues with the foodstuffs provided during the Occupation was that most of the milk was reconstituted powdered milk, which the US military had in quantity and could be easily shipped and stored.

wqsa0	Their involvement was in a conflict against the nascent Vietnamese communists mostly waged in 1946, before what we’d call the First Indo-China War. They were mostly Japanese troops who were already there, a fact exploited by the initially British-led mission that recruited them to the British, Indian and other forces they used to put down the communist rebellion. This influenced Ho Chi Minh both in terms of strategy and his attitude towards the West - he found the sudden ‘alliance’ with Japanese troops who hadn’t even gone home from their WW2 occupation yet evidence of Western perfidy.	1642833874.0	htpofsj	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmg2f8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htpofsj/

e49gp06y	Well "Germania" never really turned into anything because there simply never was a "Germania". It's a common misconception based on the false assumption of the Romans that the Tribes in the region which they called that were a lot more united than they actually were. The fact is that they only simply shared some common aspects of culture (including mythology/religion) and language. And when some of them then united for the Battle of Teutoburg Forest to beat the Romans so severely the myth was already but made. And even while the Chieftains murdered Arminius because he wanted to be King of all Tribes it didn't really matter anymore at that point.    The only reason why the Holy Roman Empire became a thing was because Charlemagne just conquered most of that Region and "united" the Tribes whether they wanted uniting or not. The only ones to come close to taking over all the Territory that "Germania Magna '' included were the Huns and even they never held that for more than a few years. The area was just extremely hostile for anybody who didn't know it. Large Armies and especially Cavalry had a pretty rough time in a place with lots and lots of thick Forrests and swamps (Moore). And after the collapse of the Roman Empire there was also just very simply nobody stupid enough to try again what one of the biggest Empires the world had seen back then utterly failed to achieve. But the Franks were (for the most part) "Germanic" (as well as celtic) themselves and so they had a much better base on which to expand their own sphere of influence into the territories of the region. Which is exactly what they did. The contribution to that came in a multitude of factors like them not being seen as much of an Invader as the Romans were who were utterly foreign to that part of Europe but also the fact that they already knew what was waiting for them there. In addition to that as time went on the Tribal societies in the region saw a couple of developments (such as the huns) and a lot of what outside societies were already used to was carried inwards toward tribes that were further away from the former Borders of the Roman Empire. The Border Regions were already appeased for many decades beforehand. Even under the Romans. So take the area from the Limes Romanus northward and put in quite some extra miles for Tribes that were very much used to less tribalized and more centralized societies. So if the Roman Empire had stuck around for some more centuries they could've simply pushed their border ever so slightly more northwards because most people close to it wouldn't have really minded becoming part of the Roman Empire. Simply put: Enough time had passed between the Fall of the Roman Empire and Charlemagnes ambitions (or generally the Franks) for the area to be a lot less hard to conquer but, make no mistake, conquer this still was (for the most part).    And then came Christianity already (again whether people wanted to or not) and the ground was practically ripe for a much more centralized form of Governing i.e. Feudalism.    As you mentioned however Germany has a pretty neat location. Because once you get rid of the forests and start drying up some of those pesky swamps, you get some extremely fruitful farmland. And in societies that are majorly agrarian, that's pretty useful and will result in giving people a generally better chance of Survival. Just like starting to drink Milk gave some Humans a much better chance of survival and subsequent prosperity then others. Adding to that the area of Germany saw the development of the Feudalist system at a time when it was just on its rise. Took a good while longer for it to make it further east and so regions more to the east were (especially through the influence of the Huns and Mongols) much more dominated by Tribal societies still. Then there's the fact that East Francia generally had a lot more Stability under Louis the German compared to West Francia under Charles the Bald.    Additionally the region also prospered from Slaves (mostly from Slavic tribes still at the time) as well as being geographically located very nicely right in the center of Europe at a time when trade started to flourish. So most people who would trade over land would have to go through the area of Germany from which they very much profited. And once the Holy Roman empire was established, that became even better because most of the Trading routes (at least the ones over land) from Italy went straight through the HREOGN. That very much included lots and lots of Trade coming from China. And since tariffs were a thing at that time pretty much at every corner, the area profited heavily from the trade across the Silk Road.    The HRE is very often romanticized and not very much understood because, to begin with, as Voltaire put it, it was neither Holy, nor Roman, nor really an Empire. It was much more a Federation of countless smaller Kingdoms and States who simply came together once every decade (or years) to elect an Emperor and that's about it. Not that the Emperor was always electable but it's a pretty good indicator that the biggest power within the HRE were the Monarchs of the single countries within it. And they were very much so still seen as single Independent countries. Which is why the HRE existed for so very long. Because it was never really much of an Empire to begin with and because the independent Rulers were just "helping each other out" (sometimes more, sometimes less \*cough30yearswarcough\*). And that's essentially how it all held together. And also why it constantly changed in shape and form. Not just because new areas were conquered or otherwise gained because some countries just joined and left from time to time. After the 30 year war the HRE wasn't even an Empire on Paper anymore and we basically had the same state of being that was the case at the time of the Roman Empire. A crapload of small states that were now officially states but agreed that being Holy and Roman sounded too good and having the chance of becoming Emperor also sounded too good for anybody to just say "nay" to. Even if at that time the Habsburger had been the only Emperors for about 200 years (and promptly got back in again after just two other houses). The HRE already proved that it had massive problems defending itself against Armies from countries that are actually united and not a loose formation of Vassal Armies that are sometimes okay with helping and other times don't care to lift a finger at all. But it became utterly clear beyond a shadow of a doubt with Napoleon and Austerlitz. Not saying that Napoleon couldn't have beaten a united army as well because the Russians were there, too. But the "Army" of the Emperor practically was only that of Austria and not really that of the entire HRE. In fact Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden even sided with Napoleon to begin with.    Hate to break it to you but the HRE was very far from "OP".    But Napoleon gave the "Germans" an actual reason to become "Germans" in the first place whereas before they never really had been. If it wasn't for Napoleon, "Germany" would likely still be just a fractured Rug of countless small states. At the very least Napoleon just united a lot of them and shifted them around to create less of a geographical clusterfuck.    In modern history "why Germany strong?" is mostly explainable by: The Prussians wanted a "united" Germany under their rule by any means necessary, mostly driven by the ambitions of Bismarck and anti-french Sentiments. And after Napoleon there weren't many who opposed the idea to begin with. Because while the HRE barely even mattered in the end, many still saw the defeat as a shame. And others tried their best to pretend it never happened. Like the Bavarians, Württemberg and Baden who, as mentioned, were on Napoleon's side (at first).	1642836654.0	htpstlr	t3_s9qb4q	t3_s9qb4q	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qb4q/what_made_germany_so_op/htpstlr/
e49gp06y	As to Germany's resources? Well Germany doesn’t really have many. In fact Germany is a very poor country just in terms of natural resources. But it does have craploads of coal. Which is why one of the first real “Industries” in Germany started to emerge in the “Ruhr area” which today is in “Nordrhein Westfalen” where coal was mined for decades on. And since coal was one of the most important resources during the age of industrialization it’s fair to say that Germany had already started out well in that regard. Most of these Territories were under Prussian rule. No surprise there. The Prussians were pretty effective in utilizing the State as a tool to subsidize private industry in a variety of ways. So where the British for example created their own undoing with their laissez faire politics in Ireland during the potato blight, the Prussians had a lot less issues with that since they simply subsidized people directly and encouraged sowing more grain etc.     The Prussians also significantly modernized their agrarian sector. Not just with Bismarck's tariffs on imported grain to strengthen local agricultural Industry (because, again, Germany was still very agricultural) but also with introducing the sugar beet as a primary crop as well as the switch to fertilizers and new, industrially, made tools etc. And since the Prussians just stuck with what they knew best, Germany became THE agricultural Powerhouse in Europe where other Nations had a lot more issues keeping up because they either didn’t have as much flat, fruitful land or simply focused more on other Industry.    Another big part of Germany becoming as rich and powerful as it did was the Education. The Prussians were mostly Protestants and introduced a general compulsory primary education system already in the 18th century, being among the first countries to do so. In addition Prussia required teachers to be certified by the state and had specific requirements at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Which was pretty important since it guaranteed a much higher standard in education. Meaning that they already laid the groundwork for later generations to bring out highly skilled and well educated workers and intellectuals. So lots and lots of great engineers with a lot of great Ideas and inventions such as the Dreyse Rifle. Germany later on just became extremely good at exporting their newest inventions. Because they invested in education much earlier than others did. Smart that.    But another part (which is sadly often forgotten) is the organization of labour and especially the Welfare State. Granted that only came in by 1880 but it did have a significant impact and generally put Germany a lot better off during every financial crisis that would follow compared to other countries.    However it should be made clear that the German States were way behind other Nations at the time until 1850. It took them quite a while to catch up to the Standards that Belgium, England or France were setting. And most of it only came after the unification of those states into the German Empire. Because while the Zollverein at least kept them capable of keeping up somewhat more than without it, the separation and completely different standards in economy made for a big hurdle.         The German Empire itself mostly kept to what Bismarck was already doing and therefore Prussia beforehand since “Prussian Values” became the dominating ethic at the time. Wilhelm II cranked the Industry up quite a notch since he wanted to compete with other Nations in terms of Military strength but we all know how that ended. I guess the newly acquired “Colonies” helped in giving Germany a further push in terms of Economy. Especially with the newly upcoming car-industry and Germany not only having been one of the first Nations to even build them but also then having gotten their hands on a very convenient source for Rubber in the German New-Guinea.         Weimar was… there… in terms of economy and considering what they had to put up with I’d say it ran surprisingly smooth.        And the less said about the terrible crap that claimed to be an “economy” of the Nazis the better. Which has nothing to do with my political views. Just that the economy of the Nazis ran completely and utterly on credit. Evident in the MEFO Bills and solely gambled on making the necessary money to pay them back by simply attacking and then exploiting other countries and their resources and finances. And, of course, the financial means of a huge part of the population which were deemed undesirable. So, yes, Not a “OP” mode at all. Just more or less a constant war-economy financed by loan after loan after loan and little else.        In summary:    The big unity of Germany is mostly completely overrated and at worst an absolute myth. Many of the interpretations of that are misconceptions based on the misconceptions of other people (like in the case of Germania Magna). Or just stylized and romanticized ideas of Nationalists in the 18th and 19th century who tried to create these legends of the great “Germania” united under the great Arminius. But there’s nothing actually to that because, as I mentioned, the chieftains killed Arminius as soon as he wanted to become their King. And the HRE was just a massive clusterfuck and never an actual Empire to begin with which was constantly plagued (pun not intended but still funny) by various conflicts and unrests pretty much from the very beginning. Like I mentioned: It only existed as long as it did because it was always much more a Confederation than anything else with an Emperor who, for the most part, didn’t have any real power beyond that of his own country and the Vassals and free cities loyal to him.    Then it got utterly obliterated by Napoleon and rightfully remade into much bigger pieces but was still just the “Flickenteppich” of Europe. Then Prussia starts to dominate because of a series of extremely valuable and important reforms both social as well as economical, becomes the German Empire, gets an Emperor who couldn’t care less about stability and has much bigger ambitions then he can afford, gets punched into submission, sees one of the most important Revolutions of our time, turns Fascist, fails again on big ambitions and ends up finding out in the end that it was best when it didn’t try to play Conqueror but instead focus on economic power especially based on education and most importantly skilled labor which brings a lot of innovation with it supported by high living-standards.	1642836660.0	htpstwj	t3_s9qb4q	t1_htpstlr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qb4q/what_made_germany_so_op/htpstwj/
e49gp06y	There always was a lot of criticism about Mother Teresa which was largely ignored by the Vatican however ([look here fore the official statement of the Vatican on her](https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_madre-teresa_en.html)). But there was a Study conducted in 2013 with the goal to look into her medical practices, her general believes as well as political views with the goals of finding a solid base for the criticism that was already brought up numerous times before ([click here for the study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0008429812469894)). There is also an Article about the Study [right here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401151627/http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20130301-mother-teresa-anything-but-a-saint.html) which gives a good summary so you don't have to pay for it.   The accusations ranged from embezzlement of founds over millions of dollars which were not invested in actual care for the sick because Mother Teresa held the opinion that the sick had to suffer like Christ on the Cross to find salvation. And to be fair the pictures of that hospice and its insides do not give any sort of impression that Millions of Dollars were invested at all. There are definite cases of Millions in Donations Documented like that of Charles Keating who donated 1.25 Million to the Hospice. And considering the substantial public attention she and her project got I would say it's very realistic to assume that they had no issues with money at all. According to "The Original Sin" by Gianluigi Nuzzi there was evidence of a secret Bank-Account of Teresa with the Vatican Bank but it's unknown how much money there was in it. Records of exact donations are very hard to come by.    On that note in an Article from 2010 Forbes Magazine wrote: "In early 2000, Susan Shields, a former Missionaries sister who left the organization "unhappy", created a furor by saying she herself had "written receipts of $50,000" in donation but there was no sign of the "flood of money." Forbes India talked to a volunteer in the Los Angeles office of Missionaries of Charity who admitted that "even when bread was over at the soup kitchens, none was bought unless donated."   Then there was the "Hell's Angel" documentary by Christopher Hitchens about Mother Teresa that brought up a lot of accusations against her in the public eye. He also wrote "The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice" on which his documentary is based. So you can either read the book or watch the documentary if you're interested. The info will mostly stay the same.  There is a substantial amount of evidence to support at least the claim that Teresa saw her work mostly as missionary first and actually caring for the sick second and that she really wasn't as good and well meaning as it is often presented by the Vatican and other sources that are interested in keeping her picture as a saint alive.	1642840249.0	htpy31g	t3_s9ux62	t3_s9ux62	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9ux62/is_mother_teresa_controversial/htpy31g/
e49gp06y	Lincoln wrote in a [Letter to Joshua Speed](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm) in 1855:  "I am not a Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor or degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that "all men are created equal." We now practically read it "all men are created equal, except negroes" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read "all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics." When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocracy"  In contrast to that, here is a direct quote by Benito Mussolini:"\[When the\] city dies, the nation – deprived of the young life-blood of new generations – is now made up of people who are old and degenerate and cannot defend itself against a younger people which launches an attack on the now unguarded frontiers \[...\] This will happen, and not just to cities and nations, but on an infinitely greater scale: the whole White race, the Western race can be submerged by other coloured races which are multiplying at a rate unknown in our race."([sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_(book)))And to add even more context, here's a passage from a Speech held by Mussolini in Bologna, April 3. 1921"How then was this Fascism born; amid what tumultuous passions, sympathy, hatred, bitterness, and incomprehension? It was not only born in my mind and in my heart; it was not only born in that meeting held in March 1919 in the little hall at Milan; it was born of the profound and perennial need of this our Mediterranean and Aryan race, which felt the essential foundations of its existence threatened by a tragic folly and a mythical tale which today crumbles to pieces, in the very place where it was born"([sauce](http://bibliotecafascista.blogspot.com/2012/03/speech-in-bologna-april-3-1921.html))  That's just for Mussolini and therefore Italian (and original) Fascism. I guess I don't really need to make a case about Nazi-Germany and their Fascism in this regard. And since the overwhelming Majority of Fascists were equal eugenicists it's probably fair to say that Lincoln would have not at all liked them. Lincoln was, in essence, a Liberal by the standards of his time. I don't think any of his views would've been compatible with what fascism is at its very core.

tl0jj	Mother Theresa utilized faith based approaches to her victims.  This meant that she didn't mistreat them per se, but she didn't treat them either. Pain and suffering was considered by her to be a gift from god. Medicine would only get in the way of her victims best interests:  *“Pain and suffering have come into your life, but remember pain, sorrow, suffering are but the kiss of Jesus - a sign that you have come so close to Him that He can kiss you.”*   What makes her so reviled by so many is that for herself, she changed her beliefs and accepted plenty of medical care to ease her own suffering.  Her funding often came from troublesome sources like a Haitian dictator and didn't seem to make it to the needy in her care. Some estimates were as low as 7% of donations actually feeding or providing medicine to those she was "caring" for.   This is all subjective to a degree though. If you're Roman Catholic you may agree with her stances. If not, then she's pretty filthy in so many ways.	1642842612.0	htq1fyo	t3_s9ux62	t3_s9ux62	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9ux62/is_mother_teresa_controversial/htq1fyo/
e49gp06y	Since it was one of the first earthquakes actively witnessed and documented in modern history it was pretty much the starting point of the science of seismology and a substantial push for science in general to seek different explanations rather then "God did it".   As a matter of fact there are several examples of Philosophers or Artists who are counted as part of the Enlightenment writing about this like Immanuel Kant, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist ([click](https://unterrichten.zum.de/wiki/Erdbeben_von_Lissabon#Heinrich_v._Kleist)). With Kant, yet again, being the worst possible offender in terms of titles:   "On the causes of the earthquakes on the occasion of the disaster which affected the western countries of Europe towards the end of last year"   "History and description of the nature of the most remarkable events of the earthquake which shook a large part of the Earth at the end of the year 1755"   "Immanuel Kant's continued consideration of the earthquakes that were felt some time ago"   And then there's also Voltaire himself with his Poem: "Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne"   or "[Poem on the Lisbon Disaster](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55316a91e4b06d7c3b435f17/t/5f0b98212d6235002623d7dd/1594595362627/Voltaire+-+Poem+on+the+Lisbon+Disaster.pdf)"  There is also a [Study on the Topic](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3155961?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) as well.

vrnrs	If you mean uneducated then yes. Prior to late 19th century public education the vast vast majority of people did not receive an education coming close to what even a 10 year old today receives.  But if you mean stupid. Well that has many things that contribute to intelligence/stupidity.  Poor nutrition, particularly iodine deficiency has shown a 15 IQ point difference.   Hookworm in the american south affected 40% of the population which led to lower health that many considered lazy and stupid.    The industrial revolution saw metric shit tonnes of lead, mercury and other toxic materials spewed into human environments. Leaded petrol in the 20th century took this to new heights.  Compare that to a modern person who isn't exposed to lead, mercury, has a balanced diet and gets 6 hours a day in a classroom and yeah, people in the past were "stupid"  > It wasn't until the development of the laser rangefinder in the 1960s that artillery was moved out the realm of guesswork  Oh wow....   So Napoleon, dude who almost conquered Europe, did so as an artillery officer. Back then artillery was the lame branch. Proper officers joined the cavalry to gain more glory. Then napoleon with his pansy arse math and calculations comes along and dominates the battlefield.  You might have learnt to navigate using a compass with 360 degrees, however most artillery officers well before ww1 were working in 6400 mils instead. At 1 kilometre distance a difference of 1 mil was 1 metre. If my artillery shells are falling 50 metres off i know to adjust my aim by 50 mils. You also had arc angles and range calculations, calculating powder loads and shell weights.

They were meant to besiege castles and besiege cities.

hcz1cyuu	Ancient Greeks had nothing in common with Islamic laws in general ! There is nothing Islamic that can be compared with NONE of different Ancient Greek city-states/tribes !! Especially if you think that Minoans were a matriarchichal society and the gene was determined by the mother and not the father especially among Minoan Royals ! Grecian style fashion would be probably very revealing and scandalous/haram for Islamic standards ,it was even considered as scandalous and provocative for male nature among Ancient Persians and Semites too.  Ancient Greeks according to their tribe/state had different laws offcourse but they never excluded their women from other men's eyes that is so hilarious !!! If they wanted to "hide" them they wouldn't dress them so feminine and desirable !!!  Many Greek tribes had laws though to prevent their own Greek women (and Greek men) from mixing with non Greeks and even more especially the Greek women ,because firstly the Greeks were either being attacked as a peaceful nation and they got enslaved at times so they wanted to protect their women and therefore their existance by this and secondly for Ancient Greeks the woman's womb was considered as "sacred" ,for my ancestors life is created inside women they compared women's womb with universe so they needed their women for reproduction not to be used to breed with other rulers . After the fall of East Byzantine empire when Greeks became slaves ,either they were under Ottomans or under British or under Venetians or French (frangoi) the Greek families were making agreements-engagements for their underage kids by promising their daughters/sons to other Greek families and they were marrying them at the proper age . This sounds weird for today's standards but it kept us alive and we are not extinct . Many Greek girls/Greek women had abortions when they got pregnant by their rulers !  Another thing simeone can learn about Ancient Greeks like Athenians and Macedonians is that they were punishing the lover of married man's wife not the wife (?!?) ,the cheated Greek husband chose the punishment for his wife's lover ,he could choose either the public humiliation (softest) either painful death (hardest) ! The unfaithful Greek wife had to suffer with her actions consequences .... Sometimes and foreign lovers were being slaughtered for mixing with the Greek wives ! For examble one of the most famous and notorious cases of antiquity was when the Macedonians found out that Persian men ,envoys  from Persia ,were having romantic/sexual affairs with Royal Greek Macedonian women of the palace and this caused cheated Royal Greek Macedonian men's deep anger and they ordered the Persian men's slaughter ! Persians send Noble Persian engineer and Xerxes cousin Bubares for further investigation because the families of the Persian envoys they had no clue about the situation or what happened to their men and were furious too . Alexander in an excellent diplomatic move he gave Bubares his young and beautiful Royal half sister Gygaea to silence the matter and keep peace !!!  So i guess we Greeks can be a really weird bunch people sometimes with uncommon habbits !!!!	1642855430.0	htqjjwj	t3_ref5nu	t3_ref5nu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ref5nu/one_of_the_crimes_the_roman_governor_of_sicily/htqjjwj/

The one thing I found absurd was: Chamberlain literally throwing aside a piece of German intelligence sight unseen. (Would he really be that stupid? Even if was going through with the signing, why would you not even have MI-6 vet it?)  Also was Chamberlain in staying over at a British consulate in Munich?  Because otherwise the Gestapo would have _thoroughly_ bugged Chamberlain's residence and known about the German turncoat;  he would have been immediately arrested.	1642874985.0	htrr7o6	t3_s9fm6k	t3_s9fm6k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fm6k/the_movie_munich_edge_of_war_asserts_that_the/htrr7o6/

gpxwtj5c	An American here with a BA in History concentrating in 20th century history.  The answer to your question of whether the US saved Britain twice is, maybe maybe not.  I don't like to play "what if" because there are so many variables some obvious some less so that it is impossible to consider them all.  Let examine WW I first.  A great many of the population in the US were against joining in WW I with some favoring joining Germany.  The British went to great extremes to sway US public opinion in the US including cutting the transatlantic cable connecting the US with Germany so they could control news flowing to the US.  The British and French led a campaign to get the US to join the war on their side but their idea was for the US just to supply men who they would train and push into the meat grinder of the trenches.  The US refused and would only supply troops if they remained under US command.  That is why the US did not really enter the war until mid way through 1918.  The French, British and allies had fought to stalemate against the German and allies.  All were literally running out of men and material.  Losses had been horrendous, heavy guns were shot out and supplies of food and munitions were running out.  I do not beleive the war would have lasted through 1918 regardless of American intervention.  What US intervention did provide was to give the upper hand to the French and Britain who did not even allow the US to participate in negotiations.  My conclusion is that US intervention did not "save" Britain but did give them the upper hand since the new troop influx conclusively tipped the balance towards the French/Britain alliance with Germany unable to continue the war.   Now fast forward to WW II.  Britain and Europe are still reeling from the losses in WW I.  Hitler rose to power and immediately started rebuilding Germany and German military.  His long term plan was always to re-establish Germany as a European power and a player on the world stage.   Spending on the military probably allowed the German economy to grow faster than the rest of Europe.  Great Britain on the other hand was still reeling from the losses, in WW I, the Great recession and the cost and effort to control and empire that was starting to challenge colonialism.  They tried to negotiate away the war and thought they had succeeded but of course there policy of appeasement failed and Germany crossed the line in the sand and invaded Poland and it was off to war.  Once again there was a strong anti war stance in America.  It was a European problem and did not involve the US.  A neutrality act was passed that forbid the US from providing arms to either side.  This included the European theater and the Pacific Theater.  Now IMHO this caused Britain to start the war in a lot bigger hole than when they started WW I.  The Germans were dealt a blow with the Battle of Britain but the British did not come out unscathed.  A lot of resources were expended.  By this time the US had found ways around the Neutrality Act and was supplying Britain with some supplies.   Britain was still spread thin with war all over the world.  Would they be able to sustain it.  Remember at this time Russia was still in bed with Hitler.  They had divided Poland between them and both had their eyes on Finland.  Germany was in the driver's seat.  Now the what ifs.  What if the Japanese had not attacked Pearl Harbor?  What if the US had remained neutral?  That is not unimaginable.  Lots of people still remembered how the French and British excluded the US at the end of WW I.  I think a best case senerio the British would have had to cede Europe to Hitler to hang on to their island and a worst case Hitler would have bided his time and tried to invade Britain at a later time.  But none of that happened.  The US entered the war.  Ramped up production and supplied arms to the world, despite the Russian disagreement with that, as well as huge numbers of troops.  In the case of WW II I think there is a strong argument that the US saved Great Britain and is also solidified US Great Britain relations which had not been that strong before.	1642898919.0	htteheb	t3_safmna	t3_safmna	/r/AskHistorians/comments/safmna/america_saved_britain_twice_in_the_last_two_world/htteheb/

1ng9p2sn	Lots of things going on he and it hard to follow, this is understandable since Sykes-picot has become a buzzword but its just one part of a very large puzzle. Its also all controversial and people are still at war over fine details about all things that happened back then with all these agreements and treaties.  There are many more agreements and treaties then just the once you mentioned. Russia actually maybe the most relevant part of those agreements but that mainly concerns what is now Turkey so its far less interesting then talking about the Arab Middle East that is today in the media more.  Of course Russia because of the revolution fell out any agreements. So whatever was agree there was no longer relevant.  The Versailles treaty establishes some mandates that were broadly along the lines of the agreements signed during the war just in a different form, I will get into that more later. The actual treaty that was supposed to settle with the Ottoman Empire, was 'Treaty of Sèvres' and it was only signed in 1920.  However, what old men decide in ball room often has little barring on reality. The situation in the East continued long after WW1 was supposedly over (usually dated 1914-1918 but fighting continued in many places). The Turks lead by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk rejected the treaty and wanted to establish a strong Turkic state, rather then at best a rump state. This was successful.   The Treaty of Sèvres was dead, and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923. So between Lausanne and Versille 'The Eastern Question' was basically answered, the Ottoman Empire that had existed for centuries was gone. The collapse of the Ottoman empire that had been going in slow motion for decades had happened. The Islamic Caliphate was also ended at that point.  The agreements during the war had stated that Russia would get Constantinople, this of course didn't happen. National Turkey had also captured much of Eastern Anatolia. There was not gone be any kind of Kurdistan because the US had no interested in backing its creation with boots on the ground and nobody else did either.  In the Arab Middle East, the Mandate system took hold. What that essentially means is that British and French empires can't call the areas colonies. The idea of Mandates was that they would eventually be turned into real states and that the Empires were there to guide them there.  One thing to understand is that these agreements didn't come from nothing, they reflected already existing relationships and influence the nations had into the Ottoman state. France had been eyeing Syria for a long time. Britain had long been holding Kuwait as a protectorate. Egypt had been basically independent for a long time. Now the region was divided officially between French and British mandates, or what we would traditionally call Spheres of Influence.  Sykes-picot Map:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/MPK1-426_Sykes_Picot_Agreement_Map_signed_8_May_1916.jpg  The famous 'Line in the Sand' from Sykes-picot, that was famously symbolically removed in one of ISIS propaganda videos still existed. However, it was quite different then it was in 1916. This was mainly because oil had been discovered around Mosul in the French sphere and Britain want that for itself.  So Britain pulled that into its sphere. Palestine went from international to British as well.  Partly these changes happened because Britain was simply more powerful relatively then France. The war had ruined France. Mosul is not easily governed from French Syria and it would have been costly to do. France had always been most interested in the Christians there. Georges Clemenceau has more important issues he cared about then Mosul and Palastine. It makes sense from a logistical perspective to be part of civilization along the rivers going North-South as it had been for 1000s of years.  Mandate Map:  https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4cb7d78182c51e83b1364b5164908a91.webp  Both Britain and France eventually split up their regions. France split of the most Christian part of Syria into a new country called Lebanon. Britain create the Jordan and Palestine. Kuwait remained its own entity, the rest of the British mandate of Mesopotamian turned into Iraq.  Interestingly, these borders have proven to be incredibly strong and for the most part remain unchanged today. This means surprisingly Middle Eastern borders have been more stable for longer then most borders in Europe and some other places in the world.	1642900988.0	httj799	t3_sa9mb7	t3_sa9mb7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa9mb7/what_did_the_treaty_of_versailles_do_to_the/httj799/

o35mx	With respect, I'm not sure this is a a comparison you can really make, nor is it necessarily true.  First of all, the United Kingdom- both now and in pre-industrial times- had about five times the population of the Netherlands. This is not insignificant. And, as you note, the British are not a continental power and thus can defend themselves via sea power. Furthermore, an independent English-British nation has existed for more than twice as long as a united Dutch nation, so that changes things as well. So, I wouldn't argue that they're similar nations other than Germanic languages, protestant Christianity, and a history of naval power.   Secondly, the South African comparison isn't really valid because Apartheid isn't the Dutch. The Afrikaners may speak what was once a dialect of Dutch, yes, but it was the British who took control of the Kaapkolonie in the Napoleonic Wars, and who oversaw the expansion of the colony based in Cape Town, eventually conquering the Boers, who would form (part of) the basis of what became today's Afrikaners. These people officially stopped answering to the Dutch Government when the British took the colony, although from what I've read many of the Boers entirely ignored any Dutch government as well, prior to this. By the time we get to Apartheid in 1948, there'd been a generation or two of entirely British government in South Africa. Furthermore, it's worth noting that (as far as I've read), the English-speaking White South Africans did support Apartheid, even if they didn't support it as much initially.   Finally, I'm not sure you can compare the Dutch East Indies vs what became modern Malaysia. Indonesia has thousands upon thousands of islands, and has an order of magnitude more population. The Dutch East Indies were a single, centralized colony; the British had a variety of protectorates and vassals, plus Singapore, which eventually were (mostly) combined into a single state post-WWII.  You might be able to do a better comparison to the British Raj, which is not renowned as gentle.   I'm not an expert nor even a historian, so I can't really comment on the specifics of Dutch or British colonialism, but I do argue, then, that it's hard to compare the two, as they're really too different, or at least can only be judged on a case-by-case basis.	1642920625.0	htuorvj	t3_sakj6q	t3_sakj6q	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sakj6q/why_were_the_dutch_such_brutal_colonialists/htuorvj/
dicoh5b3	Growing up I was taught the British were some of the worst colonists to ever rule us…and we had the Portuguese and the French colonize us too. I’ve always wondered how people arrived at that belief.

c2nytszl	If I recall correctly, Mussolini came up with the idea and conceived the Munich Conference as a means of resolving an imminent war. The British and French caved in, expecting that once the German lands were unified, Hitler would abandon his desire for further expansion, but they were rather foolish since German ambassadors/diplomats briefed the British that Hitler was preparing for war, and their warnings were overlooked. Another consequence of the Munich Agreement was the Soviet Union's reunion with Nazi Germany, and Hitler's popularity in Germany rocketed, making resistance efforts in the German military increasingly difficult.    Simply put, I believe the extra time was probably essential to demonstrate that Hitler was the monstrous individual he is, as he wanted to provoke a war by any means.	1642945445.0	htvn1r1	t3_s9fm6k	t3_s9fm6k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fm6k/the_movie_munich_edge_of_war_asserts_that_the/htvn1r1/

gqydb	The gist of it is that primaries back then, for President, were basically irrelevant. The nominee was determined at the national convention of the parties by slates of delegates nominated by state party conventions. The primaries had no impact on the convention, so candidates were generally not paying any real attention to them, and in most of these states only one candidate was on the ballot, and often not even under their own name but using a prominent local supporter like a Senator or Governor as a "favorite son" candidate to showcase their affiliation with them.   Genuine primaries awarding delegates to the national convention became more popular in some states after WW2, and beyond that competing in primaries became a more important litmus test for measuring public support of Presidential candidates, but it wasn't until 1976 that primaries became clearly the most important part of the nomination process and awarded a majority of delegates to the convention.	1642948059.0	htvs1ms	t3_saotqd	t3_saotqd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saotqd/why_were_the_results_of_the_1932_democratic/htvs1ms/
gh16flt8	Well in short, very. But it did depend, on the commander, the environment, and of course the period. Legionaries under General (and Consul) Marius for instance we’re called ‘Marius’ mules’ for how hard he worked them.  But they were (often) required to March an average of 20-25 miles a day, with 25kg then build a fort at the end of it. So would have been pretty tough.  Saying that, the fitness of a lot of other soldiers in the ancient world would also have been pretty impressive.	1642949064.0	htvu4ou	t3_saswy0	t3_saswy0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saswy0/how_physically_fit_were_roman_soldiers_in_the/htvu4ou/

ueays37	I am no academic expert on WW2 explosives, but I am a person who lives in the South East of England and can tell you that, anecdotally, I know of a handful of unexploded WW2 bombs that have been discovered near where I live during my lifetime, and the bomb squad has had to be called out to defuse them. It is definitely not an unknown thing, and happens semi-regularly. There is a list of some recent ones that have been found here:  * January 2022 - Norfolk, England - [Boat damaged after WW2 bomb accidentally detonated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-60071673) * July 2021 - Goole, Yorkshire, England - [Army detonates WW2 bomb discovered on motorway](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/24/evacuations-in-goole-for-detonation-of-500lb-second-world-war-bomb) * February 2021 - Exeter, Devon, England - [WW2 bomb detonated after homes evacuated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-56226798) * April 2019 - Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England - [WW2 bomb detonated close to Southend Pier](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-47814664)  In terms of how explosive these bombs were I'm not qualified to say, but there is a resource that tracks the quantity of explosive material dropped. "Bomb Sight"is run by the National Archives, and has mapped every bomb that fell during the London Blitz (7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941), with information about the dates of said bombings and extra information. You can find it [here](http://bombsight.org/#13/51.5130/-0.1006). London was, of course, not the only British city to experience bombing (Coventry's cathedral was quite famously destroyed in the Coventry Blitz on 14 November 1940), but it has probably been the most extensively researched. "Bomb" Sight would probably be a good place to start if you wanted to find out more.  **Sources**  * "Bomb Sight", National Archives * BBC News * The Guardian	1642953226.0	htw3syc	t3_sar5v5	t3_sar5v5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sar5v5/i_often_hear_about_the_discovery_of_unexploded/htw3syc/
1sgoccr4	Yes.  American production and experience proved crucial for both wars, primarily the former.  The US *dominated* production of pretty much everything due to their vicegrip on the emerging energy source of the day, oil.  Oil was explored and exploited extensively first in America, with Standard Oil building up to a nationwide monopoly by the turn of the century. By WW2 America alone constituted 70% of worldwide oil production, and that is gradual *decline* as more oil elsewhere in the world was found and exploited.  Their industries implemented oil quicker and in abundance, allowing for a competitive advantage that surpassed the rest of the world. Powering groundwater pumps and providing industrial fertilizer also made their food hyper competitive as well, serving as another dominant export that remains the case today.  Anyone who wanted to remain competitive had to import American oil to some degree, and in doing so be on good terms with the US. More importantly pay in US dollars, not the British pound.  As for experience, the European powers were unaccustomed to the total war that was seen in the US Civil War. Most of the wars 1850s onwards were short decisive battles that didn't last more than a year or two.  They were not experienced with the type of warfare the US had already experienced 50 years before. Trench warfare with artillery and machine gun (Gatling guns) caused mass deaths in the Civil War. US Civil War taught the importance of industrial warfare, to use industry and manpower advantages to grind the other side to dust.	1642954646.0	htw7cdp	t3_safmna	t3_safmna	/r/AskHistorians/comments/safmna/america_saved_britain_twice_in_the_last_two_world/htw7cdp/

1ouz4fvr	I am interested in this as well.  I am living the part of Indiana jones where they box up the lost ark and put it into storage.  I am working on a daughters of the American revolution book on for the 250 anniversary of American revolution (2026) my chapter is working on a book that Is what happened to our area (we have a French and Indian war fort) during the revolution. So we are explaining what happened after the French and Indian war, to make this more confusing the records call this American rev war Fort the same name as the British fort.   Basically its an ego trip of 2 women especially. I am sitting there with several more 20 somethings as the assistants.   they are looking for a powder horn that someone found and donated to Fort X (its French and Indian) its carved with Fort X with date 1776 so its actually the American revolution fort. with an etching of a fort on it. literally has the name of it.  Long story short Fort X left it go on display at another museum so my team is contacting 4 other places to find out where is Fort X (still owns it) powder horn. I swear we are going to these musueum and look into their storage ourselves.  I have told people and all they said was we do not work for a newspaper like I want to write a fantasy story. I wish.

cnphbl8l	My dissertation at university was on the Knights Templar, obviously that doesn't mean I'm  an authority on the matter, but I'm not sure what you mean by part of the Catholic church.  In essence they were a monastic order that followed their own specially devised monastic rule. The Latin Rule as it was called, was devised by Bernard of Clairveaux in 1128. It was very similar to the earlier Rule of St Augustine.  From their inception, the Templars were an oddity. Swearing to live a monastic life but also bearing arms to defend pilgrims on crusade. It was only once they'd received the patronage of Clairveaux and the support of Pope Innocent II that they became more of an official Catholic monastic order.	1642957803.0	htwfgsf	t3_sawspf	t3_sawspf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sawspf/were_the_knights_templar_always_part_of_the/htwfgsf/

There is also a concept called "Pikuach Nefesh," which basically states that the preservation of human life comes before almost every other commandment. If a Jew found themselves in a situation in which their only option was to orally take pork insulin, they would be allowed to do so by Jewish law.	1642958950.0	htwih86	t3_sautz9	t3_sautz9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htwih86/

2rcoj	As a white Powwow fan in the United States, I feel that I can address this a bit. It's the word costume that is important. If it looks like a Halloween costume it is not appropriate. It's like wearing black face. An attractive Powwow outfit is usually acceptable because mostly everyone realizes that they are a modern invention anyway. But there are old lines drawn that will not be crossed. Such as "Thou shalt not wear a war bonnet unless you deserve to wear a war bonnet". At least at a Native Gathering. Karneval is a different story. The New Orleans Mardi Gras is just crazy and fun and there really is no use complaining about all the cultural appropriation going on there.	1642960648.0	htwmxvv	t3_savz63	t1_htw6xle	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwmxvv/

I understand your frustrations. The fact that you’re trying to understand your education is a step in the right direction. Think of history as an in-between of science and art: we can study concrete things, but at the end of the day it’s up to us to interpret that information to the best of our abilities. A LOT of my graduate work was just juxtaposing many viewpoints on the same topic—connecting the dots to see what the story was.   Keep connecting those dots. Ask tons of questions.

h8ny3uyr	I’m not OP, but they are gone and I do have some experience with this in Germany.  German culture (most of Central/Western Europe really) is shocking, patronisingly racist against Native Americans. I expect most Germans would deny that, as they love _die Indianer_ so, so much, but it is true.   That love is of an infantilised genetic “native,” indistinguishable from any other on the continent, exactly maybe from “the other ones” in Central and South America.   In Germany; _die Indianer_ are all wise and nature-loving, childlike in their goodness and faith in others, brave and almost supernatural in their physical abilities, a simple belief system and a simple culture you can master in a few weekends. The stereotypes aren’t bad per se, but they are pretty insulting.   And even for those who don’t actively play dress-up Indian, “generic Indian”  is a [popular costume](https://image.stern.de/8595620/t/j0/v3/w1440/r1.7778/-/karneval.jpg) at carnival, a good [kids birthday theme](https://www.pink-dots.de/tipps/spiele-fuer-den-indianergeburtstag), a ]reasonable idea for a comic, animated series and a recent movie](http://zkmb.de/decentering-mans-place-in-the-universe-yakari-and-its-visual-representation-of-native-americans/)  I’m not surprised that the kind of person who reflected on and researched so little when they were trying to “reenact Indians” continued that behaviour when choosing a side in re-enacting the Civil War (which itself is weird. It’s not like Europe never had any wars here they could reenact.

What could have been done differently to change the outcome?  What went right and wrong?    AP History is also intended to teach you how to write critically.

anyry7th	Many barangay settlements operated via subsistence farming, diffusing into smaller groups once the number of inhabitants grew too large. The archipelagic nature of the Philippines further encouraged populations to spread out, allowing each settlement to exercise political autonomy. Early Spanish reports describe barangays sprinkling the coastlines of Luzon and the Visayas, each with about 30-100 households.   These socio-political units could merge for mutual benefit however. Pre-conquest Manila, estimated at 500 households, and Cebu, probably at 200-250, were comprised of multiple barangays linked by trade and intermarriage between their elites. Group consensus was vital in these settings, and the ties that bound leaders and followers were on a deeply personal basis. This meant that loyalties could shift based on the capability of the leadership.   The Spanish could therefore win over barangays piecemeal which made the task easier but also slowed things down. The diffused settlements made them logistical headache to control, made only feasible by delegating responsibilities to the Catholic Church, encomenderos, and native elites.  Elsewhere, the Islamification of barangays in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago gave rulers additional legitimacy based on religion. A sultan’s authority could be justified by asserting his direct (or indirect) lineage to the Prophet Muhammad. This led to the creation of the Sultanates of Sulu and Maguindanao, both of which resisted Spanish incursions for centuries.	1642995841.0	htz3zrc	t3_rw72tc	t1_hs37p8r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rw72tc/how_come_the_philippines_ended_up_colonized_but/htz3zrc/

240c8n9e	I have read the rules regarding responses, and I don’t want to fall afoul of them, but I have to take issue with the premise of the question, “being called a gorilla is a common insult in Japan.” I have a degree in Japanese literature (albeit post-war, not ancient), am employed as a translator, and have lived in Japan since 2004. Though I’m not sure how you would measure such a thing, being called a gorilla as an insult in Japanese would be no more or less common than being called a gorilla as an insult in English. There is even a gorilla in Higashiyama Zoo named Shabani who is famous for how handsome he is. He’s somewhat of an unofficial mascot for the city of Nagoya, where I live, as he’s been used by the city in municipal advertisements. I have also never encountered in my academic studies, professional work, or personal life a negative reputation attributed to gorillas. Babies and people with relatively “simian” features such as large ears are sometimes referred to as “猿”(saru), meaning “monkey” in general, but the reputation of monkeys as a whole doesn’t suffer from this.   I understand if this answer does not meet the criteria for a proper response, so no hard feelings if the mods delete it.	1642997030.0	htz6mf4	t3_sb9ad3	t3_sb9ad3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb9ad3/being_called_a_gorilla_is_a_common_insult_in/htz6mf4/

pho6o	In John Holland’s ‘Hitler’ it is claimed most of his wealth and the parties came from private backers who were among Germany’s old aristocratic elite and German businessmen who saw Hitler’s Nazi’s as the lesser evil compared to the social democrats and communists. Many also were actively anti Semitic and very supportive of Hitler beyond financial reasons.   In Ian Kershaw’s ‘Hitler’ he says that the money received from the profits of Mein Kampf made him independently rich for the rest of his life. Even though he continued to be gifted money and houses and other expensive gifts after this by many private admirers who were similar to the crowd John Holland mentions.   Ian Kershaw claims that the Nazi’s before the Beer Hall Putsch were usually in some sort of financial issues and Hitler himself relied on entirely private donations of an unknown amount and origin.   So Kershaw believes the Beer Hall Putsch, the following trial and Hitler writing Mein Kampf in prison was the turning point in political and financial fortunes for the Nazi’s.   Up until his death Hitler would not have financially wanted for anything just based on Mein Kampf’s income alone.

5adbc98u	>the ways that they filtered out the reasons that the CSA seceded, and its commitment to maintaining the enslavement of Black Americans, were startling to me.

pho6o	Not to be rude but that has nothing to do with what I said.   There are clear expectations when writing about Hitler and Nazism, one of them requires the downplay of any successes of the regime or its members and the focus upon mistakes. Most writers will write more about the failure at Dunkirk than the victory of France, and many believe they are actually working against the creation of future neo nazis by doing so. But the opposite seems to be true, though I can’t say that with academic certainty.   There are multiple times where both Holland and Kershaw almost apologise for mentioning anything positive about him and instantly regale the reader with a criticism or negative assessment as compensation. The point isn’t that Hitler should be praised or critiqued but that history shouldn’t be blurred simply for the sake of the writers personal beliefs. If a writer can’t stomach the idea of writing anything about Hitler that isn’t almost entirely negative, maybe they shouldn’t be writing about Hitler?   And you haven’t read much Hitler biographies if you think historians don’t judge personalities, they most certainly do.   Kershaw’s book spends lavish amounts of times trying to depict negative personality traits of Hitler and trying to explain a lot of the history away with such rather gossipy and ahistorical assessments. He gossips endlessly about Hitler, at the cost of actual historical discussion. Again it’s more a social history at times, and he is willing to believe preposterous negative stories because that suit his personal beliefs. For example he chooses to believe that Hitler got on his knees with one of his early followers wife and claimed to be her eternal slave or something like that. The only source for this is ofc the women who he supposedly said this to, who had every reason after the war to try and distance her and her husband from him as much as possible. But Kershaw is happy to use this and equally questionable sources but he considers the account of Hitler’s long term childhood friend to be almost entirely false. He ignores most of what his childhood friend says and instead creates his own narrative which is based on exceptionally little actual sources. Again it isn’t that Hitler doesn’t deserve to be criticised or whatever, it’s that Kershaw thinks it’s ok to basically invent and warp the narrative as he sees fit.   This is just one small sample of the complexities and cheap immaturity’s that makes Hitler and Nazism very complex and frustrating topics to discuss with an even somewhat historically valid framework.	1643010650.0	htztfe1	t3_sbczey	t1_htzs2em	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/htztfe1/
12hxe3	The marshal-plan largely is the answer for that.  West germany got granted a five year protection period to rebuild its economy and vast loans to companies to finance the rebuild. Additionally west germany didn’t have to tear down as much of their economy and infrastructure and ship it east. Furthermore the then backbone of german economy, coal steel and machinery was in high demand since so much was destroyed. Thanks to the loans it was possible to heavily invest in those keeping workers employed, companies like RUAG und Krupp alive and in return getting absolutely state of the art machinery.  A similar, though smaller effect can be seen after WWI when french reparation obligations forced germany to heavily modernise, though this wasn’t financed by US banks and therefore a little more troublesome.	1643012592.0	htzvyvu	t3_sbh5lh	t3_sbh5lh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbh5lh/how_did_west_germanys_economy_recover_so_well/htzvyvu/
hfsx6	"The contribution made by American capitalism to German war preparations before 1940 can only be described as phenomenal. It was certainly crucial to German military capabilities. For instance, in 1934 Germany produced 300,000 tons of natural petroleum products and less than 800,000 tons of synthetic petroleum gasoline; the balance was imported. Yet, 10 years later in ww2, after transfer of the Standard Oil of New Jersey hydrogenation patents and technology to I. G. Farben (used to produce synthetic gasoline from coal), Germany produced about 6.5 million tons of oil - of which 85% was synthetic oil using the Standard Oil hydrogenation process. Moreover, the control of synthetic oil output in Germany was held by the I. G. Farben subsidiary, Braunkohle-Benzin A. G., and this Farben Cartel itself was created in 1926 with wall street financial assistance.  On the other hand, the general impression left with the reader by modern historians is that this American technical assistance was accidental and that American industrialists were innocent of wrong doing. [...] evidence suggests that not only was an influential sector of America business aware of the nature of nazism, but for it's own purposes aided nazism wherever possible (and profitable) - with full knowledge that the probable outcome would be war involving Europe and The United States." - Chris Sutton" Wall Street and the rise of Hitler.  Hitler was also elected during a time of hyper-inflation and foreign money was worth a lot more than German marks at the time of his campaign. From the same book:   "The Dawes Plan arranged a series of foreign loans totalling $800 million with their proceeds flowing to Germany. These loans are important [...] because the proceeds, raised for the greater part by the United States from dollar investors, were utilized in the mid 1920s to create and consolidate the gigantic chemical and steel combinations of I. G. Farben and Wereinigte Stahlwerk, respectively. These cartels not only helped Hitler to power in 1933; the Also produced the bulk of the German war materials used in WW2."	1643013995.0	htzxpxl	t3_sbczey	t3_sbczey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/htzxpxl/

He was really not the best option to lead a newly-independent Georgia, and I do have to wonder what could have happened had Kostava not died before then.  Nothing would change, as Russia repeatedly threatened Georgia during that period.  The Georgian army was bombed several times, and Yeltsin also threatened Shevardnadze or Gamsakhurdia (I do not remember which one) to bomb Tbilisi if they invaded South Ossetia.

8wzec	Early on Hitler made a living through speaker fees and rich friends who “lent” him money.  In 1920, Hitlers left the army and began his rise in leadership in the National Socialist German Workers Party and did not accept a salary. When asked how he made a living, he would get angry. When Hitler was indicted in 1921 by the National Socialist Party, who believed that his leadership of the party was becoming too dictorial, he was asked by the committee court of the party how he made his money. He replied, “If I speak for the National Socialist Party, I take no money for myself. But I also speak for other organizations… and then of course I accept a fee. I also have my midday meals with various party comrades in turn. I am further assisted to a modest extent by a few party comrades”. His own personal lifestyle was also not lavish.  *The Rise And Fall of The Third Reich* states: “His wants were certainly modest. Until 1929 he occupied a two-room flat in a lower-middle-class district in the Theirschstrasse near River Isar. In the winter he wore an old trench coat - it later became familiar with everyone in Germany from numerous photographs. In the summer he often appeared in shorts the *Lederhosen*which most Bavarian donned in seasonable weather.”  After the publication of his book *Mein Kampf*in 1925, its royalties became his chief source of income. His book didn’t make significant sells until 5 years later, in 1929, when his annual sales increased 10 fold from an annual average of 5,000 copies sold to over 50,000. Along with the rapid rise of the Nazi Party, this was also the year an inexpensive copy was released.  *The Rise And Fall Of the Third Reich:* “But they were nothing compared to those received in 1933, the year he became Chancellor. In his first year of office Mein Kampf sold a million copies, and Hitlers income from royalties, which has been increased from 10 to 15 percent after January 1, 1933, was over one million marks (some $300,000), making him the most prosperous author in Germany and for the first time a millionaire. Except for the Bible, no other book sold as well during the Nazi Regime, where few households felt secure without a copy on the table…. By 1950, the year after World War inscentia broke out, six million copies of the Nazi bugle had been sold in Germany.”	1643017025.0	hu01ec9	t3_sbczey	t3_sbczey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu01ec9/

6nm351dq	Ancient china for its time was the most collectivised society you could find, it was one of the earliest societies to adopt censuses of its people to maximise its taxation, even before the first emperor unified china. As the warlord states pre-unification had a sort of arms race with both their military but also their civil advancements. This was a very volatile period so keeping a tight leash on your population was ideal. So collectivism through effective bureaucracy has been a staple for china even before china ever formed. The Qing dynasty on the other hand was a very different state than most Chinese dynasties before it. As they were first of all a dynasty consisting of a minority living in china, and effectively locked the country into an isolated, and even delusional state.   It is said that when the first British envoys appeared before the emperor, he started speaking latin, for him and the court were under the impression that Europe was still under mostly roman rule  This stagnation in things such as bureaucracy, also halted their control of their population. The small villages that most of their population resided in were isolated in every sense of the word, thus creating this situation where the state could no longer keep their tight leash on its people as before, which lead to things as the opium epidemic becoming as bad as it did, a rise of piracy, and later on in the mid to late “century of humiliation”, a rise of secret societies.	1643022529.0	hu0859o	t3_sbjluv	t3_sbjluv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbjluv/how_old_is_collectivism_in_china/hu0859o/

So the Marshall Plan where the USA provided billions to Western Europe helped a lot. The Allies also acted very benevolently to Germany. Before after a war, you would ruin the conquered enemy. This is exactly what the Treaty of Versailles achieved. Clearly that didn't work out, and so the Allies sought to strengthen Germany. There were no reprisals. No punishment.  Also I think being bombed to absolute shit gave Germany a blank slate to build back up. Compared to a lot of France and the UK that has remained largely the same for centuries, Germany had to start anew.

So I’ve done much research on this both for school , as well as my own family’s history, my ancestors would attend what was called in New Orleans, ‘ Quadroon Balls’ where good looking, pretty faced , good body, usually taught both French and often Spanish and of course English , sometimes even educated in France - Mulatresses , like my great great grandmother where then purchased as lovers and companions by wealthy French creole and Spanish men. This is the closet I have ever seen to ‘ breeding farms’. Nothing in any historical , let alone primary source material states that these things exist. It’s lies and bulls hit, of course slaves were raped throughout history rape is just a part of life. However breeding farms where just not real.	1643026192.0	hu0d8g3	t3_sbgvx5	t3_sbgvx5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbgvx5/were_there_breeding_farms_for_african_americans/hu0d8g3/
e49gp06y	Funny story there. One of my favorites\^\^  After the war Bavaria became US-Occupied territory. And since the Publisher for the NSDAP and therefore the Government called "Franz Eher Nachfolger" had it's seat in Munich, that meant that every and all rights to every and all literature published through this Publisher became Property of the USA. But when the US Troops left, they simply didn't really know what to do with that and since Germany was to become sovereign, they decided to leave the rights with the Bavarian Government. Specifically the Ministry of Finances. Strange choice at first but made sense for the Americans since those rights were very much only about Finances to them.  So from the End of the war to 2015 there have never been any actual new prints of the book. At least not in a version without commentary. And that is very simply because the Bavarian Ministry of Finance held all the rights and never gave them up. There were international reprints because of course but there was little that could've been done to stop them all. Besides once the Internet became a thing, it was everywhere in form of PDF anway.  Technically there was never any laws speaking against reprinting the book. Nor even against reselling it. In fact the "Bundesgerichtshof" (the German Supreme Court) ruled in a verdict in 1979 that the ownership, distribution as well as acquisition of the book in one of its "original" forms as an "antique" isn't a criminal offense according to §86 StGB.   Since 2015 the copyright on the book has expired and now everybody call reprint and sell it as they see fit. There could still be a case where the book is classified as propaganda and therefore count as "Volksverhetzung" but it's doubtful considering the verdict in the past and the justification for it.   Fun Fact: The rights for the Book in Britain were already sold in the 1930's to a different Publisher so the book could've been printed there much earlier then 2015.	1643028618.0	hu0h4fh	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0cdhg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0h4fh/

On the east side of the park, towards Hackney, you'll find several large arched stone alcoves. These were features added along London bridge for weary pedestrians and Londoners to kick back, have discourse, and generally take in views of the city and the Thames.   There are quite a few examples of repurposed architecture and whatnot in London which can be fun to track down.

8l5zr	I can provide the knowledge that here in Denmark it was common from my great grandmothers and onwards time ( so 1900+ at least, certainly earlier although I cant verify that far back. To butcher your own chickens, you see, for cows and pigs, you would be visited by the butcher who for a fee would do the killing and rough cutting of the meat, you would then divide the meat further yourself and "clean the cuts".  This was done to save expenses for the butchers fee to a minimum, and also to have the meat on sight where it could be stored correctly right away rather than to tracel with it.  So killing chickens by beheading them was something the children was taught fairly early on and not that big of a deal, and quite often a butchering day was also a family get together if you had more meat than what you could safely manage yourself before it spoiled.  My grandmother would also explain how meat was salted or hung to preserve it.  So while the answers youre looking for are most likely further back in time, These traditions are sure to have gone back further than just 3 or 4 generations.

4d7o8msd	You're right to put "original" in quotation marks as if you want to be pedantic you could say that the original London Bridge was built by the Romans, and was made of wood. When people refer to the old London Bridge they often refer to the medieval bridge which had buildings on it and stood until the early nineteenth century when it made way for the New London Bridge. New London Bridge was replaced in 1973 with the current, rather boring looking London Bridge. Incidently the old New London Bridge now sits in Lake Havasu in the USA.   I hate to disapoint you, but looking at historical images of both bridges, neither appeared to have carved keystones like this. It would be interesting to ask what the source of the rumour is. In my experience rumours tend to develop easily around buildings or bits of buildings. Common examples are houses made from ship's timbers (very rare in reality) or everything in London being designed by Christopher Wren. In fact, Ye Olde Watling, a pub in the city of London claims to be built from ship's timbers by Christopher Wren, despite being made of brick!	1643036209.0	hu0wjuj	t3_sbmanv	t3_sbmanv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmanv/what_happened_the_original_keystones_of_london/hu0wjuj/

665tpgv4	There wasn’t an association between bebop and China. Louis Armstrong came from (and developed) a world of traditional New Orleans jazz in the 1920s and earlier, where time and key signatures were relatively straightforward, with a call-and-response nature that made following it relatively predictable. In the late 1920s, even just the development of swing, where beats were differentially stressed to produce a pushing-and-pulling rhythmic effect was groundbreaking. It was shocking and new, and even somewhat challenging for people to listen to.   Swing became the dominant genre of jazz for decades, remaining the fresh, hip, progressive thing that the cool young kids enjoyed. However, like rap, it became commodified and less innovative after bubbling through society. Incidentally, WWII helped legitimize this black and Jewish art form to white America. Prior to the war it was largely enjoyed by those who were “cool,” urbane, and urban. Middle America thought it beneath them, or at best a fun, foreign-sounding fad.   During the war, however, divers Americans mixed. White midwesterners were fighting alongside black New Yorkers and were exposed to swing. Being such a specifically American genre also made people appreciate it, and rally around it when they even saw Nazis make fake jazz songs as propaganda to show how uncivilized Americans were. Jazz artists toured alongside troops to boost morale.   By the end of WWII, jazz - swing being its dominant form - was therefore widely understood and familiar to American ears. However it was also overexposed. Commercials, movie scores, TV and radio bandstands, everyone was dipping into swing in a way that bored the jazz innovators. It is the late 1940s, we were almost a generation past the innovation of swing in the late 1920s. Artists never want to just make their dad’s music, and we see young black artists innovate bebop.   Stripped down without a big band, heavily reliant on improvisation, using shifting time keys and time signatures were just the start. Instruments were played in a deconstructed, unpredictable manner that did away with the familiar, call-and-response features that made late swing so palatable to the masses.   This is what Louis Armstrong was calling “Chinese.” That descriptor is simply a long-used term to refer to things that one doesn’t understand, often implicitly also suggesting they don’t value it. Chinese was seen as a confusing, funny, primitive, impossible-to-understand language to contemporary western ears. By now, he was the older generation of jazz artist. He also had a more personal financial reason to discredit bebop’s legitimacy, as he was benefitting from the postwar boom in swing. There was no cited, or really even detectable, influence from traditional Chinese music on the development of bebop.	1643037264.0	hu0z1qk	t3_sbmjvg	t3_sbmjvg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmjvg/louis_armstrong_famously_called_bebop_chinese/hu0z1qk/

g43fx4pr	I can not answer all of your questions, but I will try to answer as many as I can.  > The US (with allies) funded the resistance to the Russians. This included the mujahideen and Osama Bin Laden himself. Is this accurate?  We know for a fact that the United States funded (and armed) the Mujahideen, this operation was called "Operation Cyclone."^[1]  What we are less certain about is if Osama Bin Laden got the same treatment. Keep in mind that OBL was not part of the Mujahideen, he was one of the many "Afghan Arabs" who was involved with the war on the side of the resistance against the Russians. If he did receive financial support from the CIA, there likely wasn't a proxy involved (besides maybe Saudi Arabia?).   There is no actual paper trail linking the CIA and Osama Bin Laden though, that is just a fact. Still, based on the US' history of interventionism and imperialism, it wouldn't exactly be a reach to say that it's possible that the CIA was funding OBL in some way. Robin Cook, the former Foreign Secretary of the UK, certainly seems to think so. This is what Cook said in a The Guardian article from 2005:  *"Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida, literally "the database", was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden's organisation would turn its attention to the west."*^[2]  CNN's Peter Bergen, who has actually interviewed OBL before, had this to say when asked if it's true that the CIA funded OBL:  *"This is one of those things where you cannot put it out of its misery."*  *"The story about bin Laden and the CIA -- that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden -- is simply a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. In fact, there are very few things that bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and the U.S. government agree on. They all agree that they didn't have a relationship in the 1980s. And they wouldn't have needed to. Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently."*  *"The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him."*^[3]  So make of all this what you will.   > Following the war, the Taliban were created / trained in Pakistan. The initial members of the Taliban were refugees from Afghanistan and veterans of the war / mujahideen, and they took over Afghanistan in 1994. Is this accurate? How much overlap (in numbers of people) was there between the mujahideen and the Taliban of 1994?  The initial composition of the Taliban was actually a mix between the mujahadeen who fought against the Soviet invasion in the 1980s and Pashtun students of traditional Islamic schools from eastern and southern Afghanistan.^[4] The group was officially founded in 1994 but only took over Afghanistan and established a new government in 1996.^[4]    ---  Sources/Further Reading Material:  [1]: [Arming Afghan Guerrillas: A Huge Effort Led by U.S. - New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/18/world/arming-afghan-guerrillas-a-huge-effort-led-by-us.html) / [Operation Cyclone Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone)  [2]: [The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means - The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development)  [3]: [Bergen: Bin Laden, CIA links hogwash - CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html)  [4]: [The Taliban in Afghanistan - Council on Foreign Relations (Web Archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20121017134802/https://www.cfr.org/afghanistan/taliban-afghanistan/p10551)	1643038549.0	hu1288x	t3_sbhtkg	t3_sbhtkg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbhtkg/did_us_involvement_lead_to_the_rise_of_the/hu1288x/

"McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge cut and transported to the United States for use in the construction of a new bridge in Lake Havasu City, a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu.

g43fx4pr	Originally, African Americans used to name their children whatever was popular at the time in the US. This changed in the 1960s due to the Civil Rights Movement. After the 1960s, a lot of the uniquely African American names you might've heard started to pop up. These names are largely either:  * A combination of two/three popular names.  * A popular name but with a prefix (La-, De-) or suffix (-isha, -ique) added to it.  Since its founding, the Nation of Islam has also influenced how African Americans named their children. Common Muslim/Middle Eastern names became very popular within African American circles.

Black Americans, having been stripped of their cultural heritage and national identity, have spent these last centuries doing their best to create a brand new culture that exists aside from any attempts to force them to assimilate their children with "European" names.  For better or worse, Black Americans are no more African than they are European, and their desire to not be exclusively defined by either of those cultures has lead to a new culture of creative naming.	1643050312.0	hu1xmge	t3_sbsz53	t3_sbsz53	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbsz53/what_are_the_origins_of_a_lot_of_black_american/hu1xmge/

4yd0h6qk	The reason why an invasion, blockade, or nuclear strike didn't occur against China was to avoid WW3.  Technically, the USA wasn't at war with China.  All Chinese forces were technically vollenteers, although many we're former nationalist troops who had little choice in the matter.  China and the USSR had a mutual defense pack with each other, which means that if America directly attacks China the USSR will be forced to join and with the USSR having recently acquired nukes, this is the end of the world.  This is all ignoring the fact that even if they did blockade or bombard cities it wouldn't have stopped the war.  Nothing short of a full on invasion, which would kill millions and be potentially disastrous.   Mao was crazy, but he wasn't stupid.  He didn't send millions of his own men to die just to support a fellow communist regime, he wanted to make China into a global superpower.  By defending Korea he's A. Keeping a buffer state between him and the west. B. He's starting his own sphere of influence. And C. Most importantly the Russians are giving him invaluable technology, factories, logistic support, military advisors, and all the essentials to become a superpower.  Now that Mao is in a secure position his new goal is to become one and lives lost don't matter.  He sacrificed roughly 36 million in a famine exporting food to Russia so he could build an a-bomb.  He wouldn't even lose sleep at a mere 10 or 15 million killed by American bombardment. The American public on the other hand would never stand for thousands or millions of civilians being killed like this.  It would be a political death sentence to all involved.  So in conclusion, the Americans did not escalate the war due the the fear of world war 3 and the tremendous cost and effort that would be required to change the outcome of the war.  I just read Mao by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday and that is where my knowledge of this event comes from.	1643054416.0	hu28hnb	t3_sbsezs	t3_sbsezs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbsezs/why_didnt_american_navy_bombard_chinese_coastal/hu28hnb/

So early in Russias history, during the high medieval period, the Kievan Rus, a Rus princely state situated in today’s northeast Ukraine, western Russia and eastern Belorussia, became the dominant power between the different Russian states. It was very different from what you expect from a Russian state. They were converted early by the byzantines to orthodox Christianity, this started a relationship where the Kievan Rus started to venerate all things byzantine and saw itself as a nation closely tied to it. To the point that they would send soldiers to the eastern roman empire who themselves would be later known as the Varangian guard. So nearing the 13th century, the Mongols began their conquests of most of asia, and once they passed into the 1200s, they had set sights on the rus kingdoms. They quickly collapsed under the mongolian armies might and ferocity, which ended with the burning of kiev, and the last time ever that rus/russian power was centralised in the ukraine. Now, with contenders such as the novgorod republic and aforementioned kievan rus out of the picture, power over the russians was slowly being consolidated by the duchy of moscow, mind you they are all still a part of the mongolian empire, but as the mongols employee a very “laissez-faire” way of governing, asking nought but for a certain amount of taxation, the russian duchies were left in a situation were they held complete control over the peasants to increase the wealth so as to pay off the Mongolian empire (now the golden horde). So as the duchy of Moscow turned into russia, it basically sacked its population repeatedly to pay off the mongols, until it finally freed itself. This russia was a much more crueler and money driven amalgamation of russian nobles and Mongolian ways of terror that had distanced itself far away from the descendants of the Kievan Rus. This is the first point in modern history where we see the divide between the Russians and now, Ukrainians. I skimmed over a bit since its been millennia since I’ve ever had to think about this but i hope it helped	1643057048.0	hu2fcgf	t3_sb37w1	t3_sb37w1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb37w1/when_did_the_east_slavs_divide_themselves_into/hu2fcgf/
av7m7ojh	You are right in saying that Ireland was made up of fractured, petty kingdoms.   However, there were rulers who claimed the title of High King of Ireland, the primer inter pares. Some of them are based in legend, while others are grounded more in history.   One such High King is Brian Ború, who is credited with a decisive victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf, 1014.   While Ireland never represented a unified political state, there has been contention that this was the trajectory of Irish political rule prior to the Norman invasion of Ireland.   So, to conclude, these myths and legends could be referencing a High King of Ireland, or a petty king. It is unclear without knowing the name of the king or the kingdom in question.	1643057383.0	hu2g8c3	t3_sbmqt2	t3_sbmqt2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmqt2/why_do_many_welsh_myths_and_arthurian_legends/hu2g8c3/

While walking around Colonionial Williamsburg Virginia, I was able to talk to the actor working as the cobbler (shoe maker) within the town. They preceded to describe that, back within American Colonionial times, a separate left and right shoe were not made. Instead, two of the same shoes were made, and as worn, the shoe would over time adapt to the wearers foot. I'm essence, shoes were not designed for a specific foot shape but to work as shoes. So, to suggest a possible answer to the part of this question about the history, it was simply due to material, work and time costs that shoes had a narrower toe box and less form fitting design.	1643059849.0	hu2mskn	t3_sbuljf	t3_sbuljf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbuljf/the_majority_of_modern_everyday_shoes_do_not_have/hu2mskn/
av7m7ojh	In this sense, a petty king is one who rules over his domain, often a petty kingdom.   The High King exerts power and authority over a larger area than his petty kingdom - theoretically, the island of Ireland. I say theoretically, because it's hard to exert control over many fractured kingdoms, and sometimes there are other claimants to the title.   There are other factors, such as dynastic conflicts going on, so the authority of a High King is not constant.	1643060097.0	hu2ngwz	t3_sbmqt2	t1_hu2lm3p	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmqt2/why_do_many_welsh_myths_and_arthurian_legends/hu2ngwz/

x70zp	I'm unsure if this will be worthy enough for this subreddit but the following is my overly simplified understanding of that situation. Zionist groups began buying property in modern day Israel in the mid 19th century in the Ottoman "state" of Palestine, primarily in the Golan Heights region. The Ottoman Empire realized there had been a buildup of Jewish people in that area and confiscated it prior to World War 1. This caused there to be yet another ethnic group which was outraged at the OE; all of the outraged ethnic groups were organized by Britain (Lawrence of Arabia) in World War 1 to fight the OE, with the promise of lands after the war. Zionists and Muslim Palestinians were all grouped into the Palestine state following the war to limited success and managed from afar by Britain.  During World War II, then grand mufti ("mayor") of Jerusalem Sheikh Muhammad Amin al-Husseini often met with Adolf Hitler and discussed their mutual dislike of Jews. He shared the sentiment that he didn't have a problem with Jews necessarily, he just wanted them to live somewhere else. Both of them discussed where they could all be shipped to instead of their own countries. So during that war, there was a certain amount of persecution of the Jewish population. Following the war, the Jewish population began to organize and rebel/become freedom fighters/engage in terrorism to gain their own state. Britain was still in control of Palestine and eventually drew lines in the sand, giving the Zionist population its own Israeli state split apart from Palestine.	1643061935.0	hu2sb7l	t3_sboeq2	t1_hu2lafs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sboeq2/in_a_meeting_with_fdr_ibn_saud_reportedly/hu2sb7l/

Molla Fenari, a cleric from Sultan Bayezid I’s reign is recorded to extend weekend from 2 to 3 days. This extra day was granted so the students could work and pay the “outrageous bookseller prices”.  The earliest records about specific booksellers in Ottoman Empire are from 1520.  Out of 140 shops in the Grand Bazaar, 4 of the shops  belonged to book merchants (called “sahaf”). There are also records of book merchants in Fatih district and other major marketplaces.  European diplomat’s one of the important missions in Constantinople was to shop for valuable books. In a letter to Venice, Venetian diplomat Piedro dela Valle writes that he has been looking for Arabic grammar books in Bezistan market in Constantinople in 1615.  Likewise a Dutch merchant in Izmir Michiel de Mortier wrote to the Dutch Levant trade director to complain about the diplomats in Constantinople. He complained that the diplomats spent thousands of golden liras in book merchants which could have been used to solve trade matters.   Overall it is clear that Ottomans had book shops in the classical period. We can also presume that there were places selling books and book supplies to students in early 1400s and 1300s, even though there are no surviving reports.   About the author and statement you mentioned, I have not heard of a book ban in Ottoman Empire. It also does not sound plausible for an Empire that needs schools and libraries to ban books. However Bayezid II banned the printing press, as a result of lobbying from scribes who did not want to lose their profitable jobs to a machine. This ban was only lifted in 1700s during the reign of Ahmed III.

3d593pdj	IIRC, the analogy with Rugby or American football goes back to the early-20th-century British scholar George Grundy.  It has been disputed in writing since the 1940s, but there are two problems: most of the scholars have only book knowledge of combat with edged weapon, and the school which replaced the 20th century 'orthodoxy' fell into the trap of proposing the opposite of whatever Hanson had written and accepted his ideas of what kinds of methods and sources were valid.  The result is duelling armchair theories which have not always been placed in comparative context or subjected to basic practical tests, and a lot of claims about the properties of arms and armour which won't survive contact with a specialist archaeology library.  As more archaeologists, and more scholars with experience in martial art and combat sports, enter the debate, its likely that research about the mechanics of early Greek combat will move beyond people asserting things and denying everything that other people say.	1643062549.0	hu2twma	t3_s83m6b	t1_htojroy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/hu2twma/
al0bz	The simple answer is that your toes are not meant to go to the end of the shoe. [Here is a podcast](https://www.stitchdown.com/stitchdown-shoecast/ron-rider-shoe-sizing-mistakes/) from a manufacturer/brand owner about shoe sizing mistakes that people make now. Essentially, you want the *largest* size that will still keep your foot comfortably in place, not the smallest size you can squeeze into. But many people size like the latter, or they are focused primarily on making sure their toe reaches the end. This is not desirable, particularly in more formal footwear where aesthetic is a primary concern and the material is not particularly giving. The most important part of sizing for shoes is putting the ball of your foot where the manufacturer designed the shoe to be flexible and “break” with the natural bend in your foot.   Basically, imagine someone added a smooth taper to the front end of the Geo Court II, and that’s how you’re intended to size. The Converse on the left is not sized correctly, and you can tell because they are approximately the same length as the Geo Courts despite being intended to leave room in the toe for the shoe to aesthetically taper.   You can find more sizing advice on /r/goodyearwelt, which is aimed primarily at leather shoes and boots but nonetheless provides good advice for general lifestyle footwear (modern athletic or running footwear on the other hand, is a different beast because of the flexibility of the upper’s material and the rigorous motion you put it through).

l6to6	Yes, they did spoke latin in Maghreb, which evolved in its own unique way, but not enough is known to know if it came to be a separate language. While we now little about it, we know that by 386 Augustine of Hippo, who was native to the region, complains in his work how his pronunciation is criticized by his peers from Italy, and how he founds faults with theirs. Though, was the language spoken in North Africa at that point different enough to be already considered a separate language is unknown. Other people such as Publius Consentius and saint Jerome also mention the differences. There are also some inscriptions thought to be written in the North African dialect. Another possible remnant of this dialect/language remain in different Berber languages and Maghrebi Arabic as loan words, though not all words of romance origin are thought to be descendant from the North African dialect/language.

593n2189	From a biologists perspective, its not that evolution itself was radical, but that the origin of life itself may have been a cascading series of evolutionary events. There were other theories presented which also tried to explain the same phenomenon, that is, why over generations some organisms as a population change. Humans bred many animals; dogs, cattle, pigeons, horses. We did know that they could change, so the idea that evolution explains this was not that radical.  What was radical was to suggest that genesis, the bible, was incorrect. At that time, most of the scientifically minded world still had religion coursing through its veins. That in fact humans and all other living things on earth had likely come about due to a slow process of changing over vast time scales, and not that god himself had created man "in his own image", were radical ideas.	1645029564.0	hx6w9gm	t3_stz4d1	t3_stz4d1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hx6w9gm/

The depressurization of this vessel more than likely killed the astronauts quite quickly and as they were radio silent during descent. From what I’ve gathered, the state of the bodies upon retrieval were not unlike that of bodies which were involved in major car accidents.  The capsule reached terminal velocity on its descent and slammed into the ocean at a considerably unsurvivable velocity.

If it was known that animals could change over time, why would it be such a surprise that humans could vary with time/geography/chance?   People would have always seen huge variations within families and different races, so - respectfully, it's not like the "image of god" was ever considered one eternal unchanging portrait, I don't see how it contradicts creationism in that respect?  (On a slight tangent - the more I think about this, the more the whole debate starts to look more and more like a very highly controlled social narrative which allows for very little personal/creative input as to our ancestors true origins and leads to increasing interdependence on "experts" to explain mysteries to us)	1645030334.0	hx6ybsv	t3_stz4d1	t1_hx6w9gm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hx6ybsv/

So all the genetic material dogs have comes from originally created ancestors whose the descendants later have inherited some of the genetic information.

ep3tiqfy	Káiser Wilhelm II of Prussia (Germany) was Queen Victoria’s grandson. His injuries sustained at birth resulted in him having Erb’s palsy and manifested in a withered arm. He was subjected for years to what amounts to torture in order to hide it, and forced into metal aparatases that look like torture devices. His mother was ashamed of him and he was permanently traumatized. It doubtless affected his character.	1645033313.0	hx767t0	t3_su1kjh	t3_su1kjh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su1kjh/how_would_a_member_of_the_nobility_with_a/hx767t0/

However, it is unlikely that they are about his wife as they lived apart for most of Shakespeare’s life. Of course, because he left nearly nothing behind outside of his works, almost anything you read about the man himself is speculative.

acgr5wok	While I was in the maritime museum in Sydney Australia, there was a photographic display showing one of the Australian warships that was deployed to China (British Aus alliance) and the period of service in the Opium war. My wife who is chinese was shocked that there was such a 'blatant' display. She then translated the display to an elderly chinese couple who didn't know english at the museum, and the old chinese couple said "You bastards!" in mandarin.      This is an article about Australian and allied intervention from the Australian perspective. To answer your question its just mentioned in passing or its a vestibular remant of western history in school education.

6ip1p	I looks like the article is about the Boxer Rebellion and made a passing mention of the Opium Wars. My personal experience in Canadian public schooling is pretty similar to yours in Australia. I would say probably 80%+ of people I've met don't know about the Opium Wars or only really heard about it in passing in conjunction with Chinese nationalism. Those who know about this particular event (the burning of the Old Summer Palace) is even fewer. The vast majority of those who do know about it tend to be Chinese diaspora or those with a particular interest in East Asian history.

Only recently have we kinda been forced to revisit the colonisation of Australia by the British and the massacres conducted on the indigenous population.

7e595	It also isn't true that dogs were selectively bred through all of human history. At least, not if we define selective breeding as prezygotic selection of breeding pairs (which is what people usually mean). That was a post-Darwinian development, coincidental to the rise of kennel clubs, and also eugenics. In the words of /u/mikitacurve, prezygotic selection breeding is canine eugenics.  As you say, people understood heritability existed. But they tended to attribute it to one sex or the other. So for instance, in Alexander the Great's horse breeding program, they only tracked  dams, and in modern Europe, before the mid 19th century, they only tracked sires. My horse's pedigree goes back to the Godolphin Arab (foaled in 1724), but it doesn't record dams until the mid-19th century. Postzygotic selection, or culling, was the main method of influencing genetics for most of human history. As of twenty years ago, this was still the case in agricultural societies that practice transhumance. A shepherd might have a favorite mommy dog, and cull pups any other female whelped. Or they may like white dogs, and cull pups of other colors.

ijgbv	Not a historian but to me the neoconservatives were basically the logical evolution of the Reagan coalition:  Christians/social conservatives, low taxers, and military interventionalists. To me, its somewhat a reaction to Clinton winning the election but I find it ironic that they claimed to be for small government on on hand yet advocated use of government for social conservatism and regime change (and whatever else was on their agenda).  On the surface it sounds counterintuitive to be so pro-invasion, being the last superpower with no  big threat, but if you think about it, if you're the only superpower, who is going to stop you from using your might abroad? Now you can more easily use your military to enact what you want without an equal counterbalance like we saw in the Cold War.    I'll also add that I think the massive success of the first Gulf War in 1991 really deluded some people into thinking war was easy and the U.S. was just so powerful that all conflicts would be a cake walk like that - not realizing the unique circumstances of that particular engagement.  Just my two cents.	1645046200.0	hx82ry1	t3_stvdr1	t3_stvdr1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stvdr1/how_did_neoconservativism_gain_so_much_influence/hx82ry1/

gzud5	Hawaii was removed from the United Nations List of Non-Self Governing territories simply because the United States granted it statehood along with Hawaii in 1959. This consequently established a state government in Hawaii and give them appropriate influence over the federal government, which means that they had a large say in their governance. Additionally, while Hawaii was and still is ethnically distinct from the United States, being much more Asian and Polynesian than the mainland, the question of what territories should be on the list is ultimately political and the United States had sufficient political influence to have it removed.	1645057868.0	hx8v0a6	t3_stly1p	t3_stly1p	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stly1p/why_was_hawaii_removed_from_the_list_of_un/hx8v0a6/
44tlbfkw	The Soviet union was primarily comprised of a central and "unified" ideology, namely communism (Leninism, Stalinism etc). However each country still had its own nationality and ethnic groups, and similarly many of these nations, or at least significant portions of their populations still find themselves deeply tied to the soviet project and the "dream of a global revolution" that came with it. An example would be the term "Ostalgia", which is a combination of the German word for East (Ost) and Nostalgia. This being a phenomena that has evolved forth in areas in east Berlin and east Germany, wherein Germans feel a strong sense of nostalgia for when east Germany was still a part of the Soviet Union, believing things were better back then.   You also have a lot of people, primarily communists, around the world who still feel a deep kinship with Russia and areas around eastern europe in particular because of the connection to the soviet union.      So moreso than a national identity, the Soviet union managed to establish an ideological unity that reaches around the globe. Though ultimately the soviet union fell because of growing economic issues, and people who had lived under regimes controlled directly or indirectly by the Russian leaders were yearning for independence.	1645059195.0	hx8xxp8	t3_su7uad	t3_su7uad	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su7uad/why_did_the_soviet_union_not_manage_to_create_a/hx8xxp8/
7puko7xo	The county of portucale was part of the kingdom of galicia and león, predecessors of the crown of castille and the kingdom of spain. After portuguese independence, Portugal was raised into a kingdom with papal recognition. In medieval terms, the kingdom of castille had no claims on portuguese territories so the only way for this two entities to be together was through one king inheriting both kingdoms. In 1383 Portugal had a succession crisis, the king of castille claimed the throne and so did a bastard of one of the previous portuguese kings, in the end the bastard won and both entities remained separate. Portugal had another succession crisis in 1580. Phillip II claimed the portuguese throne and yet again another bastard of one of the previous portuguese kings claimed the throne. Phillip II won the war of succession and inherited the title of king of Portugal. All the political entities Phillip II had, had different degrees of autonomy and the rule of this entities were left to governors and viceroys. Portugal declared independence in 1640 and a war was fought so it was recognized. Had Portugal lost the war then eventually it would have been integrated into the political entity called kingdom of spain which was founded in the 1700s and revoked alot of autonomy that the crown of castille, aragon, etc had.   After that there were some wars fought between both countries, the only territory that Spain got from Portugal through war was Olivença but that was not recognized, furthermore, there is a treaty that establishes that Olivença should come back to the hands of the portuguese.  So "spain" and its predecessors had 2 opportunities to claim portugal. And portugal had 1 [opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Castilian_Succession) to claim castille.	1645060209.0	hx905hc	t3_su46pw	t3_su46pw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su46pw/why_did_spain_never_expand_into_portugal/hx905hc/

But ultimately a lot of aspects come down to what you personally believe happened because history has a great deal of gaps, which could allow for different hypothesis on the matter built from extrapolation, which by itself would force the consideration of several different factors, all which could be rendered moot in a heartbeat with new evidence.	1645060565.0	hx90yc6	t3_su27yy	t3_su27yy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su27yy/when_selecting_biographies_articles_etc_on/hx90yc6/

The Great Depression of the 1930s unlike the very big depressions of the 19th century was the first time citizens turned to their governments looking for them to change things rather than just seeing them as phenomena akin to natural catastrophes which you could do nothing about.   During the second world war the apparatus of national accounting (caluclating GDP etc.) was created to help prosecute the war.

Though even then Death in June didn't come out of folk music, but a more synth and industrial oriented background, before embracing folk, and in turn helping to create the neofolk genre, through their various collaborations in the 90s.  This article, whilst not living up to many scholarly merits, provides a good overview, and offers a lot of links to more valid sources on the history of Death in June, their musical influence, and the connection between neofolk and the far right. https://libcom.org/library/death-in-june-a-nazi-band	1645061548.0	hx9355e	t3_stgtf3	t3_stgtf3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stgtf3/how_did_folk_music_the_folk_revival_become/hx9355e/

cexlx	19th-century scientists deduced that the interior of the Earth was hot by observing volcanoes, and correctly concluding that the magma brought up to the surface must be coming from a hot reservoir of molten rock in the Earth's interior.  But Lord Kelvin (to use one example) thought that this meant that the material in the interior of the Earth was, approximately, isothermal at the melting point of rock. Kelvin also assumed that the Earth could be well approximated as a  uniform and undifferentiated sphere of material. We now know that both of these assumptions are incorrect: the interior temperature of the Earth increases from the mantle temperature of about 1000K to a core temperature of about 6000K. The density of the Earth also roughly doubles going from the mantle to the core.  So they knew the interior of the Earth was hot, but at the time they did not have the correct value.  Incidentally, Kelvin's assumption that the Earth's interior was all at the melting point of rock was one of the main sources of uncertainty in his age estimates of the Earth. As Kelvin got better measurements of the melting point, he also refined what he thought the temperature of the "interior" of the Earth must be. Thus Kelvin's allowed age range for the Earth dropped from the original 20-400 Myr to just 20-40 Myr.	1645063615.0	hx97rb8	t3_stz4d1	t1_hx7wqmv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hx97rb8/
ecqt0	What you are seeing is not a solarium, but the captain's and officers' quarters at the stern if the ship.  These old ships had enormous amounts of men on board when compared to similar-sized modern warships. Everything was done by hand, nothing was mechanised or automated, so many hands were needed. With so many men on board, and most of the interior taken up by guns, powder, workshops, provisions etc, there was very little space on board for the crew. They had no cabins, but typically slept in hammocks that were strung wherever there was space for them. Living down there was miserable. It was dark, damp, crowded and must have stunk horrifically.  If you managed to make it to officer or even captain you got a bit more comfort. Your quarters were at the stern, close to the steering wheel and the station the ship was commanded from.  Now the stern had one massive advantage: There are no guns in the stern and since ships typically engaged side-to-side, there was a much lower chance for cannon balls whizzing through your quarters. This free space and low need for protection meant you could splurge on some actual glass windows for the higher ranks to enjoy — and that's what you see.  So, it's not a solarium or sunroom, it's just the captain's cabin at the stern, who was the only person to get to enjoy some actual sunshine in their cabin.	1645064029.0	hx98o99	t3_su8rlj	t3_su8rlj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su8rlj/did_bulging_amber_solariums_exist_on_old_timey/hx98o99/

Although scientifically fringe, Intelligent Design supporters fall into the big tent of the Christian Right. This gives them a much bigger microphone than they might otherwise have had. Evolution is just a theory stickers in text books are recent enough that I'm pretty sure some of them violate the 20 yesr rule.	1645065395.0	hx9bqfj	t3_stz4d1	t1_hx8s4wq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hx9bqfj/
2pdn613x	I'm going to go ahead and answer this - with a massive caveat that what you're asking requires speculation inherently, and obviously there is not going to be any way to answer it outside of being subjective.  First, consider that the way women were portrayed in the 1960s in film was highly different than today, and any large part was going to be expected to be romantic. That really has nothing to do with the makers of the film, that's just what film culture of the time called for - and deviation from that would have complicated a already challenging story that was trying to be comparitively historically accurate.  T.E. Lawrence was very possibly gay, and very possibly a extreme masochist -- he died never having any known romantic relationships whatsoever. It's possible the filmmakers simply didn't want to broche this component of Lawrence's life, both due to the nature of it, and to avoid blatantly rewriting history --- so they simply opted to not include any females at all.	1645067023.0	hx9fcoq	t3_strpal	t3_strpal	/r/AskHistorians/comments/strpal/were_women_not_involved_in_any_significant/hx9fcoq/

d70nw	> Does the new species just stop being able to produce fertile offspring one generation, or is it a percent thing where, say, if 75% of offspring are infertile then it’s a new species?  The boundaries of speciation are not that clear-cut. The ability of two organisms to produce a viable offspring has to do with how homologous their chromosome sets are, which determines whether or not meiosis can happen mechanistically.  If the chromosomes are too different, they can't line up and then separate properly during meiotic cell division.  But the boundary isn't sharp; instead, fertility gradually decreases as the amount of genetic disparity increases.   These days, the term "species" is just as often applied to groups that *could* successfully interbreed, but *don't*, usually due to geographical or social barriers. Essentially, two populations of the same species are separated such that they form independent breeding pools; then, over time, the genetics of the two populations drift apart until the two populations can no longer interbreed, and at that point we consider them separate species.   But consider, if you will:  nearly all of the Great Cats are interfertile.  They are members of what you could call a "superspecies" -- a group of "species" that are actually similar enough genetically to interbreed, but don't do so due to geographic or social/behavioral barriers.  Similar, nearly all citrus fruits are really the same fruit species -- then can nearly all interbreed, and will, if planted near each other. They taste very different to us because we have selectively bred them for that, but the citrus plants don't care. We call them different species, but if  you could ask the fruit, they probably wouldn't agree!	1645068863.0	hx9j1c5	t3_stz4d1	t1_hx8ayo0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hx9j1c5/
aty1u	Thank you for this detailed answer. I find this question fascinating because it’s in fact true that enormous numbers of Chinese Communists were massacred in extremely horrific fashion during the Shanghai Massacre and during the violence that followed in other parts of the country, But it’s difficult to parse the reality because the most detailed accounts come from pro communist sources like Howard R. Isaacs “The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution”. But while these accounts may be exaggerated it’s clear that the Chinese peasants and labor activists suffered horribly at the hands of the ruling elite.   I agree that Orwell most likely based his comment off of reading Malraux. I really appreciate you drawing a connection between that and the actual event.	1645059748.0	hx8z50q	t3_stvgah	t1_hx8ki8m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stvgah/in_1927_chiang_kaishek_boiled_hundreds_of/hx8z50q/
cdr5z	One problem with the fertility thing - you can end up with two species that diverge in opposite directions from a centre one. Then the two divergent species can’t breed with each other, but both divergent species can still breed with the centre one.  I can’t think of a real example off the top of my head, so pretend this is true: Great Danes and Chihuahuas are too far apart to produce fertile offspring. However, they can both produce viable offspring with Golden Retrievers. (Again, I’m like 99.9% sure this specific example I’d false, but illustrates the point well.)	1645074606.0	hx9sw70	t3_stz4d1	t1_hx8ayo0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hx9sw70/
501sv0w9	There are a few reasons: • The flight made it into a newspaper the day after it took place. While the national media didn’t initially take an interest in the flights (and they wouldn’t until Wilbur started to do a publicity tour in France), the local press was there, well, at least one reporter was (though it’s speculated that up to 4 were). You can see the story from the conveniently named Virginia Pilot here (https://www.pilotonline.com/history/article_610fe57e-e3f0-5048-a7c3-4a45983a5822.html). So we know it happened, and on what day it did. • Then there is the plane. The plane in the photo is the Wright Flyer. It crashed after the fourth flight at Kitty Hawk on 14 December, 1903, and was never flown again due to the damage. The Wright Flyer 2 had a few noticeable differences to the original. Firstly, it has a larger, 15 HP straight-4 piston engine (the original flyer had a smaller 12 HP model), which was mounted further back on the lower wing than the original (to adjust the center of gravity). It also had longer skids and a reduced wing camber than the original. All of these changes they stuck with or further refined for future Flyer iterations. With each iteration, the plane looked less like the original (and we know what that one looks like, as it’s in the Smithsonian). • And finally, when not making bicycles, the Wright Brothers were avid photographers. Orville took the photo on a glass plate negative using a Korona-V, made by the Gundlach Optical Company. They used prints of the photos of their first flights for fundraising, hence why the negatives wouldn’t be turned over to the Library of Congress until 1949, a year after Orville’s death.	1645075567.0	hx9ugio	t3_sufrkw	t3_sufrkw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sufrkw/how_do_we_know_if_the_1905_wright_brothers_flight/hx9ugio/

That is kind of a weak argument in terms of the evidence  An excellent point that I somehow never considered before. Sure we have the benefit of access to that fossil record and other things like radiocarbon dating for bones now, but honestly I think if i was an educated person at that time I probably would have rejected Darwin's theory as well.

5uuqjg9l	Well, this question is more psychological than historical, but I’ll try to answer it anyways.  &#x200B;  First of, all childrens’ toys were intended to be played with and to be entertaining in the first place, with the rather “terrifying“ ones getting less sales than “funny” ones- the middle of the 20th century in the Western world (where the “toy boom“ mostly happened, with an influx of mass-produced metal and plastic toys swarming the market while stuffed animals were produced in masses as well) was mostly very conservative and sometimes either overprotective to children (basically, the typical Karens we know today, but with a view into the family rather than outward, buying only selected toys for children), or uncaring/neglecting (letting them play outside without supervision and going on their own business, and so not buying many toys for the children).  No matter what family you were in, toys were being thought as things for pre-schoolers, with the age of 9 being considered almost “too old” to play with dolls- you’d be usually found either reading books or watching TV (if you had one) at home or playing outside on the streets if you wanted to enjoy your free time- this narrows our demographic down significantly (except for maybe toy soldiers, pistols and swords for boys, and tea sets for girls).  The modern view of “cuteness” has been over-commercialised through success formulas: fur, big eyes, lots of moving things, softness, no self-moving parts aside voice boxes or toy train motors… Back in the 50’s, that formula was rather unknown, with a steady drive for realism being seen rather than the colourful buyers’ trap toys are today, which led to the partial ignorance of the “rules” of cuteness. Monkeys, for example, were more entertaining with a motor so they could walk and move, and dolls were kept rather realistic, with rather hild-like features. This was all mostly because of the lack of big entertainment media aside of cinema, radio and TV, which all were pretty restricted for kids at that time. Anything moving, however, was a real entertainment and almost a “miracle” from the childrens’ perspective.  Well, today’s world holds an abundance of modern media that can entertain a LOT better and offers far more “cute-traps”, diverting us from real toys, and towards the miracle onscreen and demanding a rapidly changing toy market, which inevitably makes the “traditional” toys seem old. A big problem are also the signs of decay they show over time: broken parts, colours rusting off, dusty and mouldy fur… that makes them seem even more unnatural and sinister, something “dark” hiding under a silhouette that was made to be joyful and cute. Add to that the rather weak technical abilities for toy production at that time- eyes were often painted or carved/molten into the face, hands and feet were rather stiff…      Clowns have a totally different method yet again. With their grotesque appearance, painted faces and silly jokes they are aimed specifically at small children who have the drive to discover new things- and by showing them unusual stunts, clowns would release dopamine in their brains. Now, the fear of clowns is based upon this very thing- you grow up, and get used to societal norms and regulations, the very thing clowns try to actively break. The grotesqueness is what would make it less entertaining and more terrifying for people with fear of Clowns, and for the rest of us, things like “it” by Stephan King or Killer-Clowns have opened a more terrifying view of them, letting us doubtbtheir intentions behind the ‘innocent’ laughter and grotesque actions. Children today are still attracted to clowns, but get ‘bored’ or terrified far sooner due to familiar mass-media being so different.  &#x200B;  A big part of it is also because of Hollywood: by using subtle hints or big signs of danger and/or linking the toys of old to supernatural phenomena, they effectively change the toys’ meaning and make them seem terrifying. Plus, by common usage in movie tropes, we start associating the old toys with fear, terror and monsters.  To be honest, today’s toys are at least equally terrifying, and only commercialisation prevents from them being used as horror-material more actively.     Or, in short:  Now, while the children back then loved to play with their toys, the modern fear is based on multiple factors:  1) Hollywood’s presence and usage of tropes in successful productions  2) slow decay of old toys we own  3) abundance of different mass-media and a different view on cuteness  4) uncanny humanlike resemblance  5) movement and grotesqueness  6) association with past- we grow up, they don’t  7) combination of phobias in adults	1645081089.0	hxa2zk5	t3_su5uwg	t3_su5uwg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su5uwg/why_do_so_many_traditional_childrens_toys_and/hxa2zk5/

5uuqjg9l	Gargoyls in Mediveal Gothic architecture had one main job: they should remove water from roofs and had  water channels inside them (thereby their name, meaning smth like “throat” in French). It was mostly to prevent church/house roofs and masonry walls from erosion through water.  Now, they also held a second function: according to a Legend, gargoyles also were there to “scare off” evil.     Now, why did we stop putting it on, then?  Gothic architecture is all in itself a great piece of art that was mostly built during a specific time in the Middle-Ages (12th-16th century, in rare cases up to 18th century). It was mostly used for churches p, city halls or for manors of the wealthy- it was rather expensive to build all those filigrane decorations, after all.  The Renaissance brought in more simple architecture, and both the split of the Church (because of Luther)m the 30-year war and the “Age of Enlightenment” made it hard for filigrane and expensive architecture to thrive- Lutheran/Protestant churches were rather simple, the “Age of Enlightenment” simply had less need for great churches, and the 30-year war plundered and destroyed them- all three periods made it hard for complex architecture to spread.  The Revolutions, wars and other conflicts during the 17th, 18th and 19th century also made it easier for less complex buildings, as money was often used for wars rather than for buildings (except for a small amount of churches and mansions).  The early 20th century left no chance for the gargoyles to thrive again- between economic crisis, war and simplification of architecture, there was yet again no room for them.  &#x200B;  The main problem is the rather expensive price and low practical usage of gargoyles in modern buildings, and also a big amount of stonemason mastery required to create them. Ceramic roofs have also lowered the necessity of them, as water gets diverged down steel pipes.  &#x200B;  A source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyle	1645085868.0	hxa98ap	t3_sug6u8	t3_sug6u8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sug6u8/why_did_we_stop_putting_gargoyles_on_buildings/hxa98ap/

vrnrs	An individual transmission isn't the whole story about the reliability of a tank line becoming a meme or not. You need replacement transmissions for when they eventually break, you need mechanics to replace them in the field and you need the time to actually replace them.  Germany initially built an extra engine and transmission for every 10 tigers. Simply put that wasn't enough spare parts to keep all tigers in working order. But building spare parts meant taking away from complete new tank production which had zero wear and tear on any part while replacing a transmission on an old tank you still have other parts nearing end of life there does come a point where a new tank is a better investment.   Then you needed mechanics to do the repairs. As the war dragged on more and more men were being sent to combat roles and less to support roles. And even "behind the lines" some experienced mechanics were becoming casualties of war and getting replaced by green mechanics who took longer to repair.  Finally time to repair. The german tanks were hilariously over engineered and transmission replacements required more mechanics, for longer length of time than similar allied tanks. Even if a battalion had enough spare parts, and a top tier team of mechanics, the tanks spent longer combat ineffective getting repaired.  So if you were an allied soldier and you happened to have come across several tigers abandoned with broken transmissions you might incorrectly talk about reliability, when you should actually laugh at the lack of logistical support.	1645087797.0	hxabm5r	t3_suhhta	t3_suhhta	/r/AskHistorians/comments/suhhta/was_the_inefficiency_of_the_tiger_1s_transmission/hxabm5r/

4cowl	It's gonna be difficult to have any opinion on this at all considering we know nothing about the guy and whether or not he even existed is only a solid "probably...".   There are ZERO contemporary records or evidence that this person existed - hell even the book of Mark (the earliest gospel that's included in the canon Bible) was written in like 90AD.   So if you're asking what about him was made up, the answer is literally everything. Best case, some of those vague recollections and all that dogmatic posturing just happens to be a close approximation of who the guy was. Even then it's incidental (as in, accuracy was likely not the point) and impossible to sort out the semi-accurate portrayals from the outright fabricated nonsense - if the guy even existed in the first place.   Just look at the revisionist history movements that have drastically altered some perceptions of the Confederacy to see the propagation power of myth - and that was only 160 years ago and with WAY more contemporary records. Intentionally inserting political/religiously motivated bits of inaccurate information causes some crazy drift in the temporal telephone game we call history.   TL:DR  Did Jesus/Jeshua believe he was “the son of god?” - Non-biblical sources don't exist, this is impossible to know.

2uc50t58	Well obviously the only sources that we have concerning his life are in the Bible, where the books were written a few decades after his death.  In some cases by eyewitnesses, others not by eyewitnesses, but still within living memory of the events.  This doesn’t mean that they are 100% reliable, of course, but as far as historical documentation of a figures life goes, this is fantastic.  For your first part- how did he see himself?  Well, based on what is recorded in the gospels, what his disciples taught after his death, and the fact that he was crucified, he certainly saw himself at the minimum as someone who was sent by God to teach.  If you want to take a more skeptical approach to the part where he claims divinity, you could argue that he merely thought of himself as a prophet, here to reform the way that the Jews thought about the law.    It is worth mentioning that the Talmud, Jewish religious writings that were written much later, may include references to Jesus, but it is not agreed upon that they are references to the Jesus of Christianity.  Some of the references are to a Yeshu of Nazareth who is accused of sorcery, stoned, and then hung on the eve of the Passover, and his 5 disciples are then tried and executed.  Another reference makes mention of a Jesus, son of Pantera, who conducts healings, and there are a few references to Jesus, the Nazarene, who teaches the Torah.    As far as the socialist part, that’s nonsense.  Encouraging charity is pretty standard in most religions, and this was especially true in Judaism.  Additionally, Jesus was living in a time where the wealthy people of his society were increasingly hellenized, and held beliefs contrary to traditional Judaism.  (The Sadducees, according to Josephus in his *Antiquities*, did not believe in any kind of soul or bodily resurrection after death, and were very connected to the Roman power structure, though they and their teachings were very unpopular with the people.)  What modern socialists misunderstand when they claim that Jesus was a socialist for his criticisms of wealth is that 1st Century AD Jews weren’t wealthy through private enterprise, they were wealthy because they were cooperating with a power structure that was pagan and directly counter to Jewish religious belief.  Jesus’ endorsement of poverty, however, has lead to some people theorizing that he may have some connection to the Essene movement.  (Josephus also mentions them, they lived in isolated groups that were essentially communes, holding everything in common, and also practicing absolute celibacy.  They can be seen as an inspiration for the hermetics and monastics that played a role in Christianity.)  Honestly, though, I haven’t seen much evidence for it, and nothing very convincing.  Not saying it’s impossible, just that I don’t see it based on what we have.  Now of course we can’t bring up the historical vs Biblical Jesus of Nazareth debate without addressing the elephant in the room- his miracles and resurrection.  Your take on this is going to be whether or not you’re a Christian- if you aren’t a Christian, you will not believe in the supernatural aspects of the Bible (though I think Muslims will agree to many of his miracles, just not the resurrection), whereas if you are a Christian you will probably believe all those miracles happened.  For what it’s worth, other sources at around this time don’t seem to question the authenticity of his miracles, but this is a time when such things were amazing, but still considered relatively normal occurrences, so take that as you will	1645100845.0	hxaszxv	t3_sulyhr	t3_sulyhr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sulyhr/did_jesusjeshua_believe_he_was_the_son_of_god_how/hxaszxv/

p4l5r	According to [this clinical paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsap.13329), the first report on chocolate intoxication in dogs was published in 1942:  > Clough, G. W. (1942) Theobromine poisoning in the dog. Veterinary Journal 98, 196-197 > > Abstract: A proprietary dog food containing a cacao byproduct caused sudden death in 6 dogs. This food contained from 13 to 15 grains theobromine per lb., and it is suggested that its action on the heart was responsible for the deaths of these dogs.   Garner's Veterinary Toxicology (1967) provides a bit more background:  > During the early stages of the 1939-45 war, cacao waste products received a great deal of attention as possible animal feeding stuffs and several outbreaks of poisoning were encountered, particularly in pigs and poultry. [...] Clough (1942) reported deaths in dogs receiving a proprietary food found later to include about 2 g per kg of theobromine.  That said, this knowledge does not seem to have become widespread among dog owners until at least 1980s, when it starts appearing in popular media (e.g. New Scientist, 7 Feb 1985, p 88, "*Beware of chocolate for dogs*") and veterinary guides (e.g. Veterinary News, 1982, "*Veterinarians also should warn clients not to feed dogs chocolate "treats"*").	1645106632.0	hxb476p	t3_suopq1	t3_suopq1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/suopq1/how_long_have_people_known_that_chocolate_is_bad/hxb476p/

b9t1	I’m not a biologist, and this is a debated subject, but generally lack of ability or willingness to breed plays a large part.  But a good counter argument is ring species: there are lakes for example with species of land animal surrounding them. And you end up with animal group A next to B, and they’re somewhat different, but *can* interbreed on occasion. And next to B is C: also similar, but distinct, and B sometimes interbreeds with C. And C with D, D with E, and so on. And then you get around the lake with G. And G and A are near each other, and not at all similar, and cannot at all interbreed. So where do you delineate the species? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ in the end (I think) “species” is a useful term, but like “planet” it’s kind of made-up.	1645111748.0	hxbgb3j	t3_stz4d1	t1_hx8ayo0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hxbgb3j/

b9t1	I’m not a biologist, but: it’s also important to note that DNA is digital, not analog. If the code to make an animal were analog, then like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy, if there were any change of information it would quickly render the animal unviable. Darwin had no knowledge of DNA, and without understanding that mechanism, his theory was fundamentally incomplete: he could say “this is what I think is happening, and how, and why” at the macro level, but had no explanation for what enabled the processes he envisioned.   DNA being quaternary (a “bit” in DNA can have four values: AT, TA, CG, and GC) digital information allows for error correction, and without that, evolution would be (nearly?) impossible.   Darwin and the rest of the 1800s had no idea of any of this. The nature of DNA wasn’t discovered until about a hundred years later, and many of the concepts of digital information were unknown at Darwin’s time.   I think, but don’t have a cite, that Darwin even described this problem, and said that he didn’t have an answer to how animals and plants could change but conserve their nature as he was proposing. And he had the courage to say that if such method didn’t exist/ couldn’t be found then it would disprove his theory.   Reading on the digital nature of DNA. Warning: many links you will find in searched for digital DNA are creationists trying to twist the digital nature of DNA into an argument for an intelligent designer.   https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-history-mendel-dna-yafeng-shan  https://resolution-kelvin2514.blogspot.com/2012/02/essentials-atcg-abcs-of-dna.html?m=1	1645113018.0	hxbjkgi	t3_stz4d1	t1_hx7efn0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/stz4d1/why_was_evolution_considered_so_radical_when_dogs/hxbjkgi/
3rksbbja	Contributing to the uncanny valley theme: the toys of previous generations are, by definition, *old*. Most of the examples you'll see are faded, their clothes torn by play, or they're missing limbs, their joints are frozen, their hair is patchy, their painted skin is peeling off - and all their colours were comparatively muted anyway, compared to what we can do with plastics nowadays. Even vibrantly-coloured modern play equipment that's been left alone for just a decade or two gets very quickly very messed up (Google it), and it only needs to lose a little of the human/anthropomorphic resemblance that once made it cute in order to take a swan-dive into the Uncanny Valley.  There's stuff to be said about age in other ways, too - these false children, who neither aged nor died while their owners lived their whole lives into senescence and death, can be seen as almost cruel in their immortality, surviving the boy or girl who loved them without a change of expression.	1645117039.0	hxbu6xt	t3_su5uwg	t1_hxavqqd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su5uwg/why_do_so_many_traditional_childrens_toys_and/hxbu6xt/
ebdgbjp6	Could you elaborate a little bit? Economic bubbles by definition are unsustainable economic trends which carry the seeds of their own destruction. Are you asking what caused the bubble in the first place or are you asking if there was a specific instigating event that caused it to burst?    To draw a parallel, the US Mortgage Crisis was inevitably going to break when banks aggressively marketed mortgages to people with premiums which by law were legally allowed to fluctuate, which were then being sold to just about anyone who could prove they were employed. This inevitably leads to a problem where the minute teaser rates were up and the full cost of these mortgages came to bear the holders of said mortgages would default on their loan. So anyone who was familiar with the system and understood the kinds of people banks were preying on understood that eventually it'd all come crumbling down.   But knowing that the whole thing would not last is quite a bit different than knowing *when* it'll burst. Which, in the case of the Mortgage Crisis, was right around when the Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. That specific event turned a 'someday' problem into a 'right now' problem.    Other parallels can be found with most economic bubbles, Black Tuesday during the Great Depression for example. But to provide a counter example, you can also consider something like the Spanish Empire. While her colonies provided Spain with a great deal of material wealth, no one was really paying attention to what flooding commodity markets like silver and gold would do, which lead to the Spanish Price Revolution. While 1% inflation isn't ruinous in a modern economy, the Spanish importing silver and gold in such quantities lead to an inflation rate of 1% to 1.5% on the year, every year, for over 150 years. And while this economic disaster was more a story measured in decades and centuries, it still lead to a situation where Charles V abdicated and the Spanish crown declared bankruptcy in 1557 because wars are expensive and when you already have debt, bringing on more typically comes with the ear mark of higher interest rates.	1645119160.0	hxbzwyo	t3_suogax	t3_suogax	/r/AskHistorians/comments/suogax/what_were_the_major_problems_which_caused_the/hxbzwyo/

joxkm	You’re asking a very specific question about the motivations of authors, which would require knowledge of the actual author and evidence of their actual beliefs contrasted with what they wrote, or else evidence directly indicating motivation.  To the best of my knowledge, we do not have evidence that directly implicates any author with *intentional* fabrication in large part because we do not have direct evidence of the authors. That said, substantive and comparative analysis of the Bible as well as non-canonical works creates a set of data from which intentional fabrication can be inferred as a reasonable possibility, but the same data can also lead to reasonable inferences of sincere beliefs imperfectly passed through oral or scribal traditions, misunderstandings, bias, or differing interpretations of prior works.   For the most part we also can not speak to the motivations behind the selection of Biblical canon, as it developed over time and was already more or less in its recognized form by the time theologians and religious authorities added their canons to the historical record. Differences in canons can be attributed to theological debate and differences.   However, establishment of official doctrine as established by councils can and have been analyzed through a lens of intentionally formulating faith. This includes the Henry VIII breaking the Anglican Church from Roman Catholicism over of personally wanting to divorce his wife. It should be noted that the Church in England as a whole also had a fair amount of internal debate over doctrinal differences between Protestantism and Catholicism, and so the formation of the Ten Articles can be studied from both a theological and personal viewpoint.  Additionally, more recent religious offshoots can be analyzed more thoroughly due to more contextual information regarding the formation of their canon and doctrine. This can be applied to recognized cults/child sex abuse rings such as Paul Schäfer’s *Colonia Dignidad*.  There is also the Latter Day Saints movement, which has a lot of recorded history in regard to its founding and the introduction of new books to the Bible contained within the Book of Mormon. Though believers of course believe the Book of Mormon is true revelation, those outside the movement, including ex-Mormons, believe there is ample evidence it was all fabricated by Joseph Smith and possibly collaborators. That is a large subject on its own.	1645120479.0	hxc3hv9	t3_sutmih	t3_sutmih	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sutmih/is_there_evidence_that_parts_of_the_christian/hxc3hv9/

365hps1w	There was something similar in Silla-era Korea, roughly 50BCE to 1000 CE. There were tile roofs on the pricier houses, and the end tiles on the corners were always decorated. A popular decoration was the face of a ddokabe (probably spelled wrong), usually translated "goblin". It was an animated inanimate object, often a broom. Sounds strange, but the people thought everything was animate, so there it is.   The ddokaybee (ditto) could be frightening, so its scary face was placed on roof tiles to keep away evil spirits. When I asked someone who's really studied this, she said these roof tiles were most popular following outbreaks of illness.

The word itself was derived in Italy after excavations of artwork in the Domus Arena and because they were found "in a cave" or "in a grotto" it became grotto-esque (literally grottesco). Later (1600s) Chimaera may have had a "grotesque" quality but we wouldnt understand it to be "a grotesque" until much later. Hence the 1800s comment.

Yeah, Gargoyles served a function as water spouts, but it's not like they HAD to be ornately sculpted to serve that purpose. People chose that because they appreciated it above and beyond the purely functional.

13ch64	 I love this question and the clip that inspired it. On larger ships like galleons and carracks (picture ships like Mayflower and large Age of Sail man o' war style ships) you absolutely had these large, orante rear sections-  they're generally called aftcastles, although the technical term is aftercastle. These most commonly housed the captain's cabin or very occasionally a large planning area (picture a conference room at sea). These were sometimes gilded and decorated to show the wealth of the ships' owners or country of origin, but general merchant ships and whaling ships were usually left relatively plain because it didn't serve a real purpose and it cost quite a bit of money. Towards the end of the 1700s these ornate aftcastles became less and less common as western ships became lower to the water and more sleek in design. One of the best examples of an elaborate aftcastle on a ship that still sails is Kalmar Nyckel, a replica of a Swedish ship that sails out of Delaware.	1645133742.0	hxd2q4j	t3_su8rlj	t3_su8rlj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/su8rlj/did_bulging_amber_solariums_exist_on_old_timey/hxd2q4j/

bcido	It's a combination of factors; pre-made sculptural elements are very cheap but it is difficult to make them work naturally within a space. Either you dedicate yourself to picking features that all blend together in a coherent historical style (which would just be a revival) or you try and blend different elements at the risk of looking "tacky". Custom sculptural elements can look quite beautiful, but doing custom stonework/woodwork is significantly more expensive now than it was 100 years ago.  I've done a cursory search and the closest thing I can find to "modern" gargoyles comes from the Art Deco period. I was hoping to find a postmodern building with some abstract gargoyles, but sadly nothing came up.	1645134600.0	hxd51sy	t3_sug6u8	t1_hxd1qmk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sug6u8/why_did_we_stop_putting_gargoyles_on_buildings/hxd51sy/

The distinction I am trying to draw is that when chimaera were described as grotesque, its because people were using grotesque to mean what it means now, not because it took on a new meaning with the adjective use of the object - and didnt become a noun until the 1800s in French and English.	1645137050.0	hxdbf1x	t3_sug6u8	t1_hxcg2za	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sug6u8/why_did_we_stop_putting_gargoyles_on_buildings/hxdbf1x/

feqz1	I won't say whether it is fabricated, fictional, apocryphal, or whatever but there are certain parts of the bible we can definitively say did not happen as written.   The Flood did not happen. There are no sedimentary records depicting a worldwide flooding event and in fact there is not enough surface water on the planet to cover all the land (at least since Humans have been on the planet).   We can also say that the associated Ark story did not happen. There is no genetic evidence all animals on earth simultaneously descended from a single male and female of the species as were supposedly saved on the ark. In fact it would be impossible to gather two of every species in one human lifetime, let alone build a boat large enough to hold them all and their food (and fecal matter).	1645138073.0	hxddzy9	t3_sutmih	t3_sutmih	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sutmih/is_there_evidence_that_parts_of_the_christian/hxddzy9/
4u0ti	You're getting your etymology lines crossed here, I think. Grotesque, as a noun came first. Miriam-Webster cites the noun as first appearing in English in 1561, and the adjective appearing later in 1603. In any case, neither were broad definitions at first, which was the point I was making in my initial comment. Grotesque as an adjective was first and foremost only a way to describe the specific artwork style. The broader use of the phrase to mean *anything* "gross" or ugly has developed over the span of the last 300 years.	1645138367.0	hxdeqi3	t3_sug6u8	t1_hxdbf1x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sug6u8/why_did_we_stop_putting_gargoyles_on_buildings/hxdeqi3/

3wj81	*Francis, the Talking Mule* appeared in seven comedy films of the 1950s.  Roy Rogers' horse *Trigger* was always prominent in his film appearances, and doubtless would have been recognized if seen walking down a Beverly Hills equestrian trail.  *Mr. Ed,* the talking horse, appeared in 143 television episodes in the 1960s. Portrayed (except in the first season) by gelding Bamboo Harvester, he was voiced by former Western film actor Allan Lane.  Probably only Trigger would have been recognized by fans if riding in an unmarked trailer, but any of the three could have made celebrity appearances for events like local TV kids shows, shopping center promotions, or supermarket openings.

Medieval monkz would hand write books on parchment as can be seen in this 14thc century manuscript from [Brussels](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/1424/loyset-liedet-and-pol-fruit-david-aubert-fifteen-cuttings-from-histoire-de-charles-martel-flemish-written-1463-146 )  Books written by hand were extremely expensive and not something a regular person would own.    >And it went through all sorts of technological transformations, and then it became books that everybody could buy  The major technological invention that allowed the common consumer to gain access to books as we know it was obviously the printing press, and was made in what is modern day Germany in the 14thc century.

a3b03	I am mildly familiar with one technique referred too as the "Sioux alarm clock". I first heard of this in the 1945 book Wildwood Wisdom by Ellsworth Jaeger. "Sioux Alarm Clock. When a Sioux warrior wanted to be awakened early to go to the war trail, he merely drank a lot of water before he went to bed at night.  The earlier he wanted this primitive alarm clock to waken him, the more water he drank." p419.  With a quick search I found reference too Stanley Vestal’s 1984 book, Warpath: The True Story of the Fighting Sioux Told in a Biography of Chief White Bull, “Indian warriors could determine in advance their hour of rising by regulating the amount of water drunk before going to bed.”  I have not read the later book but imagine anyone who has, or is more familiar with Chief Whitebull and his depictions of Sioux life and history.   So there are at least two mentions of Native Americans drinking water before bed to wake up.

dhjt57ca	Wisconsin, and Milwaukee in particular, became a base of socialism for three major reasons.   The first was that in the United States, there's a swath of the country stretching from Minneapolis through the Upper Midwest and Mid-Atlantic into New England where almost all of America's early industry was headquartered . This is for a lot of reasons (proximity to iron and coal deposits, access to easy shipping via the Great Lakes, large pools of immigrant labor, etc), but the point is that along with industry went large and highly militant labor movements.   The second was the large German-American population that settled in major Midwestern cities like Milwaukee. This is not unique to Milwaukee, of course, there were other major centers of German immigration in Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Saint Louis. The significance of this is that in the mid-19th century, most of these German immigrants were fleeing from the aftermath of the failed 1848 German Revolution. These immigrants, who were almost entirely leftists who had been exposed to socialist ideas in Germany, brought them to America and continued to consume the latest left-wing thought coming out of Europe. (Interestingly, Karl Marx was almost one of these immigrants, seriously considering moving to Texas a few years before the publication of the Communist Manifesto).  So that explains why there was a lot of left-wing energy in Midwestern cities. But why were they particularly successful in Milwaukee? That's at least partly due to a movement called "sewer socialism", referencing the high-quality public sewer system they created. The sewer socialists, based mostly in Milwaukee, sought to focus on practical municipal reforms over revolution. When Milwaukee socialists found themselves in municipal positions, they pushed for improved public services and cleaner neighborhoods, avoiding the sort of machine corruption common in other American cities. This was a popular approach, and Milwaukee was governed by socialist mayors from 1910-1912, 1916-1940, and 1948-1960, as well as electing the first ever socialist to the House of Representatives in 1910.	1645155666.0	hxehoo5	t3_sv2uit	t3_sv2uit	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sv2uit/til_that_wisconsin_historically_had_many/hxehoo5/

9p1nj	Hopefully this won’t get deleted as my answer is not really historic but technical.  Capacitors have been around since the mid 18th century. You could build a capacitor bank, charge it off household current and then discharge it quickly enough that you will get an output off 1.21 gw.  A 2f capacitor charged at 220v would hold 48.4 kJ calculated using E=CV\^2/2  1 watt is defined as 1 joule per second and a capacitors discharge rate is determined by the resistance of the circuit it is connected to and the capacitance of the capacitor using the formula T=RC where T is the time taken for the capacitor to discharge 63% of the energy stored.  I‘m going to make a couple of assumptions here that aren’t strictly correct to keep things simple but in a practical application you could just add more capacitors in parallel to account for losses or use more smaller capacitors to get a faster discharge rate if the circuit has higher resistance.   tells us that You mention a lightning strike being sufficient but not practical as you don’t know when or where it will happen so I will use that as a basis (ignoring all the complicated stuff about how a lightning strike actually works) for how long you need 1.21gw for. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html tells us a lightning strike lasts about	1645158047.0	hxemica	t3_sux9jd	t3_sux9jd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sux9jd/lets_say_im_a_wealthy_but_otherwise_average/hxemica/

Long story short, I would say all the Amazon is man-made but there is evidence to suggest large tracts of it were cultivated like parklands or silvaculture. The major sign is the soil itself, in some places, there’s evidence it was deliberately composed of charcoal, broken pottery, and garbage to make fertile soil. It’s distinctly darker than the “natural” soil.	1645158953.0	hxeo91t	t3_sv86bn	t3_sv86bn	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sv86bn/was_the_amazon_rainforest_manmade/hxeo91t/

5r0hc	Hi! I also hope that this doesn’t break the sub rules, but considering that this is a more technical than historical question and also clearly asked tongue-in-cheek, I hope I can provide an answer based on my personal expertise as an electrical engineer.   In short, no, there is absolutely no way a regular person could get 1 or 2 Farads of capacitance in 1955. At the time, commercially available electrical components would primarily be sold in hobbyist stores and catalogs aimed at amateur radio operators. On page 64 of this [Radio Shack catalog from 1955](https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/1955_radioshack_catalog.html) you can see the “postage stamp mica” capacitors available at the time. The values in this particular catalog are around 0.05 mF, which is 1/20,000 of 1 Farad. In order to get the 16 Farads in the comment above, you would have to lay out approximately a 50 ft x 50ft array of 320,000 capacitors.  But none of that even matters because the poster above mentioned charging these off of 220 V. Even in modern day, a 220 V capacitor (which is usually used for jump starting motors and the like) will only go up to 50ish mF. I expect to be corrected since this is the Internet, but I am not aware of any commercially available way to achieve that much capacitance with that high of a voltage rating even today.  A modern commercially available supercapacitor, though, will run you about $7 and fit in the palm of your hand https://sci-supply.com/super-capacitor-1-farad/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIq6Gsx8KI9gIVlkWGCh0FNwB6EAQYAyABEgL-pfD_BwE.	1645162873.0	hxev80j	t3_sux9jd	t1_hxeq06o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sux9jd/lets_say_im_a_wealthy_but_otherwise_average/hxev80j/

3omotdxk	All three families gained fame or recognition as wealthy business people.  With wealth comes the opportunity for some members to spend time dabbling in politics.  The Roosevelt's were probably more successful in business and politics than the other two.  Eleanor was Teddy's niece and FDR's wife so that is something the Kennedy's and Bush's never had.    Most of the Roosevelt politicians served in state or city government positions.  This went on for several generations.  The Kennedy's and Bush's have really only had two generations of politicians; John, Robert, Teddy and then their children.  The Bush's had George Sr. And then George W. And Jeb.  Further, some of Teddy's children chose the military and other federal service.

3xdm8a2j	I'm not an expert in rainforest succession on a geological timescale, but the first thing I did was look up Graham Hancock. He seems to be a pseudoscientist on ancient civilizations:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Hancock?wprov=sfla1  Noting his appearance on the Joe Rogan show automatically makes me take anything he is about to say with a grain of salt, but then seeing his book titles and cover art made me eat the whole spoonful of salt. He is one of the major voices of the Ancient Aliens pseudoscience that led the History Channel into it's downward spiral about 15 years ago.  That being said, it seems to be true that much of the Amazon Rainforest has been "anthropogenically modified" over the past 12,000 years. That doesn't mean humans planted every tree/shrub/forb, rather the soils were impacted by humans modifying them to support greater soil biodiversity which in turn supports greater plant diversity etc over a VERY long period of time:  https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/geoglyph/overview#:~:text=While%20previously%20thought%20to%20have,is%2C%20in%20fact%2C%20an%20anthropogenic  Interesting to compare that to this Smithsonian article that talks about the history of science examining the Amazon and one botanist from 1991 declaring it  "The First Eden, a pristine natural kingdom":  https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/pristine-untouched-amazonian-rainforest-was-actually-shaped-humans-180962378/  Very cool to see science modifying it's hypotheses and conclusions with new data. Also, very silly for a botanist to talk about the "First Eden" being the geologically very young Amazon Rainforest when the oil we use today came from forests that existed more than 300 MYA.  Though Graham Hancock is correct on the surface, I would look to other more reliable sources for more info.	1645163755.0	hxewnz4	t3_sv86bn	t3_sv86bn	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sv86bn/was_the_amazon_rainforest_manmade/hxewnz4/
9p1nj	Absolutely, you can make capacitors from aluminium foil and wax paper.   I did have a quick look for some old electronic component catalogs to check availability but all I could find was listings selling catalogs as collectibles, not showing what was inside. 2f capacitors are probably too large for this anyway as you likely wouldn’t get the resistance low enough to discharge them fast enough. I picked that size for easier math and that it’s about the biggest capacitor you can make using aluminium foil and wax paper. A more realistic design would use more smaller capacitors in parallel, as to what size exactly, you would need to know the resistance of the circuit. Most likely you would end up with about 10000 1millifarad capacitors which these days sell for under $1 each retail, I’m sure you could get a discount ordering 10000 of them. That would be a bugger of thing to build but should be possible and would be an absolutely  epic thing to see.	1645164241.0	hxexg03	t3_sux9jd	t1_hxeq06o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sux9jd/lets_say_im_a_wealthy_but_otherwise_average/hxexg03/
4yxllfi9	This question is coming from a place with entirely the wrong assumptions about piracy. A lot of pirates/privateers were British. Our weather is definitely not 85F, wool is the fibre most readily available in a typical British port owing to our sheep farming and mercers, and disrobing is not encouraged in British culture, possibly because hypothermia is a constant threat in our North Atlantic climate. A woollen seacoat would be standard attire in the Royal Navy for centuries for a reason.  And a great many privateers were ex naval men.   Additionally temperatures at sea are typically less than at land- sailors in all history have tended to need warm clothing and wet weather gear because sailing the ocean is frequently chilly and wet.	1645165467.0	hxezbuf	t3_sv5lkh	t3_sv5lkh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sv5lkh/did_golden_age_pirates_really_wear_such_heavy/hxezbuf/

vrnrs	So i initially thought about jacking into the highest voltage distribution cables in the US at 34,500 volts. But that is still 29,000 amps...... Thats not gonna be pretty and very likely impossible for an average citizen. Hopefully an electrical engineer sees this and comments on viability of 29,000 amps.  Then i thought about straight up breaking into a nuclear reactor. That is starting to get outside the possibility of an average suburbanite and a 1955 reactor with an output of 5MW is still far from your goal.  So maybe your person decides to travel interstate to the hoover dam for their trespassing needs. With 16 turbines (well 15 big and 2 small ones where the 16th turbine was meant to go) it had a max output of 1.3 gigawatts in 1961 when the last turbine was placed. You would only need 13 of those turbines to your target. Just i can't find the exact date where the hoover dam had 13 turbines just there were 9 functional by end of 1939 and all of them in 1961.	1645171581.0	hxf7sai	t3_sux9jd	t3_sux9jd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sux9jd/lets_say_im_a_wealthy_but_otherwise_average/hxf7sai/

Armchair generals tend to vastly downplay or overexaggerate the value of various things because they only count kills, and I'd reckon the same applies here.

Have a look at the National Ignition Facility, they generated a 10 tw pulse recently, as the entire global generation capacity is around 7.5 tw quite obviously they didn’t need that as a continuous power supply it’s just a matter of compressing the power into a short pulse NIF does clever stuff with their lasero compress the pulse https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-experiment-puts-researchers-threshold-fusion-ignitionhttps://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-experiment-puts-researchers-threshold-fusion-ignition but it is the same principle, build up  power over time and release it in a short pulse.

dijxg9ci	An ancient historic are was deeply affected by world war one trench building - but it was not in an active war zone.  Salisbury plain - the area that includes Stonehenge - is an area of intense historic interest. Since 1897 it was also home, to series of military bases, that was hugely expanded upon the outbreak of the First World War. The area hosted one of the largest military training ground in Britain as well as an aerodrome. There was intense concern about damage to Stonehenge itself as well as other historic artifacts (e.g. barrows) due to this activity. The digging of trenches for example, and use of munitions, had a significant effect on the area. The Society of Works, Wiltshire Archeology Society amid others did try to document the area and monitor the impact of military activities but this was largely based on the archeology of the time that focused more on external structures as opposed to earthworks; George Englehart of the Wiltshire Archeology Society noted that two soldiers who removed soil from a barrow promised to put it back afterwards!   The war did galvanise an existing campaign to protect Stonehenge: the aerodrome was dismantled after the war, amid a campaign to 'restore' Stonehenge into a preserved area of national importance, absent of military or commercial (farming) activity  M Barber (2014) Stonehenge Aerodrome and the Stonehenge Landscape; English Heritage Research Dept Report 007/2014 Historic England  Walker, K.

Perhaps not, the case can be made here that this is a matter of the same. As a means to trace familial lineage to the creation of permanence. A important aspect of ancient peoples world view is to to connect themselves to the past in order to maintain societal worth.

4c90tj3x	Josephine Crawley Quinn discusses the subject of the child sacrifice in her book In Search of the Phoenecians. Her primary focus is on explaining why this practice appears only in the Western Mediterranean colonies and is seemingly completely absent (at least in terms of the archeological record) in the Phoenecian cities of the Levant. She argues that the prevalence of this practice only in Carthaginian sites starting in the 7th century BCE is evidence that the Phonecians city states were actually culturally distinct and did not see themselves as belonging to the same cultural group. The Carthiginians, unlike their Tyrean ancestors, sought to centralize power, partly through exporting cultural practices, including the circle of tophet, explaining the presence of these sites from Malta, to Tunisia, Southern Sardinia, Western Sicily, and across the Western North African coast to Morrocco.	1645188174.0	hxftqr2	t3_suok96	t1_hxcf2ed	/r/AskHistorians/comments/suok96/how_prevalent_was_child_sacrifice_in_the_levant/hxftqr2/

9phf7ddg	"even if plausible, it's unprovable" is the best bet here, although admittedly it does not make for much of an answer.   Mary Beard has a treatment of the whole affair in SPQR. She points out that the death of Caligula is one of the best-documented killings in Roman history, but a lot of it is mysterious. She seems quite dubious of the official story that Claudius had no ambitions and was chosen by the Praetorians when they found him hiding behind a curtain. She points out that a show of reluctance can often cover ruthless ambition, and that all the stories about how awful Caligula was and how innocent Claudius was were written down during the reign of Claudius.   Claudius, of course, came to power after the bloody murder of his own nephew and his wife and their daughter and a lot of other people. She points out that a -lot- of the stories about bad emperors were written down during the reigns of the successors. These successors often came to power after bloodshed. (the list of emperors who died of natural causes is short) These emperors would often, like Claudius, have the motivation to encourage the writing of stories that made them look good. She tends to treat almost all the stories about succession and palace politics as stories that tell us about what Romans thought and said, not as things you can rely on to be true. So even if there was a plot that Claudius was in on, you would not expect to find much evidence.   &#x200B;       Beard, Mary. SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome. Reprint edition.

They were installed using open cut methods… meaning trenches were dug in the streets or through lots and pipe was placed there. Early pipe was either constructed using brick and mortar (larger diameter pipe) or vitrified clay pipe (smaller diameter). The pipes often had combined sewer outfalls… areas that allowed a combination of sewage and storm water to overflow into waterways in the instances of high rain events.	1645196374.0	hxgar6k	t3_sv6zkk	t3_sv6zkk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sv6zkk/how_were_mass_plumbing_systems_built_for_major/hxgar6k/

5upeokmv	I would seriously challenge your assertion that the constitution “allowed the states to succeed”. The north did not annex the southern states. A very very simplified answer is that the south lost the and the states were “readmitted”. There are alot of people who would argue that the southern states never actually “succeed” because there is no provision for that in the constitution.  The constitution doesn’t say anything about succession.

wiz2n	The Constitution did not allow for states to secede, actually. Why would the cornerstone of the US government provide the means for its own undoing?  Those who argued for secession were typically in the camp that the US government was infringing the principles it stood upon- that their revolt was justified, as the government was not providing for the common good of the South. At least from the perspective of southern agitators, they were revolting against Northern overreach into their domestic institutions.  On the other side of the coin, I shall quote Lincoln: "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union." What would it mean for the integrity of these United States if states could break away freely? That is not to say that there weren't elements of the Union seeking peace- or profits from the cotton trade- such as the Copperheads, but that generally, the goal was to preserve the Union.  'Annex' is kind of a funny term here, I would say. Is returning a revolting portion of your country into the fold an annexation, or is it just bringing order?	1645201933.0	hxgou9g	t3_svlh35	t3_svlh35	/r/AskHistorians/comments/svlh35/why_the_us_annexed_the_confederates_in_the_civil/hxgou9g/

The RDK didn't mobilized their electorate for "No" vote.

Also 67% is pretty good turnout for post-Soviet Ukraine   The RDK position was based on Soviet 1990 Secession law which provided for separate referendums in autonomies in the event of the Republic's withdrawal from the USSR, but after the August Coup, the Soviet legal procedure was finally buried by the 5th Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR  Ukrainian government specially used "Do you support the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine?" question instead of a direct question about support for independence, because they believed that relying on the parliament authority (no matter how funny this phrase sounds for a modern Ukrainian) would outweigh the results of Soviet unionist propaganda.

3bhjywh7	Answering this question requires understanding how Croatia, on the one hand, and Bosnia, on the other, became republics within Yugoslavia and, eventually, independent states.  Croatia is a successor state ultimately from the Austrian Empire and more specifically the Kingdom of Hungary. Without Croatia, Hungary and, by extension, Austria-Hungary would have been landlocked. If you’ve ever wondered why the interwar leader of landlocked Hungary was an admiral, this was why.  In contrast, Bosnia was a secession from the Ottoman Empire, a country that had plenty of sea ports (arguably too many from the standpoint of the European Great Powers).  Because the current borders were determined largely by ethnic composition, they indicate a Croatian majority along the shoreline, which is in keeping with Croatia’s onetime subjection to the Republic of Venice, just across the Adriatic.	1645214008.0	hxhk93w	t3_svqk60	t3_svqk60	/r/AskHistorians/comments/svqk60/how_did_croatia_end_up_with_all_the_shoreline_on/hxhk93w/
