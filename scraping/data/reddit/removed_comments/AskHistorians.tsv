They don’t cost much (between $15-$20 a month) and they contain all the latest scholarship on any given historical topic.	1642691439.0	htgseua	t3_s7kat3	t3_s7kat3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7kat3/how_to_become_knowledgeable_on_a_certain_era_of/htgseua/
jduzx	I don't think there is any numbers on _how many_ historians "take it seriously," but Marxist historiography is alive and well; I count myself in the tradition. Plenty of recognised and important historians nowadays are Marxists; but, I know it doesn't bode well for my point, think about a name such as Eric Hobsbawm(died 2012), one of the most important and influential historians in recent years. Eugene Genovese, who died the same year, was also a hugely influential figure. Robert Brenner, he is still alive and well, and also a key figure in history, even having a whole debacle named after him, i.e. "the Brenner Debates." Perry Anderson, also an important figure, still alive. Dave Renton, an important historian when it comes to fascism, is also a Marxist. Enzo Traverso is also a Marxist who has written extensively and important works. Edgar Hartwig is a German name I could mention. Gerald Horne is a contemporary and active American name. Chris Wickam is another name that has some weight to it.  But the short answer is, that yes, Marxism is still alive and well among historians nowadays. It is taken serious by most, even among non-Marxists, and Marxists are recognised in ways such as receiving positions and awards regularly.	1642700589.0	hthgz56	t3_s8nnvk	t3_s8nnvk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/hthgz56/
gh16flt8	It’s important to remember that Germany was newly unified (1871) anyway, during which there was a movement to make Austria part of Germany (pan Germanism). So many contemporaries would not have seen it in such stark contrast as Germany / Austria, as it can seem to more modern observers. And, though Austria had a large multi-ethnic contingency, the Austrian Germans would have been viewed, for the most, to be as ‘German’ as Saxons, Bavarians etc, which had all until recently be autonomous states, like Austria was (until 1938).	1642702234.0	hthlioa	t3_s7ogpy	t3_s7ogpy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7ogpy/why_did_the_germans_not_mind_that_adolf_hitler/hthlioa/
g8w9r6nt	So this a weird one. Some Muslims were honorary Nazis. Sadam Hussian’s uncle was pro nazi because of them fighting the British. That doesn’t mean Hitler would have loved him back.  But also over 2.25 million Muslims do fought for the allies. Mostly fighting under the British.  12,000 People from Palestinians volunteered to fight for the English and defend North Africa   The only thing a lot leaders had in common with Nazis was Israel. To the Arab world Israel and losing land was their biggest issue.   But also remember the Middle East is where a lot of Jews went for refuge.  In short. Hitler needed every ally he could get with the amount of conflicting facts it is safe to assume he just tried to manipulate them into fighting for him but it didn’t work well. He was a master manipulator. Same with what happened in Japan. Pretty sure Hitler hated Japanese people but he needed help. He thought of Arabs as no different to semites, he liked European Muslims like modern day Bosnians. He liked Islam with the history of fighting against invaders like the crusades or Afghanistan. Islam is the best example of fighting against invaders. His tactic was to use hatred Arabs had for Israel and the British to manipulate them. He did hate Muslims for not being white, because that didn’t side with him. Hitler thought the enemy of my enemy is my friend but it didn’t work out very well.  Islam is was the ww2 version of the Zimmerman telegram. “Hey guys fight for us and we will give you some things that you might want”.

cml4w8s	Something to keep in mind is that suicide as it is today was not very common at all until after the first worldwar and even then it still wasn't common until much later.  Have a thought experiment. You're in the trenches in Verdun or Yerpes, You've miraculously survived enough assaults to be reasonably effected by PTSD, now some key things, for the most part, chances are you volunteered, you're a young man with a 19th century mindset out to show how you're a man. To do so you need to come back home (preferably alive) to your wife or fiancee or family. You have a reason to keep staying alive even when things look bleak. Most people who have something to live for don't commit suicide (cross culturally).   Now if you'd received word from home that your wife/fiancee was sleeping around or died, then suicide would be a major risk but in those cases you were almost always given leave or in some cases letters would be censored. The former situation (leave) would usually lead to desertion so you wouldn't go back to the trenches anyways.  Overall the main factors causing the historic suicide rates today are a general feeling of hopelessness and a common feeling that "nothing is worth it" both *terrifying* indicators of societal collapse... Which magnifies the stress, which magnifies the feeling of apathy and hopelessness which magnifies the... And it goes on and on. Society today has a high suicide rate as a result of the culture and values unique to today. Almost any other time in history the fundamental value of "I'd like to stay alive" was more than enough to keep you from killing yourself because of stress or apathy.  Tldr. Suicide today is really unusual from a historical perspective and it's causes today don't translate well to the culture of the Early 1900s	1642707268.0	hthz6rx	t3_s8dc4j	t3_s8dc4j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8dc4j/what_were_suicide_rates_in_the_trenches_during/hthz6rx/
f8jum7xb	Thanks for the answer! I'm aware of Hobsbawm and Brenner, but I've never read them unfortunately. That might be a huge question, but what does their marxism amount to? Surely, they don't refer to marxian value form analysis in their historical research. Do they actually subscribe to historical materialism as laid out in Marx's German Ideology? I.e. do/did they believe in the existence of a certain number of stages of development according to which human history progresses?	1642707605.0	hti03ut	t3_s8nnvk	t1_hthgz56	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/hti03ut/

fjkx0xqo	If it succeeded. Yes.  Japan didn’t have natural resources for war so taking out the only threat in the Pacific Ocean would’ve been great for them, if it went as planned. This is why they invaded islands throughout the ocean.  And when this occurred the military might of the United States was not the top in the world. We were far behind England and Germany and a (large) handful of other countries. In fact it was England who gave us the schematics and whatnot for weapons so we could help them out (due to us having so many resources).	1642707900.0	hti0wte	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/hti0wte/
jduzx	I'm not sure if I understand you, so please tell me if you meant something else.  Yes, most Marxists subscribe to the idea that the conditions of a society's production, or in Marxist terms a society's productive forces and relations of production, fundamentally shape and influences society's organisation, including the political commitments, cultural ideas and values that dominate in any society. And yes, while some ideas, like "the Asiatic mode of production" have fallen out of favour, rightfully so, most Marxist's agree on, if we agree that we are talking simplified and generalised, a progression from pre-civilisation over despotic or slave societies, into feudalism, into capitalism. Ofc. these distinctions are not set in stone, there are variations, and the progression isn't as linear as I make it sound here, no Marxist would claim so.  And ofc. Marxists may refer back the Marx's value form analysis, if it should it be relevant. It is part of the broader Marxist analysis, and important when discussing capitalist society.	1642708259.0	hti1wbu	t3_s8nnvk	t1_hti03ut	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/hti1wbu/
gh16flt8	The problem for Japan was their commitment to the war in China, in which they were bogged down and extremely low on resources (there are very few natural resources in Japan, and they relied on imports for their war effort).  But, America had put a coal and iron ore embargo on Japan, amongst other economic sanctions in order to curtail their expansion (desiring free trade with China).  The position Japan was in was therefore untenable. They could either discontinue their war in China (which the Japanese military industrial complex was already committed), or take the materials by force, namely, from oil fields in the Philippines (under US mandate in 1941). This obviously meant war with America.  The idea at pearl harbour was to knock out the US pacific fleet, at which they believed America would then sue for peace, being what they perceived essentially to be a ‘decadent’, liberal democracy, with no stomach for war - this obviously proved a massive underestimation.  So in hindsight, although this seemed suicidal, and in truth, perhaps never winnable in the long term, the important thing to remember is that it didn’t come out of the blue, Japan had their reasons.

ugjki	My understanding is, IF the Japanese intended to start beef with the USA, then the attack on Pearl Harbor was strategically necessary. The reason it was NOT a good decision overall is that Japan had no real way to win a war against the United States in the long term.

bisylusj	To follow up on this: Japan had been fixated on the idea of a "knockout blow" style of warfare ever since the Russo-Japanese War was won at Tsushima Strait.

lpht4c8	It still would have been a big mistake. It would have delayed US operations by maybe about 9 months. The US had launched three of the new *Essex*-class carriers in 1942, five more in 1943, and ten more in 1944. There was simply no way for Japan to keep up with US surface fleet production   And that’s ignoring the submarine campaign. US submarines sank 89,000 tons of Japanese merchant shipping in 1942, 1.3 million tons in 1943, 2 million tons in 1944, and 415,000 tons in 1945. The jump between 1942 and 1943 was due to the *Balao*-class submarine joining the fight in late 1942 (phasing out the *Gato*-class, which remained in service until 1944) and fixes to the infamously poorly designed Mark 14 torpedos. By the end of 1944, more than half of the Japanese merchant marine had been sunk, and the American submarines were having such a hard time finding targets that they would sometimes come to the surface and use machine-guns to sink wooden fishing boats.   When you combine the US’ ability to pump out ships (between Pearl Harbor and the end of the war, the US would add to its fleet roughly 6 battleships, 18 fleet carriers, 64 light/escort carriers, 24 cruisers, 370 destroyers, and 200 submarines), the effectiveness of the submarine war and Japan’s failure to adequately address it, and the fact that China was continuing to suck Japan’s resources, there was no feasible way for Japan to have won.   Ian W Toll’s *Pacific War* trilogy is an excellent read.	1642722006.0	htiyzkj	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htimgqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htiyzkj/

4250ypmu	Sorry I took so long to answer. I didn't have much time between work and study.   My answer will be mostly based in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJlXW988nY (all the information in this video seems pretty correct if I correctly remeber most of my classes about Brazil's history during high school. The reporter also interviewed historians, transport engineers and other speacialists and the informations she collects are well contextualised). Unfortunately there are no english captions for it.  She cites 4 major reasons for train network declining in Brazil. But before explaining those reasons I suppose it would be good to contextualize Brazil's colonization and how it was populated:  Brazil was a colony of Portugal from 1500 (when it was "discovered") to 1822 (when it became part of the Portuguese United Kingdom, together with Portugal and Algarves, due to the Portuguese Royal Family fleeing to Brazil from Napoleon attacks in Europe).   From the discovery on, the modus operandi of Portugal's goods extraction (for its colonies) focused mainly on the coastal areas. In Brazil that was caused in part due to the difficulty for inland migration, since a huge and dense forest bordered virtually all the Brazillian coast what made inland movement very difficult, in part due to indigen resistance to invasion of their lands, in part due to Portugal specialization to movement in waters. The main area targeted during this period (from 1500 to the end of XVI century) was Brazil's Northeastern and Eastern coast.   Then Brazil's major economic activity became sugarcane production (from XVI century to middle XVIII century) focused also on Northeastern coast due to its suitable climate and soil.   During XVII century Brazil started its interiorization policies but it worked mostly in its Southwest Region.    In the end of XIX century Brazil prompted its emmigration policies that populated mostly Southwest and South Region.  Those are the major reasons Brazil has this population distribution today:    [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco-Costa-4/publication/310487406/figure/fig6/AS:503062697189380@1496950901357/Population-density-of-Brazil-inhabitants-per-km-2-Source-wwwibgegovbr-censo.png](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco-Costa-4/publication/310487406/figure/fig6/AS:503062697189380@1496950901357/Population-density-of-Brazil-inhabitants-per-km-2-Source-wwwibgegovbr-censo.png)  Since Brazil has such an unequal distribution in its population density, its road networks and railway networks focused mostly on joining those areas and spreading in and around them (and connecting good producing areas to ports and therefore to the coast). That seems to be the reason Brazil's never had a railroad network as extensive as its counterpart nations.   Brazil reached its railway network extension peak in 1960 (38000 Km or about 23612 miles) but it started shrinking after that year and from 1970s it just stagnated.   Reasons for railroad decline in Brazil (that's the part where the video really talks about):   Reason n.01- The Coffee Crysis.   The coffee production was the main reason for the construction of railroads in Brazil, during XIX century. The first Brazilian railroad was the "Estrada de ferro Mauá" ("Mauá Railroad", launched in 1854) used to transport coffee from the Paraíba Valley to the Bagé Harbour in Rio de Janeiro. During XIX century and the beginning of XX, coffee was the main commodity in Brazil. It  made up to 50% of Brazilian global exports. Because of coffee, the railroad increased during this period to almost 30000 Km in 1920s. During that expansion, railroad started to carry around not just goods but also people.  Then the Great Crash happened in 1929. The USA was the biggest coffee buyer and the Great Depression caused a huge declining in coffee buying (and therefore in its price). Most railroads in Brazil were private and its owners stopped investing in them as they were not profitable anymore. That caused a long and slow period of decadence for railroads so that they wold eventually became state owned, about two decades after the crysis.  Reason n.02 - Cities growth   During 1940s Brazil starts changing a lot as it transitioned from an economy mostly agricultural to an mostly industrial one. This changing caused many cities to grow and the areas in between them start having less people what caused a decrease on the demand for trains connecting cities.   Reason n.03 - Cars popularization   In 1956, Juscelino Kubitschek wins the presidential election in Brazil and he chooses the automotive industry as the major part for his development plan for Brazil, called "50 anos em 5" ("\[progressing\] 50 years in 5"). Some experts suggest that this is the begining of Brazilian focus on road network (instead of any other transportation network). There are some reasons for choosing automotive industry as a central part in a development agenda: automotive industry has a long production chain which has a multipling effect on the economy and it employs qualified workeforce. That workforce also can become relevant consumers. It's also relevant to cite that during this period, in the Cold War context, the USA transfered part of its automotive technology to strenghten its bonds with Brazil (so to avoid USRR influence over Brazil) what made possible Brazil not just assemble cars parts, but properly produce them.  In addition it's cheaper to build highways than railroads, and in the 50s and 60s petroleum was very affordable, what made car transportation a way more advantageous approach than trains at that moment. This also impacted in the reason n.02 ("Cities growth"), since roads have better capillarity inside the cities than railroads.  For all that, during Kubistchek government (just 5 years) road extension in Brazil tripled. In the mean time railroads continued to be broken up.  Reason n.04 - Passanger lines extinction   The beginning and middle of XX century  faced many changes in globalwise transport. In Brazil, specifically, there were a lot of changes in transportation demand for goods and people, including the advent of airplanes, development of automotive industry, mass migration to cities, new worker legislation, etc, so the original bussiness model for Brazilian railroads couldn't cope with all that.  Some specialists argue that it wasn't just Brazil that faced all that changes but that railroad networks suffered such a strain in many countries. But the major difference was how the governments answered to those changes and what public policies were implemented on those countries. The countries that still maintain most of (or all... or even more than) those original railroad invested in railroad DESPITE their lower profitability. That means it was an active public policy.  That was the case of the USA, Germany and France for example. Those countries statized the railroads and took on the economic losses caused by the railroads and that made them still active until today. Since Brazil prefered not to take on those losses, most passenger lines became extinct up to 90s. So from 50s on, railroads in Brazil are more and more focused to transport only goods. And those are the ones still active today (we do still have very few to trains to transport people, but they are mostly small ones and located inside cities or that transport between very close cities. And I do mean when I say they're small one as from 38000 km of current railroads, only about 1000 km are for passengers).  Nowadays 70% of Brazilian railroads transport iron ore and about 12% transport soy.	1642723340.0	htj27vs	t3_ru8b5y	t3_ru8b5y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ru8b5y/many_latin_american_nations_once_had_extensive/htj27vs/

Catching the carriers at Pearl Harbor might delay the war 6-12 months, but it won’t change the fact that Japan started with logistical hurdles it could never overcome and would only get worse as the US ramped up.    The Japanese knew this and thought the US would quit if they got bloodied early.

ysax7	It was the best idea they had at the time. Japan's overall mission was to make themselves self-sufficient. The Japanese home islands were poor in natural resources, so they needed to accumulate territory and the loot therein to make that possible. In the Pacific, that put them at odds with China, European colonial powers,  maybe the Soviet Union, and the United States. Of those, only the United States had the resources to come at Japan and attack because of their geopolitical landscape - they were safe on their own continent (they COULD get interested in Hitler but didn't HAVE to because there was an ocean of separation) and had the industrial capacity to strike if needed and keep the hits coming. The European powers wouldn't risk the bulk of their militaries in a colonial conflict when they had fascism and communism to worry about closer to home. The Soviet Union might have the motivation to fight back but not the logistical capacity - most of its factories were on the other side of the country (de facto the other side of the world) and linked by one rail line to their Pacific territories. China could fight back if attacked but didn't have the strike capacity to launch an attack on their own, and there was a civil war between Communists and Nationalists that would keep their eyes focused inward.  Japan never realistically entertained the notion that they could defeat the United States in a protracted war if it came to it. Their hope was that if they wiped out most of our strike capacity at the beginning of the war, it would end the war before it ever got rolling. They didn't think we had the willpower to rebuild an entire navy from scratch if they sank the bulk of what presently existed, that we didn't have the stamina and motivation to fight our way island-by-island across the entire Pacific Ocean, and that they could catch our carriers at port at Pearl - they were wrong on all counts. If we dropped out of the fight, the rest of the Pacific would have been theirs for the taking. If anyone else came back to take what was theirs, Japan would have a huge chunk of the world to defend and pull resources from to fight back.  Pearl Harbor looks like a bad idea because it was the beginning of a four year war that Japan was destined to lose almost as soon as it started. Risk/reward - the risk was that we'd get pissed and stay pissed long enough to finish the job, but the reward was about a third of the world. Pearl Harbor was intended to be the only major event of a war that started and ended in December 1941, and had it gone according to plan it would have been a brilliant plan.	1642727361.0	htjbo7f	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjbo7f/
9vakt	I'm going to try to take this in a slightly different way.    By attacking Pearl Harbor, they set in motion their complete and total defeat.  By being so militarily devastated after the war, the Japanese were able to rebuild and focus their economy on industry and technology, without having to spend excessive amounts of money that would have been needed during the Cold War on their military, thus putting them in position to be one of the largest economies in the world by 2000.	1642727970.0	htjd2m3	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjd2m3/

Admittedly, the middle two weren't ideal choices, but they could have tried to serve as a stopgap until the US started spamming Essexes and Independences.  Remember, by the end of 1943, the US Navy churned out 7 Essex and 9 Independences with more on the way.  Not to mention, ok, you sink a few of our 21 kt, 14" armed standard type battleships.  Congratulations, here's 2 North Carolinas, 4 South Dakotas ready and 3 Iowas in the water by 1943.  That's 9 battleships commissioned or launched by the end of 1943.  Japan built 2.

dxy7h	(Not a top-level answer ...)  Most of the answers here seem to be guilty of "resulting," i.e. judging a decision by its actual outcome, rather than by the reality of the time.   The reality of the late 1930s is that Japan, a nation with few natural resources and reliant on imports, was in a near economic blockade by the US and other great powers. They had to do *something*, and after [losing to the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol), decided to instead to fight the US. Was Japan favored to win? Perhaps not. Could they conceivably have won, and would they have prospered from winning? Yes. Were there other alternatives to going to war? Maybe - I'm sure professional historians argue about this.  I contrast the attack on Pearl Harbor with Brexit, where *all* conceivable outcomes for the UK are negative. That's what I call a "bad decision"	1642728938.0	htjfb7y	t3_s8r0wm	t1_hti11bo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjfb7y/
ba5atljj	Now I'm no admiral, but just having more industrial capacity shouldn't be a game changer if you're now drastically weaker. Anything you pump out is still hilariously outnumbered, even if you're pumping 5x as much as the enemy. This is why the strategy before Midway on the American side came off as so desperate. The guy running the show had to make sure that the Japanese were not allowed to utterly dominate, because if they did, it wouldn't matter how much America could pump out since it would just be sunk immediately.  &#x200B;  And if America just retreated from the Pacific while they built their forces up, they'd essentially be leaving the entirety of the mainland up for bombing and an unlikely invasion.	1642729153.0	htjftaf	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjeqey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjftaf/

You can be genius in some field but party may need your skills in the factory line or in the army.  In Soviet or any perfect communist state is enough that in Trotsky's case Stalin feel paranoid about him and that was enough. No one can be smarter than leader and collective party.

8l9w4	Japan was never going to win an industrial victory over the US in the 1940s. They might, however, have won a victory through intimidation.   If the US had looked at the defeat at Pearl Harbor and thought “we can’t beat these guys”, or even “this fight will be too costly, let’s make a deal”, that would have been a victory for Japan.   That was more or less the goal of the attack, to blunt the US ability to counterattack long enough to conquer and consolidate a new empire, and force the US (and Britain and Netherlands) to accept a new status quo at the bargaining table.   Unhappily for them, they made some combination of misjudgments about the US response to such an attack. Rather than intimidating the US government or people, the attack solidified their resolve to fight rather than negotiate. Unless that resolve could be broken, a war of logistics against the US was a bad game for the Japanese to play.	1642730233.0	htjiahn	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htimgqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjiahn/

The result is that we now keep an entire Ghost Fleet for just that scenario. It's called the Ghost Fleet because it's composed of about 120 warships that were previously decommissioned but we keep docked and maintained by civilians all over the USA with some that are literally wrapped in plastic like giant toys.

i8q6y	The best analysis of this is in michael barnhart’s “japan prepares for total war”   Japan’s govt was searching for economic protection and took advantage of chinas internal conflicts to build an empire in china  This war was so massive that it required more resources and empire to keep it going. Japan thus invaded south east asia to gain access to indonesian rubber and oil fields.   Problem was the usa naval base in the phillipines which could, in war, easily destroy the trade routes. Plus american economic embargo was ruinous. It was 75% of japanese trade and 90% of oil.   The result was japan needed to occupy the phillipines. The problem was the big fat american fleet in hawaii which would just stream east. So, attack pearl harbor. Occupy the phillipines. Win the war in china. And then negotiate an ceasefire with america before they rebuilt their fleet. (Essentially recreating the russo-japanese war plan of a sneak attack and then, hopefully for japan, a battle of tsushima type victory at midway.  In short, for japan to win the war in china it would have to fight the usa.	1642733936.0	htjquly	t3_s8yukr	t3_s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/htjquly/

7gjek3q	I hate Marxists so much it’s unreal. Philosopher of science Karl Popper, in The Poverty of Historicism and Conjectures and Refutations, critiqued such claims of the explanatory power or valid application of historical materialism by arguing that it could explain or explain away any fact brought before it, making it unfalsifiable and thus pseudoscientific. Similar arguments were brought by Leszek Kołakowski in Main Currents of Marxism. Marx’s historical materialism famously inverted Hegel’s philosophy. For Marx, history was a succession of economic and political systems, or “modes of production” in Marx’s language. As technological innovations and new ways of organizing production led to improvements in a society’s capacity to meet human material needs, new modes of production would emerge. In each new mode of production, the political and legal system, as well as the dominant moral and religious values and practices, would reflect the interests of those who controlled the new productive system. Marx believed that the capitalist mode of production was the penultimate stage of human history. The productive power unleashed by new technologies and factory production under capitalism was ultimately incompatible with capitalism as an economic and political system, which was marked by inefficiency, instability and injustice.  Marx predicted that these flaws would inevitably lead to revolution followed by establishment of communist society. This final stage of human development would be one of material abundance and true freedom and equality for all.   According to Popper, though they disagreed on the mechanism that directed human social evolution, both Hegel and Marx, like Plato, were historicists because they believed that trans-historical laws governed human history.  This was the key point for Popper, as well as the key error and danger.   The deep methodological flaw of historicism, according to Popper, is that historicists wrongly see the goal of social science as historical forecast—to predict the general course of history. But such prediction is not possible, Popper said. He provided two arguments that he said demonstrated its impossibility. The first was a succinct logical argument: Human knowledge grows and changes overtime, and knowledge in turn affects social events. (That knowledge might be, for example, a scientific theory, a social theory, or an ethical or religious idea.) We cannot predict what we will know in the future (otherwise we would already know it), therefore we cannot predict the future.  As long as it is granted that knowledge affects social behavior and that knowledge changes overtime—two premises that Popper considered incontestable—then the view that we can predict the future cannot be true and historicism must be rejected. This argument, it should be noted, also reflected Popper’s judgment that the universe is nondeterministic: that is, he believed that prior conditions and the laws of nature do not completely causally determine the future, including human ideas and actions. Our universe is an “open” universe, he said.   Popper’s second argument against the possibility of historical forecasting focused on the role of laws in social explanations. According to Popper, historicists wrongly believe that genuine social science must be a kind of “theoretical history” in which the aim is to uncover laws of historical development that explain and predict the course of history (Poverty of Historicism, 39). But Popper contended that this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of scientific laws. In fact, Popper argued, there is no such thing as a law of historical development. That is, there are no trans-historical laws that determine the transition from one historical period to the next.  Failure to understand why this is so represented a deep philosophical error. There may be sociological laws that govern human behavior within particular social systems or institutions, Popper said. For instance, the laws of supply and demand are kinds of social laws governing market economies. But the future course of history cannot be predicted and, in particular, laws that govern the general trajectory of history do not exist. Popper does not deny that there can be historical trends—a tendency towards greater freedom and equality, more wealth or better technology, for instance, but unlike genuine laws, trends are always dependent upon conditions. Change the conditions and the trends may alter or disappear. A trend towards greater freedom or knowledge could be disrupted by, say, the outbreak of a pandemic disease or the emergence of a new technology that facilitates authoritarian regimes. Popper acknowledges that in certain cases natural scientists can predict the future—even the distance future—with some confidence, as is the case with astronomy, for instance. But this type of successful long-range forecasting can occur only in physical systems that are “well-isolated, stationary and recurrent,” such as the solar system (Conjectures and Refutations, 339). Social systems can never be isolated and stationary, however.	1642735492.0	htjucs4	t3_s8nnvk	t3_s8nnvk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htjucs4/
8rsxo	To OP's question, it may be worth at least discussing America's naval/military readiness in 1940/41. I mean, obviously the production capacity that carried the day should have been pretty apparent, especially as the US was already producing material for the other Allied powers. But everything I've read (Toll and Atkinson specifically) leaves me with the sense that our armed forces were far from considered world powers at the time. Not to mention, there was a sentiment in the population towards isolation which the Japanese were banking on.  It was a wrong strategic decision, but to at least flesh it out - the logic was a decisive blow would cow the American public away from wanting to join the fray. And since the military would requirel time to build-up, I think Japan figured they could quickly grab the territory they needed (which to a large extent they did) and take the US's surrender forced by an impatient and fearful public before the production gap played a factor.   Again, I agree that it was obviously the wrong call, but for the sake of OP it's worth noting the context of America's global position at the time. We were not the military (and cultural) world leader that we became post WWII. Not to mention the level of militarism and dysfunction within Japan's leading strategists, allowing more fanciful world views to be entertained for planning.	1642733887.0	htjqqjz	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjho80	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjqqjz/

Then craftsmen like blacksmiths, tailorers, construction builders come and cater to these towns, living off the wealth that these natural resources give, then natural resources run out and craftsmen turn to manufactoring to make products in exchange for the natural resources they buy like food and lumber. Population expands and follows the resources and diminish when resources run dry. That's why so many boom towns across america are husk of their former glory because China supplied the natural resources like coal and iron for cheap.	1642739288.0	htk2id7	t3_s8sd13	t3_s8sd13	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8sd13/is_there_any_wellestablished_reason_why_the/htk2id7/

Not all abortions performed were done with improvised tools -- some doctors performed them.  [This article by The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/consider-the-coat-hanger/261413/) includes a discussion of how someone with means could get a safer abortion (though only because the woman was able to afford the cost).  Women of poorer means had to use other methods [(Allure discusses some of them here](https://www.allure.com/story/history-diy-abortion-roe-wade-reproductive-rights)).

3hkhei4r	This is going to be a difficult question to answer, because the Marxian tradition is, by its nature, extremely political; so your stance on Marxian politics is obviously going to affect your opinion of the Marxian historical method. How do you feel about Marx and his many, many interpolators? Do you like any of his ideas? You may like some historians who have drawn on him theoretically. Do you think it’s all a load of bull? You’re probably not going to like those historians.  Another wrinkle: there are as many different types of historical materialism as there are Marxists to espouse it, and no-one beefs harder than two Marxists disputing the dialectic. A classic example of this is between two (extremely esteemed, highly distinguished and decorated) historians who both called themselves Marxists, Perry Anderson vs E.P. Thompson. For Anderson, historical materialism is about interpreting and ordering the struggle between different social classes and interpreting economic, political and social data inside of that framework (eg lineages of the absolutist state). for E.P. Thompson, historical materialism is more about detailing the lifeways and social practices through which people make and remake class societies (e.g. the making for the English working class). Both of these historians are or were Marxists, yet they argued terribly over the meaning of their shared tradition. Are they of relevance? a hell of a lot of people seem to think so (Anderson is still a distinguished faculty at UCLA and Thompson is widely revered despite his passing). But again, if you scoff at the idea that class struggle plays a formative role in human history, you probably won’t like either of them.   So, with all that being said: what is Marxian historical materialism? To quote Marx (lol):  “[H]ere we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life. In the first method of approach the starting-point is consciousness taken as the living individual; in the second method, which conforms to real life, it is the real living individuals themselves, and consciousness is considered solely as their consciousness.”  So basically, he’s saying: let’s not start from pre-conceived notions of what the right categories and subjects of history are, but instead observe and appreciate our world as it is first and build our histories off of that. I, personally, think that is still an admirable and potent guideline for a so-inclined historian to follow.	1642741972.0	htk7s2c	t3_s8nnvk	t3_s8nnvk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htk7s2c/

Golden was the original center of power, but the Union Pacific went to Denver (via Omaha, not KC), and rail was the way to get the mine exports out. The Burlington Road came via KC much later.  Denver is also just south of a giant coal field (covering most of what is now Boulder and Broomfield) which helped drive the local industry a lot before WWII.	1642745305.0	htkdsgj	t3_s8sd13	t3_s8sd13	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8sd13/is_there_any_wellestablished_reason_why_the/htkdsgj/

3ayla62b	I may be wrong but from my understanding, Lenin during the end of his time realised that Trotsky would be a better leader. I think he wrote letters voicing this opinion as well, which Stalin intercepted and it is believed to be destroyed. Stalin was the link at the time connecting Lenin and the Party Leadership, using his power in the Party he had installed people he preferred in high places of the government.   Later on after the death of Lenin, Stalin consolidates power and he is paranoid about his enemies will plot against him, to overthrown him and he must have believed that Lenin preferring Trotsky would give him some claim over Stalin to be the leader. So, as long as Trotsky was alive his adversaries could use this to get rid of Stalin and still legitimize the coup.	1642764226.0	htl3fyp	t3_s8xv1f	t3_s8xv1f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8xv1f/why_was_stalin_so_obsessed_with_assassinating/htl3fyp/

This is one of the reasons why the Japanese invaded the region.  Their expansionist actions however put quite a few nations against them. The USA joining the war against the Japanese became more and more likely. The Japanese, quite concerned with the looming threat the USA was becoming searched for options to deal with this.  They concluded that a preventing the USA to interfere in the war was not possible. So with the assumption that the USA would fight them, they searched for a way to make the USA a smaller threat.  Their solution: Disable (or even better destroy) the US Pacific fleet so they have no weapons with which they could fight the Japanese. This fleet was stationed at Pearl Harbor, which is why they attacked it.  Now, their attack didn't do what they wanted. The US fleet wasn't all present, so a portion of the fleet was completely undamaged, but the part of the fleet that was present wasn't as damaged as the Japanese had hoped.	1642771168.0	htlesmy	t3_s8yukr	t3_s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/htlesmy/
itaexggd	Yes, and yes.   According to Library of Congress [1],  > These are specimens of the earliest known movable type. The first font was cast in the 1230s, some two hundred years before Gutenberg "invented" movable type in Europe.   I ventured no further than the Wikipedia page on movable type [2] to find this source. The fact that Gutenberg was not the first inverter of movable type may be somewhat surprising to a Western layperson. To a Korean, this conclusion is absolutely unremarkable, since the invention of metal movable type is included in the national history curriculum.   See: [In school I was told Gutenberg invented printing, my Chinese friend tells me china already had invented it before](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7v72u6/in_school_i_was_told_gutenberg_invented_printing/), [I read that the Mongols were mass producing texts in the 13th century using a moveable block type printing method.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rcacjf/i_read_that_the_mongols_were_mass_producing_texts/). This topic has been trodden before on this subreddit.   The Wikipedia sources that you link [3] are more amusing to me. Tracking down the source from Federation of Busan and Science and Technology gives us a better picture of why the page disappeared from the internet, only accessible through a Wayback Machine archive. The series of articles was written by Sohn Dongwook, a professor of science policy at the Pukyong National University and a previous standing director of the FoBST. The series, titled "Jang Yeong-sil, Busan's Scientist", were compiled into a 2007 book [4] with the same title. It's subtitle? "To Give a View of Science to Children." That's right, Wikipedia quoted a children's science education book. It is no ordinary children's science book either. A glance at the book's descriptions reveals that "its purpose is to rouse teenagers' pride in the [Busan] region and interest science." The other source is easier to track down. Woongjin Wi-in Jeon-gi is the biography (jeon-gi) of great men (wi-in) from the Woongjin publisher - a children's book series.   I bring this up to point out how difficult it is to escape nationalism when researching Korean history from Korean sources. The first source has an overtone of regional pride. The second source's, and many others', use of the term "great men" is criticized for its tendency to glorify historical figures, often under a nationalistic lens. The primary school textbook of social studies, for instance, an unfounded claim that Jang Yeong-sil used a waterwheel to defeat drought. To quote a Seoul National University professor, "there is no evidence that water wheels were successfully used to combat drought in Korea." [5]   The Encyclopedia of Korean Culture is a more reliable source for Korean studies than the aforementioned children's books. Yet, as I explained, it is difficult to escape nationalistic bias. This is especially the case since many Koreans take pride in the fact that movable type press was first invented in Korea. See the following passage from EoKC's entry on Goryeo metal press:   > Although the technology [of Goryeo metal press] is less precise, [the Gutenberg press] was invented 200 years later than Goryeo's. Considering how early Goryeo metal press was invented, and how diverse the press types were through continuous improvements, we were undoubtedly at an unrivaled position, and that is our number one pride as a culture and ethnicity. [6]  The EoKC, which has the benefit of being a secondary rather than a tertiary source, confirms earlier conclusions.   > The *Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun* published by Choe Yun-ui during Gojong's rule (1234), is the earliest book known to have been printed by the metal press, yet it is lost today. [7]  > The Gabinja was a metal press developed in 1434 by royal decree as the letters of the Gyeongjaja made in 1420 was too thin. [8]  Why, then, did movable type press not become widespread in Korea? The reddit threads I linked above explain the linguistic reasons why. (In short, Chinese written language is too complex, and Korea would not have an alphabet until a decade before Gutenberg.) Korean sources further elucidate why. Due to the small demand for books in Korea at the time, metal press was utilized to print a wide variety of books, each with a small number of copies. Mass printing was achieved through wooden press instead. [9]  [1] World Treasures: Beginnings. The Library of Congress.

2rzmr8ac	Yes.  Recently several times.  I'm sure many times in the medieval period.    Ruler of Dubai's daughter was missing for a few years.  Princess Latifa al Maktoum.  She re-surfaced again last year.   In August, Princess Shamsa (again, Dubai) was kidnapped off the street in Cambridge and taken back to Dubai.    In 1974, there was a kidnapping attempt of Princess Anne in England off the streets in London.    In the 1100s, Eleanor of Aquitaine was a very desirable wife because she was rich and had lots of lands. She was abducted two or three times (depending on how you count them) in attempts to force her into a marriage (so the kidnapper could take control of her lands).  After her first marriage (to the King of France) fell apart, she became very close to her Uncle Raymond (ruler of Antioch), there was talk of "excessive affection," and she consented to his abduction of her but that never happened.  A few weeks after her first marriage was annulled, she was traveling with her entourage.  Two different lords (Theobald (a French count) and Geoffrey Plantagenet (aka Geoffrey of Anjou),  (the brother of Henry II, Duke of Normandy) each tried to separately kidnap and marry her to take her land.  In a defensive move, she sent her messengers to Henry (future king of England), to ask him to marry her.  He did, and they got married about 8 weeks after her first wedding was annulled.  This also prevented anyone else from kidnapping her.  She thus became Queen of England.  I think they were third-cousins.  She was thus both the Queen of France and then later the Queen of England.	1642777342.0	htlspcp	t3_s98aq7	t3_s98aq7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98aq7/has_any_real_life_historical_princess_ever/htlspcp/

4d7o8msd	In a word, no. In one sense it wouldn't be hard for any medieval person to design a house, as at most levels of society houses were very formuliac and heirarchical. They were based around an open hall, often served by a buttery and pantry at the low (or service end) and a private parlour accessed from the high end. Above either of the rooms at either end you may also have had chambers (bedrooms).   Whilst every medieval person would have been familiar with the layout of a medieval house and where they fitted into it, houses were built by skilled craftsmen. For example there are countless examples of surviving medieaval houses in the Weald of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. These are mostly timber-framed and were built by skilled carpenters. Some of them have been dismantled and re-erected at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum.   If you're interested in learning more there is a huge amount of literature on the subject, but it's a very diverse topic as medieval architecture differs a lot by region. RW Brunskill's *Vernacular Architecture* is a good starting point.  *The House Within: Interpreting Medieval Houses in Kent* by the RCHME demonstrates just how sophisticated medieval carpentry was and how localised different building traditions were.  Huge caveat: As with most social history, the lower down the social ladder you go, the less evidence you have, particularly the further back in time you go. For various reasons there are plenty of surviving houses from well-off peasants upwards, but truly humble houses rarely survive above ground. There are a few examples of small low-status houses (such as lady row in York) but these were still built by carpenters.	1642779121.0	htlxa72	t3_s94i4k	t3_s94i4k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s94i4k/would_i_be_expected_to_know_how_to_build_my_own/htlxa72/
i2kk6jsw	King Song Myong of Paekche, a kingdom in the Korean Peninsula, officially introduced Buddhism in Japan. Sometime between 538-552 AD (sources are differing about the timeline), he sent some sutras and monks along with a Buddha image.   According to _Nihon Shoki_, Soga no Umako (belonging to the influential Soga family) who was presented with the aforementioned image,  after building a temple to house this image, he commissioned a former priest to train three women as nuns. These nuns went to Paekche to study more about Buddhism, returning to Japan in 590AD. And _Nihon Shoki_ states this exchange as the beginning of Buddhism in Japan.   After its official introduction, Prince Shōtoku, nephew of Empress Suiko, the first empress in Japan and also a Buddhist, promoted Buddhism. He played an important role in establishing Buddhism in Japan, erecting two temples, one in Nara and one in Osaka, that are still standing tall today.   A little shy of a century later, Emperor Shōmu's government encouraged people to convert,  they built more temples and preached Buddhism.   There are no records of any Hindu missionaries in Japan. It is said that the renditions of Hindu culture that we see in Japan spread through slow immigration or through  travellers visiting India or other parts of Asia(where Hinduism spread) who took elements of this culture back home, which is how Japan has so many Indian deities and you'll find a harmonious blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. However, there was never any active preaching and converting involved.

42bmximc	Galla Placidia, Emperor Honorius' sister, was captured by Alaric, king of the group of Goths who would be later known to history as the Visigoths, during his 410 sack of Rome. She later married Athaulf, Alaric's brother and successor.  Ater the 455 sack of Rome by the Vandals, Valentinian III's widow (Licinia Eudoxia) and two daughters (Eudocia and Placidia) were captured by Vandal King, Ganseric. However, I don't think we could really call this a kidnapping, since the widowed Empress had actually asked for Vandal help. Her late husband had been murdered by the usurper Petronius Maximus, who (forcefully) married the widow and married Eudocia, who by then was betrothed to Ganseric's son (Huneric), to his own son. After the imperial family was brought to Vandal Carthage, Eudocia was married to Huneric, as originally intended.	1642783106.0	htm7th9	t3_s98aq7	t3_s98aq7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98aq7/has_any_real_life_historical_princess_ever/htm7th9/
1oxwnd9	Most of the previous answers are excellent analyses of the balance of power in the Pacific before Pearl Harbor, but the question assumes that pre-war Japan had a rational government making decisions based on their own resources, and deep research into the probable American response to war – much less a surprise attack.        It didn’t.          Modern Japan was a very young nation.  Japan signed the Convention of Kanagawa with the United States 1854, but the ruling class did not generally accept the necessity of Westernization until the Meiji Restoration of 1868, and the constitution only dated from 1890.  So, Imperial Japan was new nation, with an imported form of government, and exactly how the mechanics of government were supposed to work were often hotly debated right up until 1945.         Worse, the goals of the government were also contested.  The Meiji Restoration and a move to Westernization only occurred after conservative Japanese military leaders realized they could not militarily match the United States and the nations of Europe.  So, nearly all of the nation's ruling elites accepted the necessity of adopting Western technology, management, and military organization, but there was never agreement about how much Japan needed Western culture.      Many Japanese, particularly from ranks of engineers and businessmen, exulted in these cultural changes after 1868.  The older elites, who largely still ran the government, were not as entranced.  Some went along with energetically, but others – particularly military and naval officers - did not see the need to fundamentally change Japanese culture to compete with the West.  They wanted Maxim guns and Whitehead torpedoes not top hats and Ferris wheels.          Yes, Japan had the veneer of parliamentary democracy, but policy actually developed out of ferocious give and take among a variety of stakeholders.  Usually, this is portrayed as the Army versus the Navy with the occasional interference of the state bureaucracy, especially the Foreign Ministry, and the industrialists.          That doesn’t do the complexity of the process justice, because there were numerous cliques within each of these power centers.  Each clique had a variety of tools to accomplish its political goals, and gradually violence and the threat of violence became a the most powerful tool in the decision-making process.        There were numerous assassinations during the decade before Pearl Harbor by radical Army and Navy officers.  These assassinations strengthened the power of the “mainstream” military, but there were several coup attempts, most notably in 1932 and 1936, that left the government weak and unable to develop policy or rein in the radicals.         The Sino-Japanese War is the best example of just how weak the official government was.  In 1931 two Japanese colonels of the Kwantung Army based in Korea and guarding the Japanese controlled South Manchurian Railroad staged false flag attacks that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria.          No one in Tokyo, including the generals and admirals who might have agreed with the ultimate goals of the actions, were in control of these operations. Japanese national strategy was set by colonels and lieutenant colonels with muddy boots.   The government had to decide whether to back the troops in the field or risk a civil war at home.  The government in Tokyo prevented a broader war for the conquest of all China for six years, but in 1937 similar operations by Kwantung Army at the Marco Polo Bridge north of Beijing succeeded in pulling Japan into that broader war.        But the weakness of the central government prevented Japan from developing a coherent strategy, because the Navy had never signed on to the war in China and constantly fought against a reduction of resources from the major naval units needed to fight the United States or Great Britain.  The US economic embargo forced the Navy into looking for a way out of the morass of China.          The Navy’s solution was to grab the oil rich Dutch East Indies, and as part of that they believed they had to attack the United States.  The primary driver of this plan was Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku.         Yamamoto thought he really understood Americans.  He had studied English at Harvard from 1919-1921and then spent 1926-1928 as a naval attaché in Washington. He believed that if he could win a series of overwhelming victories in the first six months of the war that the United State would sue for peace rather than fight a long, bloody war to conquer Japan. He was so adamant that the Army accept his plan that he threatened to resign if his plan was not accepted, and, like in 1931 and 1937, such a move would have risked a civil war.  In this instance, between the Army and Navy.          But like the OP, many Japanese officers and civilian officials thought the plan was “a comically bad decision.”  Not only did it ensure enraging the United States, it also brought on war with Great Britain, and opened new fronts in Burma, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, the Solomons, the Central Pacific, and the Northern Pacific which almost ensured strategic paralysis.          Even Yamamoto seems to have had his doubts.  He probably did not say that he had “awakened a sleeping giant,” but he was supposedly depressed the day after Pearl Harbor and thought Japan had a six month window in which to win the war.          So, it was a bizarre decision made by a government that was not really a government in the normal sense of the word.  The emperor was largely a figurehead, but a figurehead everyone tried to appease.  He did not plan Pearl Harbor, but he did give his approval.          Prime Minster Tojo was more involved, but the plan was not his either.  Even the Chief of the Navy General Staff did not create the plan.  Yamamoto was the Commander and Chief of the Combined Fleet, a much higher ranking officer than the young Army officers who pulled the nation into war in China, but the basic outline is similar.          A lower ranking officer in an active command was able to direct national strategy.  It was a disaster in China and a disaster at Peal Harbor.          For general readers I still like John Toland’s *The Rising Sun* for its general overview of Japanese government and life on the eve of war in its first few chapters.  Bix’s *Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan* is a great book and also goes into a lot of detail about the strange role of the emperor who had ultimate power, so long as he never used it.	1642782438.0	htm60uq	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htm60uq/

He was however in Munich when war broke out, and signed up to the German army. He lied on his application, and the checks were not very thorough (they wanted as many as possible to sign up, as you can imagine). He had even dodged national service in Austria in the month preceding, and was wanted by Austrian authorities for doing so, but he soon disappeared amid the millions of others on western front.	1642783503.0	htm8wja	t3_s9esjh	t3_s9esjh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9esjh/why_and_how_did_hitler_fight_for_germany_in_ww1/htm8wja/

4d7o8msd	I can't speak for all peoples and cultures, but up until around 1550 in England people heated their homes and cooked on an open hearth in a hall. This would be mitigated by the fact that the halls themselves were double height and open to the roof allowing the smoke to rise away from people. Houses were extrememly well ventilated by today's standards.  It can be very hard to put yourself in the position of someone from another historical period. Most people in medieval England, rich or poor, had one heated room in their house (the hall) and no glazing to the windows. Most of us would find it impossible to spend a winter living like this but this is all they knew. Smoke inhalation would be the least of your problems if you could die the next week from the plague,  famine, or an infected papercut.	1642784731.0	htmc9bz	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htjci3x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htmc9bz/

7s4rt2oe	Hitler had been living in Munich which was in the Bavarian providence of the German Empire. He had moved there in 1913 and made money painting architectual scenes. Some claim he was doing so to evade conscription in the Hapsburg army, further backed up by Hitler later claiming he did not want to serve the Austro-Hungarians due to their "mixed race" army as the empire was made up approximately 12 different ethnic groups.    He was sent back to Austria to join the army by the Bavarian police but had failed his exam for it in February on 1914 and returned to Munich. When the war broke out in late July 1914, Hitler requested permission to join the Bavarian army which was granted. German states could have their own armies as the Empire was technically a federation of states under Prussia. Author Ian Kershaw in his biography of Hitler states that Hitler was basically let in to serve by accident by the government. He states that Hitler should have been deported and that the matter of Hitlers citizenship was simply not raised when he joined.	1642790556.0	htms6gx	t3_s9esjh	t3_s9esjh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9esjh/why_and_how_did_hitler_fight_for_germany_in_ww1/htms6gx/

[http://japanwatching.com/environment/78-dont-cry-for-me-kyoto](http://japanwatching.com/environment/78-dont-cry-for-me-kyoto)  In John Dower's classic, *War Without Mercy*, the Japanese were very quickly turned into "harmless children" (infamous quote of General MacArthur to that effect) under US occupation (shown via cartoons and other depictions), and I was struck by persistence of that stereotype (esp. in enchantment with electronics and gadgets) when I once was browsing through *Life* Magazine's special on 1964 Tokyo Olympics:  >During the war Westerners were told of the "child mind of the Jap conscript." After the war, the same newspapers and magazines spoke of "Seventy Million Problem Children"; and cartoonists had a field day depicting the Japanese as infants in the crib or, more often, children attending General MacArthur's School of Democracy. Such paternalism was unquestionably the essence of MacArthur's attitude toward the Japanese- and Oriental people in general. His guiding philosophy during the occupation, he stated widely in publicized Senate hearings in 1951, after President Truman had recalled him from Asia, had been to treat the Japanese as twelve-year-olds. This was not an incautious remark, for the former supreme commander went on to expound his position at some length, explaining in the process why he believed the Japanese might be more receptive to American-style democratic ideas than the "mature" Germans. "The German problem is a completely and entirely different one from the Japanese problem," MacArthur informed the senators. "The German people were a mature race. If the Anglo-Saxon was say 45 years of age in his development, in the sciences, the arts, divinity, culture, the Germans were quite as mature. The Japanese, however, in spite of their their antiquity measured by time, were in a very tuitionary condition. Measured by the standards of modern civilization, they would be like a boy of 12 as compared with our development of 45 years. Like any tuitionary period, they were susceptible to following new models, new ideas. You can implant basic concepts there. They were still close enough to origin to be elastic and acceptable to new concepts..."  [https://www.amazon.com/War-without-Mercy-PACIFIC-WAR-ebook/dp/B007GZKQCY](https://www.amazon.com/War-without-Mercy-PACIFIC-WAR-ebook/dp/B007GZKQCY)  [https://theolympians.co/tag/life-magazine](https://theolympians.co/tag/life-magazine)  Sean Connery was also in news in a way movie publicity departments would not have preferred concerning 'You Only Live Twice':  >After the movie was shot, Sean Connery was asked by Japanese reporters whether he found Japanese women sexy. His answer "No" was not very popular in Japan, and the Japanese started giving him bad names.

er5he3v	It's pretty interesting the dictator Chiang-Kai-Shek who lost the entirety of China to the communists hired several dozen Japanese Officers as he looted as much he could from China and ran to Taiwan for refuge.  Even after escaping from this disaster Mao and his communist forces tried to Take the country of Taiwan several times.  It was the Japanese officers with the wartime experience who helped Chiang win several victories against the communists that assured their safety.  That and the timely intervention of the US 7th Fleet sailing in between the Taiwan straits deterred the Chinese communists.	1642795171.0	htn4oz1	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmmyiu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htn4oz1/

fsldsue9	There were Japanese that actually fought on the communist side of the Chinese civil war, mostly technical staff that is harder to source like doctors and pilots, even factory management and other middle level staff, since Japan ruled the Northeast part of China, directly or indirectly for almost 40 years by then. You have Japanese that were resident in those areas and have deep roots while being fluent in Chinese. The Chinese communists were the faction to move in after the Soviets and absorbed a lot of those personnel. Part of the ease of absorbing such staff was that Chinese communists still believed in world revolution and being a "nationless" proletariat worker's party, so they did do some "ideological remolding" in relation to Japanese soldiers and personnel that fell in their liberation zone after World War 2.   This is probably a useful Wikipedia page(in Chinese) to follow up with the sourcing, but most sources on the left behinds Japanese in China are either in Chinese or Japanese. And this is a sensitive enough subject that even those sources are quite scarce with a need to draw on grey/unofficial literature.  https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/日籍解放军  It cites 30 thousand Japanese served in the People's Liberation Army, according to an article in the People's Daily, so not so insignificant an amount, more than your number here of a couple thousand.  I won't be surprised to learn the Vie Cong did the same considering their ideological affinity of copying the Chinese communists in tactics and methods.	1642798633.0	htne9wx	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmmyiu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htne9wx/
bpmso	> And it was not much more difficult to shift public opinion in favor of Japan than it was to shift public opinion against them during the war. There was now a great enemy threatening the US, and the Japanese were among the first and best defensive lines against them.   I think 'defensive' is the key word. My understanding is that they were traditionally restricted to defensive types of armaments, Anti-air rather than strike aircraft, as an example.	1642798939.0	htnf4xg	t3_s99rlz	t1_htlxcfe	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnf4xg/

rz3dl	I don't know if it reflects British attitudes towards Japan, but in Ian Fleming's novel that the movie was based on, Fleming was more wary of Japan, its culture, and its long term ambitions.  For example, here is Bond speaking to Tiger Tanaka, the head of the Japanese secret intelligence service:  *Bond said angrily, 'Balls to you, Tiger! And balls again! Just because you're a pack of  militant potential murderers here, longing to get rid of your American masters and play at being samurai again, snarling behind your subservient smiles, you only judge people by your own jungle standards...'*	1642799580.0	htngxo7	t3_s99rlz	t1_htlxcfe	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htngxo7/
azdqv	Additionally, I've also heard the Japanese interest in Pro Wrestling came about during the occupation. The time frame of rising popularity roughly coincides with the occupation, as Rikidozan and American wrestler Lou Thesz had a series of matches with then unprecedented popularity, propelling Rikidozan to one of the biggest celebrities in Japan and by far the most popular wrestler. (Think Hulk Hogan in the 80s or Stone Cold Steve Austin in the late 90s in terms of popularity, and even that may be understating Rikidozan's popularity. People were buying TVs solely to watch his matches.)  Anyway, the point is, I don't know if the part about it being the result of the US occupation is true. (A lot of people credit Thesz for that, but again, wrestling existed prior to Thesz' first tour of Japan and was gaining popularity. Rikidozan and Thesz just shot it into the stratosphere.)	1642799921.0	htnhvfu	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmgbg5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnhvfu/
df5r825j	A point of clarification: The United Kingdom's *An Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade* (link to a copy of the Act [here](https://archives.parliament.uk/collections/getrecord/GB61_HL_PO_PU_1_1807_47G3s1n60)) was enacted in 1807 and outlawed the African slave trade- not slavery in the British Empire.  The U.S. passed the *Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves* in the same year (full text of that Act [here](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sl004.asp)), but the U.S. did not participate as heavily in the policing efforts put into effect to try to stop the African slave trade.

4y0la	As far as I understand the SS didn’t need a reason to go into a house and they wouldn’t need a warrant. Standartenfuhrur is the same rank as Colonel, so no higher up approval is needed. As far as I know there was no such thing as an illegal search when it came to the Nazi's.   I don’t think they’d be afraid of reprisals from local French farms, most of them were starving and understood if they did attack there would most likely be reprisals. At this time France was either occupied or part of Vichy ; so SS officers would have a free reign over French citizens.    The SS would kill the Jews with in front of the locals if they felt it necessary to ‘teach’ the locals a lesson and make them fear hiding Jews on their property. That goes for the farmers/citizens who hid the Jews as well.    As far as newspapers goes, the local ones most likely would have been German controlled, so unless he had access to illegal newspapers… also as far as I know even the international newspapers didn’t report on the Jews being detained once the war started.   M. LaPadite would have been either killed on the spot or detained and questioned about others in his network hiding Jews. It was absolutely a crime, and he would have been either judged on the spot or at some sham trial. As I mentioned before the government was either a German one or a French/German (vVichy) one; it wouldn’t have mattered, either way he was in for torture or death or both.	1642801343.0	htnlu42	t3_s9fyue	t3_s9fyue	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fyue/inglourious_basterds_first_chapter_french_farmer/htnlu42/

qyjgc	A hut, hovel or otherwise semi-temporary dwelling (or work building, like byre, outhouse or other enclosure) would be well within medieval farmers capabilities, related as it is to hedging and dry stone walling (the latter is useful for building cottages). Wattle and daub is a simple and easy European and African building method. It can be made more substantial with timber framing, lime washing and flooring (pounded earth, mixed with water, ox blood or sour milk for a concrete like effect).  To the crux of the matter. Many, if not all, medieval villages are where they are for obvious reasons. Proximity to water, lumber and clay are the triad. Then, so often, they occupy a strategic position. We surmise from this that many villages are surviving work camps of lost or abandoned chateau or manor castles. A mobile community of technicians employed by these proto castles would be we call architects, and also another mobile workforce of masons and charpentiers, tule makers and potters also present. Then, why is your city there? There is a reason. And that reason will have people infrastructure (monastery abbot). Do you have money? Then borrow it.

29l5u844	The minute, as a measurement of time, didn’t exist.     During the Middle Ages, people used a combination of water clocks, sun dials, and candle clocks to tell time though none of those could tell time to the minute.  While the best water clocks told time to the quarter hour, it wasn’t until the wide use and improvement of mechanical clocks that people could tell time to the minute.        Even though the minute hand may have existed as early as the late 15th century, Jost Burgieven is credited with inventing it in 1577.  Still, it took over a century for the technology to spread as the minute hand wasn’t widely added to clocks until the 1680s.  &#x200B;  source:https://andreacefalo.com/2014/01/29/telling-time-in-the-middle-ages-5-things-you-didnt-know/	1642804201.0	htntl1j	t3_s9a5j3	t3_s9a5j3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9a5j3/would_someone_in_14th_century_france_know_if_2030/htntl1j/

g2ysgndq	I did a course on holocaust studies, and my answer is that the entire LaPadite family would be sent to the extermination camps with the Jewish family. However, in the film for cinematic purposes the family was shot, which is historically innacurate (to service a more cinematic tone and set up Landa's evil). By that time the Einsatzgruppen, Nazi death squads had stopped being used in service of more efficient methods of extermination, such as gas vans and gas chambers. LaPadote in the film was left alive under  Landa's choice just out of his own volition, I believe to psychologically torture the family patriarch for helping kill the family in the end.   As you can see Tarantino too many liberties to make the film better and Landa more evil.	1642806859.0	hto0k98	t3_s9fyue	t3_s9fyue	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fyue/inglourious_basterds_first_chapter_french_farmer/hto0k98/

a107fowh	from: u/EnclavedMicrostate    On top of this, modern East Asian martial arts owe a lot to Japan, in that Japanese martial arts in the early 20th century were perhaps the most formalised and professionalised, thereby setting expectations for martial arts in the rest of Asia, and also in that martial arts became a way for East Asian countries to assert a sense of identity in response to the Japanese ascendancy in the region. Before the term Wushu    (literally 'martial arts') was established as the standard by the Communist PRC, the Nationalist ROC referred to Chinese martial arts as  Guoshu, literally 'national arts' (or 'the national art'). As an aside, a comparable dynamic can be seen with Taekwondo, which, despite its internal narrative of being an ancient Korean art, is functionally a branch of Shōtōkan karate which was given a Korean nationalist rebranding after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, and used as part of the two new Korean states' attempts at nation-building in the post-colonial period.  ...."   This is an almost unknown fact. The Nationalist government officials, many of who had studied in Japan, consciously copied the Japanese use of martial arts training to stoke nationalist fervor and build strong bodies of use to the state, as they did many other aspects of the developmental Japanese state and society.   The role of Japanese martial arts in nation building and physical education was so well known in China that Mao's very first published work, a letter to a local newspaper when he was still a teacher, called out the programs of the founder of modern martial arts, Kanô Jigorô, as an example of successful physical education as a national program and necessity as an education tool.  (And as an aside, Mao staked out a position on the hundreds of years old argument regarding the influence of Chinese martial arts on Japanese *jûjutsu* through the person of one Chin Genping, 陳元贇, a 17th century Chinese immigrant to Japan. You can imagine Mao's position....)    [https://martialhistoryteam.blogspot.com/2020/05/annotating-wayne-muromotos-legacy-of.html](https://martialhistoryteam.blogspot.com/2020/05/annotating-wayne-muromotos-legacy-of.html)      The CCP destroyed the Nationalist *Guoshu* training school and banned the practice of it and use of the term, but replaced it with *Wushu* for the same purposes.   We'll disclose a number of the original players later in The Kanô Chronicles®, including Kanô Jigorô's role in educating many of the Nationalist and CCP leaders in the early 20th century.    [www.kanochronicles.com](https://www.kanochronicles.com)   From: u/XenophonTheAthenian   "Another thing that happens is that many techniques in East Asian martial arts are very old (or claim to be--in reality quite a lot of traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean martial arts is no older than the 1930s), or because of the rapid evolution in fighting styles and warfare the circumstances under which they were developed quickly become irrelevant and the original purpose of the technique or feature of the style becomes obscure. One of my go-to examples is the **tassels traditionally found on spears or swords** in many Chinese styles. Western students often find these things very funny, and it's hard to explain why they're there, practically. The usual explanation, that they serve to distract the enemy, is obvious nonsense. These tassels are, of course, insignia or just plain decorations in origin, but that isn't especially important. What is important is that techniques, often quite effective, have developed around the interpretation that they're there for distraction, long after the practical purpose of the feature has been rendered irrelevant. In that sense, the myth becomes more important than the reality....."  I searched Reddit for the answer and was surprised I couldn't find it, even though there is a very long post on exactly that topic.   As a cadet at the US Military Academy, one of my military history professors answered that question very simply: the tassels serve the necessary function of limiting the stroke of a spear or lance into an enemy's body. With some sort of stopper, you might overpenetrate a body or limb, and then be stuck with your primary weapon useless in the middle of battle, stuck in some guy while his buds bash in your brains. 12-18 inches is enough from most any angle to strike vital organs.   The ornamentation of the plain, functional tassels came later for decorative or unit identification purposes.   u/marc-trudel	1642807294.0	hto1ogh	t3_s8ddl3	t3_s8ddl3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/hto1ogh/

f2whqo6j	First things first you need to understand the depth of what de-nazification means. That topic alone fills volumes so here a tiny little crumb of an overview from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification)   “Denazification in Germany was attempted through a series of directives issued by the Allied Control Council, seated in Berlin, beginning in January 1946. "Denazification directives" identified specific people and groups and outlined judicial procedures and guidelines for handling them. Though all the occupying forces had agreed on the initiative, the methods used for denazification and the intensity with which they were applied differed between the occupation zones.”  As outlined right here Nazis meaning those who would be opposed to teaching German Atrocities were removed from power, at least that was the idea.  The big power players in an education system would absolutely be less of an issue, to remove, but once you get down to a local level like a gym teacher that’s where people become hidden in the masses. At the same time your local gym teacher doesn’t have enough power to generate adequate pushback to be noteworthy. That isn’t to say one gym teacher couldn’t radicalise individual students but at least to my knowledge that never happened so it’s a mute point.  My grandmother (born 1951) tells a story of her German teacher who was a nazi during the ns time. Even after he remained a firm believer in the cause through and through. And he would always get worked up about the allies Atrocities like the bombing of Dresden and the bombing of langen and other hospital towns. Which I’m his eyes were an Atrocity to bomb once the German cities where he lived where bombed. Which true there is a point to be had and a discussion there but let’s not get side tracked.   He though wouldn’t outright deny the crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis. This can be due to several reasons but assuming he believed the crimes to be necessary or righteous in cause he wouldn’t admit to holding those beliefs publicly as he would have to face consequences[consequences (sorry only in German)](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/130.html) back then as much as now.[here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung) from Wikipedia the law while I shared the specific law it is also anchored in the german constitution as the first amendment that everyone is free to live from persecution.   So in short: not really I’ve never met anyone who knew anyone that provides adequate pushback beyond “well the allies did stuff too” on an individual level, in public, and no those put in power by the allies after the war didn’t cause any pushback either as their whole role was to be a force for denazification.	1642813221.0	htogbrs	t3_s9e4ue	t3_s9e4ue	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9e4ue/was_there_any_pushback_by_german_citizens_in/htogbrs/

56fvspbz	Not a historian myself but from what little i know project Manhattan had  no influence over Allies Axis war. As you know bombs were first used on Japan after Germany capitulated   How different would WWII end if Germans got bomb first? I doubt anything would change unless they would get it before 42 because after that they had no way of using it against their biggest enemy Soviets and while using it on England could force them to negotiating table but even then Germany would at most create one bomb due to their lack of meteriel and fact they couldn't just throw millions of marks into project that could not work at all (Unlike us that had both resources and money to waste thanks to them not being threatened by war at all). If England would be forced to pull out of war against Germany all i can see changing is Soviets loosing more man and whole of Germany ending up under their controll   Manhattan project saved 2mln ppl at least that's how many more would die according to plans of Invasion of mainland Japan. But I doubt Japan would keep on fighting after it saw Soviet monster devour Germany and as in our time Started rushing through Manchuria  Hirohito had too much to loose if Soviets captured Japan (Unlike allies communists had no reason to keep him alive once they captured the country)	1642814159.0	htoilyp	t3_s9olx6	t3_s9olx6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9olx6/did_new_mexico_play_a_crucial_role_in_the_outcome/htoilyp/

Beeswax candles are nearly the same as modern paraffin candles in the way that they burn. They burn faster most notably. As for the scent I've been disappointed in the complete lack of smell when burning beeswax more recently (not rona symptoms). The odor being described is no where near unpleasant in its strength or general bouquet.   I've seen an interesting chart showing the cost of lighting over time from oil lamps to LEDs.

7s4rt2oe	Like many places throughout Europe before the rise of Nationalism that followed the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon, countries were mostly formed of smaller regions loosely formed into a national identity. Before the revolution, France was separated into these regional identities. Most of these regions spoke languages that were based on the same family as French but had differences in accents, pronunciations, and even words.    These "langauges" would be things such as Picard, Burgundy, Alastian, Dauphiois, Bearnais, Bressan Champenois, Orléanais, ect. Totalling about 28 or so with some even sharing similar parts with German in regions bordering the German regions. The unification of the French under a common language started doing the revolution. Revolutionary Leaders such as Henri Grégoire reported that around 6 million Frenchmen didn't know the language and another 6 million or so could barely hold a conversation in it. Out of all the departments of France, only around sixth of them spoke French outside of Paris.   Part of Napoleon education policies in the Code Napoleon took steps to unify the population under one singular language as well. This happened through the outlawing of newspapers in regional dialects and the teaching of french in his new education system. This offers some irony as Napoleon famously had a hard grasp of the language himself and spoke with a thick accent due to his lineage and birth in Corsica, which language is closer to Italian. The need for unification under a language and common comprehension  was nessissary to properly rum an empire and military the size of Frances under Napoleon.    A good book that touches on the subject and is where some of my information comes from is Stuart Woolf's book Napoleon's Intergration of Europe.	1642819114.0	htoudna	t3_s9r5do	t3_s9r5do	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9r5do/what_languages_did_people_in_france_speak_before/htoudna/

Many museums have warehouses full of artifacts that researchers may have access to but the general public never see.

For example, you could donate to a/the holocaust museum or to organization(s) dedicated to combating fascism, anti-semitism or other forms of bigotry perpetrated by Nazis and their sympathizers.  I know this suggestion probably sounds facetious, but it's not.

4p4fi	I'm sure a museum would be interested in them.   One of the most interesting experiences I've ever had at a museum was in the Halifax war museum (in the old fort there). They have a WW2 room with lots of Nazi stuff. The thing in there that really caught my attention was a soccer jersey worn by a German player when the Nazi's were in power. My family was driven out of Europe by the Nazis, many of them died, I really don't like Nazi's. But seeing that Jersey made me consider all the average Germans, many of whom may have not been very political at all, who ended up as Nazi's by association. People who were just pursuing whatever (soccer, science, etc.) and happened to come of age at the time of Nazism would have become associted with it in a sense, regardless of whether they were really Nazi's or not. I had never really thought about it, but that soccer jersey made it feel very real for me.  Trivial stuff can give you a lot of insight into history I think. If you don't want it it should go to a museum.	1642821583.0	htp073y	t3_s9qsbu	t3_s9qsbu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qsbu/how_do_i_ethically_get_rid_of_inherited_nazi/htp073y/

e7k4p	No, Bond is absolutely stereotypical Russian drunk.  It's absolutely absurd how much he drinks.  And yes, Bond is technically a spy.  His double-0 number and license to kill mean that he is allowed to make the call on if people need to be killed in the course of his duties (it's not necessary to have to to be assigned an assassination mission, he got it after completing of them), but his actual missions are based around intelligence activities, primarily espionage and sabotage. His first book was "We need you to go beat this guy in a game of cards to beat the commies". Various enemies point out how completely useless it is to have agents 'licensed to kill' in an agency that very rarely uses assassination, as opposed to the Russians having an entire dedicated agency just for that purpose.  On the other hand, he does kill a lot of dudes for varying reasons.  He also has a military rank (technically a holdover from his time in the navy during the war) and can call on British, NATO, or other allied military assistance when necessary, as long as he's not pretending to not be in their country.	1642823377.0	htp4a3a	t3_s99rlz	t1_htp3220	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htp4a3a/

One of the issues with the foodstuffs provided during the Occupation was that most of the milk was reconstituted powdered milk, which the US military had in quantity and could be easily shipped and stored.   But tasted awful - so not only were Japanese kids being given lots of milk, which prewar was not part of the regular Japanese diet, and during the war probably unobtainable, it was pretty nasty to boot.   I had a Japanese friend that told me he was half convinced the Americans were trying to make all the kids sick, but their teachers would monitor the kids and tell them that American kids were doing without the milk they had given to Japan, so drink up!	1642825601.0	htp92le	t3_s99rlz	t1_htnvjx8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htp92le/

They were mostly Japanese troops who were already there, a fact exploited by the initially British-led mission that recruited them to the British, Indian and other forces they used to put down the communist rebellion.

e49gp06y	Well "Germania" never really turned into anything because there simply never was a "Germania". It's a common misconception based on the false assumption of the Romans that the Tribes in the region which they called that were a lot more united than they actually were. The fact is that they only simply shared some common aspects of culture (including mythology/religion) and language. And when some of them then united for the Battle of Teutoburg Forest to beat the Romans so severely the myth was already but made. And even while the Chieftains murdered Arminius because he wanted to be King of all Tribes it didn't really matter anymore at that point.    The only reason why the Holy Roman Empire became a thing was because Charlemagne just conquered most of that Region and "united" the Tribes whether they wanted uniting or not. The only ones to come close to taking over all the Territory that "Germania Magna '' included were the Huns and even they never held that for more than a few years. The area was just extremely hostile for anybody who didn't know it. Large Armies and especially Cavalry had a pretty rough time in a place with lots and lots of thick Forrests and swamps (Moore). And after the collapse of the Roman Empire there was also just very simply nobody stupid enough to try again what one of the biggest Empires the world had seen back then utterly failed to achieve. But the Franks were (for the most part) "Germanic" (as well as celtic) themselves and so they had a much better base on which to expand their own sphere of influence into the territories of the region. Which is exactly what they did. The contribution to that came in a multitude of factors like them not being seen as much of an Invader as the Romans were who were utterly foreign to that part of Europe but also the fact that they already knew what was waiting for them there. In addition to that as time went on the Tribal societies in the region saw a couple of developments (such as the huns) and a lot of what outside societies were already used to was carried inwards toward tribes that were further away from the former Borders of the Roman Empire. The Border Regions were already appeased for many decades beforehand. Even under the Romans. So take the area from the Limes Romanus northward and put in quite some extra miles for Tribes that were very much used to less tribalized and more centralized societies. So if the Roman Empire had stuck around for some more centuries they could've simply pushed their border ever so slightly more northwards because most people close to it wouldn't have really minded becoming part of the Roman Empire. Simply put: Enough time had passed between the Fall of the Roman Empire and Charlemagnes ambitions (or generally the Franks) for the area to be a lot less hard to conquer but, make no mistake, conquer this still was (for the most part).    And then came Christianity already (again whether people wanted to or not) and the ground was practically ripe for a much more centralized form of Governing i.e. Feudalism.    As you mentioned however Germany has a pretty neat location. Because once you get rid of the forests and start drying up some of those pesky swamps, you get some extremely fruitful farmland. And in societies that are majorly agrarian, that's pretty useful and will result in giving people a generally better chance of Survival. Just like starting to drink Milk gave some Humans a much better chance of survival and subsequent prosperity then others. Adding to that the area of Germany saw the development of the Feudalist system at a time when it was just on its rise. Took a good while longer for it to make it further east and so regions more to the east were (especially through the influence of the Huns and Mongols) much more dominated by Tribal societies still. Then there's the fact that East Francia generally had a lot more Stability under Louis the German compared to West Francia under Charles the Bald.    Additionally the region also prospered from Slaves (mostly from Slavic tribes still at the time) as well as being geographically located very nicely right in the center of Europe at a time when trade started to flourish. So most people who would trade over land would have to go through the area of Germany from which they very much profited. And once the Holy Roman empire was established, that became even better because most of the Trading routes (at least the ones over land) from Italy went straight through the HREOGN. That very much included lots and lots of Trade coming from China. And since tariffs were a thing at that time pretty much at every corner, the area profited heavily from the trade across the Silk Road.    The HRE is very often romanticized and not very much understood because, to begin with, as Voltaire put it, it was neither Holy, nor Roman, nor really an Empire. It was much more a Federation of countless smaller Kingdoms and States who simply came together once every decade (or years) to elect an Emperor and that's about it. Not that the Emperor was always electable but it's a pretty good indicator that the biggest power within the HRE were the Monarchs of the single countries within it. And they were very much so still seen as single Independent countries. Which is why the HRE existed for so very long. Because it was never really much of an Empire to begin with and because the independent Rulers were just "helping each other out" (sometimes more, sometimes less \*cough30yearswarcough\*). And that's essentially how it all held together. And also why it constantly changed in shape and form. Not just because new areas were conquered or otherwise gained because some countries just joined and left from time to time. After the 30 year war the HRE wasn't even an Empire on Paper anymore and we basically had the same state of being that was the case at the time of the Roman Empire. A crapload of small states that were now officially states but agreed that being Holy and Roman sounded too good and having the chance of becoming Emperor also sounded too good for anybody to just say "nay" to. Even if at that time the Habsburger had been the only Emperors for about 200 years (and promptly got back in again after just two other houses). The HRE already proved that it had massive problems defending itself against Armies from countries that are actually united and not a loose formation of Vassal Armies that are sometimes okay with helping and other times don't care to lift a finger at all. But it became utterly clear beyond a shadow of a doubt with Napoleon and Austerlitz. Not saying that Napoleon couldn't have beaten a united army as well because the Russians were there, too. But the "Army" of the Emperor practically was only that of Austria and not really that of the entire HRE. In fact Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden even sided with Napoleon to begin with.    Hate to break it to you but the HRE was very far from "OP".    But Napoleon gave the "Germans" an actual reason to become "Germans" in the first place whereas before they never really had been. If it wasn't for Napoleon, "Germany" would likely still be just a fractured Rug of countless small states. At the very least Napoleon just united a lot of them and shifted them around to create less of a geographical clusterfuck.    In modern history "why Germany strong?" is mostly explainable by: The Prussians wanted a "united" Germany under their rule by any means necessary, mostly driven by the ambitions of Bismarck and anti-french Sentiments. And after Napoleon there weren't many who opposed the idea to begin with. Because while the HRE barely even mattered in the end, many still saw the defeat as a shame. And others tried their best to pretend it never happened. Like the Bavarians, Württemberg and Baden who, as mentioned, were on Napoleon's side (at first).	1642836654.0	htpstlr	t3_s9qb4q	t3_s9qb4q	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qb4q/what_made_germany_so_op/htpstlr/
e49gp06y	As to Germany's resources? Well Germany doesn’t really have many. In fact Germany is a very poor country just in terms of natural resources. But it does have craploads of coal. Which is why one of the first real “Industries” in Germany started to emerge in the “Ruhr area” which today is in “Nordrhein Westfalen” where coal was mined for decades on. And since coal was one of the most important resources during the age of industrialization it’s fair to say that Germany had already started out well in that regard. Most of these Territories were under Prussian rule. No surprise there. The Prussians were pretty effective in utilizing the State as a tool to subsidize private industry in a variety of ways. So where the British for example created their own undoing with their laissez faire politics in Ireland during the potato blight, the Prussians had a lot less issues with that since they simply subsidized people directly and encouraged sowing more grain etc.     The Prussians also significantly modernized their agrarian sector. Not just with Bismarck's tariffs on imported grain to strengthen local agricultural Industry (because, again, Germany was still very agricultural) but also with introducing the sugar beet as a primary crop as well as the switch to fertilizers and new, industrially, made tools etc. And since the Prussians just stuck with what they knew best, Germany became THE agricultural Powerhouse in Europe where other Nations had a lot more issues keeping up because they either didn’t have as much flat, fruitful land or simply focused more on other Industry.    Another big part of Germany becoming as rich and powerful as it did was the Education. The Prussians were mostly Protestants and introduced a general compulsory primary education system already in the 18th century, being among the first countries to do so. In addition Prussia required teachers to be certified by the state and had specific requirements at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Which was pretty important since it guaranteed a much higher standard in education. Meaning that they already laid the groundwork for later generations to bring out highly skilled and well educated workers and intellectuals. So lots and lots of great engineers with a lot of great Ideas and inventions such as the Dreyse Rifle. Germany later on just became extremely good at exporting their newest inventions. Because they invested in education much earlier than others did. Smart that.    But another part (which is sadly often forgotten) is the organization of labour and especially the Welfare State. Granted that only came in by 1880 but it did have a significant impact and generally put Germany a lot better off during every financial crisis that would follow compared to other countries.    However it should be made clear that the German States were way behind other Nations at the time until 1850. It took them quite a while to catch up to the Standards that Belgium, England or France were setting. And most of it only came after the unification of those states into the German Empire. Because while the Zollverein at least kept them capable of keeping up somewhat more than without it, the separation and completely different standards in economy made for a big hurdle.         The German Empire itself mostly kept to what Bismarck was already doing and therefore Prussia beforehand since “Prussian Values” became the dominating ethic at the time. Wilhelm II cranked the Industry up quite a notch since he wanted to compete with other Nations in terms of Military strength but we all know how that ended. I guess the newly acquired “Colonies” helped in giving Germany a further push in terms of Economy. Especially with the newly upcoming car-industry and Germany not only having been one of the first Nations to even build them but also then having gotten their hands on a very convenient source for Rubber in the German New-Guinea.         Weimar was… there… in terms of economy and considering what they had to put up with I’d say it ran surprisingly smooth.        And the less said about the terrible crap that claimed to be an “economy” of the Nazis the better. Which has nothing to do with my political views. Just that the economy of the Nazis ran completely and utterly on credit. Evident in the MEFO Bills and solely gambled on making the necessary money to pay them back by simply attacking and then exploiting other countries and their resources and finances. And, of course, the financial means of a huge part of the population which were deemed undesirable. So, yes, Not a “OP” mode at all. Just more or less a constant war-economy financed by loan after loan after loan and little else.        In summary:    The big unity of Germany is mostly completely overrated and at worst an absolute myth. Many of the interpretations of that are misconceptions based on the misconceptions of other people (like in the case of Germania Magna). Or just stylized and romanticized ideas of Nationalists in the 18th and 19th century who tried to create these legends of the great “Germania” united under the great Arminius. But there’s nothing actually to that because, as I mentioned, the chieftains killed Arminius as soon as he wanted to become their King. And the HRE was just a massive clusterfuck and never an actual Empire to begin with which was constantly plagued (pun not intended but still funny) by various conflicts and unrests pretty much from the very beginning. Like I mentioned: It only existed as long as it did because it was always much more a Confederation than anything else with an Emperor who, for the most part, didn’t have any real power beyond that of his own country and the Vassals and free cities loyal to him.    Then it got utterly obliterated by Napoleon and rightfully remade into much bigger pieces but was still just the “Flickenteppich” of Europe. Then Prussia starts to dominate because of a series of extremely valuable and important reforms both social as well as economical, becomes the German Empire, gets an Emperor who couldn’t care less about stability and has much bigger ambitions then he can afford, gets punched into submission, sees one of the most important Revolutions of our time, turns Fascist, fails again on big ambitions and ends up finding out in the end that it was best when it didn’t try to play Conqueror but instead focus on economic power especially based on education and most importantly skilled labor which brings a lot of innovation with it supported by high living-standards.	1642836660.0	htpstwj	t3_s9qb4q	t1_htpstlr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qb4q/what_made_germany_so_op/htpstwj/
e49gp06y	There always was a lot of criticism about Mother Teresa which was largely ignored by the Vatican however ([look here fore the official statement of the Vatican on her](https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_madre-teresa_en.html)). But there was a Study conducted in 2013 with the goal to look into her medical practices, her general believes as well as political views with the goals of finding a solid base for the criticism that was already brought up numerous times before ([click here for the study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0008429812469894)). There is also an Article about the Study [right here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401151627/http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20130301-mother-teresa-anything-but-a-saint.html) which gives a good summary so you don't have to pay for it.   The accusations ranged from embezzlement of founds over millions of dollars which were not invested in actual care for the sick because Mother Teresa held the opinion that the sick had to suffer like Christ on the Cross to find salvation. And to be fair the pictures of that hospice and its insides do not give any sort of impression that Millions of Dollars were invested at all. There are definite cases of Millions in Donations Documented like that of Charles Keating who donated 1.25 Million to the Hospice. And considering the substantial public attention she and her project got I would say it's very realistic to assume that they had no issues with money at all. According to "The Original Sin" by Gianluigi Nuzzi there was evidence of a secret Bank-Account of Teresa with the Vatican Bank but it's unknown how much money there was in it. Records of exact donations are very hard to come by.    On that note in an Article from 2010 Forbes Magazine wrote: "In early 2000, Susan Shields, a former Missionaries sister who left the organization "unhappy", created a furor by saying she herself had "written receipts of $50,000" in donation but there was no sign of the "flood of money." Forbes India talked to a volunteer in the Los Angeles office of Missionaries of Charity who admitted that "even when bread was over at the soup kitchens, none was bought unless donated."   Then there was the "Hell's Angel" documentary by Christopher Hitchens about Mother Teresa that brought up a lot of accusations against her in the public eye. He also wrote "The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice" on which his documentary is based. So you can either read the book or watch the documentary if you're interested. The info will mostly stay the same.  There is a substantial amount of evidence to support at least the claim that Teresa saw her work mostly as missionary first and actually caring for the sick second and that she really wasn't as good and well meaning as it is often presented by the Vatican and other sources that are interested in keeping her picture as a saint alive.	1642840249.0	htpy31g	t3_s9ux62	t3_s9ux62	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9ux62/is_mother_teresa_controversial/htpy31g/
e49gp06y	Lincoln wrote in a [Letter to Joshua Speed](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm) in 1855:  "I am not a Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor or degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that "all men are created equal." We now practically read it "all men are created equal, except negroes" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read "all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics." When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocracy"  In contrast to that, here is a direct quote by Benito Mussolini:"\[When the\] city dies, the nation – deprived of the young life-blood of new generations – is now made up of people who are old and degenerate and cannot defend itself against a younger people which launches an attack on the now unguarded frontiers \[...\] This will happen, and not just to cities and nations, but on an infinitely greater scale: the whole White race, the Western race can be submerged by other coloured races which are multiplying at a rate unknown in our race."([sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_(book)))And to add even more context, here's a passage from a Speech held by Mussolini in Bologna, April 3. 1921"How then was this Fascism born; amid what tumultuous passions, sympathy, hatred, bitterness, and incomprehension? It was not only born in my mind and in my heart; it was not only born in that meeting held in March 1919 in the little hall at Milan; it was born of the profound and perennial need of this our Mediterranean and Aryan race, which felt the essential foundations of its existence threatened by a tragic folly and a mythical tale which today crumbles to pieces, in the very place where it was born"([sauce](http://bibliotecafascista.blogspot.com/2012/03/speech-in-bologna-april-3-1921.html))  That's just for Mussolini and therefore Italian (and original) Fascism. I guess I don't really need to make a case about Nazi-Germany and their Fascism in this regard. And since the overwhelming Majority of Fascists were equal eugenicists it's probably fair to say that Lincoln would have not at all liked them. Lincoln was, in essence, a Liberal by the standards of his time. I don't think any of his views would've been compatible with what fascism is at its very core.

tl0jj	Mother Theresa utilized faith based approaches to her victims.  This meant that she didn't mistreat them per se, but she didn't treat them either. Pain and suffering was considered by her to be a gift from god. Medicine would only get in the way of her victims best interests:  *“Pain and suffering have come into your life, but remember pain, sorrow, suffering are but the kiss of Jesus - a sign that you have come so close to Him that He can kiss you.”*   What makes her so reviled by so many is that for herself, she changed her beliefs and accepted plenty of medical care to ease her own suffering.  Her funding often came from troublesome sources like a Haitian dictator and didn't seem to make it to the needy in her care. Some estimates were as low as 7% of donations actually feeding or providing medicine to those she was "caring" for.   This is all subjective to a degree though. If you're Roman Catholic you may agree with her stances. If not, then she's pretty filthy in so many ways.	1642842612.0	htq1fyo	t3_s9ux62	t3_s9ux62	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9ux62/is_mother_teresa_controversial/htq1fyo/
e49gp06y	Since it was one of the first earthquakes actively witnessed and documented in modern history it was pretty much the starting point of the science of seismology and a substantial push for science in general to seek different explanations rather then "God did it".   As a matter of fact there are several examples of Philosophers or Artists who are counted as part of the Enlightenment writing about this like Immanuel Kant, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist ([click](https://unterrichten.zum.de/wiki/Erdbeben_von_Lissabon#Heinrich_v._Kleist)). With Kant, yet again, being the worst possible offender in terms of titles:   "On the causes of the earthquakes on the occasion of the disaster which affected the western countries of Europe towards the end of last year"   "History and description of the nature of the most remarkable events of the earthquake which shook a large part of the Earth at the end of the year 1755"   "Immanuel Kant's continued consideration of the earthquakes that were felt some time ago"   And then there's also Voltaire himself with his Poem: "Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne"   or "[Poem on the Lisbon Disaster](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55316a91e4b06d7c3b435f17/t/5f0b98212d6235002623d7dd/1594595362627/Voltaire+-+Poem+on+the+Lisbon+Disaster.pdf)"  There is also a [Study on the Topic](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3155961?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) as well.

vrnrs	If you mean uneducated then yes. Prior to late 19th century public education the vast vast majority of people did not receive an education coming close to what even a 10 year old today receives.  But if you mean stupid. Well that has many things that contribute to intelligence/stupidity.  Poor nutrition, particularly iodine deficiency has shown a 15 IQ point difference.   Hookworm in the american south affected 40% of the population which led to lower health that many considered lazy and stupid.    The industrial revolution saw metric shit tonnes of lead, mercury and other toxic materials spewed into human environments. Leaded petrol in the 20th century took this to new heights.  Compare that to a modern person who isn't exposed to lead, mercury, has a balanced diet and gets 6 hours a day in a classroom and yeah, people in the past were "stupid"  > It wasn't until the development of the laser rangefinder in the 1960s that artillery was moved out the realm of guesswork  Oh wow....   So Napoleon, dude who almost conquered Europe, did so as an artillery officer. Back then artillery was the lame branch. Proper officers joined the cavalry to gain more glory. Then napoleon with his pansy arse math and calculations comes along and dominates the battlefield.  You might have learnt to navigate using a compass with 360 degrees, however most artillery officers well before ww1 were working in 6400 mils instead. At 1 kilometre distance a difference of 1 mil was 1 metre. If my artillery shells are falling 50 metres off i know to adjust my aim by 50 mils. You also had arc angles and range calculations, calculating powder loads and shell weights. All things which required a decent education to be able to without a digital calculator while in a war zone.	1642850505.0	htqc8wv	t3_s9fhq3	t3_s9fhq3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fhq3/was_it_always_common_to_assume_people_in_the_past/htqc8wv/

They were meant to besiege castles and besiege cities.

hcz1cyuu	Ancient Greeks had nothing in common with Islamic laws in general ! There is nothing Islamic that can be compared with NONE of different Ancient Greek city-states/tribes !! Especially if you think that Minoans were a matriarchichal society and the gene was determined by the mother and not the father especially among Minoan Royals ! Grecian style fashion would be probably very revealing and scandalous/haram for Islamic standards ,it was even considered as scandalous and provocative for male nature among Ancient Persians and Semites too.  Ancient Greeks according to their tribe/state had different laws offcourse but they never excluded their women from other men's eyes that is so hilarious !!! If they wanted to "hide" them they wouldn't dress them so feminine and desirable !!!  Many Greek tribes had laws though to prevent their own Greek women (and Greek men) from mixing with non Greeks and even more especially the Greek women ,because firstly the Greeks were either being attacked as a peaceful nation and they got enslaved at times so they wanted to protect their women and therefore their existance by this and secondly for Ancient Greeks the woman's womb was considered as "sacred" ,for my ancestors life is created inside women they compared women's womb with universe so they needed their women for reproduction not to be used to breed with other rulers . After the fall of East Byzantine empire when Greeks became slaves ,either they were under Ottomans or under British or under Venetians or French (frangoi) the Greek families were making agreements-engagements for their underage kids by promising their daughters/sons to other Greek families and they were marrying them at the proper age . This sounds weird for today's standards but it kept us alive and we are not extinct . Many Greek girls/Greek women had abortions when they got pregnant by their rulers !  Another thing simeone can learn about Ancient Greeks like Athenians and Macedonians is that they were punishing the lover of married man's wife not the wife (?!?) ,the cheated Greek husband chose the punishment for his wife's lover ,he could choose either the public humiliation (softest) either painful death (hardest) ! The unfaithful Greek wife had to suffer with her actions consequences .... Sometimes and foreign lovers were being slaughtered for mixing with the Greek wives ! For examble one of the most famous and notorious cases of antiquity was when the Macedonians found out that Persian men ,envoys  from Persia ,were having romantic/sexual affairs with Royal Greek Macedonian women of the palace and this caused cheated Royal Greek Macedonian men's deep anger and they ordered the Persian men's slaughter ! Persians send Noble Persian engineer and Xerxes cousin Bubares for further investigation because the families of the Persian envoys they had no clue about the situation or what happened to their men and were furious too . Alexander in an excellent diplomatic move he gave Bubares his young and beautiful Royal half sister Gygaea to silence the matter and keep peace !!!

These kids, as well as the rest of the Spanish Exile, which included the cultural and scientific elite, were instrumental in the cultural and scientific development of Mexico.	1642874863.0	htrqw8v	t3_sa66bi	t3_sa66bi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa66bi/did_countries_other_than_the_uk_practice_large/htrqw8v/
3qvw7q7a	> delaying the war would give Britain time to prepare and win the war.  was that really expressed as such?  you are implying he knew war was inevitable, but the agreement was an intentional delay?  that's not what the movie portrayed at all.    in any case, most historians say that if the allies had invaded earlier rather than later, there would not have been a world war. eg, if they had invaded right after the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1935.  The one thing I found absurd was: Chamberlain literally throwing aside a piece of German intelligence sight unseen. (Would he really be that stupid? Even if was going through with the signing, why would you not even have MI-6 vet it?)  Also was Chamberlain in staying over at a British consulate in Munich?  Because otherwise the Gestapo would have _thoroughly_ bugged Chamberlain's residence and known about the German turncoat;  he would have been immediately arrested.	1642874985.0	htrr7o6	t3_s9fm6k	t3_s9fm6k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fm6k/the_movie_munich_edge_of_war_asserts_that_the/htrr7o6/

gpxwtj5c	An American here with a BA in History concentrating in 20th century history.  The answer to your question of whether the US saved Britain twice is, maybe maybe not.  I don't like to play "what if" because there are so many variables some obvious some less so that it is impossible to consider them all.  Let examine WW I first.  A great many of the population in the US were against joining in WW I with some favoring joining Germany.  The British went to great extremes to sway US public opinion in the US including cutting the transatlantic cable connecting the US with Germany so they could control news flowing to the US.  The British and French led a campaign to get the US to join the war on their side but their idea was for the US just to supply men who they would train and push into the meat grinder of the trenches.  The US refused and would only supply troops if they remained under US command.  That is why the US did not really enter the war until mid way through 1918.  The French, British and allies had fought to stalemate against the German and allies.  All were literally running out of men and material.  Losses had been horrendous, heavy guns were shot out and supplies of food and munitions were running out.  I do not beleive the war would have lasted through 1918 regardless of American intervention.  What US intervention did provide was to give the upper hand to the French and Britain who did not even allow the US to participate in negotiations.  My conclusion is that US intervention did not "save" Britain but did give them the upper hand since the new troop influx conclusively tipped the balance towards the French/Britain alliance with Germany unable to continue the war.   Now fast forward to WW II.  Britain and Europe are still reeling from the losses in WW I.  Hitler rose to power and immediately started rebuilding Germany and German military.  His long term plan was always to re-establish Germany as a European power and a player on the world stage.   Spending on the military probably allowed the German economy to grow faster than the rest of Europe.  Great Britain on the other hand was still reeling from the losses, in WW I, the Great recession and the cost and effort to control and empire that was starting to challenge colonialism.  They tried to negotiate away the war and thought they had succeeded but of course there policy of appeasement failed and Germany crossed the line in the sand and invaded Poland and it was off to war.  Once again there was a strong anti war stance in America.  It was a European problem and did not involve the US.  A neutrality act was passed that forbid the US from providing arms to either side.  This included the European theater and the Pacific Theater.  Now IMHO this caused Britain to start the war in a lot bigger hole than when they started WW I.  The Germans were dealt a blow with the Battle of Britain but the British did not come out unscathed.  A lot of resources were expended.  By this time the US had found ways around the Neutrality Act and was supplying Britain with some supplies.   Britain was still spread thin with war all over the world.  Would they be able to sustain it.  Remember at this time Russia was still in bed with Hitler.  They had divided Poland between them and both had their eyes on Finland.  Germany was in the driver's seat.  Now the what ifs.  What if the Japanese had not attacked Pearl Harbor?  What if the US had remained neutral?  That is not unimaginable.  Lots of people still remembered how the French and British excluded the US at the end of WW I.  I think a best case senerio the British would have had to cede Europe to Hitler to hang on to their island and a worst case Hitler would have bided his time and tried to invade Britain at a later time.  But none of that happened.  The US entered the war.  Ramped up production and supplied arms to the world, despite the Russian disagreement with that, as well as huge numbers of troops.  In the case of WW II I think there is a strong argument that the US saved Great Britain and is also solidified US Great Britain relations which had not been that strong before.	1642898919.0	htteheb	t3_safmna	t3_safmna	/r/AskHistorians/comments/safmna/america_saved_britain_twice_in_the_last_two_world/htteheb/

1ng9p2sn	Lots of things going on he and it hard to follow, this is understandable since Sykes-picot has become a buzzword but its just one part of a very large puzzle. Its also all controversial and people are still at war over fine details about all things that happened back then with all these agreements and treaties.  There are many more agreements and treaties then just the once you mentioned. Russia actually maybe the most relevant part of those agreements but that mainly concerns what is now Turkey so its far less interesting then talking about the Arab Middle East that is today in the media more.  Of course Russia because of the revolution fell out any agreements. So whatever was agree there was no longer relevant.  The Versailles treaty establishes some mandates that were broadly along the lines of the agreements signed during the war just in a different form, I will get into that more later. The actual treaty that was supposed to settle with the Ottoman Empire, was 'Treaty of Sèvres' and it was only signed in 1920.  However, what old men decide in ball room often has little barring on reality. The situation in the East continued long after WW1 was supposedly over (usually dated 1914-1918 but fighting continued in many places). The Turks lead by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk rejected the treaty and wanted to establish a strong Turkic state, rather then at best a rump state. This was successful.   The Treaty of Sèvres was dead, and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923. So between Lausanne and Versille 'The Eastern Question' was basically answered, the Ottoman Empire that had existed for centuries was gone. The collapse of the Ottoman empire that had been going in slow motion for decades had happened. The Islamic Caliphate was also ended at that point.  The agreements during the war had stated that Russia would get Constantinople, this of course didn't happen. National Turkey had also captured much of Eastern Anatolia. There was not gone be any kind of Kurdistan because the US had no interested in backing its creation with boots on the ground and nobody else did either.  In the Arab Middle East, the Mandate system took hold. What that essentially means is that British and French empires can't call the areas colonies. The idea of Mandates was that they would eventually be turned into real states and that the Empires were there to guide them there.  One thing to understand is that these agreements didn't come from nothing, they reflected already existing relationships and influence the nations had into the Ottoman state. France had been eyeing Syria for a long time. Britain had long been holding Kuwait as a protectorate. Egypt had been basically independent for a long time. Now the region was divided officially between French and British mandates, or what we would traditionally call Spheres of Influence.  Sykes-picot Map:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/MPK1-426_Sykes_Picot_Agreement_Map_signed_8_May_1916.jpg  The famous 'Line in the Sand' from Sykes-picot, that was famously symbolically removed in one of ISIS propaganda videos still existed. However, it was quite different then it was in 1916. This was mainly because oil had been discovered around Mosul in the French sphere and Britain want that for itself.  So Britain pulled that into its sphere. Palestine went from international to British as well.  Partly these changes happened because Britain was simply more powerful relatively then France. The war had ruined France. Mosul is not easily governed from French Syria and it would have been costly to do. France had always been most interested in the Christians there. Georges Clemenceau has more important issues he cared about then Mosul and Palastine. It makes sense from a logistical perspective to be part of civilization along the rivers going North-South as it had been for 1000s of years.  Mandate Map:  https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4cb7d78182c51e83b1364b5164908a91.webp  Both Britain and France eventually split up their regions. France split of the most Christian part of Syria into a new country called Lebanon. Britain create the Jordan and Palestine. Kuwait remained its own entity, the rest of the British mandate of Mesopotamian turned into Iraq.  Interestingly, these borders have proven to be incredibly strong and for the most part remain unchanged today. This means surprisingly Middle Eastern borders have been more stable for longer then most borders in Europe and some other places in the world.	1642900988.0	httj799	t3_sa9mb7	t3_sa9mb7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa9mb7/what_did_the_treaty_of_versailles_do_to_the/httj799/

o35mx	With respect, I'm not sure this is a a comparison you can really make, nor is it necessarily true.  First of all, the United Kingdom- both now and in pre-industrial times- had about five times the population of the Netherlands. This is not insignificant. And, as you note, the British are not a continental power and thus can defend themselves via sea power. Furthermore, an independent English-British nation has existed for more than twice as long as a united Dutch nation, so that changes things as well. So, I wouldn't argue that they're similar nations other than Germanic languages, protestant Christianity, and a history of naval power.   Secondly, the South African comparison isn't really valid because Apartheid isn't the Dutch. The Afrikaners may speak what was once a dialect of Dutch, yes, but it was the British who took control of the Kaapkolonie in the Napoleonic Wars, and who oversaw the expansion of the colony based in Cape Town, eventually conquering the Boers, who would form (part of) the basis of what became today's Afrikaners. These people officially stopped answering to the Dutch Government when the British took the colony, although from what I've read many of the Boers entirely ignored any Dutch government as well, prior to this. By the time we get to Apartheid in 1948, there'd been a generation or two of entirely British government in South Africa. Furthermore, it's worth noting that (as far as I've read), the English-speaking White South Africans did support Apartheid, even if they didn't support it as much initially.   Finally, I'm not sure you can compare the Dutch East Indies vs what became modern Malaysia. Indonesia has thousands upon thousands of islands, and has an order of magnitude more population. The Dutch East Indies were a single, centralized colony; the British had a variety of protectorates and vassals, plus Singapore, which eventually were (mostly) combined into a single state post-WWII.  You might be able to do a better comparison to the British Raj, which is not renowned as gentle.   I'm not an expert nor even a historian, so I can't really comment on the specifics of Dutch or British colonialism, but I do argue, then, that it's hard to compare the two, as they're really too different, or at least can only be judged on a case-by-case basis.	1642920625.0	htuorvj	t3_sakj6q	t3_sakj6q	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sakj6q/why_were_the_dutch_such_brutal_colonialists/htuorvj/

c2nytszl	If I recall correctly, Mussolini came up with the idea and conceived the Munich Conference as a means of resolving an imminent war. The British and French caved in, expecting that once the German lands were unified, Hitler would abandon his desire for further expansion, but they were rather foolish since German ambassadors/diplomats briefed the British that Hitler was preparing for war, and their warnings were overlooked. Another consequence of the Munich Agreement was the Soviet Union's reunion with Nazi Germany, and Hitler's popularity in Germany rocketed, making resistance efforts in the German military increasingly difficult.    Simply put, I believe the extra time was probably essential to demonstrate that Hitler was the monstrous individual he is, as he wanted to provoke a war by any means.	1642945445.0	htvn1r1	t3_s9fm6k	t3_s9fm6k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fm6k/the_movie_munich_edge_of_war_asserts_that_the/htvn1r1/

gqydb	The gist of it is that primaries back then, for President, were basically irrelevant. The nominee was determined at the national convention of the parties by slates of delegates nominated by state party conventions. The primaries had no impact on the convention, so candidates were generally not paying any real attention to them, and in most of these states only one candidate was on the ballot, and often not even under their own name but using a prominent local supporter like a Senator or Governor as a "favorite son" candidate to showcase their affiliation with them.   Genuine primaries awarding delegates to the national convention became more popular in some states after WW2, and beyond that competing in primaries became a more important litmus test for measuring public support of Presidential candidates, but it wasn't until 1976 that primaries became clearly the most important part of the nomination process and awarded a majority of delegates to the convention.	1642948059.0	htvs1ms	t3_saotqd	t3_saotqd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saotqd/why_were_the_results_of_the_1932_democratic/htvs1ms/
gh16flt8	Well in short, very. But it did depend, on the commander, the environment, and of course the period. Legionaries under General (and Consul) Marius for instance we’re called ‘Marius’ mules’ for how hard he worked them.  But they were (often) required to March an average of 20-25 miles a day, with 25kg then build a fort at the end of it. So would have been pretty tough.  Saying that, the fitness of a lot of other soldiers in the ancient world would also have been pretty impressive.	1642949064.0	htvu4ou	t3_saswy0	t3_saswy0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saswy0/how_physically_fit_were_roman_soldiers_in_the/htvu4ou/

Africans we’re easier to control because they were separated entirely from their language and culture, and were transported to an alien place.

ueays37	I am no academic expert on WW2 explosives, but I am a person who lives in the South East of England and can tell you that, anecdotally, I know of a handful of unexploded WW2 bombs that have been discovered near where I live during my lifetime, and the bomb squad has had to be called out to defuse them. It is definitely not an unknown thing, and happens semi-regularly. There is a list of some recent ones that have been found here:  * January 2022 - Norfolk, England - [Boat damaged after WW2 bomb accidentally detonated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-60071673) * July 2021 - Goole, Yorkshire, England - [Army detonates WW2 bomb discovered on motorway](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/24/evacuations-in-goole-for-detonation-of-500lb-second-world-war-bomb) * February 2021 - Exeter, Devon, England - [WW2 bomb detonated after homes evacuated](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-56226798) * April 2019 - Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England - [WW2 bomb detonated close to Southend Pier](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-47814664)  In terms of how explosive these bombs were I'm not qualified to say, but there is a resource that tracks the quantity of explosive material dropped. "Bomb Sight"is run by the National Archives, and has mapped every bomb that fell during the London Blitz (7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941), with information about the dates of said bombings and extra information. You can find it [here](http://bombsight.org/#13/51.5130/-0.1006). London was, of course, not the only British city to experience bombing (Coventry's cathedral was quite famously destroyed in the Coventry Blitz on 14 November 1940), but it has probably been the most extensively researched. "Bomb" Sight would probably be a good place to start if you wanted to find out more.  **Sources**  * "Bomb Sight", National Archives * BBC News * The Guardian	1642953226.0	htw3syc	t3_sar5v5	t3_sar5v5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sar5v5/i_often_hear_about_the_discovery_of_unexploded/htw3syc/
1sgoccr4	Yes.  American production and experience proved crucial for both wars, primarily the former.  The US *dominated* production of pretty much everything due to their vicegrip on the emerging energy source of the day, oil.  Oil was explored and exploited extensively first in America, with Standard Oil building up to a nationwide monopoly by the turn of the century. By WW2 America alone constituted 70% of worldwide oil production, and that is gradual *decline* as more oil elsewhere in the world was found and exploited.  Their industries implemented oil quicker and in abundance, allowing for a competitive advantage that surpassed the rest of the world. Powering groundwater pumps and providing industrial fertilizer also made their food hyper competitive as well, serving as another dominant export that remains the case today.  Anyone who wanted to remain competitive had to import American oil to some degree, and in doing so be on good terms with the US. More importantly pay in US dollars, not the British pound.  As for experience, the European powers were unaccustomed to the total war that was seen in the US Civil War. Most of the wars 1850s onwards were short decisive battles that didn't last more than a year or two.  They were not experienced with the type of warfare the US had already experienced 50 years before. Trench warfare with artillery and machine gun (Gatling guns) caused mass deaths in the Civil War. US Civil War taught the importance of industrial warfare, to use industry and manpower advantages to grind the other side to dust.	1642954646.0	htw7cdp	t3_safmna	t3_safmna	/r/AskHistorians/comments/safmna/america_saved_britain_twice_in_the_last_two_world/htw7cdp/

1ouz4fvr	I am interested in this as well.  I am living the part of Indiana jones where they box up the lost ark and put it into storage.  I am working on a daughters of the American revolution book on for the 250 anniversary of American revolution (2026) my chapter is working on a book that Is what happened to our area (we have a French and Indian war fort) during the revolution. So we are explaining what happened after the French and Indian war, to make this more confusing the records call this American rev war Fort the same name as the British fort.   Basically its an ego trip of 2 women especially. I am sitting there with several more 20 somethings as the assistants.   they are looking for a powder horn that someone found and donated to Fort X (its French and Indian) its carved with Fort X with date 1776 so its actually the American revolution fort. with an etching of a fort on it. literally has the name of it.  Long story short Fort X left it go on display at another museum so my team is contacting 4 other places to find out where is Fort X (still owns it) powder horn. I swear we are going to these musueum and look into their storage ourselves.  I have told people and all they said was we do not work for a newspaper like I want to write a fantasy story. I wish.

cnphbl8l	My dissertation at university was on the Knights Templar, obviously that doesn't mean I'm  an authority on the matter, but I'm not sure what you mean by part of the Catholic church.  In essence they were a monastic order that followed their own specially devised monastic rule. The Latin Rule as it was called, was devised by Bernard of Clairveaux in 1128. It was very similar to the earlier Rule of St Augustine.  From their inception, the Templars were an oddity. Swearing to live a monastic life but also bearing arms to defend pilgrims on crusade. It was only once they'd received the patronage of Clairveaux and the support of Pope Innocent II that they became more of an official Catholic monastic order.	1642957803.0	htwfgsf	t3_sawspf	t3_sawspf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sawspf/were_the_knights_templar_always_part_of_the/htwfgsf/

There is also a concept called "Pikuach Nefesh," which basically states that the preservation of human life comes before almost every other commandment. If a Jew found themselves in a situation in which their only option was to orally take pork insulin, they would be allowed to do so by Jewish law.	1642958950.0	htwih86	t3_sautz9	t3_sautz9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htwih86/

2rcoj	As a white Powwow fan in the United States, I feel that I can address this a bit. It's the word costume that is important. If it looks like a Halloween costume it is not appropriate. It's like wearing black face. An attractive Powwow outfit is usually acceptable because mostly everyone realizes that they are a modern invention anyway. But there are old lines drawn that will not be crossed. Such as "Thou shalt not wear a war bonnet unless you deserve to wear a war bonnet". At least at a Native Gathering. Karneval is a different story. The New Orleans Mardi Gras is just crazy and fun and there really is no use complaining about all the cultural appropriation going on there.	1642960648.0	htwmxvv	t3_savz63	t1_htw6xle	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwmxvv/

I understand your frustrations. The fact that you’re trying to understand your education is a step in the right direction. Think of history as an in-between of science and art: we can study concrete things, but at the end of the day it’s up to us to interpret that information to the best of our abilities. A LOT of my graduate work was just juxtaposing many viewpoints on the same topic—connecting the dots to see what the story was.   Keep connecting those dots. Ask tons of questions.

h8ny3uyr	I’m not OP, but they are gone and I do have some experience with this in Germany.  German culture (most of Central/Western Europe really) is shocking, patronisingly racist against Native Americans. I expect most Germans would deny that, as they love _die Indianer_ so, so much, but it is true.   That love is of an infantilised genetic “native,” indistinguishable from any other on the continent, exactly maybe from “the other ones” in Central and South America.   In Germany; _die Indianer_ are all wise and nature-loving, childlike in their goodness and faith in others, brave and almost supernatural in their physical abilities, a simple belief system and a simple culture you can master in a few weekends. The stereotypes aren’t bad per se, but they are pretty insulting.   And even for those who don’t actively play dress-up Indian, “generic Indian”  is a [popular costume](https://image.stern.de/8595620/t/j0/v3/w1440/r1.7778/-/karneval.jpg) at carnival, a good [kids birthday theme](https://www.pink-dots.de/tipps/spiele-fuer-den-indianergeburtstag), a ]reasonable idea for a comic, animated series and a recent movie](http://zkmb.de/decentering-mans-place-in-the-universe-yakari-and-its-visual-representation-of-native-americans/)  I’m not surprised that the kind of person who reflected on and researched so little when they were trying to “reenact Indians” continued that behaviour when choosing a side in re-enacting the Civil War (which itself is weird. It’s not like Europe never had any wars here they could reenact. I’m guessing those are too close to home to pretend they were actually fun and noble and have non-depressing story lines).	1642984760.0	htyd2dq	t3_savz63	t1_htwsxhx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htyd2dq/

anyry7th	Many barangay settlements operated via subsistence farming, diffusing into smaller groups once the number of inhabitants grew too large. The archipelagic nature of the Philippines further encouraged populations to spread out, allowing each settlement to exercise political autonomy. Early Spanish reports describe barangays sprinkling the coastlines of Luzon and the Visayas, each with about 30-100 households.   These socio-political units could merge for mutual benefit however. Pre-conquest Manila, estimated at 500 households, and Cebu, probably at 200-250, were comprised of multiple barangays linked by trade and intermarriage between their elites. Group consensus was vital in these settings, and the ties that bound leaders and followers were on a deeply personal basis. This meant that loyalties could shift based on the capability of the leadership.   The Spanish could therefore win over barangays piecemeal which made the task easier but also slowed things down. The diffused settlements made them logistical headache to control, made only feasible by delegating responsibilities to the Catholic Church, encomenderos, and native elites.  Elsewhere, the Islamification of barangays in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago gave rulers additional legitimacy based on religion.

240c8n9e	I have read the rules regarding responses, and I don’t want to fall afoul of them, but I have to take issue with the premise of the question, “being called a gorilla is a common insult in Japan.” I have a degree in Japanese literature (albeit post-war, not ancient), am employed as a translator, and have lived in Japan since 2004. Though I’m not sure how you would measure such a thing, being called a gorilla as an insult in Japanese would be no more or less common than being called a gorilla as an insult in English. There is even a gorilla in Higashiyama Zoo named Shabani who is famous for how handsome he is. He’s somewhat of an unofficial mascot for the city of Nagoya, where I live, as he’s been used by the city in municipal advertisements. I have also never encountered in my academic studies, professional work, or personal life a negative reputation attributed to gorillas. Babies and people with relatively “simian” features such as large ears are sometimes referred to as “猿”(saru), meaning “monkey” in general, but the reputation of monkeys as a whole doesn’t suffer from this.   I understand if this answer does not meet the criteria for a proper response, so no hard feelings if the mods delete it.	1642997030.0	htz6mf4	t3_sb9ad3	t3_sb9ad3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb9ad3/being_called_a_gorilla_is_a_common_insult_in/htz6mf4/

pho6o	In John Holland’s ‘Hitler’ it is claimed most of his wealth and the parties came from private backers who were among Germany’s old aristocratic elite and German businessmen who saw Hitler’s Nazi’s as the lesser evil compared to the social democrats and communists. Many also were actively anti Semitic and very supportive of Hitler beyond financial reasons.   In Ian Kershaw’s ‘Hitler’ he says that the money received from the profits of Mein Kampf made him independently rich for the rest of his life. Even though he continued to be gifted money and houses and other expensive gifts after this by many private admirers who were similar to the crowd John Holland mentions.   Ian Kershaw claims that the Nazi’s before the Beer Hall Putsch were usually in some sort of financial issues and Hitler himself relied on entirely private donations of an unknown amount and origin.   So Kershaw believes the Beer Hall Putsch, the following trial and Hitler writing Mein Kampf in prison was the turning point in political and financial fortunes for the Nazi’s.   Up until his death Hitler would not have financially wanted for anything just based on Mein Kampf’s income alone. And he had other more anonymous sources always at his disposal.	1643002256.0	htzgowc	t3_sbczey	t3_sbczey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/htzgowc/

Many modern writers on the topic stay away from discussing many different topics regarding Nazism. As such much of how the Nazi’s achieved their goals is not focused on as not to promote modern nazi sympathy or neo Nazism.   Both Hitler books I sourced spend more time discussing Hitler’s daily routines over Nazi policy or events.

5adbc98u	>the ways that they filtered out the reasons that the CSA seceded, and its commitment to maintaining the enslavement of Black Americans, were startling to me.

pho6o	Not to be rude but that has nothing to do with what I said.   There are clear expectations when writing about Hitler and Nazism, one of them requires the downplay of any successes of the regime or its members and the focus upon mistakes. Most writers will write more about the failure at Dunkirk than the victory of France, and many believe they are actually working against the creation of future neo nazis by doing so. But the opposite seems to be true, though I can’t say that with academic certainty.   There are multiple times where both Holland and Kershaw almost apologise for mentioning anything positive about him and instantly regale the reader with a criticism or negative assessment as compensation. The point isn’t that Hitler should be praised or critiqued but that history shouldn’t be blurred simply for the sake of the writers personal beliefs. If a writer can’t stomach the idea of writing anything about Hitler that isn’t almost entirely negative, maybe they shouldn’t be writing about Hitler?   And you haven’t read much Hitler biographies if you think historians don’t judge personalities, they most certainly do.   Kershaw’s book spends lavish amounts of times trying to depict negative personality traits of Hitler and trying to explain a lot of the history away with such rather gossipy and ahistorical assessments. He gossips endlessly about Hitler, at the cost of actual historical discussion. Again it’s more a social history at times, and he is willing to believe preposterous negative stories because that suit his personal beliefs. For example he chooses to believe that Hitler got on his knees with one of his early followers wife and claimed to be her eternal slave or something like that. The only source for this is ofc the women who he supposedly said this to, who had every reason after the war to try and distance her and her husband from him as much as possible. But Kershaw is happy to use this and equally questionable sources but he considers the account of Hitler’s long term childhood friend to be almost entirely false. He ignores most of what his childhood friend says and instead creates his own narrative which is based on exceptionally little actual sources. Again it isn’t that Hitler doesn’t deserve to be criticised or whatever, it’s that Kershaw thinks it’s ok to basically invent and warp the narrative as he sees fit.   This is just one small sample of the complexities and cheap immaturity’s that makes Hitler and Nazism very complex and frustrating topics to discuss with an even somewhat historically valid framework.	1643010650.0	htztfe1	t3_sbczey	t1_htzs2em	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/htztfe1/
12hxe3	The marshal-plan largely is the answer for that.  West germany got granted a five year protection period to rebuild its economy and vast loans to companies to finance the rebuild. Additionally west germany didn’t have to tear down as much of their economy and infrastructure and ship it east. Furthermore the then backbone of german economy, coal steel and machinery was in high demand since so much was destroyed. Thanks to the loans it was possible to heavily invest in those keeping workers employed, companies like RUAG und Krupp alive and in return getting absolutely state of the art machinery.  A similar, though smaller effect can be seen after WWI when french reparation obligations forced germany to heavily modernise, though this wasn’t financed by US banks and therefore a little more troublesome.	1643012592.0	htzvyvu	t3_sbh5lh	t3_sbh5lh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbh5lh/how_did_west_germanys_economy_recover_so_well/htzvyvu/
hfsx6	"The contribution made by American capitalism to German war preparations before 1940 can only be described as phenomenal. It was certainly crucial to German military capabilities. For instance, in 1934 Germany produced 300,000 tons of natural petroleum products and less than 800,000 tons of synthetic petroleum gasoline; the balance was imported. Yet, 10 years later in ww2, after transfer of the Standard Oil of New Jersey hydrogenation patents and technology to I. G. Farben (used to produce synthetic gasoline from coal), Germany produced about 6.5 million tons of oil - of which 85% was synthetic oil using the Standard Oil hydrogenation process. Moreover, the control of synthetic oil output in Germany was held by the I. G. Farben subsidiary, Braunkohle-Benzin A. G., and this Farben Cartel itself was created in 1926 with wall street financial assistance.  On the other hand, the general impression left with the reader by modern historians is that this American technical assistance was accidental and that American industrialists were innocent of wrong doing. [...] evidence suggests that not only was an influential sector of America business aware of the nature of nazism, but for it's own purposes aided nazism wherever possible (and profitable) - with full knowledge that the probable outcome would be war involving Europe and The United States." - Chris Sutton" Wall Street and the rise of Hitler.  Hitler was also elected during a time of hyper-inflation and foreign money was worth a lot more than German marks at the time of his campaign. From the same book:   "The Dawes Plan arranged a series of foreign loans totalling $800 million with their proceeds flowing to Germany. These loans are important [...] because the proceeds, raised for the greater part by the United States from dollar investors, were utilized in the mid 1920s to create and consolidate the gigantic chemical and steel combinations of I. G. Farben and Wereinigte Stahlwerk, respectively. These cartels not only helped Hitler to power in 1933; the Also produced the bulk of the German war materials used in WW2."	1643013995.0	htzxpxl	t3_sbczey	t3_sbczey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/htzxpxl/

8wzec	Early on Hitler made a living through speaker fees and rich friends who “lent” him money.  In 1920, Hitlers left the army and began his rise in leadership in the National Socialist German Workers Party and did not accept a salary. When asked how he made a living, he would get angry. When Hitler was indicted in 1921 by the National Socialist Party, who believed that his leadership of the party was becoming too dictorial, he was asked by the committee court of the party how he made his money. He replied, “If I speak for the National Socialist Party, I take no money for myself. But I also speak for other organizations… and then of course I accept a fee. I also have my midday meals with various party comrades in turn. I am further assisted to a modest extent by a few party comrades”. His own personal lifestyle was also not lavish.  *The Rise And Fall of The Third Reich* states: “His wants were certainly modest. Until 1929 he occupied a two-room flat in a lower-middle-class district in the Theirschstrasse near River Isar. In the winter he wore an old trench coat - it later became familiar with everyone in Germany from numerous photographs. In the summer he often appeared in shorts the *Lederhosen*which most Bavarian donned in seasonable weather.”  After the publication of his book *Mein Kampf*in 1925, its royalties became his chief source of income. His book didn’t make significant sells until 5 years later, in 1929, when his annual sales increased 10 fold from an annual average of 5,000 copies sold to over 50,000. Along with the rapid rise of the Nazi Party, this was also the year an inexpensive copy was released.  *The Rise And Fall Of the Third Reich:* “But they were nothing compared to those received in 1933, the year he became Chancellor. In his first year of office Mein Kampf sold a million copies, and Hitlers income from royalties, which has been increased from 10 to 15 percent after January 1, 1933, was over one million marks (some $300,000), making him the most prosperous author in Germany and for the first time a millionaire. Except for the Bible, no other book sold as well during the Nazi Regime, where few households felt secure without a copy on the table…. By 1950, the year after World War inscentia broke out, six million copies of the Nazi bugle had been sold in Germany.”	1643017025.0	hu01ec9	t3_sbczey	t3_sbczey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu01ec9/

6nm351dq	Ancient china for its time was the most collectivised society you could find, it was one of the earliest societies to adopt censuses of its people to maximise its taxation, even before the first emperor unified china. As the warlord states pre-unification had a sort of arms race with both their military but also their civil advancements. This was a very volatile period so keeping a tight leash on your population was ideal. So collectivism through effective bureaucracy has been a staple for china even before china ever formed. The Qing dynasty on the other hand was a very different state than most Chinese dynasties before it. As they were first of all a dynasty consisting of a minority living in china, and effectively locked the country into an isolated, and even delusional state.   It is said that when the first British envoys appeared before the emperor, he started speaking latin, for him and the court were under the impression that Europe was still under mostly roman rule  This stagnation in things such as bureaucracy, also halted their control of their population. The small villages that most of their population resided in were isolated in every sense of the word, thus creating this situation where the state could no longer keep their tight leash on its people as before, which lead to things as the opium epidemic becoming as bad as it did, a rise of piracy, and later on in the mid to late “century of humiliation”, a rise of secret societies.	1643022529.0	hu0859o	t3_sbjluv	t3_sbjluv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbjluv/how_old_is_collectivism_in_china/hu0859o/

So the Marshall Plan where the USA provided billions to Western Europe helped a lot. The Allies also acted very benevolently to Germany. Before after a war, you would ruin the conquered enemy. This is exactly what the Treaty of Versailles achieved. Clearly that didn't work out, and so the Allies sought to strengthen Germany. There were no reprisals. No punishment.  Also I think being bombed to absolute shit gave Germany a blank slate to build back up. Compared to a lot of France and the UK that has remained largely the same for centuries, Germany had to start anew.

e49gp06y	Funny story there. One of my favorites\^\^  After the war Bavaria became US-Occupied territory. And since the Publisher for the NSDAP and therefore the Government called "Franz Eher Nachfolger" had it's seat in Munich, that meant that every and all rights to every and all literature published through this Publisher became Property of the USA. But when the US Troops left, they simply didn't really know what to do with that and since Germany was to become sovereign, they decided to leave the rights with the Bavarian Government. Specifically the Ministry of Finances. Strange choice at first but made sense for the Americans since those rights were very much only about Finances to them.  So from the End of the war to 2015 there have never been any actual new prints of the book. At least not in a version without commentary. And that is very simply because the Bavarian Ministry of Finance held all the rights and never gave them up. There were international reprints because of course but there was little that could've been done to stop them all. Besides once the Internet became a thing, it was everywhere in form of PDF anway.  Technically there was never any laws speaking against reprinting the book. Nor even against reselling it. In fact the "Bundesgerichtshof" (the German Supreme Court) ruled in a verdict in 1979 that the ownership, distribution as well as acquisition of the book in one of its "original" forms as an "antique" isn't a criminal offense according to §86 StGB.   Since 2015 the copyright on the book has expired and now everybody call reprint and sell it as they see fit. There could still be a case where the book is classified as propaganda and therefore count as "Volksverhetzung" but it's doubtful considering the verdict in the past and the justification for it.   Fun Fact: The rights for the Book in Britain were already sold in the 1930's to a different Publisher so the book could've been printed there much earlier then 2015.	1643028618.0	hu0h4fh	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0cdhg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0h4fh/

8l5zr	I can provide the knowledge that here in Denmark it was common from my great grandmothers and onwards time ( so 1900+ at least, certainly earlier although I cant verify that far back. To butcher your own chickens, you see, for cows and pigs, you would be visited by the butcher who for a fee would do the killing and rough cutting of the meat, you would then divide the meat further yourself and "clean the cuts".  This was done to save expenses for the butchers fee to a minimum, and also to have the meat on sight where it could be stored correctly right away rather than to tracel with it.  So killing chickens by beheading them was something the children was taught fairly early on and not that big of a deal, and quite often a butchering day was also a family get together if you had more meat than what you could safely manage yourself before it spoiled.  My grandmother would also explain how meat was salted or hung to preserve it.  So while the answers youre looking for are most likely further back in time, These traditions are sure to have gone back further than just 3 or 4 generations.  Source: I come from a family of farmers, slaugtherhouse workers and butchers.

4d7o8msd	You're right to put "original" in quotation marks as if you want to be pedantic you could say that the original London Bridge was built by the Romans, and was made of wood. When people refer to the old London Bridge they often refer to the medieval bridge which had buildings on it and stood until the early nineteenth century when it made way for the New London Bridge. New London Bridge was replaced in 1973 with the current, rather boring looking London Bridge. Incidently the old New London Bridge now sits in Lake Havasu in the USA.   I hate to disapoint you, but looking at historical images of both bridges, neither appeared to have carved keystones like this. It would be interesting to ask what the source of the rumour is. In my experience rumours tend to develop easily around buildings or bits of buildings. Common examples are houses made from ship's timbers (very rare in reality) or everything in London being designed by Christopher Wren. In fact, Ye Olde Watling, a pub in the city of London claims to be built from ship's timbers by Christopher Wren, despite being made of brick!	1643036209.0	hu0wjuj	t3_sbmanv	t3_sbmanv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmanv/what_happened_the_original_keystones_of_london/hu0wjuj/

665tpgv4	There wasn’t an association between bebop and China. Louis Armstrong came from (and developed) a world of traditional New Orleans jazz in the 1920s and earlier, where time and key signatures were relatively straightforward, with a call-and-response nature that made following it relatively predictable. In the late 1920s, even just the development of swing, where beats were differentially stressed to produce a pushing-and-pulling rhythmic effect was groundbreaking. It was shocking and new, and even somewhat challenging for people to listen to.   Swing became the dominant genre of jazz for decades, remaining the fresh, hip, progressive thing that the cool young kids enjoyed. However, like rap, it became commodified and less innovative after bubbling through society. Incidentally, WWII helped legitimize this black and Jewish art form to white America. Prior to the war it was largely enjoyed by those who were “cool,” urbane, and urban. Middle America thought it beneath them, or at best a fun, foreign-sounding fad.   During the war, however, divers Americans mixed. White midwesterners were fighting alongside black New Yorkers and were exposed to swing. Being such a specifically American genre also made people appreciate it, and rally around it when they even saw Nazis make fake jazz songs as propaganda to show how uncivilized Americans were. Jazz artists toured alongside troops to boost morale.   By the end of WWII, jazz - swing being its dominant form - was therefore widely understood and familiar to American ears. However it was also overexposed. Commercials, movie scores, TV and radio bandstands, everyone was dipping into swing in a way that bored the jazz innovators. It is the late 1940s, we were almost a generation past the innovation of swing in the late 1920s. Artists never want to just make their dad’s music, and we see young black artists innovate bebop.   Stripped down without a big band, heavily reliant on improvisation, using shifting time keys and time signatures were just the start. Instruments were played in a deconstructed, unpredictable manner that did away with the familiar, call-and-response features that made late swing so palatable to the masses.   This is what Louis Armstrong was calling “Chinese.” That descriptor is simply a long-used term to refer to things that one doesn’t understand, often implicitly also suggesting they don’t value it. Chinese was seen as a confusing, funny, primitive, impossible-to-understand language to contemporary western ears. By now, he was the older generation of jazz artist. He also had a more personal financial reason to discredit bebop’s legitimacy, as he was benefitting from the postwar boom in swing. There was no cited, or really even detectable, influence from traditional Chinese music on the development of bebop.	1643037264.0	hu0z1qk	t3_sbmjvg	t3_sbmjvg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmjvg/louis_armstrong_famously_called_bebop_chinese/hu0z1qk/

g43fx4pr	I can not answer all of your questions, but I will try to answer as many as I can.  > The US (with allies) funded the resistance to the Russians. This included the mujahideen and Osama Bin Laden himself. Is this accurate?  We know for a fact that the United States funded (and armed) the Mujahideen, this operation was called "Operation Cyclone."^[1]  What we are less certain about is if Osama Bin Laden got the same treatment. Keep in mind that OBL was not part of the Mujahideen, he was one of the many "Afghan Arabs" who was involved with the war on the side of the resistance against the Russians. If he did receive financial support from the CIA, there likely wasn't a proxy involved (besides maybe Saudi Arabia?).   There is no actual paper trail linking the CIA and Osama Bin Laden though, that is just a fact. Still, based on the US' history of interventionism and imperialism, it wouldn't exactly be a reach to say that it's possible that the CIA was funding OBL in some way. Robin Cook, the former Foreign Secretary of the UK, certainly seems to think so. This is what Cook said in a The Guardian article from 2005:  *"Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida, literally "the database", was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden's organisation would turn its attention to the west."*^[2]  CNN's Peter Bergen, who has actually interviewed OBL before, had this to say when asked if it's true that the CIA funded OBL:  *"This is one of those things where you cannot put it out of its misery."*  *"The story about bin Laden and the CIA -- that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden -- is simply a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. In fact, there are very few things that bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and the U.S. government agree on. They all agree that they didn't have a relationship in the 1980s. And they wouldn't have needed to. Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently."*  *"The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him."*^[3]  So make of all this what you will.   > Following the war, the Taliban were created / trained in Pakistan. The initial members of the Taliban were refugees from Afghanistan and veterans of the war / mujahideen, and they took over Afghanistan in 1994. Is this accurate? How much overlap (in numbers of people) was there between the mujahideen and the Taliban of 1994?  The initial composition of the Taliban was actually a mix between the mujahadeen who fought against the Soviet invasion in the 1980s and Pashtun students of traditional Islamic schools from eastern and southern Afghanistan.^[4] The group was officially founded in 1994 but only took over Afghanistan and established a new government in 1996.^[4]    ---  Sources/Further Reading Material:  [1]: [Arming Afghan Guerrillas: A Huge Effort Led by U.S. - New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/18/world/arming-afghan-guerrillas-a-huge-effort-led-by-us.html) / [Operation Cyclone Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone)  [2]: [The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means - The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development)  [3]: [Bergen: Bin Laden, CIA links hogwash - CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html)  [4]: [The Taliban in Afghanistan - Council on Foreign Relations (Web Archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20121017134802/https://www.cfr.org/afghanistan/taliban-afghanistan/p10551)	1643038549.0	hu1288x	t3_sbhtkg	t3_sbhtkg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbhtkg/did_us_involvement_lead_to_the_rise_of_the/hu1288x/

By 1962, it was not sturdy enough to carry the increased load of traffic; the bridge was sold by the City of London in April 1968 to make way for its replacement.The purchaser, Robert P. McCulloch, was an entrepreneur and real estate developer who founded Lake Havasu City. He installed the bridge to attract tourists and retirement home buyers to his properties there."  "McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge cut and transported to the United States for use in the construction of a new bridge in Lake Havasu City, a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu. The Arizona bridge is a reinforced concrete structure clad in the original masonry of the 1830s bridge. The bridge was completed in 1971 (along with a canal), and links an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City.

g43fx4pr	Originally, African Americans used to name their children whatever was popular at the time in the US. This changed in the 1960s due to the Civil Rights Movement. After the 1960s, a lot of the uniquely African American names you might've heard started to pop up. These names are largely either:  * A combination of two/three popular names.  * A popular name but with a prefix (La-, De-) or suffix (-isha, -ique) added to it.  Since its founding, the Nation of Islam has also influenced how African Americans named their children. Common Muslim/Middle Eastern names became very popular within African American circles.

Black Americans, having been stripped of their cultural heritage and national identity, have spent these last centuries doing their best to create a brand new culture that exists aside from any attempts to force them to assimilate their children with "European" names.  For better or worse, Black Americans are no more African than they are European, and their desire to not be exclusively defined by either of those cultures has lead to a new culture of creative naming.	1643050312.0	hu1xmge	t3_sbsz53	t3_sbsz53	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbsz53/what_are_the_origins_of_a_lot_of_black_american/hu1xmge/

4yd0h6qk	The reason why an invasion, blockade, or nuclear strike didn't occur against China was to avoid WW3.  Technically, the USA wasn't at war with China.  All Chinese forces were technically vollenteers, although many we're former nationalist troops who had little choice in the matter.  China and the USSR had a mutual defense pack with each other, which means that if America directly attacks China the USSR will be forced to join and with the USSR having recently acquired nukes, this is the end of the world.  This is all ignoring the fact that even if they did blockade or bombard cities it wouldn't have stopped the war.  Nothing short of a full on invasion, which would kill millions and be potentially disastrous.   Mao was crazy, but he wasn't stupid.  He didn't send millions of his own men to die just to support a fellow communist regime, he wanted to make China into a global superpower.  By defending Korea he's A. Keeping a buffer state between him and the west. B. He's starting his own sphere of influence. And C. Most importantly the Russians are giving him invaluable technology, factories, logistic support, military advisors, and all the essentials to become a superpower.  Now that Mao is in a secure position his new goal is to become one and lives lost don't matter.  He sacrificed roughly 36 million in a famine exporting food to Russia so he could build an a-bomb.  He wouldn't even lose sleep at a mere 10 or 15 million killed by American bombardment. The American public on the other hand would never stand for thousands or millions of civilians being killed like this.  It would be a political death sentence to all involved.  So in conclusion, the Americans did not escalate the war due the the fear of world war 3 and the tremendous cost and effort that would be required to change the outcome of the war.  I just read Mao by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday and that is where my knowledge of this event comes from.	1643054416.0	hu28hnb	t3_sbsezs	t3_sbsezs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbsezs/why_didnt_american_navy_bombard_chinese_coastal/hu28hnb/

6nm351dq	I myself can only tell you the divide between Russians and Ukrainians. So early in Russias history, during the high medieval period, the Kievan Rus, a Rus princely state situated in today’s northeast Ukraine, western Russia and eastern Belorussia, became the dominant power between the different Russian states. It was very different from what you expect from a Russian state. They were converted early by the byzantines to orthodox Christianity, this started a relationship where the Kievan Rus started to venerate all things byzantine and saw itself as a nation closely tied to it. To the point that they would send soldiers to the eastern roman empire who themselves would be later known as the Varangian guard. So nearing the 13th century, the Mongols began their conquests of most of asia, and once they passed into the 1200s, they had set sights on the rus kingdoms. They quickly collapsed under the mongolian armies might and ferocity, which ended with the burning of kiev, and the last time ever that rus/russian power was centralised in the ukraine. Now, with contenders such as the novgorod republic and aforementioned kievan rus out of the picture, power over the russians was slowly being consolidated by the duchy of moscow, mind you they are all still a part of the mongolian empire, but as the mongols employee a very “laissez-faire” way of governing, asking nought but for a certain amount of taxation, the russian duchies were left in a situation were they held complete control over the peasants to increase the wealth so as to pay off the Mongolian empire (now the golden horde). So as the duchy of Moscow turned into russia, it basically sacked its population repeatedly to pay off the mongols, until it finally freed itself. This russia was a much more crueler and money driven amalgamation of russian nobles and Mongolian ways of terror that had distanced itself far away from the descendants of the Kievan Rus. This is the first point in modern history where we see the divide between the Russians and now, Ukrainians. I skimmed over a bit since its been millennia since I’ve ever had to think about this but i hope it helped	1643057048.0	hu2fcgf	t3_sb37w1	t3_sb37w1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb37w1/when_did_the_east_slavs_divide_themselves_into/hu2fcgf/
av7m7ojh	You are right in saying that Ireland was made up of fractured, petty kingdoms.   However, there were rulers who claimed the title of High King of Ireland, the primer inter pares. Some of them are based in legend, while others are grounded more in history.   One such High King is Brian Ború, who is credited with a decisive victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf, 1014.   While Ireland never represented a unified political state, there has been contention that this was the trajectory of Irish political rule prior to the Norman invasion of Ireland.   So, to conclude, these myths and legends could be referencing a High King of Ireland, or a petty king. It is unclear without knowing the name of the king or the kingdom in question.	1643057383.0	hu2g8c3	t3_sbmqt2	t3_sbmqt2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmqt2/why_do_many_welsh_myths_and_arthurian_legends/hu2g8c3/

While walking around Colonionial Williamsburg Virginia, I was able to talk to the actor working as the cobbler (shoe maker) within the town. They preceded to describe that, back within American Colonionial times, a separate left and right shoe were not made. Instead, two of the same shoes were made, and as worn, the shoe would over time adapt to the wearers foot. I'm essence, shoes were not designed for a specific foot shape but to work as shoes. So, to suggest a possible answer to the part of this question about the history, it was simply due to material, work and time costs that shoes had a narrower toe box and less form fitting design.	1643059849.0	hu2mskn	t3_sbuljf	t3_sbuljf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbuljf/the_majority_of_modern_everyday_shoes_do_not_have/hu2mskn/
av7m7ojh	In this sense, a petty king is one who rules over his domain, often a petty kingdom.   The High King exerts power and authority over a larger area than his petty kingdom - theoretically, the island of Ireland. I say theoretically, because it's hard to exert control over many fractured kingdoms, and sometimes there are other claimants to the title.   There are other factors, such as dynastic conflicts going on, so the authority of a High King is not constant.	1643060097.0	hu2ngwz	t3_sbmqt2	t1_hu2lm3p	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmqt2/why_do_many_welsh_myths_and_arthurian_legends/hu2ngwz/

x70zp	I'm unsure if this will be worthy enough for this subreddit but the following is my overly simplified understanding of that situation. Zionist groups began buying property in modern day Israel in the mid 19th century in the Ottoman "state" of Palestine, primarily in the Golan Heights region. The Ottoman Empire realized there had been a buildup of Jewish people in that area and confiscated it prior to World War 1. This caused there to be yet another ethnic group which was outraged at the OE; all of the outraged ethnic groups were organized by Britain (Lawrence of Arabia) in World War 1 to fight the OE, with the promise of lands after the war. Zionists and Muslim Palestinians were all grouped into the Palestine state following the war to limited success and managed from afar by Britain.  During World War II, then grand mufti ("mayor") of Jerusalem Sheikh Muhammad Amin al-Husseini often met with Adolf Hitler and discussed their mutual dislike of Jews. He shared the sentiment that he didn't have a problem with Jews necessarily, he just wanted them to live somewhere else. Both of them discussed where they could all be shipped to instead of their own countries. So during that war, there was a certain amount of persecution of the Jewish population. Following the war, the Jewish population began to organize and rebel/become freedom fighters/engage in terrorism to gain their own state. Britain was still in control of Palestine and eventually drew lines in the sand, giving the Zionist population its own Israeli state split apart from Palestine.	1643061935.0	hu2sb7l	t3_sboeq2	t1_hu2lafs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sboeq2/in_a_meeting_with_fdr_ibn_saud_reportedly/hu2sb7l/
3d593pdj	IIRC, the analogy with Rugby or American football goes back to the early-20th-century British scholar George Grundy.  It has been disputed in writing since the 1940s, but there are two problems: most of the scholars have only book knowledge of combat with edged weapon, and the school which replaced the 20th century 'orthodoxy' fell into the trap of proposing the opposite of whatever Hanson had written and accepted his ideas of what kinds of methods and sources were valid.  The result is duelling armchair theories which have not always been placed in comparative context or subjected to basic practical tests, and a lot of claims about the properties of arms and armour which won't survive contact with a specialist archaeology library.  As more archaeologists, and more scholars with experience in martial art and combat sports, enter the debate, its likely that research about the mechanics of early Greek combat will move beyond people asserting things and denying everything that other people say.	1643062549.0	hu2twma	t3_s83m6b	t1_htojroy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/hu2twma/
al0bz	The simple answer is that your toes are not meant to go to the end of the shoe. [Here is a podcast](https://www.stitchdown.com/stitchdown-shoecast/ron-rider-shoe-sizing-mistakes/) from a manufacturer/brand owner about shoe sizing mistakes that people make now. Essentially, you want the *largest* size that will still keep your foot comfortably in place, not the smallest size you can squeeze into. But many people size like the latter, or they are focused primarily on making sure their toe reaches the end. This is not desirable, particularly in more formal footwear where aesthetic is a primary concern and the material is not particularly giving. The most important part of sizing for shoes is putting the ball of your foot where the manufacturer designed the shoe to be flexible and “break” with the natural bend in your foot.   Basically, imagine someone added a smooth taper to the front end of the Geo Court II, and that’s how you’re intended to size. The Converse on the left is not sized correctly, and you can tell because they are approximately the same length as the Geo Courts despite being intended to leave room in the toe for the shoe to aesthetically taper.   You can find more sizing advice on /r/goodyearwelt, which is aimed primarily at leather shoes and boots but nonetheless provides good advice for general lifestyle footwear (modern athletic or running footwear on the other hand, is a different beast because of the flexibility of the upper’s material and the rigorous motion you put it through).

He was really not the best option to lead a newly-independent Georgia, and I do have to wonder what could have happened had Kostava not died before then.  Nothing would change, as Russia repeatedly threatened Georgia during that period.  The Georgian army was bombed several times, and Yeltsin also threatened Shevardnadze or Gamsakhurdia (I do not remember which one) to bomb Tbilisi if they invaded South Ossetia.

2gu4x0fh	Ottoman Empire definitely did have book shops.  It is pretty hard to find shop records about the early empire. However we do have other evidence. Molla Fenari, a cleric from Sultan Bayezid I’s reign is recorded to extend weekend from 2 to 3 days. This extra day was granted so the students could work and pay the “outrageous bookseller prices”.  The earliest records about specific booksellers in Ottoman Empire are from 1520.  Out of 140 shops in the Grand Bazaar, 4 of the shops  belonged to book merchants (called “sahaf”). There are also records of book merchants in Fatih district and other major marketplaces.  European diplomat’s one of the important missions in Constantinople was to shop for valuable books. In a letter to Venice, Venetian diplomat Piedro dela Valle writes that he has been looking for Arabic grammar books in Bezistan market in Constantinople in 1615.  Likewise a Dutch merchant in Izmir Michiel de Mortier wrote to the Dutch Levant trade director to complain about the diplomats in Constantinople. He complained that the diplomats spent thousands of golden liras in book merchants which could have been used to solve trade matters.   Overall it is clear that Ottomans had book shops in the classical period. We can also presume that there were places selling books and book supplies to students in early 1400s and 1300s, even though there are no surviving reports.   About the author and statement you mentioned, I have not heard of a book ban in Ottoman Empire. It also does not sound plausible for an Empire that needs schools and libraries to ban books. However Bayezid II banned the printing press, as a result of lobbying from scribes who did not want to lose their profitable jobs to a machine. This ban was only lifted in 1700s during the reign of Ahmed III.

l6to6	Yes, they did spoke latin in Maghreb, which evolved in its own unique way, but not enough is known to know if it came to be a separate language. While we now little about it, we know that by 386 Augustine of Hippo, who was native to the region, complains in his work how his pronunciation is criticized by his peers from Italy, and how he founds faults with theirs. Though, was the language spoken in North Africa at that point different enough to be already considered a separate language is unknown. Other people such as Publius Consentius and saint Jerome also mention the differences. There are also some inscriptions thought to be written in the North African dialect. Another possible remnant of this dialect/language remain in different Berber languages and Maghrebi Arabic as loan words, though not all words of romance origin are thought to be descendant from the North African dialect/language.  If you're interested in the topic, I would suggest 2007 book from J N Adams titled "The Regional Diversification of Latin 200bc - 600ad".	1643112653.0	hu56mas	t3_sc1z9k	t3_sc1z9k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc1z9k/did_north_africa_have_romance_languages_before/hu56mas/

l2cpa	In modern Berlin and actually most of Germany the most popular is Pilsn style lager. This style was invented 1842. Lager beer in general need an cool environment to be brewed so without cooling machines nearly every beer in the past would have been an ale.  Also the usage of hops was only taking over from the 16th century. So you might have still some brewers using Hyoscyamus, heather mugwort or other herbs to spice the beer.  Thirdly, weaker beers were more common.  A beer from the 17th century that still exist is Berliner Weissbier, which is a wheat based beer.	1643139156.0	hu6yaaj	t3_sbxxac	t3_sbxxac	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbxxac/im_a_burgher_in_17th_century_berlin_how_is_the/hu6yaaj/
7s4rt2oe	As stated by another commenter, the Germans relied on their machine guns for most of their tactics. However, the US combined their semi auto small arms with combined arms to create breakthroughs. They would combine aggressive infantry movement with tanks and ariel support. Their tactics emphasize quick movement while also covering their flanks. Wars past the late 1800s relied more on support equipment than just small arms to win engagements. While the m1 garand proved to have a one up in one on one engagements, overall tactics were very much controlled by tanks, artillery, and planes. US once again had this advantage being industrial and able to out produce others. The US overall goal was to overwhelm with firepower, which all weapons from the M1 to the tank contributed.	1643139921.0	hu70c65	t3_scdgx5	t1_hu6up9d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scdgx5/did_the_use_of_the_m1_garand_as_a_primary_issue/hu70c65/

rjrxq	The short answer is that there is no generally agreed upon line between Ancient and Classical China because those terms aren't commonly used in Chinese historiography. This doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't use that framework in teaching- it just means you'll have to do a little thinking about what purpose the Ancient/Classical distinction is intended to serve, and what element(s) of Chinese history you want to highlight.   The longer answer is that there is really no standard periodization at all outside of dynasties and reign eras, so even China scholars tend to come up with their own for each work as necessary. Some periodizations focus on political shifts (like the Qin conquest), some focus on cultural milestones (like the rise of the Hundred Schools of Thought), some focus on religious changes (like the arrival of Buddhism or the emergence of Daoist religion). Some mark the end of "early" or "ancient" China as early as the Spring and Autumn Period (c. 8th-5th centuries BC, contemporary with Archaic Greece) and some mark it as late as the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (141-87 BC, contemporary with Marius and Sulla).  I'd be happy to make some recommendations if you can tell me a little bit more about what you'll be teaching and how in depth you'll be able to get with your students.	1643141413.0	hu74cfi	t3_scfls1	t3_scfls1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scfls1/whats_the_actual_difference_between_ancient_and/hu74cfi/

12z7lv	Greetings  So ... Germany. Or better Europe. Some examples necessary for the later development:  - Jews has been part of the European religious scene for many centuries. This religious scene was heavily evolving over the course of history, dividing in many different subfactions which often were hostile against each other and/or used as a reason for violent action.   - Combine that with European history which had many smaller and larger skirmishes, conflicts and wars (basically there was always a minor conflict somewhere in Europe) and suddenly pointing the finger on a group and call them *"The Enemy"* becomes standard. Because people want an explanation why there is conflict, whey they are loosing, why they are poor, whey they have lost children in war etc. And pointing at *The Enemy* is a far more convenient explanation than looking at a mirror.  - As more and more Europeans converted to the Christian religion the religious question "who killed Jesus Christ" came up. And again pointing the finger to the Jews and saying "The Jews killed Jesus Christ, our saviour" is something very easy and convenient to say.   - Some regions barred Christians from money businesses. These were performed by outcasts, whose religious interpretation did not forbid it. In some regions these were Jews. Money lending / transaction businesses however were never beloved in the public eye. *"I am poor (because my religious interpretation forbids me from making money) and that Jew over there is filthy rich (because his religious interpretation allows him to make money), so The Jew is guilty of my problems"* becomes something very easy to say.   - The plague (*The Black Death*) was attributed to "dirty Jews".  - Jews were considered to have black / evil / unholy magic, forbidden by Christian religion.  You could list dozens, hundreds of other examples throughout European history, but the examples above show how easy and often *The Jew* had become *The Enemy* in the eyes of the European politicians, clergy and common people. Over the course of centuries it lead to pogroms, religions murder, discrimination by law, telltales and prejudices ("the Jewish nose, they steal money ...") and this unfortunately becomes so ingrained into the culture that even if there were no discrimination performed by the government, the population became used to discriminate against Jews ... because ... well, because it was always *The Jew"*. /shakesfist  Fast forward to 1918 and the end of World War One. The first hyperindustrialized war with a death toll previously unseen. Untold millions dead in the trenches of *Niemandsland*, machine gun nests, bomber aircraft, chemical weapons and an European society having to bury an entire generation of teenagers, after they had sent them so happily to the trenches. WW1 had of course one official reason (the assassination of Prince Ferdinand with the invasion started by Germany). But at that time the entire political situation in Europe was a powder keg waiting to explode, as it was a time of hyper nationalism for many European countries. *"My country is the best and the rest is a rotten apple"*. When Germany invaded France 1914  they put signs on the troop transports stating *"See you in 2 hours in Paris"*. A few years later Europe was in ruins. And now we go back to the blame game.  - After the war extremist parties received a lot of influence and new members, one of them what would later become the NSDAP, the Nazi party.   - The basic building block of European and German right-wing extremists was the *Dolchstoßlegende* ("Stab-in-the-back myth"), where Germany was never actually defeated in WW1 on the honourable field of battle, but was betrayed from the inside, from the civilian population ... from *The Jew*. Again, it was extremely convenient to point the finger at an external enemy.  - With the Black Friday and the collapse of the world economy Germany of course was heavily affected. I still have an old *Reichsmark*  here, stating that this was worth (and I kid you not) *201 billion Mark*. Which could purchase you a leaf of bread. And of course it was *The Jew* as a banker who was found guilty in the eyes of the right wing extremists.  - In 1933 Adolf Hitler became the new chancellor, and transformed Germany and other regions into a dictatorship. The core philosophy was of course the *"Herrenrasse"*, the superiority of the white men, compared to the subhumans ... like *The Jew*. Entire pseudo-scientific literature was written to attempt to convince that *The Jew* was not a proper human being. Case example: you could measure his nose and tell that this was a Jewish nose. Then you measured the nose of a criminal (hopefully a murder and rapist) and you found out that in 99% of these cases the noses had the same measurements.   - Of course Germany itself had no free press any more, the entire school education was transformed into a propaganda tool, the cultural scene, from movies to books, was politically radicalized, political enemies and "traitors" were in prison or murdered and in the end the German government and Nazi party were successful into making *The Jew* the scapegoat for everything which went wrong in the world since Jesus Christ. 2000 years of pogroms, discrimination, murder and scapegoating ended in the Auschwitz concentration camp.  And the Germans were fine with that.   Because *The Jew* has became *The Enemy*. We even invented a word for that: *Judensau*, roughly translated to "Jewish Pig". We even made movies about that like *"The Eternal Jew"* from the 1940s.  **TLDR**: European historic development made the Jews the perfect scapegoat for the Nazi propaganda. When Nazis came to power the population was actually pretty ok with it.

w3dgz	The Munich conference was a massive miscalculation by Chamberlain and the European allies. Not only did it embolden Hitler, but it took away a key ally against Germany. Czechoslovakia was actually a very well trained and armed military at this moment all while possessing formidable defensive positions along their western border with Germany (Hitler later commented that after taking over this portion of Czechoslovakia and viewing the defensive fortifications, a German invasion would have been pushed back).  From their own diaries, German generals were colluding to overthrow Hitler and even went as far to inform the British and French delegation that if they were to remain firm and not give in to Hitler, they would stage a coup and overthrow Hitler. The overwhelming majority of people including the German generals did not favor another world war. The concession of Czechoslovakia further emboldened Hitler - this at the same time took away an reasoning the German generals could give for overthrowing Hitler as he scored a major victory for Germany while "maintaining peace".  As a side note, one of the most glaring faults and miscalculations by the allied powers was Mein Kampf offers a detailed blueprint for Hitler's exact motives. The reign of the Third Reich was all exhaustibly foreshadowed in his now over decade old manifesto.	1643144414.0	hu7cdrz	t3_scipvu	t3_scipvu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scipvu/the_new_film_munich_the_edge_of_war_argues_that/hu7cdrz/
omyb7	While there is zero evidence, there's no denial or confirmation from the US government agencies as of today. The linked post does a pretty good job at exploring it from an acedemic side but there's still a personal side to this question.  In Tule Lake, you had the ["No - No" boys](https://encyclopedia.densho.org/No-no_boys/) who would not sign a loyalty oath and there were draft resisters. Once again, there was no evidence that any of these guys were disloyal, just very upset at the circumstances the were placed in and being insulted by being asked to take a loyalty oath.  The rest of the camps were quiet and there was little, if any, resistance. That is a direct result of having the barbed wire, guard towers with guns pointed inward and a deep sense of shame. Both first and second generations who were old enough to know what was happening, were absolutely humiliated at being segregated and stripped of all rights.   Having my father born in a camp and the rest of my family in the camps has given me an insight on this that is quickly dying out due to the age of the internees. There are a large number of books written by internees as well as from their perspective. There are a few books from the 1940s that are blatant propaganda on the part of the US government that is a very good insight into the different types of psychology used against Japan (dehuminzation) versus Italy and Germany.	1643144965.0	hu7duuq	t3_scjoen	t3_scjoen	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scjoen/did_japanese_internment_camps_actually_find_any/hu7duuq/

Black music labels and black acts have always had to in a sense “white wash” themselves to appeal to the mainstream. Combine that with the fact that early classic rock n roll acts had to limit their excitability to appeal to the mainstream, its safe to say that US society effectively suppressed black music and rock n roll music in general.    It’s speculation but I believe if the world had a better understanding of race relations during this time, there would have been more black artists in radio circulation, larger white acts would have been able to include more black musicians in their collaborative work, labels would be able to sell more black music etc.	1643144999.0	hu7dy2a	t3_scn87b	t3_scn87b	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scn87b/if_america_desegregated_earlier_would_america_be/hu7dy2a/

ilgin	I just had a course about this in university. I have to say that this was a course about ancient Rome and Byzantium, therefore christianity was the more central religion in this course. Focus was therefore also on the old Graeco-Roman polytheistic religions. The era was from 2nd century AD to about the 8th century AD.  There are several reasons why religion shifted from polytheism to monotheism. Firstly is that polytheistic religon was a lot less inclusive than christianity. Many polytheistic cults were only available to free male citizens. Christianity was open to everybody, including slaves and women.    Secondly was that Christianity was anchored in older ideas. This drew in a lot of people who liked this as an idea. This meant that there was an immediate overall idea of a unified Christianity. There were many different ideas inspired by ancient religions, philosophy, astrology etc. This diverse thinking fit in with ancient thinking about religion, but it also meant that Christianity was anchored in recognisable ideas to people of that time.   Thirdly, Christianity was very big on charity which also drew in a lot of people. From the poor to the elite.  Fourthly, Christianity offered eternal salvation to everybody. This was not the case in all polytheistic cults.   These are a few points about Christianity within the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. I am not well versed enough to talk about Islam or Judaism. So i hope someone else can assist me on this point.   For further reading I would reccomend Stephen Mitchell, A History of the Later Roman Empire AD 284–641; Alan Bowman, Averil Cameron, and Peter Garnsey (eds.), The Cambridge Ancient History 12. The Crisis of Empire, AD 193-337; Averil Cameron, ‘The Cost of Orthodoxy’, Church History and Religious Culture 93.	1643146964.0	hu7j5yj	t3_scnx5n	t3_scnx5n	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scnx5n/what_is_the_reason_religion_shifted_from_mostly/hu7j5yj/

ilgin	Very much true. Christianity and Islam did not acknowledge polytheistic religions cause there was one god. There could not be other gods. Polytheistic religons did not see a problem with multiple gods. They even had fused gods like Hercules Magusanus of the Batavians. Christianity and Islam were more focussed on converting which was not as important for polytheistic religons.	1643148095.0	hu7m0s7	t3_scnx5n	t1_hu7l8df	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scnx5n/what_is_the_reason_religion_shifted_from_mostly/hu7m0s7/
s3pcqe	No. No, no and again no.  This was the final thing throwing me off the movie, unfortunately it was too late,. I had to watch it to the end.  Germany wasn't ready ti deal with France and Britain on 1938. Almost a year later, they where better mobilized, with more panzers (many many more Chechozlovakian tanks from the Skoda factories) and far more infantry divisions. Also the Mol-Rib pact wasn't on the table on 1938. In September 1939 it was.  On the other hand, Britain and France didn't do (almost) anything to prepare for a war. They rested on the promise of Hitler that Munich concessions would be that last thing before ... eternal peace.  And even then, people argue that should the allies committed to an all out attack during the invasion of Poland, Germany would have had collapsed. Imagine if they did it in 1938 when they where even more under armed.  Even the movie says so. It contradicts itself. The Wehrmact generals were ready for a coup "because they didn't believe they had a chance to win a war with France and Britain while dealing with Chechoslovakia".  The only reason the movie supports and ends with this, is to a) give meaning to the protagonists's actions and risks, and b) to make Chamberlain's decision sympathetic, to make it seen as a smart move, instead of a weak one, of a terrible miscalculation, which it was.	1643148409.0	hu7msnh	t3_s9fm6k	t3_s9fm6k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9fm6k/the_movie_munich_edge_of_war_asserts_that_the/hu7msnh/
8xrkkmvu	To this excellent answer, I would add that that eighteenth century Scotland was not so restrained as nineteenth century Scotland, particularly in private, all-male, or elite contexts:  For example, Anstruther was home to the ‘Beggar’s Benison’ a club which celebrated sexuality and existed from 1732 to 1836. The members were merchants, doctors, and gentry drawn from the local elite. Meetings featured readings from prurient literature, talks on human and animal sexuality, ribald toasts/songs/jokes, and the exhibition of nude young women. The club also owned a collection of pornography and various sexual artifacts, such as a wig said to be made from the pubic hair of Charles II’s mistresses. The club is also believed to have engaged in rituals of group masturbation, either at every meeting or to induct new members.   The club spawned a number of similar clubs in Scotland and elsewhere, but was wound down in the face of changing Victorian attitudes towards sexuality.  For those curious, see:   * Stevenson, David. The Beggar's Benison: Sex Clubs of Enlightenment Scotland and Their Rituals.

c2wdvjuh	There's not **one** single reason that encompasses all names for countries. Often names of countries come are based on the first time people heard of a place, and that name became ingrained in the language. My focus area is Japan, so I'll use this as an example. In Japanese, the name of the country is "Nippon" or "Nihon", but the first name Europeans heard was the Chinese name for Japan, which is the Chinese reading of the characters. A common transliteration of the Chinese name for Japan is "Zipangu", which sounded like "Japan" to the Europeans. So the name was adopted and stuck, even after they managed to establish contact with the Japanese.  Not every place name will have the same etymology as that. There are countless reasons for why various countries got stuck with various names.	1643150151.0	hu7r316	t3_sclx0u	t3_sclx0u	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sclx0u/is_there_a_historical_reason_we_dont_all_refer_to/hu7r316/

152vfu	>From their own diaries, German generals      I don't think those can be taken seriously as sources.  After the war, German generals led by Halder started the process of distancing themselves from Nazis.   The "Generals' Memorandum", also co-authored by von Manstein and von Brauchitsch, aimed to portray the Wehrmacht as a clean, professional army which did not commit atrocities against Jews, Russian prisoners of war.  As to who did, well, it was all something of a mystery.  Part of that myth-making was that they could have won the war, or at least lost it better, had their advice been taken; but unfortunately they were over-ridden by Hitler.  The archetype of this is Halder's Hitler als Feldherr, but you hardly have to look widely to find former Nazi generals posing as liberals who were entirely opposed to all those bad things they didn't know anything about.  No-one takes this seriously any more.  Wehrmacht commanders were party to the full range of atrocities, and their post-war memoirs are self-serving lies designed to salve their consciences, burnish their reputations and in many cases keep them out of prison.     So if you have memoirs which claim "German generals were colluding to overthrow Hitler" then without massive corroboration from sources who are not other German generals, or actual concrete proof of acts to further such an objective, they are just not credible.	1643152081.0	hu7w047	t3_scipvu	t1_hu7cdrz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scipvu/the_new_film_munich_the_edge_of_war_argues_that/hu7w047/

hotgwmq5	Jesus was a victim of voice to skull technology (v2k on the boards) and a "targeted individual" who was "gangstalked". The phenomenon has occurred in humans ever since and is becoming more and more prevalent as the years go on. Every day, new people are coming online, going to the police, and reporting use of the alien's voice to skull technology to trick people as part of a manipulation strategy to control human beings. Jesus was a human icon we were willing to accept and follow when we would not directly worship the extra terrestrial aliens that were controlling and influencing Jesus. To this day human beings would still never worship a being from another world, especially when it is responsible for their own punishment, but they are comfortable with worshiping a human being that was controlled by a being from another world. Would we take orders on how to live from aliens? Nope, but we will from Jesus since he's human. Faith in Jesus is dramatically on the decline for a good reason- truth and knowledge of what Jesus was and what happened to him.	1643153033.0	hu7ydxy	t3_r6z2pp	t3_r6z2pp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/r6z2pp/what_do_we_actually_know_about_the_real_beliefs/hu7ydxy/
u4rak	But this highlights exactly why Chamberlain made the decisions he did, the French didn't want to go to war to protect the borders of the Czechs and neither did the British public. Chamberlain died in 1940 I think, so any criticism of his actions had no one to push back against them. At the conference he used Hitler's speeches proclaiming he wanted peace to craft an agreement, and insisted that Hitler agree to his own words.   The other thing to keep in mind is that Hitler was furious with Chamberlain and up until the end of his life and bitterly complained about how he had been outmaneuvered. Hitler kept insisting that if Chamberlain had not gotten the agreement and the war began in 1938, then Germany would have been winning.	1643153166.0	hu7ypyy	t3_scipvu	t1_hu7wddy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scipvu/the_new_film_munich_the_edge_of_war_argues_that/hu7ypyy/

And they made deals with firms across europe and smuggled raw material from different countries. During the years of development, they fooled the US by saying they were establishing nuclear powerplants for civilian purposes but threatened India that they already had nuclear arsenal. This way, they avoided sanctions as well as avoided a full blown war with india. Finally, they did their nuclear tests in 1998.

8b5lp4nf	It wasn't the bows specifically. Mongols succeeded in arid (either hot or cold) areas of the steppe and dessert. If you look at the map of their empire, it's huge but mostly empty. It's easy to take over much land if there aren't too many people and you have an advantage with guiding horses over familiar type of land. Once the Mongols hit wetter climates with higher populations, their advantage ceased to be an advantage. Population matters because most societies at that time had developed specialization - some people were traders, some warriors, some priests, some artisans, farmers, etc. Mongols didn't specialize - everyone was a warrior. 1000 Mongol warriors go up against 500 warriors from a small Afghani kingdom, Mongols win. 1000 Mongol warriors go up against a Deccan king with 5000 warriors, Mongols lose badly.   I'd also argue that central Asian nomads didn't necessarily conquer parts of India. They moved in, but the main areas were also the same type of arid steppe that the Mongols could navigate - areas that are now Afghanistan, Pakistan Gujarat, Rajasthan, and a few regions that were not arid like Punjab and Kashmir. Original Aryans, Scythians, etc. were all pushed by population pressures into the subcontinent in areas less suited to large populations. It's why the central Asian DNA exists more in northwestern South Asians than in other regions. Sure, there was violent conflict that arose between the central Asians and native South Asians, but they couldn't wipe out the entire population like they had when the Aryans moved into Europe. Eventually, they assimilated while also providing new ideas.   Babur won in India because Indians were using primitive weapons and Babur had guns. Also, each princely state was its own polity. Very easy for a unified army to take over a small kingdom, then move onto the next. Politics matter. A raja without much of an army or territory doesn't care if his Maharaja is Babur or some other guy, nothing much changes for him - he still has to pay tribute to someone. Maybe he supports Babur because Babur offers to exact less tribute than the current Maharaja.	1643153353.0	hu7z6lo	t3_sci49f	t3_sci49f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sci49f/among_other_reasons_the_mongols_did_not_press/hu7z6lo/

While he may have had some influence on racist politics, it would be a mistake to call him *the* inspiration on either. Racist politics were well-developed in America long before Ford started to publish the Dearborn Independent. He began that in 1919, while the trial of Leo Frank was in 1913 and the Second Klan was founded in 1915. Hitler similarly had a bevy of influences, among which Ford can only be ranked as a minor one. [Antisemitism was well established in Germany already.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hpyg1t/what_were_the_main_reasons_that_antisemitism/)  Now, these things I've mentioned (Leo Frank, the Second Klan, and German anti-semitism before Hitler took over) are already barely ever spoken of in historical curricula.

c1kaq	This doesn’t fully answer your question, but the venerable Cecil Adams of the now-defunct Straight Dope once wrote a column on merkins, which tangentially discusses why being Barbie-smooth may have been out of fashion at the time. https://www.straightdope.com/21341912/what-is-a-merkin  Excerpt: > They used to shave off all the pubic hair as a cure for syphillis, so the well-to-do used wigs.  > Before penicillin was around to ease the lives of the promiscuous, these were used to cover up any sores prostitutes may have obtained in the line of duty.  > They used to treat the syphilitic with mercury, which caused baldness.  > The merkin is for women with no pubic hair. Some people just don’t develop hair down there, and this can be embarrassing.  > In days of old a common problem was lice. One of the ways people dealt with this was to shave all the hair off their bodies, including arms, legs, and pubes. Wigs became very popular. Pubic wigs caught on slowly, starting among the kinkier set, but eventually became halfway respectable.  Unfortunately he never arrives at a definitive answer:  > Erudite answers from around the globe, and not one of them duplicates another. Also, one is still left with a nagging question: who’s a merkin supposed to fool? By the time you get to the level of intimacy where somebody is going to see whether you have pubic hair or not, your range of observation, as we might say, is such that a wig is not going to make for a very convincing masquerade.  At least his prose is as always entertaining.	1643163529.0	hu8njid	t3_sch20f	t1_hu7bcu9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sch20f/how_was_robbie_burns_nae_hair_ont_received_by_his/hu8njid/

That's when I went to live with my dad and step-mom. They were non smokers, as were all her friends. After a few months I visited my mom and nearly gagged when I went into her house.  It was overwhelming. I was amazed that I didn't notice it before, but I think it was because it's all I knew.

The military planned to do a coup if Hitler went to war with Britain and France over the Sudetenland/Czechoslovakia. The Munich Conference was an utter disaster geopolitically and the only point in which WWII could have been prevented and Hitler neutered.   The readiness and mobilization of France and Britain doesn’t matter at all if you consider this critical event, although even only France was still able to fight Germany in 1936. At this stage Germany was still in the process of rearmament so wouldn’t even have been able to fight France yet who had a decent enough army compred to Germany’s in 38. Czech guns and industry especially helped Hitler in the war effort significantly. That movie just seems like an attempt to rehabilitate a terrible political decision and appeasement.	1643175657.0	hu9d5tp	t3_scipvu	t3_scipvu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scipvu/the_new_film_munich_the_edge_of_war_argues_that/hu9d5tp/
p61tb	u/hillsonghoods has posted an excellent Mod note on how you could amend this question, but I wanted to make an attempt at answering it as you've asked it. I would suggest reading their post before mine, as I won't be specifically addressing curriculum concerns based on jurisdiction or the time constraints of teachers.  ==  It's an interesting question, and one that should be looked at through the lens of *why* you were learning about him.   I want to give the disclaimer that many people in that particular point in history (as it is with many outdated beliefs, in any period of time) may have had racist or anti-Semitic beliefs, they might have championed the teachings of eugenics, and held a number of strong beliefs about many things that today, generally as a society, we take for granted as being wrong/debunked/out of favour for whatever reason. While it may be surprising to you, when you first learn about it, it's a thing. It's not a hidden thing. These things have been known since they were the present. I suppose, to some degree, what changes is how we feel about them, be it individually or collectively. Perhaps that's what you're dealing with at present.  Nonetheless, to the query at hand!  Were you learning about Henry Ford, the man, and the scope of his life? If so, then his business in media *should've* been mentioned, as well as his anti-Semitic leaning.  Or were you learning about Henry Ford, the business man, and his contributions to the evolution of the assembly line, and the impact he had on the automotive industry in America? If so, then that particular set of beliefs he held isn't really fodder for this topic/focus.  Or were you learning about prominent American leaders, businessmen and people of influence in the first half of the 20th Century in America, and their contribution to a resurgence of growing antisemitic sentiment in society? By the sound of it, this is not what you were looking at.  Answering that question should give you an idea of why you might not have focused on, say, *The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem.*   ==  What it boils down to is what the focus of the unit you were doing was, with regards to Henry Ford coming up as a person of interest.  If you were in a high school History class, you were more than likely focusing on American business and economic growth in the teens and the 1920s, of which Henry Ford's contribution was not small. That being the topic, his efforts in that regard would be the focus. You might be more specifically focusing on changes to working life, and changes to how manufacturing increased production, and subsequently, consumption. The aforementioned material would then fall into the scope of such a unit.  Ford's anti-Semitic beliefs would not. It would be out of place to bring them up here, regardless of them being concurrent to some of these events.  If a unit had come along about regarding rising antisemitism in North America during the 20s and 30s, and the different places in society where it gained traction, and Henry Ford's contribution is suspiciously absent, then your question gains a lot more traction with regards to "why \[you\] haven't learned about this".  ==  The last thing I want to touch on is our propensity to mythologize prominent people in our societies, especially when they are a prime figure towards a large contribution to where we are today. This is doubly true when we first learn about such figures. It's easy to glorify someone who we consider great in some sphere, and we have a nasty habit of forgetting that such people are not paragons of virtue, nor has there ever been a promise that they should be, despite the fact that they might have had a brilliant idea in some discipline, be it business, or science, warfare, medicine, law, education, construction and engineering, whatever.  These are the types of people, as you've said, we like to call heroes. And it's a difficult thing to kill one's heroes (or the image of them as a hero) by pointing out their flaws, remembering that they're human, they're flawed, and they might have done things that aren't worth glorifying. Some people might argue that by doing so, we lose figures to aspire to.   In your case, it's proven to be an issue. But it seems to be one you want to better understand. And that's always a good thing.	1643176863.0	hu9f7r6	t3_scsa5l	t3_scsa5l	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scsa5l/why_do_we_not_learn_about_henry_fords/hu9f7r6/

l9lys	American History is heavily whitewashed in schools and the Ford Motor Company has gone to great efforts to control the PR narrative of their founder. As you can see in [the Ford Motor Company official biography](https://corporate.ford.com/articles/history/henry-ford-biography.html) of him, the [Henry Ford Museum biography](https://www.thehenryford.org/history-and-mission/henry-ford-collector/) of him (which also highlights how sue happy he was against people who said anything bad about him), there is absolutely no hint of his white supremacist/anti-semitism past. Henry Ford is put on a pedestal of American ingenuity and industrialism, so it's easy to use him as propaganda to present a certain image of American history; which is sadly pretty common among a lot of historical figures.

That is, they briefly learn about his most important contributions to manufacturing, but never learn much about the man himself. IMO this is fine for middle school social studies.

de8e1	Alexander couldn't have read from Daniel, because it wasn't written until around 167 BCE, almost two centuries after his death. Historians are more or less unanimously in agreement that Daniel was written around this time because of various events it describes.     Much of Daniel describes the events of the rule of Seleucid Emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes, including his invasions of Egypt in 169 and 167 BCE. The end of this section describes Antiochus' invading Egypt a third time before dying in Judea. However, he did not in fact invade Egypt a third time, and he did not die in Judea, he died in Persia or Babylon in 164 BCE. Because Daniel gets Antiochus' death wrong, but correctly describes events up to 167 BCE, it had to have been written between 167 and 164 BCE.	1643192143.0	hu9zonl	t3_scuc32	t3_scuc32	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scuc32/did_alexander_the_great_really_visit_jerusalem/hu9zonl/

5ay45	We can extend the question to the whole idea of progress and "stages" of societies. This would be more a question for r/AskAnthropology though.     I can chime in and say that yes, it is indeed wrong and oversimplified, but to some degree inevitable given the paradigm of 4X and strategy games.      To answer your question is sufficient to say that yes, spatially contiguous populations eventually "lost" technologies, like the famous example of building techniques and materials the Romans employed. Or the abandoning of  farming to revent to foraging in the British Isles in prehistoric times that for sure implied a loss of know-how about farming techniques.  To elaborate better on the question though, we should expand the field of view. Game design and a kind of old-fashioned, reductionist, idealist vision of history and humankind go well together. Why? Because both don't want to deal with complexity. History, Anthropology and other sciences in the last century decided that their models and narratives were too simplified to properly explain many phenomena and started renouncing linearity and reduction to incorporate more and more complex explanations. A linear progress of history is simple, reassuring and easier to deal with, both for game designers and academics.   While we can say the Academia is in a mature stage of "cleanup" from these simplified views that are now labeled as outdated, the videogames industry didn't need to update itself mostly because the perception of the general population of such phenomena is still the same as before. School textbooks are part of the problem: simplicity is good to teach kids and the idea that civilizations, states, technologies and so on are neat, well-delimited, stable concepts you can use to describe the past is helpful for teachs and students. But it loses a LOT of information.   What you ask here is if the amount of information lost in this simplified model is a problem or not. Like the saying goes: "every model is wrong, but some are useful". To really answer that question, you should ask yourself, "useful to what?".	1643196532.0	hua5dus	t3_sd0f30	t3_sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hua5dus/

5ay45	So, I would say one book that deal with this and criticizes mostly Anthropologists but also Historians is The Dawn of Everything by Graeber and Wengrow. This critique is not original to them and it's quite established for both fields so for sure somebody will be able to find better references that go deeper on the methodological and theoretical part.  For the part about modeling, I guess any Epistemology entry-level book would speak about the nature and trade-offs of models and the way they represent reality.	1643198818.0	hua8rmu	t3_sd0f30	t1_hua7qan	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hua8rmu/
w6nno	Video games also have the problem that they are games. It seems obvious, but games do not set out to portray reality, but to create entertainment value. Why games are entertaining is obviously complicated and even dependent on each individual, but I assume design is often based on reducting complicated phenomenon into systems that follow some sort of predictable rules.	1643200228.0	huab2ch	t3_sd0f30	t1_hua5dus	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huab2ch/
n9mzv	This is the answer.   I'm really not sure what sort of answer an historian might give, but smoking was still normal in my youth and allowed in many places the youth of today would probably be shocked by.   It was fairly pervasive, and while smoke eaters did exist in places planning for significant tobacco consumption it wasn't as though they were 100% effective.

5ay45	yes and no. Now I speak as a programmer and a (very) amateur gamedev. Here I believe you're mixing up two different tradeoffs: one is between direct and mediated representation, that is shared with any art form. How much you want to translate your experience and understanding of reality into the artistic artifact vs how much you want to mediate it through, for example, the need to keep the game fun (or convey a political message, imagine an alternative reality and so on and so forth).  Another, separate, tradeoff specific to videogames is between predictability vs generative. Civilization, for instance, is not predictable because it has composable elements that can lead to generative gameplay not foreseen by the devs. Like the infamous nuclear Gandhi from Civ 2(3? 4?) vs Stone Age Americans.  Fidelity to History moves on both axis (and possibly many others). A big difference is made by the understanding of fidelity throughout different games. Civilization doesn't care to have high fidelity because it doesn't have a historical setting at all. It's just freely reinterpreting concepts from (old-fashioned) anthropology and history to create made up scenarios.  EU4, for instance, aims to a slighlty higher degree of fidelity: the map and the starting condition try to portray historical reality and so do the dynamics of the game (very debatable if they do it well but that's not the point).  Other games aim much higher: basically any RPG, Adventure or FPS game with a strictly historical setting enters a space where what is represented on the screen influences how you portray the historical reality of the time and the facts that happened. It's unreasonable to do so with Civilization, it's stupid to do it with EU4 but it's much easier if we are talking about stuff like the new Expeditions: Rome or stuff like CoD4, Hell Let Loose, Patrician IV and so on. With these games it is more interesting to reason about representation while with strategy games that just want to portray single concepts extracted from their concepts (such as the nature of technology throughout time), it's a bit of a sterile exercise. Nonetheless it is dangerous in the sense that people inform their view of the past and present based on the game design choices and designers are responsible as much as a film director is responsible for romanticizing or misrepresenting the past in a movie.	1643201815.0	huadw6s	t3_sd0f30	t1_huab2ch	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huadw6s/
15rl1q	Definitely not, for example we know of some building techniques, but at the same time we try to guess how they did others, we have no idea how exactly they built the pyramids for example, later we "forgot" how to do Roman concrete, we have no idea how was Brunelleschi's dome was built (recent studies have seen the structure for the first time thru a small crack in the outer structure, but still we have several questions about it), so as a whole, we have forgotten many advances and construction techniques. The Antikythera mechanism is another example, it was a "computer" that the most recent theory suggests it calculated astronomical positions, and untill this past century we had nothing as advanced as it, so definitely we didn't keep all the knowledge our ancestors had.	1643202627.0	huafelh	t3_sd0f30	t3_sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huafelh/

At the end of the day it is simply a video game so there's maybe no reason to complain this much but something that I really hate about it is how eventually you will be forced to adopt either "democracy, fascism or communism" as if it were inevitable that they exist and that they are the only choice	1643203017.0	huag5iz	t3_sd0f30	t1_hu9yps4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huag5iz/

If what’s bumming you out is that the forward progress enjoyed by liberal democracies since 1945 appears to have partly stalled, or that the American unipolar world (only a few decades old) is ceding to some multipolar configuration, then take comfort that no one can possibly predict what comes next. Historical understanding can however help us make better decisions, build more resilient policies and regulatory structures, and resist efforts by our opponents to degrade what we have. That’s a comfort for many, although humans are so diverse that there will always be opposition to any set of norms and any meaning will always create difference (and hence inequality). There is no utopia but can you name a time and place that was better for most members of our species?

1lwpqk	I would  try to answer as my best:  There's knowledge that can be lost because the information was known by a few members of a society that dissapears without passing the knowledge (like the Greek fire IRC, and a lot of indigenous popular knowledge).     From my anthropologist POV, knowledge needs to be stored (in humans, written, etc.) transmitted and applied: you could have the technology to understand phyiscs and nuclear fision, but you need also a society that can expend, train and be able to sustain nuclear plants and all the processes related to gather the resources, build and run the plant, store the waste and so.   This kind of POV is related to ecological economics and cultural ecology, where the energy that a society is capable to extract from an environment is the key for a population to use and preserve technology and knowledge. Another schoolar field related is the collapsology, with authors like Tainter.	1643204382.0	huaiwh3	t3_sd0f30	t3_sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huaiwh3/

The thing is, any idea or scientific discovery is a puzzle piece in a larger puzzle of where that science is at the moment as well as where society in general is at the moment and what it has need of, so while things don't get forgotten per se they do spend decades collecting dust on shelves.

for0hho1	Perhaps when there is a change in population and lack of cultural continuity, there can be a loss of knowledge such that the prior culture's technologies are not recognized as such and considered to be natural or supernatural rather than human in origin.    I'm thinking here of the "giants' work" (*enta geweorc*) mentioned the Old English corpus which (at least back when I was a student) were considered to be references to Roman ruins. The Anglo-Saxons were surrounded by the relics of Roman Britain. But having learned nothing from the Roman-British, they simply had no idea how to build anything like that and thought the ruins were not of human make at all. "Giants must have built this!" Or so one line of reasoning goes. Here they would differ from your sixth-century Italians who are credited with greater knowledge of the Roman past.    Of course this could very well be entirely poetic, with the Anglo-Saxons knowing full well that the Romans were people just like them but with different capabilities and interests. Just because Bernard of Chartres supposedly said that scholars of his day were like dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants does not mean he thought people were taller in the past. Likewise perhaps we should give the Anglo-Saxons more credit.	1643205583.0	hualhdh	t3_sd0f30	t1_huagn8y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hualhdh/

n31yn	Peruvian/Andean Incan society suffered quite badly from this, but more as a direct result of colonization by the invading Spanish armies. The first Spanish Catholic cross arrived in South America and eventually Peru in the 1630’s. With an invasion force of only a few hundred men, horses and weapons, the Spanish subdued the government centers and population of the Incan empire, estimated to be at least 10-13 million people. Through deceit, deception, betrayal and outright dehumanization, the Spanish cut the head off of the culmination of a thousand years of Incan and pre-Incan architecture, engineering, mathematics and religious progress. Their engineering methods were so precise that a piece of paper cannot be inserted into the joints of multi-ton stone walls. These trapezoidal structures/techniques have survived at least three documented >7.0 magnitude earthquakes *and haven’t moved an inch*. They had leveling systems, complex transport and probably built intricately detailed scale models of their structures as blueprints for their most sacred temples and buildings that the ruling class occupied. The buildings and ruins of the Inca are still there today, built on top of and lived in. When the Spanish invaded and installed the church and it’s architecture as government (or even used the gold/stone from the Incan sacred temples for their new buildings) , they effectively destroyed the entire ruling class of Incan society, and as these people were the only ones of their civilization with knowledge of their engineering and communication systems, the knowledge was lost forever and immediately. Today we can only speculate on such facts based on limited evidence and context, if at all.	1643206973.0	huaolsu	t3_sd0f30	t1_hualhdh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huaolsu/

Henry Ford is almost always, to my knowledge, discussed during the industrial revolution in a high school classroom and is basically broken down to "mass implemented assembly lines" and you move on from there. Unfortunately, the way most states have their history curriculum broken down, or at least in my state, high school American history has to cover reconstruction to as close to modern-day as they can get, and even then, most classes never make it past Vietnam and that's if they are lucky. It's impossible to spend as much time as is really necessary on every topic to give students a complete understanding of the era being discussed, not only because of time constraints, but other factors like the fact that students usually care about a few specific history topics, if any, and the industrial revolution is not a popular one among them. I like to mention horrible things like that in class about historical figures, especially presidents because it re-engages students but TL;DR, it just isn't the most important thing to mention when you have so much to cover in a comparatively short amount of time.	1643208498.0	huas77r	t3_scsa5l	t3_scsa5l	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scsa5l/why_do_we_not_learn_about_henry_fords/huas77r/

Likely reasons being that the ore only naturally occurred in very select places. Those locations may have been lost or become inaccessible or were otherwise exhausted. There's also evidence that trade route disruption and suppression of the industry by various colonial powers may have had a role.     You can find "Damascus" steel knives now.

From what I can tell when Spanish explorers came to the Americas they had expected to be landing in asia and therefore expected to find hemp and other plants associated with Asia, so when they landed and saw plants that *looked* like hemp they thought, "oh this must be hemp since we're in Asia". Adding to confusion there are also fiber plants in the Americas that the native Americans grew that had fiber qualities similar to hemp and that caused these to get names like cannabinum, but these are not remotely similar to each other genetically.  Although it would make for fascinating study for me, Hemp was sadly not in the precolumbian Americas.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Best Summary with more sources: [https://ahotcupofjoe.net/2019/05/cannabis-in-the-americas-when-and-from-where-did-it-arrive/](https://ahotcupofjoe.net/2019/05/cannabis-in-the-americas-when-and-from-where-did-it-arrive/)	1643212438.0	hub2bw0	t3_q58d57	t3_q58d57	/r/AskHistorians/comments/q58d57/is_cannabis_indigenous_to_the_americas/hub2bw0/

4w5uu	That's my interpretation, yes. It's been a while since I read the Noggle book, but I don't recall any further explanation there  (happy for someone to correct me though).  It's printed in a number of other (later) sources you can easily find on Google Books that the name came from the sound that the planes made as they glided over the Germans, that it reminded them of the sound of witches on brooms -- again, indicating that the nickname wasn't intentionally gendered.  I can't find the origin of that explanation. I would hazard a guess that it came from Night Witches (1990) by Bruce Myles, a book to which I do not currently have access. However, Night Witch Polina Gelmen, in the Noggle book, specifically calls out the Myles book as being a fictionalized account, with only the names being real, so its historical value is limited, but it may be the source of that particular explanation.	1643221565.0	hubrwtn	t3_sd77g8	t1_hubp7zu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd77g8/night_witches_was_the_german_nickname_for_the/hubrwtn/

Unless this changed dramatically over the next generation, a 25-27 year old first time bride would be a lot more common than a 17 year old. However this[this](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1064.8772&rep=rep1&type=pdf) source suggests the average ages of first marriage were rising, not falling.   >The lowest figure we have for bachelors is that for  1839-41, 25-5 years, the highest figure that for 1899, 26.6; over the same period the average for spinsters rose only from 24'3 to 25-2 years.

The Frenchman Alexis de Toqueville, writing in the 1830s, noted how odd it was to see so many 18 year olds getting married and starting families in the United States. He attributed this anomaly to the vast amount of unclaimed land and opportunities for productive work that was available to young Americans at the time. In France and Britain, the relative lack of available resources meant that men in particular would have to work well into adulthood before having enough wealth to support a family.

We never ask about Sweden colonizing Skåne (a later acquisition that actually underwent a certain colonization effort), or Dalarna, or Helsinge, or Medelpad and so on. If the "tribal chiefs" in Småland or Västerbotten are acceptably part of Sweden why aren't the ones in Österbotten? Basically, the Finnish areas were incorporate organically as the medieval "Swedish" state expanded northwards, southwards, and westwards. None of these expansions are termed colonization so why would it be so in the east? In fact the expanding influence along the coast northwards has a lot of similarities how the expansion I sometimes see Finland called a Swedish province and it makes me cringe. (Parts of) Finland was an integral part of Sweden from the time Sweden as an entity meaningfully exists. Sweden (including Finland) actually had provinces across the Baltic sea which were ruled by governors and had their own laws.  Studies of placenames indicate Swedish speaking people settled areas all along the coasts during early medieaval times, areas that weren't permanently settled by Finnish speaking peoples who didn't practice the same type of agriculture. Basically, the "Swedes" could found settlements in places the "Finns" weren't using. And there was a lot of mixing between the peoples, both linguistically and ethnically.  In short the expansion of influence of what would develop into Sweden included Finnish peoples who took part in the construction of the Swedish state, essentially as equals. There was little difference between a peasant in Västerbotten or Österbotten or a noble either side of the sea. Therefore it is difficult to apply the label of colonialism on it without entirely robbing the word itself of any specific meaning.  Finally, of course this expansion of influence wasn't necessarily frictionless and entirely bereft of violence. But 1) neither was the same expansion in what no one today would call colonized Sweden, and 2) a lot of the supposed violence such as crusades aren't actually supported. Like e.g. St. Erik supposedly crusaded against the pagan Finns, if you believe his beatification legend, the problem is there's no real proof for it having happened and it borrows almost wholesale from established "tropes" of what a saintly king should have done.  Kari Tarkiainen talks a fair bit about the period in "Sveriges Österland - från forntiden till Gustav Vasa" (2008). And I recently read another book that touched a lot on the Swedish/Finnish "problem" that may also be part of what I'm remembering but sadly I have only recently found my library's "save the stuff you borrowed list" function and I can't recall the title.	1643304446.0	hugpgg4	t3_sbu2d0	t3_sbu2d0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbu2d0/can_the_swedish_rule_of_finland_be_considered/hugpgg4/

In which case I would look into:   Iram a city in the desert of Yemen situated on an oasis that over time dried up causing sinkholes to open and parts of the city to collapse. It was very prosperous in its day and its relatively sudden litteral downfall was told of in Islamic texts and thought to be an allegory or moral fable by many for quite awhile.   Sodom and Gomorrah long considered a morality myth by scholars there is some evidence that they might cities in and around the dead sea that were destroyed in much the same way that it was described in the Bible by essentially a cosmic impact of some   Numerous cities and civilizations in the Amazon rainforest which were known of but scholars weren't sure how much was true and how much was conquistadors making up bullshit.	1643315656.0	huhkiwt	t3_sddlk2	t1_hud85l9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/huhkiwt/
j5jld	Similar story for the Ottoman dynasty and the last caliph/sultan Abdülmecid II.  **Short answer**: Selling family jewelleries and arranging royal marriages (yep, they are still a thing)  **Long answer**:  After Turkish Parliament’s passage of the law No. 431 titled “*Law on the Abolishment of the Caliphate and the Expulsion of the Ottoman Royal Family from Turkish Territory*” ^1 in March 1924, Abdülmecid II and 155 Ottoman royal family members (also  ~75 courtiers) ^2 ^3 exiled.  Royal family were given a week to leave the country, they decided to temporarily stay in Switzerland until they figure out a permanent settlement.   They were given total sum of  £2.000 and Republic of Turkey passports with Switzerland visas. They travelled from Istanbul to Terriret/Switzerland ^4 via Venice Simplon-Orient-Express with 725 kg luggage and extra 6 carriages ^5.  Swiss Bomonti family (which built a modern beer factory in Feriköy/Istanbul back in 1885) helped the royal family during their 8 months long temporary stay in Switzerland before moving to their permanent residence in Nice/France.  They moved to Nice in October 1924, tried to survive by selling family jewelleries until two royal marriages happened in 1931 and got £50.000 from these marriages ^7. After ensuring the survival, remaining dynasty members lived a simple and ordinary life compared to their ancestors.     --- 1 https://www5.tbmm.gov.tr/tutanaklar/KANUNLAR_KARARLAR/kanuntbmmc002/kanuntbmmc002/kanuntbmmc00200431.pdf   2 https://www.habervitrini.com/iste-surgune-gonderilen-osmanli-ailesi/369978  3 https://gayriresmitarih.wordpress.com/sultan-vahdettin/surgun-listesi/  4 https://ataturkansiklopedisi.gov.tr/bilgi/halife-abdulmecid-efendi-1868-1944/  5 https://rayhaber.com/2016/02/tarihe-isik-tutan-tren-bileti-son-halife-abdulmecidin-surgun-yolculugu/  6 https://www.tr-ch.org/tr/swiss-days-2019-istanbul/  7 https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/princess-durru-shehvar-progressive-princess-of-hyderabad/article25368539.ece	1643319536.0	huhv0o7	t3_se16t1	t1_hugw62s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se16t1/how_did_rulers_fleeing_their_countries_pay_for/huhv0o7/

hwirmt	Hi! I’m in university and my minor is in German Studies. 1920’s Germans lacked national identity and was in shambles after the death toll, financial destruction, and lack of national identity. WW1 was devastating and having discrete and specific propaganda is comfortable when you don’t know that it’s propaganda.  I think WW1 can explain a lot of your questions, specifically the postwar environment. Yes there were previous genocides, but the Germans had the same mentality as modern Americans do: “That’s terrible it happened there, far away, but it would never happen here.”   I think this combination of a shambled, poor, husbandless postwar, ignorance, and ultimately a hunger for national Identity are the primary factors.

3f2ueiy	When it comes to 'forgotten' conspiracy theories it's worth noting that the earliest vaccine mandates provoked similar hysteria and conspiracy theories to those that are circulating today in regards to Covid. Lots of 19th century pamphlets claimed that the smallpox vaccine actually killed children/was a form of population control. In the most shrill versions of these pamphlets Queen Victoria was compared to the biblical Herod.  Closer to our time you'll find that 'stab in the back' conspiracies often crop up on the losing side following socially traumatic military defeats. These conspiracies argue that certain wars were lost due to intervention/interference by politicians or 5th columnists rather than being lost on the battlefield. The Nazis campaigned on this premise in regards to WWI but I doubt there's much interest in keeping that narrative alive - even amongst neo-Nazis. It's just no longer relevant to the movement.  If someone did a study into the frequency of certain terms you could probably measure the same dropoff in regards to the Vietnam war and the POW/MIA conspiracy. Wikipedia even has a section devoted to 'diminishing impact'.  The 'Satanic panic' of the 80s and 90s also appears to be on the wane but religiously-inspired conspiracies often have earlier precedents and a long 'tail'. Perhaps the most resilient conspiracy theories are those that are fed by anti-semitism. I think the blood-libel still gets a bit of oxygen breathed onto it every now and then by extremist Islamic clerics (and, slightly more obliquely, by Q-anon wingnuts) and that conspiracy is roughly two thousand years old at this point.  But my sense is that most conspiracy theories actually have a fairly short half-life due to the fact that they often arise in response to a particular political or social circumstance. Because conspiracies are fringe beliefs that lack supporting evidence they're probably not as well-documented in broad historical narratives unless they contribute to social upheaval in some way.   What you're seeing with conspiracies theories regarding the JFK assassination and the moon-landing is a form of survivorship bias where a small number of prominent, persistent theories are giving the impression of resilience to conspiracy theories in general. We only get that impression because, as a society, we've all collectively memory-holed tens of thousands of other fringe beliefs.  You can see the same effect when it comes to defunct scientific theories. Unless you're studying the history of science you're unlikely to encounter many of the false starts and dead-ends along the way (Lamarckism being perhaps one relatively well known counter-theory to evolution). Same with music - we think bands from the 70s are great because we've collectively filtered out all the garbage pop music from that era.  Hope that helps. I also hope I haven't revived the blood libel.	1643323737.0	hui6153	t3_sd0r8f	t3_sd0r8f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0r8f/are_there_historical_examples_of_conspiracy/hui6153/
276lb2v9	Hey here is one I can answer!  So broadly this divide you are seeing is because of the nature of Traditional Ecological Knowledge(TEK) as a field of study and also the nature of European history. So to start TEK is the term for ecological knowledge that is pasted through tradition(stories, songs, faith, art etc.) and not through scholarly documentation/experimentation^1. Because of this whatever practice we wish to call TEK must not have been integrated into a broader scholarly/scientific understanding of a topic otherwise tradition would not be main form of dissemination for that practice^2. Furthermore because of the nature of European scientific history a large body of the knowledge that was historically excluded from scholarly studies was knowledge that came from indigenous communities being viewed as myth or fantasy not serious study^3. It's also important to note that TEK as a field of inquiry is both young and mostly American, Europe and many parts of the old world have very few indigenous communities to draw TEK from because indigeneity cannot really exist without settler-colonialism(as explained fantastically [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qee4hd/why_are_there_so_few_indigenous_peoples_in_europe/hhsvqug/) by /u/Wild-Enkidu) and settler-colonialism is far less common in Europe and the old world. Finally Europe/Europeans disseminated agricultural and ecological knowledge in written scholarly form for the entire medieval period. Cato the Elders De agri cultura (On Farming) for instance was written in 160 BCE but was being reproduced and spread around Europe at least as far back as the 12th Century and well into the 15th Century.  >1.

3xmnr	Pertinent passage - "We don't know the identities of actors and chorus members, except that they were all male citizens. We do know that a choregos, or "impressario," was the boss of the production and paid for it. His expenditure was considered a "liturgy," a system by which Athenian elite were expected to pay out for the benefit of the city. One could pay for a chorus, or pay for a warship, or build/restore a temple, or fix a bridge, et cetera. We know that the choregos chose the chorus members and supported them while they rehearsed, but the specifics elude us. The choregos also payed for any special effects and costume needs. In return, he got his name on a nice marble monument, along with a notation if his chorus won the prize at the festival (several such monuments survive and we can read the names, especially in the 4th century). Since the chorus members were chosen, it stands to reason that some were "good at it" and could sing/dance better than others. We do not get the impression that they were professionals, and they were surely not payed enough to sustain them the rest of the year. They must have had day jobs!"	1643333541.0	huitpc3	t3_sdwzpa	t1_hufxvm2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sdwzpa/in_ancient_greece_did_the_audience_pay_to_watch/huitpc3/

eduun	The Churchill tank was named after Winston Churchill not because he was Prime Minister in WW2, but because he formed the Landship Committee in 1915 while he was First Lord of the Admiralty, responsible for the development of armoured fighting vehicles in WW1. Curiously, the pattern for British tanks was to name their "cruiser" tanks with C-names (Challenger, Comet, Cromwell, etc.). Infantry tanks did not follow a naming pattern (Matilda, Valentine) - Churchill being a coincidence.  The USSR was more direct in naming their vehicles after contemporary figures. The KV tank was named after Kliment Voroshilov, the defense minister, while the IS tank was named for Josef (Iosef) Stalin himself. Given that Stalin named a city after himself that happened to be the turning point of the war, these names were likely given for propaganda purposes.  You likely won't see a Biden-class aircraft carrier, but it doesn't mean that you won't see a ship named after Joseph R. Biden. The current aircraft carrier model used by the US Navy is the Nimitz class, named after Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, who was the head of the navy during WW2. Conventionally, the ship class is named after the first ship of that class. Subsequent Nimitz-class carriers include the Dwight D. Eisenhower, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Whether we'll see a USS Barack Obama or Donald J. Trump will depend on the administration at the time, though generally these namesakes honour individuals who have made significant contributions to that military branch or the armed forces as a whole.	1643338980.0	huj6a68	t3_seeo1a	t3_seeo1a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seeo1a/was_the_naming_of_equipment_and_fortifications/huj6a68/

7hg014qq	To supplement your answer, to the best of my knowledge the British used various themes during the period. For example, the self-propelled artillery had an ecclesiastical theme in their names: Deacon, Priest etc. The American tanks sold to the British were named after American civil war generals: Stuart (M3 and M5 light), Lee (M3 medium with American style turret), Grant (M3 medium with the British designed turret - IIRC), and the Sherman (M4 medium). It is my understand the US military adopted these names after they were given and carried on the general theme (so we end up with the Pershing , the Patton etc.)?   &#x200B;  The French Maginot Line, built in the inter-war period, was named after the man who pushed for its construction. The alpine 'extension' was named after its location, as was the contemporary built French fortifications in Tunisia:  Mareth Line. The Soviets built some in the inter-war period, and I believe they were named after major political figures (Stalin and Molotov). I don't believe the British anti-invasion defenses, built from 1940 onwards, were not named (to the best of my knowledge), other than based off their location and are commonly just referred to as "stop lines". The German defensive lines in Italy, during 1943-45, had a multitude of names including one named after Hitler. Similar things occurred in the 60s too. During the Vietnam War, there was the McNamara Line. The Israelis had the Bar Lev Line. Both named after their proponents.	1643340968.0	hujarcw	t3_seeo1a	t1_huj6a68	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seeo1a/was_the_naming_of_equipment_and_fortifications/hujarcw/

jhijs	That is the history of the *Syrian* hamster. There are five species of hamsters kept in captivity; the Chinese and Winter White species were the earliest to be described by Peter Pallas, a Prussian zoologist, in his *Spicilegia zoologica* in 1773.   Professor Israel Aharoni was indeed the first person to recover live hamsters from the wild in 1930: a litter of 12 Syrian pups and the mother from a burrow in Aleppo, Syria. Unfortunately, the stressed mother began to destroy her young, which Aharoni mistook for abberant behavior, and he euthanized her immediately. Only three pups--two males and a female--survived to adulthood, the rest either dying or escaping. It is from those three siblings that nearly every pet and laboratory Syrian is descended.

Maud and Ewan had grown up in a culture and time where divorce was considered a scandal.

In 1911, the year of Maud's marriage, Prince Edward Island still held its head high as a province unsullied by divorce, crediting the low divorce rate to good education and a morally upright population.  They did not comment on the fact that in this same period various murders, poisonings, and spousal abuse cases on the Island resulted in one of the marriage partners being tossed into Falconwood or jail.   >On May 16, 1918, the Uxbridge *Journal* noted that the Canadian Parliament was debating whether the Senate or the courts should grant divorces.  Although attitudes were changing, Maud could not have coped with either the emotional upheaval or the scandal of a divorce, even she had wanted one—which, apparently, she did not.  ...   >It is hard for our society to understand the anxiety and shame that Maud's era felt over sexual dalliance, adultery, and divorce.  These "sins" were scandalous even in Hollywood then, where public disapproval could be felt at the box office.  Maud's generation remembered all-too-well the scandal, for instance, over the 1919 silent movie version of *Anne of Green Gables*, which was well received across North America on its release.  But then William Desmond Taylor (1872-1922), the movie's married and middle-aged director, was found murdered, and compromising letters from the actress who played Anne, Mary Miles Minter, as well as her monogrammed underwear, were reportedly found in his room.  Mary Miles Minter herself was not suspected of the murder (though her mother, angry at her daughter's "seduction," was under some suspicion).  But the public was so shocked at the immorality of a starlet—especially one who was known as "Anne of Green Gables"—having an affair with an older, married man that the film was withdrawn and all copies were said to be destroyed.  No known intact copy has survived. ...  >Chester's [older son's] extramarital affair filled Maud with shame and fear.  She knew it could become the talk of the women's afternoon teas in Toronto society, and the gossip would also travel to the Island.  Having her own professional status under attack was one thing, but to have her family name besmirched would be more than she could bear.  She thought, quite rightly, that it would even affect Stuart's [younger son's] career.   >With nerves already frayed, in August 1937 Maud began to increase her doses of barbiturates. She wrote in her journal that she did not like taking them, but claimed they were necessary.   *Lucy Maud Montgomery: The Gift of Wings*, Mary Henley Rubio	1643355999.0	huk1ko4	t3_ronxak	t3_ronxak	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ronxak/what_is_a_yankee_divorce_as_described_in_lm/huk1ko4/
f8k0c	Yes, the Germans in the 30s were indeed surrounded by warnings of rising fascism. [This (secondary source) article](https://www.bpb.de/geschichte/nationalsozialismus/dossier-nationalsozialismus/39540/erste-widerstaende) is pretty much a perfect response in both scope and topic of your question; sadly, it's in German. I don't have the time to translate it in its entirety, but I'll try to provide an overview of its overall structure and give translations of relevant contained quotes. I'm a native German but not a professional translator, so I apologize in advance if some things sound awkward.  All of this post is a translation except marked as a remark by me, so I won't mark it as a quote in its entirety. I do use some quotes for quotes within the article.  The fight against national socialism before 1933   With the NSDAP gaining more and more success, artists, scientists, journalists and intellectuals took on the fight against the national socialists. They realized that German under NS leadership was heading straight into war.  Early Warnings  > That the Nazi is weaving you a death wreath - Germany, don't you see?  Kurt Tucholsky asks in his 1930 poem "Germany, wake up". Two years later he wrote the satire "Hitler and Goethe" in the form of a school assignment, to make clear how simplistic and loudmouthed Nazi propaganda is; it ends with Hitler having the upper hand ("In comparison, Hitler is opposed to the materialistic world order and will abolish it when taking power, as he will the lost war, unemployment and bad weather"). (Note by daniu: the German hold Goethe in such a high regard that anyone "winning" against him will appear as ridiculous out of the box).  > The same desparation weakening everyone is Hitler's strength. National socialism at least brings a last hope of the starving: cannibalism. In the end, you can eat yourself. This is the terrible attraction of this promise of salvation. It refelct not only the barbaric instincts of a time of impoverishment, but especially the singlemindedness and political cluelessness of those bourgeois on the decline marching behind Hitler."  Carl von Ossietzky, editor of the "Weltbühne", wrote end of 1931, when Hitler's rise to power seemed inevitable.  In the fine arts, George Grosz graphics and paintings became legendary, as well as photo montages by John Heartfield, both members of the KPD (communist party).   Writer Lion Feuchtwanger in his 1930 novel "Success - Three Years History in the Province" paints a sharp picture of the Bavarian political landscape at the time. Hitler in the form of the figure "Rupert Kutzner" as leader of the "Truly German" is represented as ridiculous as much as dangerous.  Emil Julius Gumbel, professor for statistics at the university of Heidelberg since 1923, and member of the peace movement, put together a thesis of 23 pages, commisioned by the "League for human rights", called "Let Heads Roll - Fasist Murders 1924-1931" (a quote from fascist propaganda), in which he writes  > These numbers nearly parallel the growth of the national socialist movement, first slowly 1924-1929, then in a sudden increase. These bloody deeds show the true face of fascism. It shows the German people the methods he will be using, should he come to power.

craypd3p	The German army on the Eastern Front most certainly accepted Russian deserters. In fact, the need for manpower was so acute, that many generals deemed it necessary to maintain their units at fighting strength. These troops were most often referred to as Hilfswillige (abbreviated to 'Hiwi' by german troops) taken to mean helper or volunteer auxiliary although this term was applied to many non-german auxiliaries and not just former-soviets.    Distinct from volunteer exiled units, the Hilfswilleger were recruited from Soviet POWs, deserters (such as was being encouraged in the movie), and even from local populations which lay under German control.   Initially their use was seen as supplementing German manpower by performing support roles, freeing-up Germans for front-line duties. Nigel Thomas argues that after September 1941, large portions of German divisions were composed of Hilfsweger performing duties as interpreters, drivers, medical and food orderlies. Some estimates place these numbers by the end of 1941 as high as 15% of the division's total strength.^(1)    However, by mid/late 1942, they had clearly moved into combat roles with the German 6th army at Stalingrad containing as many as 50,000 Hiwis, which would be between 20-25% of the army's total manpower. German officers found the contrast between military necessity and German political ideology conflicting but the former won out. According to Anthony Beever, who researched the 6th Army's stand at Stalingrad amongst German military archives, many German soldiers readily testified to the bravery and loyalty of the Hilfsweger combat troops. ^(2) The brutal treatment these troops experienced can only be imagined - with death as a disciplinary tool used by their German officers, often for the smallest infraction, weighed against the certainty of interrogation and execution if these 'former Russians' were ever captured by the Red Army.      1.

9ul4y	I can answer this to some degree: I don't know about broadcasting to soldiers in Stalingrad specifically or soldiers defecting but The Russian Liberation Army was an force composed of people from a variety of backgrounds including Russians sympathetic to Nazi Germany...however, a large chunk of the force was former Soviet POWs. Andrey Vlasov headed the RLA after being captured at Leningrad. He "switched" sides from the Nazis back to the Soviets to aid the Prague Uprising right as Nazi Germany was surrendering however, by that time he had worn out his welcome on both sides. *"He and the ROA then tried to escape to the Western Front, but were captured by Soviet forces. Vlasov was tried for treason and hanged."* So, Nazi Germany was certainly open to the aid of Soviet soldiers no matter where they came from. Like all wars since the advent of mass communication, opposing sides have been trying to recruit or persuade their enemy from fighting. For example, the NVA (and Viet Cong) used pressured POWs and sympathetic Americans (Jane Fonda's actions seem to fall under this umbrella though she later expressed regret) to broadcast to GIs in Vietnam.	1643359772.0	huk6r6g	t3_seflsl	t3_seflsl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seflsl/in_the_movie_enemy_at_the_gates_2001_a_german/huk6r6g/

f8k0c	Criticism of Antisemitism  A strong criticism of the NS ideology and their predecessors also came from the side of the burgeois/left-liberals. Most prominent was the (later German president) Theodor Heuss who, along his friend Reinhold Maier declined his consent to the "Ermächtigungsgesetz" ("empowerment law") after the "seizure of power" in March 1933, and remained in "inner emigration". He took position against the NSDAP's antisemitism very early. His book "Hitler's Way. A Historical-Political Study on National Socialism" came out early 1932. He preferred to discuss the historical and psychological preconditions of the Hitler movement argumentatively rather than polemically. As a liberal political writer, he lacked the fantasy to imagine the brutality and lust for murder with which the NSDAP programm would be put into reality starting 1932. His writing does however contain passages like  > The destruction of jewish cemeteries must hit a community hard, in which, contrary to all the drivel of the individualistic power of dissolution of the Jewish, the family also finds a living bond into the past; it soils us all. We all carry a stain on us, since something like this, cowardly and without respect, became possible.  The Nazis were even more angry with writer Konrad Heiden than they were with Heuss. Heiden released a book in 1932, "The History of National Socialism, the Career of an Idea", which showed some impact as a well researched fighting paper. The author emigrated in april 1933 and continued his resitance against national socialism from the Saarland with books like "Birth of the Third Reich" (1934) and - under the pseudonym Klaus Bredow - the articles "Hitler is raging" (1934) and "Are the Nazis Socialists" (1934). Heiden also wrote the first large and critical biography of Hitler, which came out in 1935/37 in two volumes in Zurich (along with English, American and French editions), written from a spirit of resistance.  Also in the year of crisis 1932, Ernst Niekisch put out a warning "Hitler - a German Undoing". He was imprisoned in 1939 for "preparation of high treason" after his magazine "Resistance - Papers for National Revolutionary Politics" had already been forbidden in 1934. His charges included the the manuscript "The Realm of Lower Demons - a Scathing Criticism of the 'Third Reich'". In the most important NSDAP magazin "Völkischer Beobachter" ("Peoples' Watchman"), the process was reported on in 1938 as follows:  > Long before 1933, [Niekisch] put himself agains national socialism, and continued to fight after the seizure of power the political and economic goals of the national socialist state in an inflammatory way until his arrest, badmouthing the leading personalities of the Third Reich in the worst ways.

f8k0c	Warnings of War  The NSDAP also encountered resistance from the conservative side, amongst them the Munich-based publicist Fritz Michael Gerlich being the most prolific. He belonged to an extremist nationalist grouping of the "All Germans" during the first world war, then came out as a fighter against Marxism and Communism. Starting 1923, the influential journalist engaged in the fight against Hitler and his followers. With the support of catholic circles, he issued to magazine "The Straight Way", which published internals of the NS-movement provided by its own intelligence service, to expose their criminal character. Gerlich was arrested March 1933 by the SA, mistreated and finally a target of the murder spree of June 30th, 1934. In July 1932 already, he described Hitlers goals with the sentence  > National Socialism [...] means: Animosity towards the neighboring nations, government of violence internally, civil war, peoples' war. National socialism means: Lies, Hatred, murder amongst brothers and endless suffering!  Erich Mühsam wrote as a call to a unified front of antifascist power:  > The only power able to prevent Hitler's rise to power is the combined will of the workers the mind of whom have not been twisted by national socialism.  He followed up this early warning in 1929 with a warning for the SPD and KPD [socicalist and communist parties] that would come to pass in 1933. A terrible time would come,  > if the dance of the Third Reich begins [...] wenn the martial law shootings, the progromes, lootings, mass incarcerations represent law in Germany.   Mühsam was arrested in the night of the Reichstagsbrand on February 28th 1933. He died in the concentration camp Oranienburg in 1933 after months of abuse.  Hans Achim Litten, a partyless lawyer, engaged in legal ways of fighting the rise of national socialism, in context of a movement "Red Help Germany" for workers that were put to court for political reasons. in the "Felseneck-Case", 150 SA-men had raided a gardening colony and beat two men to death. Litten reconstructed what had happened, resulting in 5 Nazis being sued.  In November 1930, Litten appeared as a joint plaintiff in the case against the SA who had raided the "Edenpalast" and left 4 men injured. He tried to prove that these were not acts driven by the lower level but used as a means to push through political goals by the NSDAP leadership, and planned as such. He put the responsible leader of the NSDAP on the witness stand and managed to drive him into a corner. This forced Hitler to distance himself from Berlin's Gauleiter Goebbels.  This wasn't the only, but most prominent case in Littens practice of law. The NSDAP took revenge for embarrassing Hitler by arresting him in 1933 and let him suffer for five years in prisons and concentration camps.

93n0lq9j	I'm not an expert in this particular subject.... I know a couple things. FDR courted his cousin. He wrote her letters. Eleanor Roosevelt, remembered fondly by history, was Franklin's first cousin. Of course, the Roosevelts are going to be rich, privileged. Of course, as you may know that Theodore Roosevelt, also President, was both Franklin's 5th Cousin AND Eleanor's Uncle. Square that.    The letters "The Courting" that Franklin did, overwhelming her by sheer volume and the bubbly words lead me to believe that it was known & the cousins began. Why? Keep the money in the family. Why give POWER to your wife's brother UNLESS your wife's brother is also your cousin? You see?  Morbid. True.    Eleanor was a real doer. She was the pants in the Family. She wasn't allowed to lead or even speak back then. Women had their place. Franklin would end up having an affair with Elenor's Best woman, her assistant. Can't remember her name but FDR LOVED this woman. Loved. She was by his side when he died. 2022 me, I tried to find a picture of her. Haaaaa ......  I think that the cousins set it up in the last century. I think they KNEW that they WOULD be marrying into the family. Oh, as a matter of face, FDR was fiddling around with another woman ...

f8k0c	Parties and Organisations  The ideologic counter position, but also party politicical competition were the drigin forces in the fight of the worker's movement against the NSDAP before their seizure of power. However, many of those forces were bound into a fight amongst each other. The KPD called the SPD "social fascists" and didn't stop short of allying themselves with the NSDAP against the SPD and other parties. The SPD on the other hand didn't want anything to do with the Moscow-oriented KPD. The NSDAP as the common enemy was the lucky third party. Additionally, the leadership of the SPD wasn't willing to leave the ground of the constitutionally allowed or even seemed to, until it was too late, because the enenmies of constitution had undermined and destroyed law and order.  After the first NS electoral success in 1930, the political fighting order "Reichsbanner Schwarz Rot Gold" was reinvigorated. Its goal was the defense of the republic and constitution and organized show of force against the right-wing extremists. Marches and rallies were the means that were fought with.  After the "Papenstreich" on July 20th 1932 [against the Prussian Government], the Reichsbanner underwent more and more of a decline. Against the coalition of the burgeois right, 1931 saw the founding of the "Eiserne Front" ("Iron Front") as a "was of human bodies against the fascist danger". Lack of decisionmaking in its leadership prevented actions of those organisations against the seizure of power by Hitler. These acts of resistence had been demanded by members that didn't appreciate not being allowed to fight for the republic with a general strike or similar. The leadership however feared the idea of being accused of lawlessness more than anything. Another factor was not being willing to engage in the bloodshed that would have been inevitable in case of a confrontation between the two sides.  Some young SPD members like Carlo Mierendorff, Theodor Haubauch und Kurt Schumacher were critical of their party's course and promoted a more fighting position. Schumacher, having become famous for his speech in the Reichstag on February 23rd, 1932, drew the ire of the NSDAP and spent almost the entire time of NS government in a concentration camp. In his speech, he'd said that the German people would take decades to "heal the moral and intellectual wounds that were inflicted by this kind of agitation".  He summarized this full contempt in the words  > If we acknowledge anything about national socialism, it is the fact that in the first time in German politics, the complete mobilization of human stupidity has succeeded.	1643363572.0	hukbj8d	t3_se888r	t1_huk9nwf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se888r/were_1920s_citizens_of_germany_surrounded_by/hukbj8d/

craypd3p	The word 'dozen' comes from the latin (via french) for duodecim (two and ten). Etymology aside, the common usage of twelve as a counting unit is really quite simple - it can be divided a lot easier into whole numbers for major fractions (quarters, halves and thirds) than ten without having to regress into decimal places.   12 (1/2 = 6, 2/3 = 8, 1/4 = 3)  whereas 10 (1/2 = 5, 2/3 = 6.666666er..., etc)  12 is divisible, wholly, by many more numbers than 10 while still remaining a manageably small calculation. This is almost certainly why the most well-known coinage - pre-metric invention, were on this sort of scale. Think Pieces-of-eight being divisible into eight pieces, or the English Penny being 12p to the shilling (and the reason why there were 20 shillings to the pound is that makes 240 pennies to the pound - a 12 divisible again).    Random fact, even early gun-bores (gauge) were considered in those terms and survive to this day - the 12-bore is derived from the size of lead ball you made from 1/12th of a pound of lead   Probably also why we think in terms of 12 for our time and calendar, both are (loosely) divisible by 12, certainly more so than ten.   Ten is important for simple numbers as humans can use their fingers, but for quick, easy calculations and for the distribution of products, for stacking, for artistic building decoration (mosaics, tiles, etc) twelve is key.	1643365440.0	hukdw6q	t3_sdl2v4	t3_sdl2v4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sdl2v4/when_did_humans_begin_to_use_sets_of_12_as_a_unit/hukdw6q/
163mk82p	So I'm not a historian but I am a Sephardic jew and  quite interested in our history , I will try to give a satisfying answer.  Yours is a great question , and as many questions the answer is it depends: like you said , this varied greatly by location and the pre existing Jewish communities. Most Sephardim migrated to the Ottoman empire , Morocco , and the Netherlands , in that order. The ottoman empire had Jewish communities consisting of Greek speaking Romaniote Jews , and indeed they maintained separate synagogues and communities , they had their own liturgy that differed from that of Sephardim. These communities were mostly on the Aegean islands. Sephardim were most numerous in the Ottoman empire in the cities of Salonika and Smyrna (Thessaloniki and Izmir). There was a liturgical and linguistic breach between the Spanish speaking speaking Sephardim and the Greek speaking Romaniotes. Which does not imply they had bad relations.  In Morocco things were a bit different given there were substantial Jewish communities pre Alhambra decree since the times of the Roman empire. There was a greater degree of integration between them and Moroccan Jewry came to adopt the Sephardic lithurgy as standards (as most of the middle east eventually did). There came to be a dialect of judeo Spanish that incorporated Arabic in Morocco , called haketia.  In the Netherlands  there was not much in the ways of integration , Sephardim became an elite in the Dutch Jewry , with great banking families such as the abravanel. They came to be at odds with later arriving Ashkenazic refugees , often times disapproving of intermarriage between the communities. Eventually Ashkenazim vastly outnumbered Sephardim here and the community  got smaller and smaller that by the time of the Shoah there were only a couple thousand Sephardim in the Netherlands.	1643365979.0	hukel7u	t3_sc9zpb	t3_sc9zpb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc9zpb/did_the_jews_who_fled_from_spain_following_the/hukel7u/

cbhqd	You've explained how there were warnings against Nazism, but this is not quite what the OP asked about. In the modern day, fascism is a byword for historic atrocities, not merely the name of one of several ideologies competing in the market of ideas. I think it should go without saying that *any* ideology attracts criticism - whether it's fascism, communism or something mundane like social democracy, liberalism or conservatism.  There is a sense now that people should realise that when something is credibly accused of being fascism it's not the same kind of criticism as other ideologies attract, that we "should know better" due to examples from the past. Was this true of the criticism in the early 20th century - was there a sense that people should know better because of examples from history? I think it's worth stressing that the Italian party was literally named the National Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista) so already we should know that the character of criticism is different, because nowadays fascists themselves don't describe themselves as fascists due to the negative association.	1643367629.0	hukgsbz	t3_se888r	t1_hukbj8d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se888r/were_1920s_citizens_of_germany_surrounded_by/hukgsbz/
gpde1	Most dictionary definitions of "vermin" say it covers an array of small animals and insects etc, all with a negative connotative. For example Merriam Webster lists one definition for vermin, of three, as "small common harmful or objectionable animals (such as lice or fleas) that are difficult to control". Modern American English tends to use the word solely for troublesome mammals like mice or rats, but the word can be somewhat broader.  Looks like the word comes from the Latin word "vermis" which means worm, but I can't speak to its historical roots and usage.	1643367795.0	hukh0df	t3_se1rv3	t1_hujdsca	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se1rv3/did_the_crusaders_say_anything_about_hamsters/hukh0df/
a2k1yczl	This is too broad a question to be answered in a single post. Try to be more specific about what you are primarily interested in. The history of mass industrial housing in the ssr? The quality of residential infrastructure? The size of the apartments? The quality of construction?   And in spite of all the Soviet striving for unification, we will always find regional peculiarities and a lot of local differences, although a person familiar with the real estate market in Moscow will be able to quickly start navigating the real estate market in Kiev or Minsk.   Nevertheless, first the periodization.  It's just Stalin-Khruschev-Brezhnev. And their houses, respectively, Stalinka, Khrushchevka, Brezhnevka.   Stalinka - a large spacious apartment with 3+ meters high ceilings because it was designed by architects of the Russian Empire, who learned how to build for the wealthy public who had in mind as a model noble chateau.  https://images.app.goo.gl/9EMh5VZ5a2REqr656  https://images.app.goo.gl/2GeHJc9M3WcHUVwr9  Wide avenues and buildings surrounded by parks.  Is this correct? Yes. And no. If you dig deeper, we find that the Stalinkas can be divided by period into prewar and postwar, and by purpose into type and nomenclature. The type can in turn be divided into type, workers and hostels, and for example the hostels were also divided into three classes, and here we can spend at least two semesters of lectures. But in order not to go crazy, we will focus on the facade nomenclature stalinkas. So the beautiful houses. There's a wide avenue on one side and a park on the other. Here the modern reader will say. Wait, what good is an avenue it only noise, stink, and traffic jams? This is because the modern reader is spoiled brat! in those years it seemed that this is happiness.  https://images.app.goo.gl/VF2Zm4zwAwAstbUS9  In short, the park, the avenue, chic and beautiful who would object? Khrushchev. Why? Too expensive. Prose of life. Too expensive and not enough for everyone. Plus urbanization from 17% to 50+% and the loss of housing stock during the war.   So the new task facing the Soviet government is to provide the Soviet workers with personal housing, because it is somehow uncomfortable to have the world's first state of workers and peasants, and people mostly live in dugouts, barracks, communal houses and hostels. (A communal house is usually a large noble apartment built before the revolution for 5-20 rooms, which were divided into rooms by the principle of one family - one room. This is not the worst option. But a barrack with bunk beds for 40 people is yes, it can make you think about the frailty of life. And after 1945 it's not that uncommon, especially in the European part of the country in ruins.  Of course, the Germans easy could burn someone along with his house, but someone returned from the war and had to live somewhere at least temporarily. And there was not enough housing for everyone even before the war because of urbanization.  So the problem had to be solved.   So Khrushchev. Let's give him a word: "Some (architects) understand architecture aesthetically, as an artistic activity, and not as satisfying the needs of the Soviet people. They spend people's money on unnecessary beauty, instead of building simply and more."  So now the Khrushchevs and the concept of the microroyon (micro district). About microrayon development should be written separately - statistical studies, needs, research routes home-school, home-polyclinic, home-work.    So khrushchevkas. Khrushchevkas are usually five stories high. Why? Because doctors decided that walking up more than five stories could be bad for your health. They actually said four floors, so initially they built four, but then they decided to build even faster and Khrushchev decided that if people went up to the fourth floor, then somehow the fifth they will go up. Why not build an elevator? Some will say economy, but it's more about the fact that elevators are still a bottleneck. For the mass production of elevators need elevator factories, and they do not yet. First we build factories for the production of panels.    So there is a misconception that all Khrushchev buildings are the same. This is not true. Khrushchev buildings are also different. There is the K-7, there is the 1-335 series, there is the 1-506E series, 1-507, etc. And they're all different. Probably about-at least about the most famous major series to write separately, but so already too long it turns out.   So the main problem is the speed of construction and savings. The ceiling height was reduced to 2.5 meters. The kitchen has five or six seats. The planned economy included the new type of houses, and immediately for each type of apartment began to produce the appropriate furniture. And yes Khrushchev houses are built of different materials, but mostly of panels or bricks. The brick ones are usually much better. According to the following characteristics - soundproofing (In a good brick house, especially in a Stalinist building, you can open your dentist's office with a drill or cut your wife with a chainsaw and no one will hear. In the panel Khrushchev, especially in the early series, you will hear how the neighbor from above went to the toilet at night.), heat saving, microclimate, depreciation..  There was also an idea to build a house out of plastic. Well, what about modern material? We found out that it was impossible to hammer a nail into the wall there, and it was proposed to immediately issue plastic hooks with special glue to residents. Fortunately, this project did not materialize.  In general, how successful was the very idea of ​​mass industrial housing construction?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate  Was it worth it? Well, everyone decides for himself.  To hide behind authority I will refer to Oscar Niemeyer.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Niemeyer  "With the help of these houses you have solved a colossal social problem. When I started planning the city of Brasilia, I dreamed that people from the favelas would move there. You got the job done and I didn't. Yes, I built a beautiful city in which the elite has now settled. So what. People still live in favelas."  Then there were Brezhnevkas, but this is the next stage.	1643369223.0	hukj0xi	t3_semr9c	t3_semr9c	/r/AskHistorians/comments/semr9c/quality_of_housing_under_khrushcev/hukj0xi/

The tensions that led to the First World War (of which the Second was really just a continuation) were mostly born of powerful nations being squeezed together on the same continent and a web of alliances between them and their smaller neighbours. France had been at war with Prussia (the driving force behind the unification of Germany) over territory in Europe within living memory.  The overseas possessions weren’t really a factor, which is why the two largest empires in the world were on the same side both times.	1643370513.0	hukkwhr	t3_secaj1	t3_secaj1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/secaj1/was_having_colonies_a_big_reason_for_ww1_and_ww2/hukkwhr/
7x68fbo7	I can't speak for the whole of Europe; only the Netherlands; since I mainly do Dutch genealogy.  Long story short; no dowry, no arranged marriages, boys and girls had equal say in choice of a partner. (Only common squabbling; parents disliking a marriage because the person had a different religion or came from a family that they were in a beef with, etc. stuff that still excists.. but parents had in the end no say in who their son/daughter chose to marry)  This also had a lot to do probably with the fact that for example women/daugters could inherit/buy property/start businesses.. since well forever. It has been quite gender-equal on that area; so you did not lose or win anything with having a son/daughter. It  was expected though that a married couple lived in their own house; medeival Netherlands was quite poor; so men/women married quite late. But that álso meant that you did not like "loose" your daughter to another family; all your children leave the house if they get married: so another reason to not have any dowry.   A lot of people were incredibly poor. Living in huts made from mud/grass was still common. Everyone who could, young/old/men/women had to pitch in to survive. There was no time for being busy with arranged marriages/dowry's/etc. The higher up you go; the more you notice people were busy with who their child could/should marry. When there was actually money in the family.. (and also more fights around inheratances etc.). So the middle class that owned small farms; you see more records like that in small court. And the upper-class even more. But in the end by law there was simply no things as having a say in who your child married; so people just married who they loved. And the records of small court show that the parents mainly got as advice to "stop fighting with each other over it and act like normal people"  lol. (I highly reccomend to try to read court-documents from that time; they can be so hilarious.. and you can see that people were só much the same as people now..)	1643370668.0	hukl51w	t3_sefyp3	t3_sefyp3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sefyp3/how_did_common_people_find_their_wives_in/hukl51w/

5rojn	What I noticed from doing my family genealogy here in Germany is how mobile people got with the times. Nowadays it's common to marry even people from other continents. Just go back 50 years and it was already pretty uncommon to marry even a foreigner. Go back 100 years and it was already uncommon to marry someone from another province. And then pre 1750ish marriage mostly took place between people who lived on neighbouring farms.   Another interesting thing, widows and widowers usually remarried within a year of the death of their spouse. It looks like those marriages were purely practical.	1643373193.0	hukp644	t3_sefyp3	t1_hukl51w	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sefyp3/how_did_common_people_find_their_wives_in/hukp644/

7xgnjo	The manpower need was often acute, but  Rolf-Dieter Müller in his 2007 An der Seite der Wermacht: Hitlers ausländische Helfer beim "Kreuzzeug gegen den Bolschewismus" 1941-1945 of which I have a Swedish translation from 2015 shows that they were used much less extensively than (especially the military) wanted.  While he goes through all the non-German troops used, IIRC roughly 1/3 of the forces of the Eastfront was allies or foreign volunteers. He also talks a lot about the various Russians peoples encountered in particular were barred from actually serving with weapons more or less to the end. It was mainly the leading Nazis that didn't want to arm the untermenschen, so e.g. while they did use the captured Russian general who was willing to switch side after captivity as a propaganda tool they never got around to properly setting up real forces, the Russian anti-bolsjevik army remained a paper-product. In many cases this was symptomatic, as the war rolled in over the Soviet Union various groups hailed the Nazis as liberator, but the nazis quickly disabused these people of that notion. Then they eventually turned somewhat on the idea but usually much too late to be of any use. That said as people have already mentioned a fair number of people were used officially or not as various support activities and other allied or "collaborator" forces e.g. unloaded proper troops from things such as anti-partisan work or rear-area security. The salient point though is that while the Wermacht gladly saw deserters, it's one Russians less shooting at them, there was never any proper plans to use such men to do real fighting. The ideological issues stood in the way too long. You would never "join" the Nazi Wermacht. And I guess we should be glad the Nazis were such a disorganised and self-sabotaging bunch really.	1643375461.0	huktbq4	t3_seflsl	t3_seflsl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seflsl/in_the_movie_enemy_at_the_gates_2001_a_german/huktbq4/
craypd3p	In September 1941 Hitler authorised the enlistment of these auxiliaries in military support roles, albeit reluctantly, but officers on the ground had been making use of them since the previous summer. As the war progressed they were formed increasingly into cohesive combat units under German command, a system the Nazi leadership appears to have officially opposed yet also turned a blind eye toward as it continued. The system became increasingly more official from this point on with the recruits being "rewarded" with variants of German uniforms (as opposed to their insignia-removed soviet uniforms) after a 2-month probation period.   Generals in the German army recognised both the conflict with ideology but also its necessity. One officer remarking it disturbing that "that the "Beasts" we have been fighting against are now living with us in closest harmony".^(1) However, as is most often the case in way, military necessity tends to triumph - Army Order HV44B Nr. 289 (292) in July 1944 actually awarded Hilfswilliger recognised status within the German Army (including promotion to NCO rank).^(2)   The Nazi political leadership was certainly aware of the enlistment of these types of forces and their use in cohesive combat battalions and not simply in support roles. In fact it supported the strategic redeployment of many thousands of such soldiers to the western front in order to free-up and transfer German units eastward. Over 40 battalions (perhaps as many as 30,000 men or more) of troops recruited in the east were sent west in late 1943 and early 1944 with 21 of these folded into the 7th and 15th armies in Northern France, with many units suffering heavy causalities during and after Operation Overlord. In late 1944, Himmler convinced Hitler to allow the official establishment of Russian-commanded Anti-soviet forces which was to be grandly titled the Russian Liberation Army, but only one division saw action before the wars end.     1.

48n5rhu0	As previous comments have addressed, many rulers were able to leverage family connections, private property, and/or take large amounts of capital and possessions with them on their way out. However, sometimes exiled rulers haven’t been so lucky and have fallen on hard times.  Charles X of France racked up pretty large debts in the UK during his first exile after the French Revolution. He was able to put these off during the reign of his brother and himself after Napoleon was defeated. After his second exile in 1830, he was contacted in the UK by several firms wanting their debts paid, so he jumped on the support of the Austrian emperor and moved there to get away. He lived largely off Austrian support for the rest of his life.  Peter II of Yugoslavia was pretty unlucky to not have many possessions in exile, and any property was seized by Tito’s communist regime after WWII. He never accepted that his throne was permanently gone, so he never cut his upper-class lifestyle and had issues with his cheques bouncing at fancy restaurants and hotels. He made much of his income from supporter donations, giving speeches, and organizing events for the Yugoslav community in the US Midwest. He struggled with alcohol and died cash-strapped.  Gustav IV Adolph of Sweden lived in a small hotel in Switzerland and got by pretty quietly until he died about 30 years after his deposition.  Many rulers could stay financially solvent after their depositions, but some unfortunate ones did not.	1643375896.0	huku6nc	t3_se16t1	t3_se16t1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se16t1/how_did_rulers_fleeing_their_countries_pay_for/huku6nc/
7x68fbo7	"different religion". There were many different types of Christianity; that people could squabble over. We now see that more as the "same religion" in these times that Christianity isn't that popular anymore in the Netherlands. Different religion we think more like someone who is Christian marrying somehow who is Islamic.  But back then every village could have slight differences in their Christianity; or often in the same village. So your partner could in the vieuws of your parents "not go to the right church".   But personally, looking at documents in small courts: I vieuw this more as having "beef" with another family. It does not sounds so different then people hating fans of the neighbourings "enemy" soccer-team....get in tomato/tomato fights..A dad hating his son in law because he roots for the "Lions" and he for the "Eagles" or something..  Since it never ended in something real; people still married.   Sidenote; the "schepenbank"; the courthouses of that time often had a big social function. You see this sometimes also in small US towns; that the local police officer also is the social worker. Hence these "small squabbles" also ended up in court records. Whereas now; if you are in a disagreement with a neighbour/family-member this would not end up in courtdocuments. (unless.. you actually fysically fight each other offcourse).  Sidenote 2; these small court documents also often seem to show we think people were more religious back then; then they actually were. Yes; the church was somewhat a social pressure to join/attend. But a lot of people just didn't; and that was not frowned upon. Some villages you find notes in "schepenbank" records like "person X never visits the church" in a negative way but most of the time it's not mentioned and they seem often doing other things on sunday (working the field/drinking in the pub/etc.) then being at church.	1643376127.0	hukunkl	t3_sefyp3	t1_hukpw6s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sefyp3/how_did_common_people_find_their_wives_in/hukunkl/

9ayzs	This was a matter of contention among the Nazi leadership. Anti-soviet Russians (and others) were used for propaganda purposes however were not allowed into combat at the beginning of the war. As the need for manpower grew, officers that deserted the red army started campaigning to be given command of units of POWs willing to switch sides and fight for the axis. Hitler resisted this as he did not trust the deserters and felt that arming Slavic soldiers would create problems for his plans later down the road, however he eventually consented and the ROA (Russian Liberation Army) was created.  It functioned for a relatively short period of time and eventually sided with Czech partisans against SS units, perhaps to ingratiate themselves with the allies.

qmwup	King George III of England had recurring bouts of mental illness for years, culminating in 1810 when, after the death of his daughter Princess Amelia, he became permanently insane. Technically what followed was that the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to some "letters patent," which appointed Commissioners. These were at least irregular, if not illegal, because the King was supposed to sign them, but Parliament voted to go ahead in the absence of the signature because, of course, the King was insane and his signature, even if obtainable, would have been meaningless. This had been tried before, in 1789, when the king had previously suffered an episode of his mental illness. On that occasion, the process was not complete before the King recovered. He then retroactively approved what the government had done while he was insane, which was a factor in the later decision to use the same process again in 1811.      The Lords Commissioners then granted the royal assent on the King's behalf to the "Care of the King During His Illness, etc Act 1811," which formally suspended George III from the discharge of his royal functions, and instead decided that the Prince of Wales (also named George) would serve as regent. The formula was that Prince George would discharge the royal functions "in the name and on behalf of the King." This arrangement held from 1811 until 1820, when George III died and the prince took the throne in his own right as George IV.	1643381152.0	hul5u8u	t3_senz02	t3_senz02	/r/AskHistorians/comments/senz02/there_have_been_more_than_a_couple_mentally_ill/hul5u8u/
1iaf7h6	The LDS church has never claimed that Black people do not have souls. Since the beginning congregation have always been integrated and all races have been allowed to be baptized into the church. Soon after the church was organized in 1830, several black members joined, were baptised, and ordained to the priesthood. Congregations were fully integrated and the president of the church at the time was firmly against slavery. The Book of Mormon taught "and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile."  Sometime during the 1850s the second President of the church put a ban on ordaining black men to the priesthood which meant they couldn't perform baptisms on others or serve as bishops of congregations. Black people still continued to be baptized and participate in their congragations. There is no official record as to why the ban was put in place although some members justified it by using the example from the Bible of The house of Israel not allowing members of tribes outside of the tribe of Levi to be ordained Priests, and claiming that Black people were descended from Cain. The LDS church has disavowed all of these theories.  The civil rights movement in the 1960s, The U.S. legalizing inter-racial marriage in 1967, and the fact that many Black members of the church had made sacrifices to build a temple in Brazil, all caused the church president at the time to pray and ask God about the ban. Church President Spencer W. Kimball and his counselors "recieved a revelation from God" while praying in the temple that all worthy men should be ordained to the priesthood regardless of race. The ban was lifted.

5upeokmv	This is my opinion only. I think that the fact they “allowed” the portraits to be painted and displayed with the “Hapsburg Jaw” would indicate that they didn’t see a real issue or weren’t ashamed. Over time many rulers with physical issues would hide them and not allow them to be displayed. One example (sort of) is Augustus Caesar. Nearly every single bust or likeness you see of him is as he was when he was in his early 20s. You never see him portrayed as a old man. He was 75 when he died and had ruled for over 40 years. If he weren’t vain, didn’t care about getting old or whatever  then you’d think there would be more statues, busts or painting of him as a old man. It could also be that he just wanted to see have him people always see him, and Rome as a extension of him, as young and vigorous. Again my opinion and is apologize if it didn’t really answer your question.	1643383930.0	hulcvyw	t3_set8hm	t3_set8hm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/set8hm/what_evidence_do_we_have_on_what_the_more/hulcvyw/

1iaf7h6	Changes to church policy only occur by unanimous vote from the leader ship of the church consisting of the Quorum of the 12 apostles and the First Presidency (The president and two counselors). In 1969 they all voted to remove the ban, except for Harold B. Lee (Senior apostle at the time) who said that they shouldn't change church policy without revelation from God. In 1973 after Harold B. Lee died, Spencer W. Kimball was made president of the church and he continued to pray often about the ban. In 1978 he basically let the others know that he had received inspiration about ending the ban. They all voted unanimously to end the ban and all claimed to have received spiritual confirmation.	1643384294.0	hulduk1	t3_ser2qk	t1_hul8qik	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/hulduk1/

5jxdz	The other /u/QuickSpore answer is a good one, but by chance, Benjamin Park, Black LDS historian, had a Twitter thread a few days ago on events after this position changed that is sourced and very interesting.  [https://twitter.com/BenjaminEPark/status/1486075703753785344](https://twitter.com/BenjaminEPark/status/1486075703753785344)       Also, this assertion "that Black people did not have souls until the 1970s" is incorrect.  There was a priesthood ban.  Black people could join, be baptized, and otherwise participate, but could be ordained to the priesthood.  Since the LDS Church has a lay male clergy, that affected all male Black members, so it was significant, but again your assertion is incorrect.   In fact, in Utah, for all of Brigham Young's racism, he did not segregate congregations either by separating them outright or by separating their seating like what was happening in other parts of the country at that time.  And yes, there were a small number of Black members in Utah.   [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng)	1643386133.0	hulis5f	t3_ser2qk	t3_ser2qk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/hulis5f/
10xab7	This isn't an answer but 2  additional question.   I remember reading somewhere (I think it was in Under the Banner of Heaven but I could be wrong) that BYU played into the decision. They were in danger of losing federal funding or they would lose NCAA affiliation because they were discriminating by not admitting black students and that was the impetus for reversing restrictions for black people to be accepted into the religion. When the discrimination became an issue, the right people had the right revelations to update the religion, much like the right people had the right revelations about ending polygamy at the time needed for Utah to get statehood.   This was something I read probably a good 20 years ago, so I am hazy on the facts. My question then is, did BYU play a role in the religion revising their prior discriminatory policies against black people and if so how?  A follow-up to that is have there been other revelations besides statehood and polygamy (both starting and ending) that were convenient for wholesale changes in the religion? I mean convenient in terms of conforming to some outside externality that needed to change (Examples of what I mean: Joseph Smith wanted to bang more than one woman, *poof* polygamy. Utah couldn't be a state if they kept polygamy so *poof* no polygamy. Something would happen if they kept discriminating against black people so *poof* black people allowed to be Mormon)?	1643386192.0	hulixoh	t3_ser2qk	t3_ser2qk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/hulixoh/

bzkmc	As someone who is a current member of the church in question, it is incredibly frustrating and disappointing that, to put it bluntly, Brigham Young was a massive racist.  Our scriptures specifically state that God doesn't discriminate against "black and white, bond and free, male and female." Joseph Smith, as stated previously, was an abolitionist. But more than that, the church was actually originally hated in large part because they allowed black people (freed slaves, basically) to meet with the rest of the church and not separately.  In fact, it was a big part of the manifesto published by officials in Missouri that "justified" the infamous Extermination Order in 1838, with them stating that they were angered that the church was inviting "the degraded and corrupted free Negroes and mulattos" to come live with them.  Just a really frustrating turn of events that things turned so drastically in the other direction. It may have somewhat been a product of the time, but it caused/enabled many member of the church to be racist throughout church history and even today.	1643387032.0	hull7g5	t3_ser2qk	t1_hulg25z	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/hull7g5/
2bd3axi1	Correction, Mormon doctrine never taught that "Black people did not have souls."  The race doctrine included:  *  Black people are descendants of Cain/ black skin is the "Curse of Cain."  This is a common belief among US Christian religions in the 19th century. * Black people are descendants of Ham, who was married to an African (ie Black) woman, and whose descendants were cursed by Noah because Ham made fun of Noah's nakedness. * Central to Mormon doctrine is the concept of a spiritual pre-existence, where God made the decision to send Jesus to earth to redeem mankind for sins, and rejected Lucifer (ie, Satan's) plan in which there would be no freewill and therefore no need for redemption.  Satan and his followers left the spirit world and are now demons.  Those spirits who supported Jesus are labeled as "valiant in the pre-existence" and were born into Mormon homes.  Then there were fence-sitters who neither left with Satan nor supported Jesus.  Fence sitters were permitted to come to earth but are cursed with Black skin.  So yes, Black people have spirits but were not valient enough to: * Be admitted into Mormon temples until the 1970s.  If you do not enter the temple, you are not eligible for the highest degree of heaven.  Mormon doctrine taught until that time that while Black people would be admitted into heaven, they would be there as servants. * Hold any level of priesthood.  Keep in mind that Mormons are a lay clergy, so non-Black men were eligible for the first level of priesthood by age 12.  As far as the factors that led to changing the last two policies, it would be some combination of the following:  * As Mormons did more missionary work in Brazil in particular, it was extremely difficult to know much less enforce the "not one drop" of Black blood position the Church maintained for eligibility to enter the temple or hold a priesthood position. * The growing divide between the church's racist position and the cultural mainstream US. The church was starting to feel tremendous pressure for its policies with events like the the [Black 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Wyoming_Cowboys_football_team) Wyoming players debacle.  * The Mormon church is essentially run by 15 men (3 in the First Presidency and 12 Apostles) with lifetime tenures.  The Q15, as they are sometimes called, had significant disagreements within the organization.  Some, including Marion G. Romney (Mitt's uncle) were quietly but adamantly pro-race equality.   Others, including Mark Peterson and Delbert Stapley, were unapologetically racist and outspokenly opposed to any change in doctrine.  The Prophet Spencer Kimball was likely more progressive than his older predecessors on race issues in general, but very much aware of the practical effect the racism was having on the Church's missionary efforts in South America, and reputational effect in the US.  However, changing the doctrine is hard enough, even with unanimity.  So the doctrine required that enough of the pro-racists died off and even then some likely political maneuvering by Prophet Kimball.  When the "revelation" to change the doctrine came, Mark Peterson was coincidently in South America on an extended assignment, and Stapley was in the hospital, so neither was in the room when the remaining Q14 received the revelation.    * The Mormon church would also have been aware that Bob Jones University had recently lost its tax exempt status due to race discrimination.	1643387156.0	hulljhm	t3_ser2qk	t3_ser2qk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/hulljhm/

8w886	And as the original response has been deleted here’s my response to that:  It’s not intended as apologia, but an attempt at an evenhanded discussion of the topic of Brigham Young. While my degree is in Mormon History, I’m not LDS myself. Likewise I personally entirely deplore Young’s sentiments.   A discussion of Young must include the environment he existed in. It’s not apologia to recognize that nearly everyone in the US in the 1850s would be considered a radical racist by today’s standards; but within that environment there’s still grades of racism. Young was far from an abolitionist, but he was seen as a reformer. And the slave code Utah issued under his direction, was the most “liberal” of the time and included provisions for things like: all slaves had to be educated at their owner’s expense; slaves couldn’t be sold without their consent; having sex with a slave automatically freed the slave; and so forth. A proper discussion of Young needs to include that as well, and not just be a salacious retelling of his worst statements on race; of which there *are* many.	1643389358.0	hulrjdo	t3_ser2qk	t1_huloqh6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/hulrjdo/

ee9qku7x	Thank you for your answers.  I seem to remember that there was also a campaign against the communist party when it was gaining momentum.  Was some of the antisemitism mobilized to denigrate and create fear towards the communist party as well as some false accusations claiming the communist party had been involved with some bombings?	1643393456.0	hum2niy	t3_se888r	t1_hukbj8d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se888r/were_1920s_citizens_of_germany_surrounded_by/hum2niy/

And finally in Mexico you’ll find that because of those 2 things Mexico used political machines and sidestepped voting and that resulted in them squandering their miraculous growth while still remaining in power	1643394170.0	hum4k6t	t3_seqzop	t3_seqzop	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seqzop/in_the_period_from_1940_to_80_mexico_was_one_of/hum4k6t/

Until relatively recently, it was thought to be just a myth -- until we found the remains of said giant bird.  Turns out the stories were true.  https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/maori-legend-of-man-eating-bird-is-true/QRUOJKCF524QMJKX5P7SMTGO2Y/	1643394743.0	hum645g	t3_sddlk2	t3_sddlk2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hum645g/
hiactl6c	Brilliant!  Excellent summation of a complex subject.  What are your thoughts about the power of the volk's feelings that their hyperinflation and other economic disasters were the current Germans paying for the mistakes of a previous government and previous generation?  I find a lot of legitimacy in those feelings, and a large body of facts can be used to support those feelings.  Many explanations can be spun from that body of facts, and the Nazi spun a scapegoating narrative which appealed to feelings and emotions rather than reason.   When continuing those more reasonable approaches became more and more untenable, the "feel good" Nazis stepped into that vacuum with equally untenable approaches, but those approach "felt good" and gave short term returns.  How far off-base am I?	1643395033.0	hum6w2f	t3_se888r	t1_hukbj8d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se888r/were_1920s_citizens_of_germany_surrounded_by/hum6w2f/
f8k0c	You are probably thinking of the Reichstagsbrand, the fire burning down the Reichstag on February 28th 1933 caused by arson. The left leaning Marinus van der Lubbe was arrested for it and always stated that he was the sole perpetrator, but the are doubts as to whether this is true, and that the Nazis has an active part in it.   It did result in the law essentially legalizing political imprisonment, eradicating the last chance of preventing the Nazis from seizing total control.	1643396629.0	humb6hd	t3_se888r	t1_hum2niy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se888r/were_1920s_citizens_of_germany_surrounded_by/humb6hd/
ee9qku7x	I believe that is it.  Pretty sure it was buried in a Walter Benjamin piece of writing context.

wtdos	A lot of civilian ocean liners were requisitioned and made into troop transports, hospital ships, things of that nature; their high speeds gave them an advantage against submarines over your typical cargo ship. But yes, the movement of supplies from the US and Canada to Britain and the Soviet Union was pretty much the primary focus of the Battle of the Atlantic. The Allies operated hundreds of extensive convoys primarily guarded by cruisers, destroyers, destroyer escorts and their equivalents, and escort carriers; and thousands upon thousands of cargo ships were built in order to keep that supply chain going.	1643400366.0	huml34a	t3_sewxbj	t3_sewxbj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sewxbj/when_did_civilian_ships_stop_sailing_across_the/huml34a/
13prl7	It occurred after the airforce was split from the army in 1947.  Gen. Hamilton Howze was assigned to the army air corps (which flew choppers mainly) to develop doctrine for this relatively new weapon. Apparently his ideas for chopper doctrine reminded him of the way Indian tribes fought. The H13 Sioux (popularly known as the MASH chopper) became the first helicopter to be named for a Indian tribe since the general found the names of previous helicopters to benign.  From there it became tradition and was actually laid down as a naming instruction in Army Regulation 70-28 in 1969. I’m not 100% sure on this but I recall something about it being in its predecessor AR705-14 from 1963 as well, which in turn was a conformation of DA Memo 705-3 from 1959. These should be available from the pentagon digital library (or at least they were a few years ago I have them saved somewhere I’m sure but I can’t find them. Yes my digital collection is a mess)  These regulations specifically stated that Army aircraft needed to be named for Indian terms and names of American Indian tribes and chiefs.      https://www.defense.gov/News/Inside-DOD/Blog/article/2052989/why-army-helicopters-have-native-american-names/  https://medium.com/war-is-boring/everyone-relax-the-armys-native-american-helicopter-names-are-not-racist-d21beb55d782	1643400746.0	humm2sx	t3_set23j	t3_set23j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/set23j/why_are_so_many_helicopter_in_the_us_military/humm2sx/
169ceaep	It may also be informative to read Truman's radio report on the Potsdam Conference, given on August 9th (the date of the Nagasaki bombing), which includes reaffirmations of the Yalta conference's commitments to democratic government, free press, and the independence of Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, "not to be in the sphere of influence of any one power."  Given the timing of these statements, Stalin could clearly see the barbs being directed towards Soviet influence in Eastern and Central Europe. I believe that Byrnes also made similar statements to that effect shortly afterwards. Thus, even after the end of the war in Europe, the US continued to affirm its commitment to democratic processes and independence in the former Axis occupied and satellite states. Given the state of the Soviet economy, the US military presence in Central Europe, and the lack of nuclear parity at the time, the Soviets were forced to tread more lightly than they may otherwise have.	1643401093.0	hummzjg	t3_sev0i4	t1_hum8nt4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sev0i4/why_did_the_soviet_union_run_poland_and_east/hummzjg/
eblrg66o	You got that all wrong. First, there has been only been one religion since the times of Adam. (i.e. Following the guidance from the Almighty creator). All the prophets (Adam, Idris, Noah. Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Moses, David, Solomon Jesus and finally Muhammad(saw)) all taught us the same message. The only difference is that people in earlier times were primitive and thus the message was simple, and as humanity progressed the message became more refined. When humankind entered the era of science and technology Almighty God sent the final message to last us until the end of our existence on earth. Prophet Joseph passed mos of his life in Egypt during the times of Pharaohs.	1643401638.0	humofsx	t3_sejzgk	t3_sejzgk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sejzgk/ive_heard_that_ancient_egyptian_religion_had/humofsx/
