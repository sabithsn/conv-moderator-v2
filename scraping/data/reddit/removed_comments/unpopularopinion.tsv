agnbs9vd	It's not bullshit.  It's the scientific consensus, and for that reason is present in the WPATH Standards of Care (page 11) and the DSM-5 (page 455).  While multiple studies covering decades of research demonstrate the desistence phenomenon, there have been **no** published studies which demonstrate otherwise.  The most recent research only confirms it.  There are critiques of the research, but it has been defended [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15532739.2018.1468292) and [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325443416_The_myth_of_persistence_Response_to_A_critical_commentary_on_follow-up_studies_and_'desistance'_theories_about_transgender_and_gender_non-conforming_children_by_Temple_Newhook_et_al_2018/link/5b0e88414585157f8722b622/download).	1641134096.0	hqxr3jk	t3_rr0obg	t1_hqxisxd	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rr0obg/lgbtq_mega_thread/hqxr3jk/

4e1iqntp	I bet you're an unmarried man. Men generally start complaining about this in their 30s and 40s unless they have wives who take on the entire mental burden of planning their social/vacation lives (a task which men rarely appreciate, nor thank their wives for). So my unasked for advice which you will never take is that you must start doing the social planning for yourself. Throw parties, ask people out to plays and movies, ask people to accompany you for dinner and coffee. Planning social time, you would soon see, is real work. Yet if you neglect it, as surely as your body turns to shit from not exercising, your spirit turns to shit from not socializing.

4f9df1w6	weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don’t contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups’ beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I’ve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there’s a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It’s also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say “fine” when asked how he’s doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I’ve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of “gender” or why it’s a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you’ve said about sex is true - that doesn’t mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"	1642575509.0	htaf3ly	t3_s7j4tx	t1_hta9m60	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htaf3ly/

I can also link you to a page that defines racism to mean that POC cant be racist because the definition of racism is prejudice + power.   Here's one from an actual dictionary: Gender: "either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones."

By decision to not use the pronouns is not based on fear or laziness, but on respect for the truth of which the identity that trans people claim is not.	1642588714.0	htawdf7	t3_s7j4tx	t1_htavfgi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htawdf7/

iinfff68	As someone who was in the pizza industry for ten years, you’re wrong.     We don’t obsessively call them pies - a pizza is still a pizza - but when we’re talking business, we use the term “pie” because it’s shorter than “pizza”. And it also feels better to use some of the hyphenated jargon with “pie” instead of “pizza”.     The two most prominent examples of this are the terms “pie-hour” and “X-pie”, where X is an integer equivalent to the number of pizzas in an order. Pie-hours are used to denote how many pizzas were made in an hour of business, and are a great way of showcasing how busy peak hours are.    So when you think of the terms “pie-hour” and “pizza-hour”, not only is one shorter, but that same one also feels way better to say. Additionally, when you say something like “I’ve got a 40-pie at six PM”, that also feels way better than saying “I’ve got a 40-pizza order at six PM”.     **TLDR: professionals use the term “pie” in their jargon because it’s easier, flows better, and takes less time**	1642613713.0	htccx1r	t3_s7dh4k	t3_s7dh4k	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7dh4k/people_who_call_pizzas_pie_are_holding_society/htccx1r/

etxdf22i	There needs to be “kids free” flights.  Had a mother sit behind me with her two kids who were probably 6 and 4 years old. It was a 6 am flight and she gave them each a whistle which they loudly and proudly blew at 6 fucking am!!  She took the whistles away after several passengers complained which then resulted in her kids screaming, crying, and kicking my seat which then resulted in her yelling at them to “shut up or you are going to get kicked off this flight.” She eventually gave up and let her kids play kickboxing with my seat.  I would pay extra money to never be on a flight with kids again. Not all kids are bad but that was the worst 2 hour flight of my life.   I say between 7 pm to 7 am kids shouldn’t be allowed on flights. 🤷🏼‍♀️	1642742362.0	htk8ic5	t3_s92rlw	t3_s92rlw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s92rlw/there_should_be_an_age_limit_for_passengers_on/htk8ic5/

WOW.  https://m.imgur.com/a/QKlMwDB  People that rape because they are unable to control their sexual impulses (literally said so himself in his Facebook post) belong in prison or at the minimum in some sort facility where someone can make sure he never rapes again.

Doreen admits to not caring about boundaries and having impulse control issues then goes on about how they're a victim with ptsd for molesting and purposely making people uncomfortable by jerking off beside them.    We don't know the details of the rape situation in particular because Doreen didn't go into detail   Edit: also this came out in 2020 apparently and Doreen was dropped from some website or article because of the allegations.

gda1993x	>that someone else kicked her for no reason  Are you insane?  Where did I mention a reason or no reason?  Were you there???  Do I think it was her fault?  100 percent?   No I don't.  But as they say, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  I am getting pretty sick of people treating women as if they are too dysfunctional to make proper decisions about who to date.    Or maybe I should say, either put them in that dysfunctional camp or be consistent that they are actually capable of personal responsibility.  Damn.  Which is it?  Choose.  I wasn't there when my future wife was attacked.  And I wasn't there when Rihanna was attacked.    But I feel pretty sure THE SIGNS were there.   And I will happily hold them both accountable for ignoring THE SIGNS.  I have seen women do this all my life.   That's why I decided to become the nice guy that never does that to a woman.  You know what my reward was?  NOTHING!    Women never beat my door down for that!  So I had to backtrack and become a different kind of man.   Then I started getting women.  But guess what?  I stopped being a White Knight in the process.  Women want respect.  They get to earn it, just like men.    Women want sympathy?  Well how much will depend on their own actions and decisions.   OBVIOUSLY.	1643375674.0	huktqqv	t3_se0zv0	t1_hugq0d0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/se0zv0/chris_browns_popularity_goes_to_show_how_sick/huktqqv/

dcsqpp3b	VERY UNPOPULAR OPINION on Reddit: All these new 'genders' and 'sexes' are not 'real'. Just because these edgy kids imagine them, its not real. Schizophrenic people often can't live without imaginary people, same with these new 'gendermania' kids - its a trend and its gonna go away within a few decades. A popular argument is "Gender is a social construct and it is different from sex". First, many of these 'new gender' guys don't think so. They are pretty aggressive that Biology is on their side and these new genders are natural and scientifically true (I literally know no researcher apart from researchers in the West who gives a shit about these new array of genders). Second 'THATS THE FUCKING POINT'. Its a social construct, like religion and ideologies. They are NOT real. Get over them.  Also, these new genders have the habit of celebrating 'femininity' and rejects masculinity as 'toxic'. Trust me Americans, in the long run this is gonna prove disastrous. The whole world is angry with US - Russia, China, Islamic countries like Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Indonesia, etc. and here these new gender people are trying to make the US Army more feminine because of hippie impulse "Let's not fight, let's not engage in war, let there be peace". Once US Army becomes sufficiently weak, given the internal Republican-Democrat divide and the anger of foreign nations, its a matter of time before US gets gangbanged badly. And LGBT will be the cause of it. Mark my words.	1644082201.0	hvpykci	t3_sih98g	t3_sih98g	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sih98g/lgbtq_mega_thread/hvpykci/

3a1sujv4	LGBTQ+ is a trend.  This started 2y ago, everyone became gay all of the sudden. Especially teenage girls. Im not homophobic, however, this is all bs. When i was young nobody cared if you were gay or not, and whoever was gay was trully gay. Today, there are dozens of made up genders and sexualities and each time a new one appears it seems to be more ridiculos than the others, everybody makes up sexualities and genders just to be more unique, but if they all become gay doesent that means that being gay now wont make you any different. Ive met around 30 bisexual girls irl and none of them had any attraction to the female gender, theyre all coming out just so they can make part of the lgbtq community.Why is everyone coming out all of the sudden? Why did everybody just came out simultaneously in this 2y period? I have no problem whatsoever with gay people, i also have 2-3 "gay" friends, theyre all super nice people but joining a group that promotes you being your trueself by forcing yourself to be gay and forcing homosexuality on everybody and everything just defeates the purpose. A lot of companies now glorify pride month by adding lgbt on everything. Why did they start gloryfying pride month so much exactly 2y ago? Why didnt they do that longer ago? I also want to add how much i hate gay people whose personaliy revolves around their sexuality. Why do you need to tell everybody that youre gay or that youre trans, and why do you need the pride flag on everything you posses so much? Why do you make gay ships of straight characters? Why does everything that you like has to include something lgbt or else its bad? Why does it bother you so much that im straight? Why. Do. You. Glorify. Homosexuality. So. Much? Its just your sexual preferance, no need to force it upon this world. If youre gay im glad for you, but i couldnt care less, just as i couldnt care less if somebody is straight. I know im gonna get downvoted to hell but its my opinion.	1644330466.0	hw32fcb	t3_sih98g	t3_sih98g	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sih98g/lgbtq_mega_thread/hw32fcb/

1ae7vrnn	I've tried to express this to people numerous times.  I'm from California, lived in the bay area and southern California.  $20 is still $20 for the most part, but when you start looking at the cost of living 100k isn't really a lot.  Like, it's enough to be comfortable, but you aren't going to be buying a house with that.    And everyone saying "Just move to not-california where it's a lot cheaper".  That's actually a lot harder than people realize.  As soon as you move out you are going to be makinng less money, which means moving back would be hard, and I love California.  Also, there aren't a lot of jobs for someone like me just randomly scattered through the country, I don't have a huge amount of "work from home" options in my field.  Like, I have a lot of options to do some work from home, but I need to be close to the lab/office so I can still go in.  Also, I would probably get depressed living in a super flat, not much to do region.  I know everywhere offers something, but, there honestly just isn't going to be much for me in Kansas.  I like where I live, it's pretty fucking expensive, especially because of how close to the ocean I want to live, which still is like a mile away, and it's shitty, but the weather is mostly good so I don't need a hhouse with a ton of beneficial things to it.    Like, I would prefer to make ~500k where I live now, especially if I was starting a family.  100k is enough, but it's stretching things thin and giving up a lot, 250k is on the lower end of house buying power around here, but I think that would be fairly comfortable, and a decent bench mark.  We can take buying a house out of consideration for this argument, because while I do want to buy, the market is pretty fucking skewed right now, which, might change in the future, but it also might not.	1644334648.0	hw3cijc	t3_sn6c84	t1_hw1louk	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sn6c84/250k_is_the_new_six_figures/hw3cijc/

It only took a hundred to reach 7 billion in 2009 and in 2022 we're already approaching 8 billion. That nagging in your head is just the desire to procreate and have sex, and ignore something that's clearly our of control. Like any other below average dingleberry you want to believe what's easiest, and most convenient and spread this lie for your own benefit. You want to throw your support to the patriarchal slash and burn everything fuck-till-were-fucked "common good" classical belief system. You don't want to give it up. So you read all the evidence you can to convince yourself you don't have parasitic inclinations. That or your head is screwed on so completely wrong you couldn't use your gut to read a bad situation if your life depended on it. You really have to give ZERO fucks about environmental collapse or the way the offspring themselves get left to build something from a world that's been used up.	1644347624.0	hw4c0bk	t3_snr7l4	t1_hw45wax	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/snr7l4/the_overpopulation_prediction_is_wrong/hw4c0bk/

Just because you think you are something dosent make you to it. Man and woman is not a social construct but nature. Then those Poeple say "but things change bigot" like yeah things change but mostly technology and the enviroment. If we look at greek Philosophy the toughts in us are almost the same as today. The only thing that could be a social contruct is that woman is the color pink and man the color blue. But being pissed that your parents bought you a pink wall and pink Chairs is kind of disrispectfull that they put themselves in a victim mentality just to validate thier view. heck it even starts to be normal in acadamics to tolerate everything no matter what.

i7fzpesu	This woman is quite professional, IMO. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAb8m9K3GRI  Here is the text review:  >Everything is great but the dialogue, which is amateurish. Also the vulgar humor is not funny and too pervasive. Still, this is entertaining adult fantasy animation.  When Scanlan levitated himself up i had a laugh.  When the barbarian raged the animation style changed slightly and it had this speed effect that i thought was amazingly perfect and will always stick with me.  I think most nerds are too harsh critiquing fantasy. You can't expect it to be on par with the best dramas.  I didn't like it that much but it was on par with Dragonlance so i would rate it high.  With that said have you watched Deer Stalker? https://www.youtube.com/c/deerstalkerpictures  They're the best. Their content is incredibly good i can't say enough good things about it.

2dxpv547	Adding to your point. Our biggest cultural changes as a species seems to always be in the wake of some massive technology boon.  People worked in serfdom until the industrial age and then the beginning of the 40 hour work week was born. As the tech increased more people were added to the job force, after a generation a farm family now works in factories. Another generation and they've unionized and expanded the factory output via manufacturing lines. Another generation and more people are receiving higher education- getting into fields making tech to make our lives easier.  100 year ago you *had* to have someone stay home and work the homestead, while someone brought in the income. The act of making dinner for 2 probably took a few hours alone. Imagine housework without vacuums, washers, dryers, plastics, sprays, swifters.  Even masculinity and feminity aren't the same as they were 100 years ago... hell even 30 years ago.	1644526222.0	hwf1z08	t3_spf0qv	t1_hwes93s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/spf0qv/child_birth_being_labeled_as_a_masculine/hwf1z08/
9j0s0f8y	Thats correct but our behavoir changes. But that dosent have anything to do about our sex. There are just things that are foundamental and as i sayd if you look at old greek philosophy you clearly see that the most things about the human itself where the same thounsands of year ago. And if some poeple say something else it should be clear that they got into the wrong path. And if you put everything about society together you can clearly see that it is.

You can't argue people into being less or more attracted to the people they are or aren't attracted to. As a man, I don't talk about what women should find attractive in a man because it's not up to me and my opinion doesn't matter. They're going to be attracted to what they're going to be attracted to and I just have to deal with that in one way or another.	1644905167.0	hx065wj	t3_ssu6le	t1_hx05uf2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ssu6le/i_think_pretty_girls_just_look_fake/hx065wj/

7kc4tcfz	Try to send a vagina pic. The guys would say you "thank you" and this would make you understand why they send dick pics in the first place. They are straight dudes and would totally like if a girl sent them nudes. So they falsely assume that women would like their dick as well. That's mostly a result of this "equality" mindset. They don't realize that men and women are different. You do understand that (at least unconsciously), this is why you didn't sent those men the pic of your vagina but the pic of another man's dick.	1644905971.0	hx07c78	t3_ssgh28	t3_ssgh28	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ssgh28/i_think_its_time_we_normalize_sending_dick_pics/hx07c78/

4z5l88pt	Well I do not drink or smoke. Never have. I consider vape to be a baby soother substitute and call it that too. I have my own interest and always  have had friends, but I also have a very hard time socializing with larger population just because we have different interest and levels of maturity. I think you have a valid point, but you also need to realize that different people mature at different ages and some never mature at all. At 14 many are just little kids thinking that they are adult and they will cringe at that sort of behavior later on. You have just matured earlier then most, or maybe were born that way like I was. If you want to find like minded people try joining some sports. I have found that most people training in martial arts are more like minded and mature.	1644919230.0	hx0o8l5	t3_ssyydp	t3_ssyydp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ssyydp/owning_a_vape_doesnt_make_you_cool_you_like_like/hx0o8l5/

The companies don't wanna lose their slots so they dump tons and tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, but I'm a prick if I drive to the shops instead of carrying my whole weeks shop home myself. 😂😂  Oh and on that note I heard about an experiment a fella did with gps tags on his recycling and found out most of it ended up in the ocean anyway.

The psychological institution was browbeat into obeying the liberal mob. You can choose to believe me or you can choose to believe that I am lying and I CHOSE TO BE TRANS.  Ah yes look at me the rigorous transphobe  who says that we should have a medical definition and requirement for trans people because otherwise people can CHOOSE to be trans and THAT is how we get 1  Castrated from society and 2. That is how conversion camps  become justified. If there isn't a medical reason then it is a just disordered thinking and behavior that can be fixed in the same way we can get people to be more organized.	1644925233.0	hx0vua8	t3_so6dye	t1_hx0uo86	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/so6dye/lgbtq_mega_thread/hx0vua8/

No one Is pirating from a big corporation just because they want to, odds are the company is shit or treats their workers terribly, or is just not an entity one wants to support.   So people pirate their stuff, refusing to give them money, it's no different than a boycott.   It sounds more like you just want to whine and scream "socialism bad" and there are other subs for that.   It is morally correct to not support companies that are doing morally corrupt acts, and considering most major companies and corporations are immorally exploiting someone, somewhere down the line, well you can easily do the math there.

It has nothing to do with relationships and everything to do with fact there was a time period were everyone thought they needed to have 8-13 kids to keep the society going and then all of those kids survived thinking they needed to have 8-13 kids, creating the post industrial revolution world we have now. People also stopped dying in coal mines and factories, there was no need to have 10 kids but people didn’t know that and so they did. The population is 7.9 billion at the moment, so if you wanted to round you’d round up at say 8 billion by the way.  Not my point. I know this. You are correct.  >PDA has nothing to do with showing anyone anything, I have social anxiety and find comfort in being closer to my boyfriend. Don’t deserve to get called slurs over it. Quite frankly you just sound single and bitter.  Being closer and shoving tongues into each other's throats are two different things. I don't mind a couple hugging or holding hands.

jlhwuq8v	I personally think Sandy Hook was a farce and another example of how the Joker was right.  Nobody ever panics if things go according to plan.  Even if the plan itself is horrifying.  If I said a suicide bomber would target a bazaar in the Middle East or an African village would be raped by rebels, nobody panics.  Because it's all part of the plan.  But one little schoolyard in a suburban neighborhood gets shot up...and everyone loses their minds!	1645031178.0	hx70kgm	t3_su0sc5	t3_su0sc5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/su0sc5/remington_shouldnt_have_been_sued_for_sandy_hook/hx70kgm/
