gn42675g	Refusing to yield to faster traffic is more dangerous than speeding.  There is nothing more infuriating than being in the middle of a multi-hour road trip and having someone in the left lane who will not move over to let you by, despite going under the speed limit.  What makes the most sense is that you must yield to overtaking traffic if you are in any lane except the right lane (i.e. passing lanes).  For some reason, some people are either unaware that there are other cars on the road or they feel entitled to dictate the flow of traffic. Slow traffic not moving out of the passing lanes is what causes traffic jams and accidents due to many people passing on the right.  Slow driving in passing lanes is oblivious at best, usually inconsiderate, and dangerous at worst. Let the speeders do their thing in passing lanes, and let highway patrol do their jobs.	1640904533.0	hqlvla2	t3_rr0obi	t3_rr0obi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rr0obi/politics_mega_thread/hqlvla2/

Men generally start complaining about this in their 30s and 40s unless they have wives who take on the entire mental burden of planning their social/vacation lives (a task which men rarely appreciate, nor thank their wives for). So my unasked for advice which you will never take is that you must start doing the social planning for yourself. Throw parties, ask people out to plays and movies, ask people to accompany you for dinner and coffee. Planning social time, you would soon see, is real work. Yet if you neglect it, as surely as your body turns to shit from not exercising, your spirit turns to shit from not socializing.

4f9df1w6	weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don’t contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups’ beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I’ve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there’s a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It’s also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say “fine” when asked how he’s doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I’ve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of “gender” or why it’s a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you’ve said about sex is true - that doesn’t mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"	1642575509.0	htaf3ly	t3_s7j4tx	t1_hta9m60	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7j4tx/lgbtq_mega_thread/htaf3ly/

I can also link you to a page that defines racism to mean that POC cant be racist because the definition of racism is prejudice + power.   Here's one from an actual dictionary: Gender: "either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones."

So for the millionth time, I choose not to use pronouns that trans people claim to be theirs because I do not believe those are the correct pronouns for reasons previously mentioned.

iinfff68	As someone who was in the pizza industry for ten years, you’re wrong.     We don’t obsessively call them pies - a pizza is still a pizza - but when we’re talking business, we use the term “pie” because it’s shorter than “pizza”. And it also feels better to use some of the hyphenated jargon with “pie” instead of “pizza”.     The two most prominent examples of this are the terms “pie-hour” and “X-pie”, where X is an integer equivalent to the number of pizzas in an order. Pie-hours are used to denote how many pizzas were made in an hour of business, and are a great way of showcasing how busy peak hours are.    So when you think of the terms “pie-hour” and “pizza-hour”, not only is one shorter, but that same one also feels way better to say. Additionally, when you say something like “I’ve got a 40-pie at six PM”, that also feels way better than saying “I’ve got a 40-pizza order at six PM”.     **TLDR: professionals use the term “pie” in their jargon because it’s easier, flows better, and takes less time**	1642613713.0	htccx1r	t3_s7dh4k	t3_s7dh4k	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s7dh4k/people_who_call_pizzas_pie_are_holding_society/htccx1r/

etxdf22i	There needs to be “kids free” flights.  Had a mother sit behind me with her two kids who were probably 6 and 4 years old. It was a 6 am flight and she gave them each a whistle which they loudly and proudly blew at 6 fucking am!!  She took the whistles away after several passengers complained which then resulted in her kids screaming, crying, and kicking my seat which then resulted in her yelling at them to “shut up or you are going to get kicked off this flight.” She eventually gave up and let her kids play kickboxing with my seat.  I would pay extra money to never be on a flight with kids again. Not all kids are bad but that was the worst 2 hour flight of my life.   I say between 7 pm to 7 am kids shouldn’t be allowed on flights. 🤷🏼‍♀️	1642742362.0	htk8ic5	t3_s92rlw	t3_s92rlw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s92rlw/there_should_be_an_age_limit_for_passengers_on/htk8ic5/

WOW.  https://m.imgur.com/a/QKlMwDB  People that rape because they are unable to control their sexual impulses (literally said so himself in his Facebook post) belong in prison or at the minimum in some sort facility where someone can make sure he never rapes again.

Doreen admits to not caring about boundaries and having impulse control issues then goes on about how they're a victim with ptsd for molesting and purposely making people uncomfortable by jerking off beside them.    We don't know the details of the rape situation in particular because Doreen didn't go into detail   Edit: also this came out in 2020 apparently and Doreen was dropped from some website or article because of the allegations.

Or maybe I should say, either put them in that dysfunctional camp or be consistent that they are actually capable of personal responsibility.  Damn.  Which is it?  Choose.  I wasn't there when my future wife was attacked.  And I wasn't there when Rihanna was attacked.    But I feel pretty sure THE SIGNS were there.   And I will happily hold them both accountable for ignoring THE SIGNS.  I have seen women do this all my life.   That's why I decided to become the nice guy that never does that to a woman.  You know what my reward was?  NOTHING!    Women never beat my door down for that!  So I had to backtrack and become a different kind of man.   Then I started getting women.  But guess what?  I stopped being a White Knight in the process.  Women want respect.  They get to earn it, just like men.    Women want sympathy?  Well how much will depend on their own actions and decisions.   OBVIOUSLY.	1643375674.0	huktqqv	t3_se0zv0	t1_hugq0d0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/se0zv0/chris_browns_popularity_goes_to_show_how_sick/huktqqv/

gda1993x	>Ok, so what choice are women making that cause them to get physically and sexually abused?  Dating men with red flags all over them.  Even dating men or hanging out with men with clear and known histories of abuse...like....ahem....Chris Brown.  I am not running a free sympathy booth.    They can chase victimhood without dragging me into it.  They can also do it without involving everyone's legal system.  And frankly, this case REEKS of gold digging.	1643376020.0	hukufn0	t3_se0zv0	t1_hugpda2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/se0zv0/chris_browns_popularity_goes_to_show_how_sick/hukufn0/

This is an issue everywhere that doesn’t just around “angering chuds” or “owning libs”   Also if I was indeed talking about that, why would you be angry about me giving out my opinion that these types of people are harming discussions about lgbt and BLM issues? How does acting exactly like the people you hate help you or your cause exactly?

My state I live in does require it and it’s $35 every year to tie up my car for an hour and a half for something that should take less than 10 minutes.  Some states also have registration fees and have to re-register the car every so often. My theory behind why they charge what they charge and make you re-register your car every so often it’s just another money grabbing scheme from the average citizen	1643387066.0	hullas0	t3_ser87k	t1_hulc92g	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ser87k/suburban_sprawl_makes_the_us_a_terrible_place_to/hullas0/
