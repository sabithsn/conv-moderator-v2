y03e0	In support of your point, it is important to remember that criticism of the armament of WWII tanks frequently boils down to comparing penetration values to the frontal armor of the heaviest German tanks. Given the proportion of German units who had zero tanks of any kind, and in fact would have been more or less recognizable to their forefathers in 1918, the HE rounds are important. And rather than worrying about Tiger II frontal armor, if a round can punch a Pz IV or Stug III, it can take on the vast majority of armored vehicles that would appear in their sights.	1642692580.0	htgvayl	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfxm6l	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htgvayl/
w9ir1	Preemptively clearing some confusion: حرام (with a long second a) and حرم (with a short a) are separate words, but they are related. The first term is *haram* from *halal/haram*. The second term is the one referring to the household.  To continue. Yes, subordinate rulers, princes, noblemen, even minor landlords, had a *haram* (or *zenanah* as it is called in Persian). How many people populated this household and how prosperous it was naturally depended on the man's standing and wealth. In other words, those who could afford to have separate quarters for their womenfolk, had them.   That means that a poor Punjabi farmer with a wife and son would not have a *haram*. His landlord would.  This whole practise of seclusion, veiling, concealment etc. is called *pardah* (Persian for "curtain")  Lastly, in the subcontinent, *pardah* was/is practised by Muslims and some upper-caste Hindus.	1642692920.0	htgw65y	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htf6g9x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/htgw65y/

2ycwtyy0	I apologize if this comment is not considered in-depth enough for the subreddit, but I'll give it my best shot.  First, we know that the Chinese were using some sort of postal system well before the 1800s, if only because Marco Polo wrote about it. Marco Polo describes in his *Travels* that the postal system comprised of a series of waypoints that the letters would be delivered to-- a messenger would travel to the designated postal area, hand off the letter, and then another messenger with a fresh horse would then deliver it to the next area, and so on until it finally reached its destination.  &#x200B;  >At each station four hundred good horses are kept in constant readiness, in order that all messengers going and coming upon the business of the grand khan, and all ambassadors, may have relays, and, leaving their jaded horses, be supplied with fresh ones. Even in mountainous districts, remote from the great roads, where there were no villages, and the towns are far distant from each other, his majesty has equally caused buildings of the same kind to be erected, furnished with every thing necessary, and provided with the usual establishment of horses. He sends people to dwell upon the spot, in order to cultivate the land, and attend to the service of the post; by which means large villages are formed. In consequence of these regulations, ambassadors to the court, and the royal messengers, go and return through every province and kingdom of the empire with the greatest convenience and facility...    >   >\[...\]   >   >In the intermediate space between the post-houses, there are small villages settled at the distance of every three miles, which may contain, one with another, about forty cottages. In these are stationed the foot-messengers, likewise employed in the service of his majesty. They were girdles around their waists, to which several small bells are attached, in order that their coming may be perceived at a distance; and as they run only three miles, that is, from one of these footstations to another next adjoining, the noise serves to give notice of their approach, and preparation is accordingly made by a fresh courier to proceed with the packet instantly upon the arrival of the former... at each of these three-mile stations there is a clerk, whose business it is to note the day and hour at wich one courier arrives and the other departs; which is likewise done at all the post-houses.   >   >***- The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian*** (translated by Thomas Wright, 2002)  While Marco Polo is obviously describing a messenger relay system being used by the Great Khan to correspond with other important peoples, that might not be considered sufficient enough of an answer, because it seems you're asking how normal people would write letters to one another.  Your average layperson was not able to use this postal system. It is only being used to deliver correspondence to government officials or would-be government officials. In that case, it's just a matter of knowing who the recipient is and which district they reside in.  &#x200B;  >There was a well-established old order which met the needs of the Chinese state and people on a pre-modern basis. The state had its long established official post, a far flung network of post stations on major routes over which horse relays carried couriers with official communications, as well as personages, and goods.   >   >\[...\]   >   >Although the system was very efficient by pre-modern standards, it had become increasingly inadequate by the late Ch'ing period. Besides, the official postal system served exclusively the needs of the government; postal service for private individuals varied with the locale. A city-dweller could enjoy the luxury of having his mail delivered or picked up by a courier at his house or his place of business and transmitted safely to any part of China at reasonable cost by the commercial letter agencies, *(min*) *hsin-chii*, called hongs by Westerners. For those living in the interior or in certain rural areas, however, courier facilities were either infrequent or non-existent. Very often, letters were sent by special messengers or were entrusted to muleteers, chair-bearers, travelers and the like because couriers and letter agencies tended to operate only in large towns and along routes where there was a sufficient volume of commercial correspondence to make it profitable.   >   >\[...\]   >   >Because of the importance attached to official correspondence, no Chinese government extended the use of the postal system to the people.

Main post routes radiated from Peking, connecting it with all provincial capitals where resided the governors-general, governors, commissioners, and commanders-in chief. Subsidiary post routes formed numerous networks around each district. Along the five main routes, at intervals of about 100 li, were post stations with horses and other facilities, and on subsidiary routes, at intervals of approximately fifteen to twenty-five li, were foot-courier stations.   >   >***- Postal Communication in China and Its Modernization 1860-1896***by Ying-Wan Cheng; East Asian Research Center Harvard University (1970)  &#x200B;  So, if you're a low-ranking Chinese official who lives in a huge metropolitan area, and you want to deliver your letter to another official, what you do is go to the postal station and hand the courier your letter. You tell him who it is to be delivered to and which district they live in. He then runs off to the next station, and hands it off to the next guy. So on and so forth until it eventually reaches the correct station. Once there, a foot courier then goes to the official's house or place of work and hands the letter to them.	1642693791.0	htgyf3d	t3_s88meg	t3_s88meg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htgyf3d/

8brve	"Historiography" is basically "the history of history." It's how historians have argued about history over the years. So it's a good place to start if you are thinking about doing history in a serious way, but it is also somewhat daunting because there is a lot to learn and a lot of historiography can feel pretty theoretical and obtuse if you are not steeped in these old academic debates.  For the history of science, I would recommend looking into how historians of science talk about doing their work, and what the goals and methods of the history of science are. These are often quite different from how scientists talk about their own history, and very different from how history is integrated into a scientific curriculum. The goal of history in a science class, for example, is to situate the future-scientist in understanding how the current theories were developed, so it is a "march of winners" (and usually a few big names who are meant to represent what it means to be a scientist — so in a physics/astronomy class you get the classic Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, Newton procession). In the serious study of the history of science, we don't assume that there is a smooth transition between old ideas and new ideas (often the new ideas are quite different than the old ones, even when they use the same terms), and we also are interested in the "losers" of history as well (you can't really understand Galileo without understand Christoph Clavius, for example; Clavius was the dominant Jesuit astronomer in Galileo's time, and would have written the text books that Galileo himself would have learned from, and was the chief arbiter of how the Church would respond to Galileo's claims, and so he's super important to understanding who Galileo thought he was talking to and how his claims were received). Historians of science are also very interested in peeling back the practice of science from the idea that it is just about "big ideas" or "big discoveries" done by "big men." There's always been a lot more to scientific practice than that version of things, if you care about how it actually happened.  ANYWAY. The above are just some examples of "baseline" historiographical assumptions by historians of science. There are many more ways to think about it. If I were preparing a very basic historiographical overview for someone looking to approach this topic seriously, it might include:  * Thomas Kuhn, _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ — a place to _start_ and not to _end_. Kuhn is the most famous philosopher/historian of science by _far_ but that is because he started a lot of conversations, not because he answered them. Most historians of science today are NOT Kuhnians. But he is a very useful introduction to thinking about what makes the history of science difficult to do, and some of his basic methodological arguments (like, you should try to understand how historical scientists understood their own work on its own terms — don't approach the past looking to show whether it is right or wrong according to modern scientific understanding, as that is not very productive/useful) hold up. Take his "model" of scientific revolutions with a grain of salt; most fields don't exhibit quite the dynamics that Kuhn argues for. And a lot of it is muddled.  * Ludwik Fleck, _Genesis and development of a scientific fact_ — is a precursor to Kuhn (a lot of people think Kuhn basically ripped off Fleck), and is worth reading after Kuhn, just to see how the same ideas are fleshed out in somewhat different (and arguably more sensitive) ways.   * Stephen Shapin and Simon Schaffer, _The Leviathan and the Air-Pump_ — a now-classic historical study of arguments about the nature of the vacuum in 17th century England. Even if you have no interest in 17th-century England, there are tons of methodological approaches being espoused here (you can roughly think of this approach as being very influenced by the SSK — Social Study of Knowledge — school of thinking), including how to think about how historical make claims to truth, the meaning and role of experiments and instruments, and the social nature of scientific discourse (who is allowed in a laboratory, and who is not? who is allowed to attend scientific meetings, and who is not? etc.). Overall a hugely influential book on how historians of science of all periods work today.  * Bruno Latour, _The Pasteurization of France_ — Latour is a sociologist/anthropologist, but a lot of the modern history of science is heavily influenced by insights from qualitative sociology and anthropology, and all historians of science have read this book. You don't have to love Latour (lots of historians don't)  but knowing about how Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is applied to the historical study of science is very important to making sense of a lot of modern history of science.   The above are just sort of the bog-standard texts that all historians of science will have probably read at some point (usually in graduate school). Beyond that you start to get into much more subject-specific histories. So if you were interested in the history of physics, you'd want to look at the writings of Peter Galison and his students (of which I am one). If you were interested in the history of biology, there is a whole other literature there depending on which angles you were looking at. And so on and so on, for any subfield or approach you can imagine.  Now, you're saying, crap. I didn't ask for how to become a graduate student in this field, and I'm not going to read 80 books before I start on my project. I hear you. But I would take a look (even a skim) at some of these resources. At the very least, read Kuhn, because he provides a LOT of discussions about how (and why) to do history of ideas, and that sounds relevant to what you are interested in.   Separately, there are books on how to do history _in general_ — not relating to the history of science. These cover things like, how to think critically about primary sources, what are primary and secondary sources, how to document your work through citation, etc. I believe the FAQ has some recommendations for these. This kind of stuff is useful (most of it is unsurprising, I think), but in a way I would emphasize the other historiographical stuff (e.g. Kuhn) a bit more. Because the hard part about doing history is not downloading all of the papers on a given topic and tracing through the footnotes — scientists do that all the time as part of their literature reviews — or going to an archive and saying, "show me all of the letter in this folder by this old scientist." The hard part is _making sense_ of these things in a way that doesn't commit serious errors (like attributing a modern understanding to a historical figure who thought about it very differently). And that's where the historiography will come into play.   Kuhn, for example, has an excellent discussion about why it is so difficult to answer question, "when was oxygen discovered, and by who?" You'd think it was simple, and the textbook version makes it seem like you can say, "on this date, Lavoisier or Priestly understood oxygen existed," but the reality is that the understanding of it emerged in pieces over a protracted period of time, and didn't "cohere" until a much later date. As a result it's one of those things that probably _doesn't_ have a distinct moment of discovery, but rather the idea of its "discovery" is sort of a backwards, after-the-fact narrative framing of what was actually a more complex and muddy process. This kind of stuff is important, because the "bad narrative" history of science gives us a poor understanding of the reality of how science works (and the consequences of that can be more than intellectual — no historian of science that I know was surprised that the CDC's understanding of how COVID-19 worked took a while to work out, but you can see that lots of people accustomed to a model of "scientists just get the right answer" lost a lot of faith seeing that play out in real time about something they cared about).	1642694530.0	hth0dq6	t3_s8kqxq	t3_s8kqxq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth0dq6/
esjzc	Why is Friday called 'Congregation Day' in Arabic?  I have looked at a previous Ask Historians thread about why Muslims congregate on Friday as well as searched online.  There is general agreement that the Quran commands muslims to congregate on 'Congregation Day' AKA Friday in Arabic, but this seems circular.  If Friday was already known as Congregation Day before this command, then why was that so? Was there a customary congregation on the 6th day in pre-Islamic Arabia? And if so, why the sixth day and for what purpose?  If Friday became known as Congregation Day AFTER the Quranic command, then why was the 6th day chosen?	1642694805.0	hth13gf	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hth13gf/

9x5qn2xl	Vikings avoided battles as much as they could, especially with the Franks due to their superior cavalry and weaponry. Instead they excelled in amphibious warfare. Danes did their best to achieve wealth through regular raiding without having to fight costly battles. They operated in small, independent war bands. They targeted soft targets, such as churches, abbeys and trading centres. They also struck towns when festivals and holidays were being celebrated for greater haul of treasure. For example, Danes raided Tours three days before the feast of Saint Martin in 1853. They also took political and ecclesiastical hostages and held them for ransom. This was all made possible by the use of narrow longships that were perfect for both sea and river voyages so were able to penetrate deeply into the Frankish interior. For example, a viking fleet rowed 210 miles up the Garonne river to Toulouse in 1844.  Therefore, the reason for their success was that viking bands were fast, adaptable and cleverly opportunistic. They were able to attack  where they knew the rewards were great and the defenses weak. They knew  when to fight and when to escape, when to approach by ship and when to  ride overland, when to accept tribute and when to plunder. Several groups of  vikings could band together quickly when needed and go their separate ways  when this served them better. Indeed, a warrior band could even take employment with a European ruler to stave off another viking band or to fight his  other enemies, even his own family members: “To Sigfrid and Gorm and their  accomplices he \[Charles the Fat in 882\] gave several thousand pounds of silver  and gold which he had seized from the treasury of St-Stephen at Metz and from  the resting-places of other saints, and he gave them permission to stay so that  they could go on ravaging a part of his cousin’s kingdom as they had before.”  One example of viking defeat against the Franks is oddly the one that ended in setting up Normandy: the Siege of Chartres (911). Here the vikings significantly outnumbered the Franks, but were defeated with notable loses. However, Charles the simple, King of West Francia, was looking for more permanent solution to the viking problem, so he offered Rollo and his companions land centred on Rouen in return for serving as a buffer against future viking raids up the river. Rollo and his companions gladly accepted, being cleverly opportunistic as usual. The viking rus themselves were badly defeated by the Byzantines in the battle of Arcadiopolis and battle of dorostopol.  And if we’re focusing on 11th century Normans, it has to be said that they were more likely French than viking by then, especially in Hastings.  >It is also interesting to note that few of the participating nobles in the Battle of Hastings were from the Cotentin Peninsula. Moreover, and none were reported to have supplied ships.This would suggest a clear demarcation between Lower Normandy and the Cotentin Peninsula. In part, this demarcation could reflect continued resentment of William’s rule within this region, insofar as the revolt of 1047 discussed earlier was in fact led by a prominent Cotentin lord. Still another trend which is of interest is the relationship between the nobles’ and knights’ origins and the relative density of early Viking settlement in the duchy. According to a map of settlement names, there was a high density of Viking settlers in the Cotentin Peninsula and the Pays de Caux region. It is in precisely these regions where fewer Norman combatants originated, as opposed to the Bessin region around Bayeux which had far fewer Viking settlement names and thus fewer descendants of viking settlers. Therefore, the Normans who fought at the Battle of Hastings were more likely to have possessed French than Viking/Nordic ancestry.  Of course, this is not to say that vikings were bad warriors. I don’t think anyone claims that, but they were not superior militarily to their enemies.  Sources:  Medieval Maritime Warfare, Charles D.Stanton  Viking tactics in West Francia, William E.

152vfu	"German units who had zero tanks of any kind" includes, by late 1944, a lot of German tank units.    Tanks weren't being attacked just by tanks: aside from improving tank armament and anti-tank guns both towed and mounted on various chassis, German armour faced considerable threats from the air.  Not just from tactical aircraft, but strategic bombing all the way from the refinery that made the fuel and metal, the factory that built them, the trains and tracks used to transport them, and so on, right up to the front line.  The Panzer Lehr was effectively annihilated during the fighting around St Lo, and amongst the weapons doing serious damage were M10 tank destroyers and (in Operation Cobra) strategic bombers pressed into what amounted to tactical service.	1642696253.0	hth4zoi	t3_s89fqq	t1_htgvayl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hth4zoi/
hkr7nkbc	Wow! Thank you for this response, it's about everything I was looking for.  I was aware of Kuhn's work, but I didn't know about its relationship with Fleck. In my mind, I'm more familiar with discussions surrounding Lakatos, Feyerabend, Kuhn and Popper.   You're right that I'm hesitant to read so much before starting my project, but I will definitely put these on my reading list. Since you seem to be well informed on this topic, I was wondering if you knew about some modern works on the philosophy of science? (If that's something separate?)  I'm particularly interested in the social sciences, neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology. I'm aware that Kurt Danziger is one historian of psychology, but do you know of any others by any chance?	1642696272.0	hth51hs	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth0dq6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth51hs/
b0uy0vfb	Alright. So, the first thing I want to note is that this is a topic that lends itself in a way few others do to sensationalism and propaganda. So, if you want to research this in your own time think critically and try to find academic sources rather than mere newspaper articles as the non academic sources I found tended to be… not good.   The main thing to note is that the cannibalism occurred over a roughly six week period in 1968 from May to July during the violent factional infighting that occurred at the time. An official government investigation of the cannibalism occurred in 1981-83 and later the Chinese author Zheng Yi conducted a personal investigation throughout the mid to late 80s which has been both praised and criticised for its content.   **The Background: Guangxi in 1968**  Guangxi in 1968 was an extremely turbulent place notorious for its violence. It had been led by a man named Wei Guoqing since 1954, however by 1968 Wei was in hot water. The Cultural Revolution started in the area in 1967 and almost immediately a rival faction appeared in the local party organisation, led by a man called Wu Chinnan. Wei’s faction was named the “Big Faction” or “Guangxi United Command of Proletarian Revolutionaries” and Wu’s “Small Faction” or “Guangxi April 22 Revolutionary Action Command” or just “4.22”. Wei’s faction very much came out on top with the local militia, miliary and capitol coming out in his favour against the so called “Rebels”. Things escalated fairly quickly into violence after an imposed compromise was ignored by the Big Faction, who wanted to wipe out their enemies. On May 11 1968 a successful coordinated attack was launched upon multiple Small Faction strongpoints, with many of those who surrendered after the fighting being summarily executed. Violent struggle sessions were launched in the area, with an extraordinary 90 of the 144 areas in Wuxuan county (The area most studied and seemingly the epicentre of the violence) having sessions that ended with impromptu executions. This was extraordinarily violent even by the Cultural Revolutions standards, with the official investigation stating that 524 people were executed in the area. It is worth noting however that whilst high level officials in Guangxi directly ordered and encouraged violence and extrajudicial killings they did not order cannibalism, that was something that occurred at a lower level.   **The Cannibalism**  Of the 524 executed in Wuxuan government reports state that somewhere between 64 and 76 people were eaten throughout the counties municipality and nine communes. To give some more details in a list Zheng writes that of 64 people killed and eaten 56 had their heart and liver cut out, 18 were completely eaten, 13 had their genitals eaten, one was decapitated after being eaten and 7 were reportedly cut up whilst still alive. Those doing the killing were for the most part not the violent, idealistic students many imagine when they think of the Cultural Revolution. Instead, the perpetrators were those at least ostensibly on the side of law and order who had been trained to follow orders and serve as a moral example to the community engaging in a violent purge of their perceived enemies. To give an example of such cannibalism taking place Zhang Boxun (perceived as being a supporter of the Small Faction) attempted to escape a struggle session in June 18 by jumping into a river, but was caught, killed and had his heart and liver cut out by militiaman Guo Lixiang who together with another man cooked them in a pot. A notable aspect of the cannibalism that occurred is that people from diverse parts of society participated in Wuxuan cannibalism, from idealistic youths to old women, teachers and even state functionaries. It was not limited to just one social group.  **Why Cannibalism?**  Probably the most natural question to ask at this point is why cannibalism? This kind of even did not commonly occur in other parts of China under similar circumstances and it is not like there was a famine in the area forcing people to engage in this behaviour.   Unfortunately, there isn’t really one simple answer to this question. However, there are various reasons that have been proposed as at least partial explanation for why the people of the area decided to eat their enemies as well as kill them.   Firstly, it was a group activity. Cannibalism seems to have generally occurred in group “human flesh banquets”(as Zheng states the masses called it) in which peer pressure was brought to bare. This was effective, with over 80 of the Huangmao Foodstuffs Depot and Distribution Office units members reportedly eating meals made from other people, some reportedly under duress. Cannibalism seems to have served as a way to check and affirm peoples loyalty, and bears some similarity to traditional communal feasts.   Secondly the cannibalism often seems to have been somewhat symbolic, notable here is the fact that a majority of those killed had their hearts and livers extracted and eaten. Important symbolic parts of the body were being extracted and eaten, not necessarily all of the body. Beliefs are held in parts of China that those who eat specific of a goshawk or tiger become strong and brave, perhaps eating enemies’ livers and hearts were perceived as having a similar function.  Cultural arguments have also been made, pointing out similarities between the cannibalism and traditional Zhuang ox sacrifices or Chinese folk tales involving cannibalism. These arguments are unsurprisingly extremely controversial, with Zheng (the author who conducted a personal investigation) being accused by some of cultural chauvinism against the Zhuang for such insinuations.   Political tensions obviously also played a role, with those eaten being killed at the end of a struggle session or a fight against the Big Faction. This is the explanation that seems to have become most popular in the western media, with blame being laid on communism in general and the cultural revolution in particular for creating the hatreds that inspired the cannibalism. This is an argument that is again extremely controversial, mostly in the extent to which communism as an ideology is to blame as opposed to local conditions.   Communal tension also has been suggested as a cause, with some instances of murder and cannibalism such as the murder of Peartree Li’s family seeming to occur mostly due to pre-existing hatreds finally having an outlet. Grudges taken to a murderous extreme are well documented to have occurred in other parts of China during the Cultural Revolution, cannibalism may have served as a final, extreme insult to the deceased and their family.  **It's Legacy**  The cannibalism that occurred there has a complicated legacy. Zheng Yi’s book on the topic is our main source of information but has serious flaws with some of his conclusions (for example that 10,000 people ate human flesh) not being justified by the evidence he provides. The work has also been accused of morphing into a political polemic, unconcerned with historical accuracy. The government of China restricts access to records of the topic, which means that major historians of the area end up being people like Song Yongyi who whilst a respected academic has also been arrested by the Chinese government for stealing state secrets and has a distinctly negative attitude towards the Chinese government.   Overall, what I would take away is that the cannibalism occurred during a time of absolutely massive internal tension in the area over a period of about six weeks in which one revolutionary faction suppressed another with extreme violence. A wide range of other reasons have been proposed for why the cannibalism occurred, however there is no single answer that applies to all cases, and likely never will be.	1642696568.0	hth5u2x	t3_s81fmu	t3_s81fmu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s81fmu/why_did_massive_massive_cannibalism_occur_in_the/hth5u2x/

mbx1lsj	This is such an important point that I feel often gets forgotten when discussing WWII tanks, especially British infantry tanks like the Churchill. The vast majority of fighting that all tanks did in WWII was against infantry, and a gun that has limited HE capacity is borderline useless against soft targets like infantry, anti-tank guns, artillery, unarmored/lightly-armored vehicles, etc. Infantry tanks in particular were not designed to go toe-to-toe with other tanks, but rather to do exactly what their name implies: support the infantry against enemy infantry. In this role, the Churchill was arguably one of the most successful tanks of the war.  Now of course infantry tanks did go up against enemy tanks from time to time, and while their thick armor gave them decent survivability, their mediocre capacity for AP fire did hold them back, at least against heavily-armored late-war German tanks like the Panther or Tiger, which as you rightly said were few and far between; the 75mm gun was more than adequate for dealing with the more common Pz IV's and Stug III's. But from a doctrine standpoint, the infantry tank, especially the Churchill, did what it was designed to do and did it effectively.	1642696860.0	hth6md1	t3_s89fqq	t1_htgvayl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hth6md1/

Seems pretty ignorant to write it off as Afrocentric when Africans aren’t the only non Europeans? I do realize there was a slave trade but it’s hard to believe thats all there is to it.

bfvcv	The earliest reference I could find online was a footnote in the University of Western Ontario Medical Journal from 1951 which ends: "But, then, I always was a [cunning linguist](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1bU0AQAAIAAJ&q=cunning+linguist&dq=cunning+linguist&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2k9Ks48D1AhXilFwKHb-FDu8Q6AF6BAgIEAI)."  Having searched a bunch of different newspaper archives, the earliest I could find there was an anecdote titled "Wall Scribbler Caught In Act" where a man in his late 50s writes "I am a [cunning linguist](https://www.newspapers.com/image/152649153/?terms=%22cunning%20linguist%22&match=1)" on an ice cream vending machine. This was in the *Akron Beacon Journal* for 12 May 1967.  There are also exciting and incorrect answers on Quora etc. which claim variously that the joke didn't exist before 1968 (based on Google N-Grams), and that 'cunnilingus' wasn't even a term until the 1940s. The OED does not bear this last idea out, with cunnilingus attested to as describing an activity in 1864.   More interestingly, the primary meaning shifted in the 20th century from a person who performs the act to the act itself. Before ~1900 you might say e.g. "he was employed as a cunnilingus for the Queen of Sheba".	1642697438.0	hth86n2	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htg3vd1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hth86n2/

8brve	The modern philosophy of science is, in my view, pretty divorced from the practice of doing history, and from insights into thinking about the history of science. As some point in the last few decades, the historians and the philosophers went in very different directions (the philosophers got much more analytical and much less interested in history, is one way to think about it). So there is a reason that all of the relevant stuff (Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend, Popper, Fleck, etc.) is from the 1930s-1970s, and then all of the "philosophical" work in the history of science comes from other sources (anthropologists, sociologists, and other historians). Amusingly, the History of Science Society and the Philosophy of Science Association still co-locate their meetings every few years, but there is very little overlap between the two in terms of the questions they are asking. (There are some historians and philosophers who lament this, there are some who do not.)  So the odds are you will find more philosophical discussions that are useful for history by reading historians of science. E.g., Galison for thinking about physics, Rheinberger for thinking about biology — both are historians are their heart but they do philosophical things with it.  The term that would seem most useful for looking into are the "history of the human sciences," which is what we mean for the history of social sciences, anthropology, psychology, etc.   One other resource: there are a few series like the Cambridge History of Science that basically get scholars to summarize entire fields in single articles, and always have a sort of methodological introduction. These can be very useful. The Cambridge History of Science, volume 7, is about the modern social sciences ("psychology, economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, geography, history, and statistics"); I would definitely take a look at it! The introduction is on "Writing the history of social science," by Ted Porter and Dorothy Ross, who are both immensely respected historians.	1642697675.0	hth8urk	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth51hs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth8urk/

30n1rleb	Does anyone know how to find original texts of petitions to the English Parliament from the late 1300s?  I'm doing deep dive into historical environmental impacts of trawling fisheries, and found an excellent resource from 1889;  * Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission. (1889). United States: U.S. Government Printing Office.  Inside, it contains a reference to a petition to the English Parliament of 1376-77, referenced as such:  * Pet. 51, Edw. III, A.D. 1376-'77. - Petition No. 50  The US Commission book contains a quote of the text, which describes the nets being used, states a complaint about degraded fisheries over a period of seven years, and a response that a commission should be made to "inquire and certify on the truth of this allegation" but I'd love to be able see the full text. I know it's a stretch, but tips on how to look for the context surrounding petitions at this time (i.e. who made the complaint, and where did this happen specifically?), and any results of the aforementioned commission would also be greatly appreciated.   I was going to do a full post for this, but saw this thread and thought it might fit better here.

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642699926.0	hthf59n	t3_s8o7ks	t3_s8o7ks	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8o7ks/what_war_did_my_relative_serve_in/hthf59n/
8brve	For historians, I'm not sure it's easy to generalize, other than saying, "usually questions about how social and intellectual contexts affect and are affected by scientific work" (which is very vague, and still not encompassing), but you can get a sense by looking at the [kinds of papers that people are presenting at the annual meetings](https://hssmeeting.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/1/sessiongallery/schedule?dayId=1&searchParams=%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22sortMode%22%3A%22SessionName%22%2C%22sortDirection%22%3A%22Ascending%22%2C%22sortByFieldId%22%3Anull%2C%22displayMode%22%3Anull%2C%22filterByFieldValues%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByTextValue%22%3Anull%2C%22filterByFavorites%22%3Afalse%2C%22filterByScheduleRoomIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterBySessionTypeIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByScheduleDayIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByScheduleTimeSlotIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22isScheduleOtherEventSearchAllowed%22%3Atrue%7D) (apologies in advance that this online conference platform makes it hard to see these at a glance — I prefer PDFs...). Much of the work of the history of science these days is in a mode of "descriptive/interpretive" more so than "trying to come up with an answer to a philosophical question."   Similarly with the [PSA](https://dryfta-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/psa2020/eventdocs/1636310360MeetingProgram-PSA2021-2021-09.pdf) — you can see that the questions they are trying to answer are very abstract and rarely have anything like historical case studies to back them up. That's fine, they can do their own thing, but it's not very useful for historians.	1642700056.0	hthfi2b	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hthbhx8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hthfi2b/

2liuru	According to Aelian (*Historical Miscellany* 12.12), "Note that on Crete at Gortyn an adulterer when caught was brought before the magistrates and after conviction was made to wear a garland of wool. The garland amounted to accusation that he was depraved and effeminate, and had looks appealing to women." So either the specific form of the garland was feminine, or it was because wool was a symbol of women's work like spinning and weaving, or dressing him up in appealing clothing was supposed to refer to the sexual nature of his crime.	1642701917.0	hthkndc	t3_s7wggh	t1_hth244y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7wggh/christian_mythology_has_roman_soldiers_putting_a/hthkndc/

pncvt	### Introduction and Theory  I cannot claim to be a particular specialist in martial arts or in its historiography – my greatest hands-on experience has been about two years of Wing Chun I did before the age of 10; my attempts to actually look into the history of this topic has been marred by just how barren a lot of the historiography is.  But the explanation of that comparative barrenness is part of the answer to your question, because it explains how the myth has continued to have such presence and currency. As Paul Bowman puts it, when it comes to the writing of the history of martial arts, there are in effect  > two different kinds of discourse, each claiming to be knowledge: ideological and mystical, on the one hand, versus verifiable and somewhat more prosaic, on the other.  And in turn, there are distinct priorities and desires among the proponents of each. By and large, hands-on practitioners of martial arts will repeat the stories told within their own discipline(s), not least because they form part of the overall 'package' of being a practitioner. Academic historians of martial arts, however, will be looking critically at what can be verified through reliable sources, irrespective of what is believed by the practitioners. Indeed, academic *anythings* will do that – specialists in the human, for instance, will investigate the actual, empirically verifiable effects of martial arts on the body and the mechanisms by which those effects occur, irrespective of what the specific claims made by practitioners may be.  Before continuing, it is worth making two digressions to set the scene a bit. The first is to echo Bowman's point that although these discourses are incompatible, neither is more legitimate inherently. The invented traditions of various disciplines as they exist today are nevertheless important to those disciplines as they exist, and even if they are in a sense 'lies' they are still the basis of sincerely held beliefs about particular practices; yet it is still important to have a grasp of verifiable reality when it comes to the various dimensions of martial arts.  The second is to note that the majority of contemporary historical writing on East Asian martial arts is non-academic in nature and written by present-day practitioners – [not unlike military history in the 19th and early 20th centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dca5b9/historiographic_question_what_is_new_military/f288xkw/) – with serious academic approaches being comparatively recent. However, it is quite fortunate that much of this academic material, precisely because it is competing with repeated myths and received wisdom, is relatively accessible – for instance, the journal *Martial Arts Studies* is open-access, and so too is the article I'm drawing on by Paul Bowman. What it means is that both compete in the same arena, and there is arguably no real middle ground: practitioners themselves will have difficulty accepting that their disciplines' received knowledge is at best inaccurate and at worst complete bunk; academics will understandably be miffed at the suggestion that they ought to treat this received wisdom as having equal value to what is actually verifiable.  This sets the scene for *why* the myth has persisted: for the martial arts practitioner, whether there actually was a Southern Shaolin Temple or not is irrelevant, because it did exist in the context of their own perspective on their own practiced tradition. The historian cannot change the practitioner's mind because the two are operating on different wavelengths, so to speak. As for *how*, that's a different question that we can dig into a bit.  ### The History  We can, with decent certainty, say that the Qing were not particularly keen on the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan or its attendant branches, for two principal reasons.   The first was that, like many other Eurasian powers of the Early Modern period, the Qing liked to rationalise their domains and constituents, and disliked entities that lay somewhat beyond their power. The Shaolin Monastery was only one of many Chinese Buddhist institutions over which the Qing did not necessarily exert direct control, and which which were themselves only one part of a general distrust of independent religious institutions that also broadly applied to Daoist temples. The second was that, like many Buddhist and Daoist temples with a martial arm, the Shaolin Monastery had contributed troops to support the Ming in the previous dynasty's wars, albeit against the Shun rebels of Li Zicheng rather than the Manchus. Despite not being one of the temples that supplied troops to the 'Southern' Ming during the Qing conquest of south China (of which there were many), the Shaolin Temple was nevertheless perceived as a potential locus of Ming loyalism, not just by the Qing state itself but also by elites who objected to what they saw as illegitimate alien rule. Thanks in part to the romantic writings of resentful ex-Ming officials, there came to be a pervasive but frankly impossible myth that the Shaolin monks had rebelled against Qing rule and that the monastery's destitute state in the late 17th century was a result of imperial reprisals that had stopped just short of ordering its total dissolution.  The reality was that by the time that Qing rule extended over Henan, the Shaolin Monastery had already been in pretty dire straits. In supplying troops to the Ming to fight off Li Zicheng, the Shaolin Monastery lost many of its monks in battle against Li and his allies, but its troubles did not end there, as it was subsequently preyed on by local warlords who had emerged in the absence of Ming authority. According to local chronicles, one such warlord named Li Jiyu pretended to patronise the monastery, and at one stage requested that certain ceremonies be held for his birthday. As these were being performed, he had his troops storm the monastery, where they slaughtered the disarmed monks and destroyed much of its infrastructure. Some further damage may have been caused by the Qing army as it marched south through Henan in the 1640s. Left destitute, the monastery remained dilapidated for nearly a century, with decades of neglect under relatively apathetic Qing rule. The Qing did eventually patronise the monastery somewhat, but only from 1704 onward. These contributions could be significant, as the Yongzheng Emperor paid for substantial renovations in 1735, and in return the temple hosted the Qianlong Emperor during his first Southern Inspection in 1750. But while the core monastery saw some Qing patronage, its subsidiary shrines in the region were destroyed and dispersed as basically a final nail in the coffin for its power as a local institution. It never really regained its former prestige either, with nobody holding the post of head abbott between 1664 and *1999*. The Qing remained consistently suspicious of the monastery, which was often suspected of colluding with various dissident groups at least as late as the Eight Trigrams revolt in 1813, when official communications expressed concern that the monastery might harbour other sectarians.  Thanks to the earlier depredations, the Shaolin Monastery as a military entity had very much collapsed. The same chronicler who recorded the destruction of the temple by Li Jiyu reported visiting the temple some time between the late 1650s and 1670s, where he requested that two novices demonstrate their skills for him. 'Their performance was no better than that of street beggars. It was not worth watching.' While the monastery retained its legendary reputation for martial prowess, the Qing were not eager to allow it to be taken seriously; in 1775 the Qianlong Emperor officially forbade officials and officers from involving Buddhist monks in the army, in response to news that the governor of Henan had taken on Shaolin monks as army instructors. 'Having monks train his soldiers is not only beyond one’s authority,' wrote the emperor, 'it also makes him into a laughing stock.'	1642704297.0	hthr6pd	t3_s8ddl3	t3_s8ddl3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/hthr6pd/
pncvt	### The Myth  The Qing conquest of China was, to say the least, a deeply traumatic event for many Han Chinese, especially as it involved the overthrow of the Ming, a state that had built itself on 'de-Mongolification' in the wake of Yuan rule, and which had upheld a sort of cosmically-ordained division between the 'civilised' and 'barbarian' worlds, made particularly potent by the construction of the Great Wall. Manifestations of anti-Qing sentiment often came in fits and starts, but it is probably fair to say that the Qing never could – and never did – feel entirely safe from a proto-nationalist uprising by any of their non-Manchu subjects. More importantly for the purposes of analysing the history of Shaolin, many organisations in southern China that pitched themselves as anti-Qing liked, for the purposes of PR and credibility, to claim continuity with movements and entities that had resisted the Qing invasion. Perhaps most prominent among these was – indeed, is – the Heaven and Earth Society in Fujian, splinters of which became the triad crime gangs, and which claims to have been formed when the Qing invaded southern China in the 1650s. There is, in fact, no verifiable truth to this: the Heaven and Earth Society came into existence in the early 1760s as a community mutual aid organisation, and only began anti-Qing agitation later in the decade, well after their foundation. What it goes to show, though, is that stories of an anti-Shaolin reprisal by the Qing were rooted in a pervasive anti-Qing attitude that was particularly prevalent in south Chinese society.  The origin story of the Heaven and Earth Society that eventually developed involves, surprise surprise, the Shaolin Monastery, and it seems to have been at least partly responsible for cementing the narrative that the Shaolin Monastery was destroyed during the Kangxi reign (1661-1722) and its practitioners scattered across southern China. That this was specifically a *Southern* Shaolin Monastery is not always consistently clear, and other variations on the Heaven and Earth Society's version of the myth sometimes claim it was the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan. However, the idea that this was a branch monastery – given the perhaps suspect timeframe of the destruction if it was supposed to be the original one – seems nevertheless to have had some currency. This did, however, have the perhaps unintended effect of leading to *several* monasteries claiming to be the rebuilt Southern Shaolin Monastery. According to Zhou Weiliang, at least three Buddhist temples in Fujian claimed to be the Southern Shaolin Monastery, with relatively little to actually show for it. But this claim nevertheless had currency, particularly in a region and in a time where it was possible to insinuate anti-Qing connections comparatively openly and expect that the extent of public support would outweigh the risks of official opposition.  To tie this in to the Hong Kong film industry, almost of HK martial arts cinema finds its roots in Wing Chun and its practitioners – more specifically, Ip Man's branch of Wing Chun – and Wing Chun basically replicates the Heaven and Earth Society's founding myth in claiming to originated from monks fleeing the destroyed Southern Shaolin Monastery. Judkins and Nielson argue that the claim of Shaolin origins among martial arts clans dates to at least the 1890s, when the trope also starts to appear in martial arts novels; this would track with the uptick in anti-Qing sentiments that would eventually lead to the empire's downfall, and which became particularly acute in the wake of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-5. That said, the Shaolin aspect of the Heaven and Earth Society's origin myth is attested as early as 1811, so the development in the 1890s ought to be understood as involving the adoption of this myth by martial arts groups, and not its original invention.  On top of this, modern East Asian martial arts owe a lot to Japan, in that Japanese martial arts in the early 20th century were perhaps the most formalised and professionalised, thereby setting expectations for martial arts in the rest of Asia, and also in that martial arts became a way for East Asian countries to assert a sense of identity in response to the Japanese ascendancy in the region. Before the term *Wushu* (literally 'martial arts') was established as the standard by the Communist PRC, the Nationalist ROC referred to Chinese martial arts as *Guoshu*, literally 'national arts' (or 'the national art'). As an aside, a comparable dynamic can be seen with Taekwondo, which, despite its internal narrative of being an ancient Korean art, is functionally a branch of Shōtōkan karate which was given a Korean nationalist rebranding after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, and used as part of the two new Korean states' attempts at nation-building in the post-colonial period.  Tying that back to Hong Kong, it is easy to retroject contemporary Hong Kong's tense relationship with Chinese nationhood back into the twentieth century, when the situation was actually a bit more clear-cut. Later nationalist claims of Manchu 'Sinicisation' aside, the essential foreignness of the Qing in their early decades has always been quietly understood (well, 'believed' is perhaps more appropriate), and so the story of the Shaolin monastery's destruction takes on a certain character of nationalist resistance – one with particular currency amid the rise of the Japanese Empire and the longer-term traumas this left, and also amid the continued British colonial presence in Hong Kong. Lest we forget that 1967 saw massive left-wing protests against British rule in which 51 Hongkongers were killed by British police; just four years later Bruce Lee burst onto the cinematic scene in *The Big Boss*.  An undercurrent of Chinese nationalism pervades a not insubstantial amount of Hong Kong martial arts cinema, and it is probably no surprise that Japan and the Japanese can be found as the antagonists in some of the more iconic works in the genre: 1972's *Fist of Fury* sees Bruce Lee beating up karate students in post-WW1 Shanghai; 2008's *Ip Man* is set largely during the Japanese occupation of southern China; the now somewhat obscure (but at the time quite popular) *Apkido*, also from 1972, is set in prewar, Japanese-ruled Korea. You can even find subtle hints in films that don't directly address the Japanese Empire: Bruce Lee's self-produced *Way of the Dragon* (1972 again) has a number of scenes where Bruce demonstrates the superiority of kung fu over karate, first against the employees at the restaurant he's protecting, and then against the thugs hired by the mafia boss (including Chuck Norris); Stephen Chow's *Kung Fu Hustle* (2004) evokes the overall period setting of the 1940s even if the Japanese are curiously absent. Going all the way back to the Shaolin temple, then, it forms part of a motif common across the genre where kung fu isn't just a cool fighting style, it's also an assertion of (Han) Chinese resilience.	1642704313.0	hthr8bd	t3_s8ddl3	t1_hthr6pd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/hthr8bd/
7sxro	This is a really great question, and unfortunately one I'm not qualified to answer. *The Imperial Harem* is only about the sultans and only in Constantinople. The author does provide some generalizations, which I used to broaden my answer to OP's questions about Afghanistan, and which are probably applicable to Morocco as well.   Just in case, I pressed "Ctrl+F" in my e-textbook to see if Pierce ever mentions Morocco or North Africa, but all we got is a couple references to Ibn Battuta's writing.   There are very few textbooks about harems and ordinary women's lives in the Ottoman Empire and North Africa. [*The Colonial Harem* by Malek Alloula](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Colonial_Harem/AGi7AAAAIAAJ?hl=en) looks very promising. Alloula was Algerian and focuses his work on Algeria, which is the closest I could get to Morocco. I think I'm most likely to read [*Rethinking Orientalism: Women, Travel, and the Ottoman Harem* by Reina Lewis](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rethinking_Orientalism/LbWQ8gP5xWkC?hl=en). Finally, [*Harem* by Valentine Gallet](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Harem/quEkyAEACAAJ?hl=en) is an art history book that analyzes orientalist western art in the 1800s-1900s. I might buy that one to learn more about this art that is wildly problematic but also so gorgeous.  TL;DR: I'd have to buy several more textbooks to begin to answer your question. My knowledge of the Ottomans is also limited to what is necessary to understand their influence in Eastern Europe, and I'm not an expert in the Ottoman occupation of Egypt or the broader history of North Africa.	1642704377.0	hthrewt	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htdny9a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/hthrewt/

tzc66	I've been getting replies in my mail, although they don't show up here, perhaps they were deleted immediately after being posted?   I couldn't actually read the full replies, but from the small parts visible in my mail from reddit i could see one of them asked where i read about the "single son" policy.  I should have been more clear in my comment above i think. It was in /u/orangewombat [other response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mnk6yr/comment/gu6r3st/) to a similar question, which he linked above.  The part that left me confused is this one: > One mother, one son Although the sultan could have as many concubines as he wanted, it appears that a woman's eligibility for concubine status ended when she bore the sultan her first son. The woman and her son, the prince, would continue to live within the harem until well into his teenage years, but the woman was no longer eligible to be the sultan's sexual partner. “[C]oncubines were only temporary sexual partners of a sultan[.] It seems likely that there was a revolving-door policy in the imperial harem that deprived a woman who had borne a son of further eligibility for the sultan's bed.” Imperial Harem, loc. 770.	1642705509.0	hthuind	t3_s7sm1l	t1_hte1xfp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/hthuind/
7j3q5	To add to your excellent response, while the Valentine was quickly phased out of the British Armoured Regiments once the British started getting American Shermans, the Soviets actually liked it and used until the end of the war - Valentine production was even kept up until the end of the war at Soviet request (half of all Valentine production was eventually sent to the Soviet Union).  The main difference seems to be in its use - while the British were using it as an infantry support tank (In the various army tank brigades), where it was replaced by the Churchill or medium tank (26th Arm Bde in North Africa), where it was replaced by the Sherman.     Soviets tended to use it to replace light tanks like the T-70, (The Valentine is actually in the same weight class as the M5 Stuart, despite being substantially better protected) and after some kinks in the earlier Valentines were ironed out, they eventually received and used over 3,000 of them throughout the war (And the Soviets were picky about the tanks they received - they complained loudly when the British tried to dump obsolete Crusaders on them via Lend Lease).  Ironically enough, the upgunned Valentines (armed with the same 6-pdr as the early Churchill tanks) was less popular at first than the 2-pdr Valentines because they traded a turret Machine gun to fit te 6-pdr, and because of the lack of a good HE round for the 6-pdr until later in the war.	1642705782.0	hthv8tg	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfnuco	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hthv8tg/

551ffhkm	The Korean king Hyeonjong (r. 1009-1031) came to power through a coup. The previous king, Mokjong (r. 997-1009), had very little power over his kingdom. Goryeo (the Korean kingdom at the time) was effectively ruled by Mokjong's mother, Queen Dowager Cheonchu, and her lover Kim Chi-yang. There were many in the kingdom who weren't happy about this. Cheonchu and Kim Chi-yang had a son who they allegedly wanted to succeed the childless Mokjong, and the queen tried to have her nephew Hyeonjong killed since he was the only other one in line to be king.  During Mokjong's reign, Goryeo had achieved a tentative peace with the Khitans who ruled the Liao Empire to their north. They had agreed to submit to the Khitan emperor Shengzong instead of the Song (Han Chinese) emperor. This meant they paid tribute to him and also that they let Shengzong (or his representative) perform the official investiture of King Mokjong.  In 1009, though, Mokjong was overthrown in a coup. There were factions who wanted Hyeonjong to succeed Mokjong instead of Cheonchu's son with Kim Chi-yang. They deposed Mokjong, killed Kim Chi-yang and his son, and exiled Mokjong and the queen. During their flight from the capital, Mokjong was assassinated even though he had agreed to make Hyeonjong his successor. Hyeonjong was installed on the throne without knowing that Mokjong had been killed for it.  Meanwhile, the Khitan had been waiting for an opportunity to re-invade Goryeo. They had settled their war with the Song in 1005 with the Treaty of Shanyuan, so they were eager to claim more territory on their southern border with Korea. After being informed of Hyeonjong's succession to the throne, the Khitan invaded Korea. They claimed that the Koreans were guilty of regicide, which especially angered them since Shengzong had been the one to invest Mokjong.  Years of brutal war followed. Between 1020 and 1022, peace was eventually negotiated. Not coincidentally, in 1022, Hyeonjong had his envoys report to the Khitan that he was dead and had been succeeded by his son. In reality, Hyeonjong did not die until 1031; his son Deokjong was made Crown Prince in 1022 but did not succeed him until 1031. If Hyeonjong had not faked his own death to his Khitan overlords, they may not have been satisfied with the peace negotiations.  **See**: Vermeersch, Sem, "Royal Ancestor Worship and Buddhist Politics: The Hyonhwa-sa Stele and the Origins of the First Koryo Tripitaka", *The Journal of Korean Studies* 18:1 (2013), 115-146.	1642707189.0	hthyz8r	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htfjseu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hthyz8r/
a3wnh	In addition to /u/Comprehensive_Try765 's comment on relative wealth, a wealth to GDP comparison isn't apples-to-apples either. GDP is an income metric while wealth is an aggregate. To make the comparison you care about ("ownership of total world purchasing power"), you need to compare personal wealth to total wealth. As you can imagine, "total wealth" is a very difficult metric to calculate even within a single civilization.	1642707274.0	hthz7b7	t3_s78b8h	t1_hte9mlo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s78b8h/was_mansa_musa_really_the_richest_person_in/hthz7b7/

a3wnh	It's also worth mentioning that when discussing the wealth of autocratic rulers, the divide between public and private wealth becomes very ambiguous. How much of the Roman treasury did Augustus control? How much of the empire's tax revenue can be considered his own personal income?

nxyvc	No, they did not.  The 2nd edition of the Cambridge History of Warfare (2020) is unfortunately pretty much the same as the 1st edition (2005), and as such, it reflects a previous generation of scholarship. Specifically, the expert who contributed the chapter on Greek warfare is Victor Davis Hanson, who was a leading scholar in that field in the 1990s, but whose views have been subject to sustained and comprehensive criticism ever since. I have written [many posts on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/iphikrates#wiki_historiography_of_greek_warfare) about the problems with Hanson's work and the older scholarly tradition he represents.  The notion you're asking about here - that Greeks before the Persian Wars settled whole wars in brief stretches of intense violence between hoplites - is the core of Hanson's work. It is not completely groundless, of course; Hanson could never have convinced anyone if he'd made it all up. But there are important reasons why we can still say with considerable confidence that he was wrong.  &nbsp;  **The kernel of truth**  What Hanson is getting at is that the wars of Greek states in the Archaic period were necessarily simple. Everyone accepts this; Greek states of this early time were small, poor, and primitive compared to the powerful states of the Near East. They did not have the revenues to afford standing armies or the organisation and coercive power to grow into expansionist empires. Instead, their armies consisted of citizen militia, raised for a particular campaign and disbanded as soon as that campaign was completed.  This basic system allowed the Greeks to raise large armies at minimal cost, but these armies couldn't be kept in the field for any length of time. Ordinary people had to return to their ordinary lives or the harvest wouldn't get done and people would starve. This meant that Greek states were unable to commit to long campaigns or sieges. Most of them could only afford to muster an army during a few months of summer, in between major phases of the agricultural cycle.  This extreme limitation to the availability of armed force meant that decisions had to be forced quickly or not at all. Barring the occasional storming of a city, the enemy had to be confronted in the field if anything was to be accomplished. In other words, there were structural reasons why many campaigns might end in a pitched battle, after which both sides would return home and end the fighting for the time being. (It should be noted that even more campaigns likely would have ended with nothing but a bit of ravaging and plundering.)  All Hanson needed to complete his vision of a warfare shaped entirely by pitched battles between farmer-hoplites was the claim, made by a Persian in Herodotos' *Histories*, that the Greeks always seek pitched battle on flat ground when they fight each other. Armed with that claim, Hanson could argue that these hoplite battles were the only way the Greeks knew how to fight. At first sight, it seems both plausible and confirmed by the passage in Herodotos.  &nbsp;  **The reasons for doubt**  Let's start with that claim in Herodotos. To put it bluntly, it is a lie.^1 This is clear from the context: the one making the claim is consistently portrayed as a liar and a fool, and in this particular instance he is trying to trick Xerxes into thinking the conquest of Greece will be easy. Herodotos probably never meant for anyone to believe him. He is portraying the Greeks as savage and stupid. We are supposed to see this as a transparent bit of slander, for which the speaker would eventually pay with his life (he was killed in battle against the Spartans at Plataia). That means we cannot see this claim as a fair generalisation.  And of course the Greeks understood how to wage war by other means than pitched battle. There are many examples of surprise attacks and ambushes as well as assaults on cities - all of which could result in the sort of quick and decisive outcomes that suited militia armies.^2 Pitched battle was just one possible solution to the problem that the troops would have to go home again soon - and probably not the preferred one, because it was extremely risky. Everyone wanted victory, but no one wanted to lose a huge number of their own citizens.^3  At the same time, while a lot of *campaigns* may have ended with a single battle, it is much harder to prove that those battles decided *wars*. Sure, the troops had to go home after a few weeks in the field - but they were ready to go again the following year. At this low frequency, conflicts between states could drag on for generations. After the Persian Wars, as soon as some Greek states built up some revenue streams of their own, the frequency of their campaigning increased; armies might be sent out several times during the spring-summer season, or even be paid a wage to march out in winter in the hopes of gaining some strategic advantage. Decisive battles were rare.  In terms of equipment, Hanson assumed that the farmers who formed the militia armies of Greek states were all more or less uniformly armed. In his view they were a socio-economic class of small farmers, who each had just enough to afford hoplite armour for himself (but not more). Therefore, if the farmers were doing the fighting, this must have meant that all the fighters were hoplites. The fact that the fighting was often done over farmland also neatly unites the warriors and the stakes of war. It all fits together in his model. But we now know this was not true; in the Archaic period, only the elite could afford hoplite armour, and the mass of the population would have fought as lightly equipped infantry, mixing in with the hoplites. By the later Archaic period, as Greece grew wealthier and more people could afford hoplite armour, the rich differentiated themselves by fighting as cavalry while specialist light-armed units (archers, javelin troops) soon made their appearance. Greek warfare was never an exclusive affair of hoplites (even if the sources, with their extreme elite bias, sometimes give this impression).  Finally, the duration of pitched battles (when they occurred) is simply not known. To suit his theory about what hoplite fighting looked like (which is a separate question), Hanson supposed they must be over quickly, because the warriors would quickly become exhausted. But we have no clear evidence. The sources often say battles went on "for a long time", but we don't know how long is a long time. The only thing we really know is that the pursuit of the defeated side would often go on until nightfall, but that doesn't tell us very much about how long the actual fighting went on.  In short, while Hanson's theory is not *entirely* groundless when we look at the basic conditions of early Greek warfare, it fundamentally misunderstands or even totally ignores much of the evidence. The actual picture was much more complex, and, needless to say, much less rosy.  &nbsp;  **Sauce**  1) R. Konijnendijk, 'Mardonius' senseless Greeks', *Classical Quarterly* 66 (2016) 1-12  2) P.

I'm a bit disappointed to hear that a book I've been reading quite thoroughly would contain such outdated and reality ignoring information, but I suppose it's better to know that now than to never know it at all and take such info at face value.  I'm not sure if this would be in your area of knowledge, but do you know if the rest of the book following the writing on the Greeks is more accurate and reliable or is it all within this same framework?	1642713525.0	htif15v	t3_s83m6b	t1_hticbst	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/htif15v/

They ended up dragging their feet on gun mounts for so long that Canada gave up waiting and developed their own for the Ram tank and then sent the design to Australia for the Sentinel. You realistically see British tanks build with 6-pounders in 1942.   Pressure to put a more potent gun into the Churchill resulted in the Churchill 3" 20 cwt Gun Carrier, an arguably worthless tank destroyer that was also only built after the imminent threat of German invasion was gone and there was no longer a need for it.	1642713798.0	htift30	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfxm6l	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htift30/

33y5r	What you saw happening in *The Apartment* was the character dialing 2-1-1 to reach *Long Distance,* because he wanted to call another city.  This is a minor plot point in *Rear Window,* where Jimmy Stewart's character can tell, even through binoculars, that the murder suspect dials three digits, thus he could only be placing a long distance call.  Originally, all phone users had to tell an operator whom they wished to call.  In 1879, fearing a shortage of operators due to a measles epidemic, phone numbers were introduced in Lowell, Mass. They quickly became popular, allowing switchboard operators to quickly connect calls with little training, and spread nationwide by 1910.    In 1891, Almon Strowger invented automated exchange equipment that could interpret interruptions in the phone line's current as digits and use a system of stepping relays to connect to another local line.  At first, Strowger's exchange equipment was a competitive advantage adopted by upstart competitor phone companies in big cities, and by small-town telcos looking to save money, but the Bell System developed its own automated exchange equipment by 1919 and by 1930 most urban phone subscribers could dial their own local calls.  Very small communities continued to have switchboards into the 1970s, and as heard in *The Andy Griffith Show,* it wasn’t uncommon to ask to be connected to another party by name rather than number.  The telephone network was always an affiliation of hundreds of independent companies. By the Great Depression, almost all cities had only a single telco—but many remained independent of the Bell System, particularly in rural areas.  General Telephone gradually purchase a number of small-city telcos, and there were other regional multicity companies.  Rural areas that offered little chance for profit eventually established telephone cooperatives with help from the New Deal’s Rural Electrification Administration.  The majority of intercity phone circuits, however, were operated by the Bell System’s Long Lines Division.  Until the 1960s, placing a long distance call meant first contacting a local operator by dialing 0 or 2-1-1.  That operator would then arrange the long-distance circuit, calling you back when it was ready.  Beginning in the late 1940s, big-city operators could put long-distance calls though using a process similar to Touch-Tone dialing, and connect the parties within a few seconds.  Direct Distance Dialing was introduced in 1951 and expanded quickly through the Bell System, using the North American Numbering Plan of unique numbers for every line, and had become the norm by 1965 in nearly all cities.  This could only be used for “caller-pays” calls however, and long distance was still expensive enough for midcentury movie audiences to understand the meaning of “but he’s calling *long distance.”*  For collect or Person-to-Person (you only pay if connection to a specific person is made) calls, users still dialed 0 for Operator.  Once again, however, rural areas lagged behind, and Direct Distance Dialing probably never became available to *every* landline across the country.	1642714487.0	htihqv4	t3_s89ak9	t3_s89ak9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89ak9/when_did_americans_start_dialing_phone_numbers/htihqv4/

Those are just basic books on historiography, but it might help provide you a background on why historiography is important when doing research. To me, historiography was one of the most interesting classes I took in my graduate school career because it was so philosophical. It completely changed the way I thought about writing history. It kind of helps you take a deeper dive into researching and source material, especially primary sources.Writing History by Storey is just a basic how-to on writing about history, but it's a very useful reference when trying to remember the little things about writing about the subject.	1642715225.0	htijsz2	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth0dq6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htijsz2/

dtg6h	One more thing that really took the game to the next level was the music. Halo as a series has always been known for great music, but there is a sense of wonder that plays really well into the outside levels in particular with the Halo Main Theme. The music hypes up moments in the game like few other games did, especially shooters, at the time. Every track from the somber lonely sounds when running through a forerunner facility after not having seen another human for a level or two, to hopeful ready to take the fight to the covenant, to the Warthog Run's ability to make you feel like everything is about to go down, know something is about to go down, all fill a natural point building tension, or atmosphere that really sucks you into the experience.  &#x200B;  They also knew when to use tracks that you will barely hear over the sounds of a warthog, and when to change it up to loud semi-rock music that blasts out over the sound of a Scorpions Main Cannon. They were fitted so well to their relevant scenes that you started to know what was happening before it was happening just by the hype of certain songs behind you. There is nothing like the feeling of flying a Banshee in the canyons of Assault on the Control Room or Two Betrayals as On A Pale Horse, or the Flood theme playing when you are locked away in the tunnels of 343 Guilty Spark.   &#x200B;  These sounds, with unique and easily identifiable motifs, inspired people to join music, the male choir band craze (craze is probably too strong of a word, but I don't really know what to replace it with), I have several friends who learned Guitar or Drums specifically because of the Halo series, which may be anecdotal, but there are bound to be others with similar reasons or experiences.	1642716295.0	htimp6o	t3_s7eef4	t1_htc8q6k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7eef4/what_was_it_that_made_halo_combat_evolved_such_a/htimp6o/

kv44g	>But why did they keep building and designing new bulky, slow infantry tanks, rather than investing earlier in a medium tank with higher speed and bigger guns?  It's easy to say that the British went down the wrong path in hindsight, but the development of British armour doctrine is fairly reasonable when you look at it in context of its time.  Let's go back to the early 1920s. The British adopted first the Medium Tank Mk.I then the Medium Tank Mk.II. These tanks could reach a speed of 24 kph, which was more than twice as fast as Renault FT light tanks, and had a 47 mm gun that could penetrate up to 30 mm of armour, enough to defeat any enemy tank at the time. There was also a close support variant with a 3.7" howitzer. Here we have a high speed medium tank with a big gun!  The family of tanks continued into the Medium Tank Mk.III, but only three prototypes were built. This tank was supposed to be able to reach speeds of 41.5 kph with a more powerful engine, but a blow was struck to the British armoured force with the disbanding of the Experimental Mechanized Force and cuts to the budget of land forces in 1927. The Mk.III died from this blow, and the medium tank concept with it. This was a very bad move for the British, since the Mk.III inspired the Soviet T-28, arguably the best interbellum medium tank.   Experimental work continued and it quickly turned out that you can't have everything in one tank. In 1934 the army requested a tank with the capabilities of the Medium Tank Mk.III, but lighter (12 tons instead of 16). At the same time, the army was eying the French Renault NC, so they also asked for something similar: a thickly armoured tank armed only with a machine gun.  These two directions evolved further in the mid-1930s. The British were impressed by the Soviet BT tanks at the Great Kiev Exercise and wanted something like that for themselves, and so the cruiser tanks evolved to be more like the BT (bulletproof armour, Christie suspension, high speed). At the same time, requirements for armour grew too, so you see an increase in armour on both the Cruisers (Cruiser Tank Mk.IV) and the infantry tanks (Infantry Tank Mk.II) although the latter obviously got the brunt of the armour upgrades. The armament was also modernized with the high velocity 40 mm 2-pounder and 3" howtizer for close support tanks.  Looking at the tank armament at the start of WWII, one would hesitate to state the the British bet wrong. Their "medium" tank was superior to the German Pz.Kpfw.III. The armament was the same (remember that there were no 50 mm guns yet), the armour of the Cruiser Tank Mk.IV was thicker (early Panzer IIIs had 14 mm of armour, the same as the Cruiser. Tank Mk.III), the Cruiser tank was faster. The infantry tanks had superior armour that withstood anything up to German AA guns.  It made sense for the next generation of British tanks to look exactly the same. The Cruiser Tanks Mk.V and [Mk.VI](https://Mk.VI) departed little from the Mk.IV concept and the Infantry Tank Mk.IV was still a slow and thickly armoured tank (although it had a howitzer in the hull, a feature that was quickly dropped).   The problems with this concept were only realized in the battles in North Africa. The long sight lines meant that fighting was happening at much longer ranges than in France. In this case the smaller and (slightly) faster (but more importantly, much cheaper) Valentine proved superior to the cumbersome Matilda. Also it had superior reliability and no issues with long range driving that plagued the Matilda. The new Churchill also turned out to be pretty okay against 88 mm guns at long range.   The Cruisers weren't in such good shape though. They could avoid 88 mm gun fire at long ranges due to their speed, but once they had to engage German tanks at closer ranges they couldn't compete. The solution was the "heavy cruiser" concept that surfaced at the end of 1941: a tank with the armour of an infantry tank and the speed of a cruiser tank. This was your "high speed medium tank with a bigger gun", as it would have the 57 mm 6-pounder gun that allowed it to fight German tanks at long ranges.  The problem with the heavy cruiser is that there were many ideas about how to build it. Development split into three paths: the A24 Cavalier built using Cruiser Tank [Mk.VI](https://Mk.VI) components, and then two brand new tanks: the A27M Cromwell (using a new Meteor engine) and A27L Centaur (using the old Liberty engine). The plan was to put these tanks into service in 1942, but it took far longer than expected to iron out all the bugs. By the time the tanks saw battle in 1944, it was clear that the concept was already obsolete. The replacements were already in development: a minor upgrade to the Cromwell concept (Comet) that saw battle at the tail end of the war in Europe, and a major redesign that abandoned every tradition in British tank building (the Centurion).The former was just a stopgap, but the latter resulted in a fantastic tank series that served for decades after the war.  As for the Churchill, while there were competing tank designs that were supposed to replace it, there were no proposals to do away with the concept of an infantry tank in general. If anything, the Churchills only got slower and more thickly armoured as the war went on. Like heavy tanks in other nations, they were still relatively specialized vehicles, the main type of tank in the British army was the heavy cruiser, whether the Sherman or the Cromwell.  &#x200B;  Sources and further reading:  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/03/medium-tank-mki-first-of-maneuver-tanks.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/03/medium-tank-mki-first-of-maneuver-tanks.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/12/medium-tank-mkii-interbellum-long-liver.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/12/medium-tank-mkii-interbellum-long-liver.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/01/medium-tank-mkiii-britains-cerberus.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/01/medium-tank-mkiii-britains-cerberus.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/the-first-cruiser.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/the-first-cruiser.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/cruiser-tank-mkii-with-best-intentions.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/cruiser-tank-mkii-with-best-intentions.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/04/infantry-tank-mki-first-infantry-tank.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/04/infantry-tank-mki-first-infantry-tank.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2018/05/short-term-queen-of-desert.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2018/05/short-term-queen-of-desert.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/01/britains-christie.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/01/britains-christie.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/05/cruiser-iv-bit-more-armour.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/05/cruiser-iv-bit-more-armour.html)  [https://warspot.net/246-first-among-equals](https://warspot.net/246-first-among-equals)  [https://warspot.net/382-front-line-prime-minister](https://warspot.net/382-front-line-prime-minister)  [https://warspot.ru/15292-bednye-rodstvenniki-kromvelya](https://warspot.ru/15292-bednye-rodstvenniki-kromvelya)   [https://warspot.ru/13466-kromvel-luchshe-pozdno-chem-nikogda](https://warspot.ru/13466-kromvel-luchshe-pozdno-chem-nikogda)	1642718011.0	htipuij	t3_s89fqq	t3_s89fqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htipuij/

itaexggd	This answer is pretty amazing, and I'm glad that it confirms some of my sneaking suspicions as a computer science student and a lay reader of the history of computing. I've hypothesized from my teaching experience, and have written about, how teaching a too simplified version of the history of science might actually be detrimental to emerging scientists. It gives students a false sense of how science works. Yet I've lacked a solid framework on which to base my feelings. So this post is really helpful.   Anyhow, do you happen to have any suggestions about works on the history of computing that entail historiographical discussions? I've obviously read a thing or two, though in a haphazard manner without a good understanding of how the field works.   As a follow-up question, I am aware that military history has a bad reputation due to the fact that many military historians are trained in the military, and not as a historian. Is there any sort of similar reputation for the history of science among mainstream historians, considering how many historians of science are trained in science and not in history?	1642721541.0	htixvc4	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth0dq6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htixvc4/

4sv8x	Honestly, I don't think that a band member in the 1960s would have seen it as disrespectful to cover a Beatles song in their presence. After all, two years before the release of *Sgt Peppers* there was a BBC TV special titled *The Music of Lennon & McCartney* which featured a variety of musicians covering Beatles songs...in their presence. 'Yesterday' was widely enough covered in the 1960s that it sometimes gets claimed that it's one of the most covered songs ever (in the 1965 BBC TV special it has McCartney do half the song, and then Marianne Faithfull does the other half). And not everything in the BBC special was exactly respectful: [Peter Sellers' version of *A Hard Day's Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLEMncv140s) is comedic, a parody of [Laurence Olivier's portrayal of Richard III in the Shakespeare play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDxnXgYPnKg). Presumably performed while members of the Beatles were there in the studio (BBC productions like this in the 1960s were basically recorded live), the Beatles almost certainly would have *loved it* because they had been massive fans of Sellers' comedy group the Goons.  Indeed, Beatles covers were common in the 1960s, where bands felt that a cover of a Lennon and McCartney track not released as a Beatles single might be a possibility for commercial success - that is why you get the Rolling Stones covering 'I Wanna Be Your Man', the Hollies covering 'I'm Looking Through You', Joe Cocker covering 'With A Little Help From My Friends', along with all of the early songs given away by Lennon and McCartney to other Merseybeat/London Invasion bands (e.g., 'From A Window' by Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, 'Hello Little Girl' by the Fourmost, 'World Without Love' by Peter and Gordon).  What did change with *Sgt. Peppers* when it was released on May 26th 1967 was the formation of a rock canon formed around albums, and in which *Sgt. Peppers* was often to be found at or near the top, with discussion of the worth of the album usually focused on the effort put into the arrangements and production of the sound, and its becoming the first enormously successful rock album that wasn't just a collection of songs but something closer to a symphony crafted together in a deliberate order from individual song material.   Rock being 'canonised' does have an implication of it being possible to commit sacrilege in some way by defacing the music. And some readers will probably have a negative reaction to Big Daddy's [comical recasting of 'Sgt Peppers' as 'Poison Ivy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8yaP_woyRc) or the [Hollyridge Strings' easy listening instrumental version of 'Sgt Peppers'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bppQnpRy7sU). And so the screenwriter who wrote that dialogue in the 2013 movie is most likely referring to the hallowed halls of the rock canon when he has the actor playing Mitchell or Redding voice concern about disrespect - he's voicing the feelings of 2013 about something that happened in 1967. *Sgt Peppers* was an instant commercial and critical success: for example, a negative critical comment about it in the New York *Village Voice* got hundreds of angry letters in reply. But the rock canon did take longer than a week to form, and the change in the way that people saw rock music that happened as a result of *Sgt Peppers* did not *quite* happen overnight.  And it's *very* clear that the Beatles did not feel disrespected hearing their song sung by Jimi Hendrix (who also clearly became a member of the rock canon). Certainly, Paul McCartney - the song's main writer, and one of the people most influential on the production of the album - was clearly *very* pleased to hear Hendrix's version of the song when Hendrix played it at the Saville Theatre:   > I remember him opening at the Saville on a Sunday night, 4th June 1967. Brian Epstein used to rent it when it was usually dark on the Sunday. Jimi opened, the curtains flew back and he came walking forward, playing 'Sgt. Pepper', and it had only been released on the Thursday so that was like the ultimate compliment. It's still obviously a shining memory for me, because I admired him so much anyway, he was so accomplished. To think that that album had meant so much to him as to actually do it by the Sunday night, three days after the release. He must have been so into it, because normally it might take a day for rehearsal and then you might wonder whether you'd put it in, but he just opened with it. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honours of my career.	1642723892.0	htj3j6s	t3_s8esuw	t3_s8esuw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8esuw/what_is_the_historical_reason_for_playing_a_band/htj3j6s/

But it never grew into anything major.  *The Ku Klux Klan in Canada: A Century of Promoting Racism and Hate in the Peaceable Kingdom* by Allan Bartley (2020) looks at it at the national level, and I just read this too, but I didn't find it as good as Pitsula's book.	1642724479.0	htj4xjn	t3_s8jmqy	t1_htgwylf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8jmqy/thursday_reading_recommendations_january_20_2022/htj4xjn/
7rvatyyv	Pitsula direclty addresses that (on p.7): "[t]he Klan, on the other hand, never mentioned Aboriginal peoples. It was as though they did not exist: they were thought to be a 'vanishing' race of no interest or relevance." This makes sense considering the Indian Act was in full force and most First Nations in Saskatchewan (and Canada as a whole) were confined to remote reservations. They didn't matter to the KKK because they were not a group that the Klan came into contact with frequently, unlike immigrants (meaning Chinese and Ukrainians for the most part).	1642724651.0	htj5c7c	t3_s8jmqy	t1_hti0q09	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8jmqy/thursday_reading_recommendations_january_20_2022/htj5c7c/

7s4rt2oe	The quote you used does accurately describe some instances in the first World War where even though the Germans were defending, they still had similar casualties to the Entente powers. There is also examples where casualties were less than the entente powers. My answer will stick mostly to the western front as German organization and planning over the slow and disjointed Russians in the East is what created their casualty difference there. The eastern front was far more mobile due to the size of the region so trench systems were far less common especially compared to the gridlocked western front that is synonymous with our view of trench warfare.    One thing that helped the Germans avoid more casualties in the war was the way they built trenches. The Entente power's trenches were most built straight out of digging into the earth and using wood, wire mesh, or sandbags to reinforce the walls.  Most of these trenches were only about 6 to 8 feet deep with dugout in support trenchs dug to only around 16ft, with some trench lines even shallower then that.   The Germans had observed the process of the Russo-Japanese war from 1904-05 and had seen the use of trench warfare there. During WWI, they based a lot of their knowledge off of these studies and used reinforced concrete in the construction of their trenches, something the Entente rarely did. They also made extensive use of dugout bunkers, usually a minimum of 16ft and would even reach multiple stories in some places. They would also provide ventilation for them to avoid the hazard of gas attacks. They could sit and ride out many of the initial bombardments that precluded many offensives and go to the surface whenever the advance started. Some of the bunkers could be collapsed by the artillery bombardments, but most were very suitable to surviving them.    The Germans also generally had greater amounts of heavy artillery, especially in the first couple years of the war. Entente planning would fail to properly neutralize the German artillery before many offensives and it would mean the German artillery could pound the Entente soldiers as they cross no man land. German doctrine also made better use of machine guns, even dictating interlocking fields of fire that would create large kill zones for infantry trying advance.    As the Entente was more focused on the offensive and the Germans viewed that they really only needed to hold onto the land they already have as they were well inside France, this explains why the Entente didn't do the same and use concrete in trench construction. Their view was why waste the resources on better trenches as it would discourage the attitude of the advance. Certain technologies like the tank could assist in advancing, but like most wars that came before, it was expected for the attacker to face more casualties to overcome the defender. Not always the cass but still happened throughout the war.	1642725935.0	htj8d3r	t3_s8wn96	t3_s8wn96	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8wn96/what_factors_lead_to_german_casualty_ratios_being/htj8d3r/

u9kma	Not exactly inaccurate, but not exactly to the point either. The point of the story is that vegetables *by themselves* would be considered an ascetic meal. 'Low and disdained' and 'paltry' are hyperbole to accentuate the point.  In reality vegetables were an important part of the ancient Greek diet, though not as important as in modern western cuisine.  The main component of the ancient Greek diet was grain, particularly barley and wheat (durum and aestivum), though also millet, rye, and oats.  The secondary components fall into three groups: (1) three important legumes, namely chickpeas, lentils, broad beans, and peas; (2) meat and fish, typically as flavourings or sauces to accompany the main ingredients; (3) olive oil and wine.  But there were plenty of tertiary foodstuffs alongside these, including fruits, nuts, seeds, eggs, cheese, honey (usually as an ingredient in baked goods), and yes, vegetables.  Peter Garnsey's *Food and society in classical antiquity* (1999) doesn't devote attention to these specifically, though he does mention vegetables frequently. A more focused discussion is in Victoria Tsoukala's PhD dissertation on *The social context of food preparation and consumption ...* (diss. Bryn Mawr, 2004), pp. 29-30, which suggests that the most common ones were celery, leek, beet, onion, cress, lettuce, and garlic. I'm a little uneasy that she relies on Andrew Dalby, but these do seem to be backed up by primary sources. I'm also aware that cabbage growing techniques are discussed at some length in Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder; and there were other cheaper or inferior options, e.g. cannabis could be used as an inferior replacement for cabbage.  Some striking *absences* from the list of vegetables used would be carrot, artichoke, and most of the modern varieties of Brassica. When I said 'cabbage' above, that didn't mean the modern cabbage, which wasn't developed until the Roman era. It may have meant something closer to kale. Most of the modern varieties of Brassica seem to have become differentiated from one another in ancient Italy rather than in Greece.  The idea of a vegetable-centred diet as ascetic can be seen in some ancient Christian documents. The *Life of Hilarion*, dating to the 390s CE, describes Hilarion's ascetic diet:  > ... from the time [Hilarion] was twenty-one until he was twenty-six, for three years he ate half a pint of lentils soaked in cold water and for the other three years he ate dry bread with salt and water.  > Then from the time he was twenty-seven until he was thirty-one, he sustained himself with wild herbs and uncooked roots of certain shrubs.  > From the time he was thirty-one until he was thirty-five his food consisted of six ounces of barley bread and lightly cooked vegetables without any oil.  > But when he sensed that his eyes were clouding over and that his whole body was contracting under the influence of impetigo and some kind of rough skin disease, he added oil to the diet just mentioned, and until the sixty-third year of his life he continued at this level of abstinence, tasting nothing else, neither fruit nor beans nor anything else.  (Quoted from Jason König's translation, in *Saints and symposiasts*, 2012, p. 342.)  So the upshot is that I'd read the Diogenes story as an indication of Diogenes' asceticism, rather than as a marker of social class.	1642728573.0	htjeglv	t3_s8mk5t	t3_s8mk5t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8mk5t/did_the_ancient_greeks_really_look_down_on_eating/htjeglv/

2ycwtyy0	So few people are receiving mail that it's not really an issue. If you're important enough to receive mail through this postal system, you're important enough that the couriers will know where you live or work.  Until about the 1800s or so, less than a third of all people in China are able to read and write, and the number of people who are important enough to use this sort of system are much fewer than that.  For example, if you're delivering an update on recent pirate attacks from a province on the eastern coast to Peking (modern-day Beijing), the courier might not know who "General Bao" (to make up a random person) is, but they know where the military barracks is at. More likely, though, the general receives mail regularly enough that the couriers know where he lives.  So let's say that General Bao doesn't get his letter, for whatever reason. Maybe the courier can't find him or no one has the proper authority to accept it on his behalf? In that case, the courier takes the letter back to the relay station and simply stores it for the general to collect later. The couriers are all strapped with loud clanging bells, so the idea that they might wander into the barracks and say "I'm looking for General Bao" and *no one* mentions it to him later was considered a relatively low risk. Alternatively, Bao might check the postal station somewhat regularly, or have a servant designated to do as such. If a month goes by without so much as a word from anyone about anything, that might be the cause of some suspicion for our hypothetical general.  Again, the system is designed with a very small number of people in mind. *Finding* the person was not considered a major obstacle, and most of their logistical concerns revolved around verifying that the letter wasn't intercepted or opened before reaching its destination.   If you're just wanting to write, for example, a poem to a particular lady in the next neighborhood over, there were certain merchants and couriers who made it their business to make sure it found its way to the intended recipient. In that case, there wasn't any real standardized system-- it primarily depended on who you paid to send the letter on its way. In that case, someone who carries people to that neighborhood  (via a sort of chair strapped to their back) might be willing to find your lovely lady and deliver her letter for you, but there is no standardized system by which that can be done. Which isn't to say that informal systems didn't exist!   Trade merchants were known to set up their *own* courier systems, and they were similarly known to be willing to deliver personal letters alongside their official correspondence, but the idea was still the same: Get to the neighborhood in question and then ask around. How these hand-offs happened and what the process was for finding the correct recipient varied widely, but the basic idea was always the same. Get the letter or parcel within the general area, and then locate the recipient.  Which isn't to say the system was *perfect* and always worked. Westerners visiting China in the early 1900s actually found this system incredibly frustrating. Not just because their correspondence had a nasty propensity for getting lost, but also because writing correspondence back to their home countries was particularly troublesome as well. If you're a missionary in Peking and you want to write back to beloved England, you pay a courier to get the letter to the coast (either directly via their deliveries for a merchant or via a series of hand-offs in an informal network of other couriers) and then hope that the captain of the ship is willing to take your letter to another ship which then takes it to another ship that eventually gets it to England.  If you're thinking to yourself that outside of very important military correspondence going to very important people that this sounds like a convoluted mess of hand-offs and hoping, you've got the right idea.	1642729153.0	htjft7n	t3_s88meg	t1_htj1io4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htjft7n/

ntc30	We've removed your post for the moment because it's not currently at our standards, but it definitely has the potential to fit within our rules with some work. We find that some answers that fall short of our standards can be successfully revised by considering the following questions, not all of which necessarily apply here:  * *Do you actually address the question asked by OP?* Sometimes answers get removed not because they fail to meet our standards, but because they don't get at what the OP is asking. If the question itself is flawed, you need to explain why, and how your answer addresses the underlying issues at hand.  * *What are the sources for your claims?* Sources aren't strictly necessary on /r/AskHistorians but the inclusion of sources is helpful for evaluating your knowledge base. If we can see that your answer is influenced by up-to-date academic secondary sources, it gives us more confidence in your answer and allows users to check where your ideas are coming from.  * *What level of detail do you go into about events?* Often it's hard to do justice to even seemingly simple subjects in a paragraph or two, and on /r/AskHistorians, the basics need to be explained within historical context, to avoid misleading intelligent but non-specialist readers.  In many cases, it's worth providing a broader historical framework, giving more of a sense of not just what happened, but why.  * *Do you downplay or ignore legitimate historical debate on the topic matter?* There is often more than one plausible interpretation of the historical record. While you might have your own views on which interpretation is correct, answers can often be improved by acknowledging alternative explanations from other scholars.   * *Further Reading*: [This Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/) provides further exploration of the rules and expectations concerning answers so may be of interest.  If/when you edit your answer, [please reach out via modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) so we can re-evaluate it!

96gqp	That's very much getting into a what-if, but fortunately it's a well-trodden what-if. In a lot of ways the US was lucky that Japan sank their ships in a shallow harbor; of the U.S. battle line there that day, only _Arizona_ and _Oklahoma_ would be written off as total losses; many of the other ships that were sunk were raised and participated later in the war against Japan. Losing the carriers would have been a blow to the United States, but over the course of the war the US launched ~130 new carriers of all types; Japan converted or completed 13, including two liner conversions of dubious utility. The (potential) dearth of carriers available to the US might have caused a pause in carrier operations similar to, uh, let's say the pause in carrier operations between the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in late 1942 and the Marianas in June 1944. In either case, the American carriers coming online weren't available until early- to -mid-1944 and wouldn't have been in either case; we can imagine a not-Coral Sea and a not-Midway, but the first was a local operation anyhow and the second was designed to draw out and destroy our (hypothetically non-existent) carrier fleet, in which case it wouldn't have been carried out.   tl;dr: no, there was no way the American navy was going to be defeated in the Pacific; only perhaps delayed.	1642729961.0	htjho80	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htimgqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjho80/

d9bl4mjs	Yes. Specifically in Los Angeles, Asian communities, but more specifically Koreans, emerged as something of a merchant middle-class, and would frequently open stores in areas with the lowest barrier to purchasing real-estate, which is to say low-income black-dominant neighborhoods where they often didn’t live themselves. This created a kind of material tension between the poor residents of an area and this local foreigners who controlled the majority of basic commerce. Each was threatened by the other, with the local black population feeling exploited and robbed of economic opportunity by the Asians who often did not hire black employees or contribute to local community projects, and the Asians feeling threatened by the black overwhelming population in more traditionally racist tropes or perhaps sensing this very real sense of aggrievement. Additionally, Korea is an extremely homogenous society that is largely unaware of the history of American race relations and immigrants from that country were particularly poorly equipped for the multiculturalism of urban America, which further provoked misunderstanding and tension.

9c89xxn	>I've hypothesized from my teaching experience, and have written about, how teaching a too simplified version of the history of science might actually be detrimental to emerging scientists.  I think they are two distinct fields. The kind of history we teach scientists isn't really history as historians would use the term. It's focused on the science (what was the idea, how did it differ from the previous version) rather than on the person (how did the scientist came up with this idea, what was his context), or on society (what did his contemporaries think, how did they react and why, what influence did it have on society).  I don't think it's possible to give a historian's context to the student in science class, just as you wouldn't expect a historian to fully understand or appreciate the science. It's a specialized field where you need credentials in both science and history to do it justice. The focus in science classes is much more limited, for example, talking about Newtonian mechanics to show how Einstein's field equations change our understanding of how matter actually interacts with space and time. The instructor only has a passing interest in who Newton or Einstein were or the world they lived in, the point is to communicate that there was an increasing mismatch between what Newton predicted and what we actually observed, so there was a need to reconcile theory with observations.  I think this is what the previous comment referred to as the "march of winners", not in the sense of winners and losers as people, but rather ideas that "won" because they better explained the facts. Because the scientist isn't really interested in the people, they are just convenient names to hang ideas on. Instead, the "history" is just an account of how our understanding of some phenomenon proceeded from A to B, via steps X, Y and Z in between.  This kind of account absolutely does not replace history, but it's not meant to. It's just a consequence of the division of labor between scientist and historian, with the scientist providing an account of the evolution of an idea, and the historian providing the context surrounding the idea.	1642731428.0	htjl15x	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htixvc4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htjl15x/

8brve	I am not deeply steeped in the history of computing — it is its own sub-discipline, more associated with the history of technology than the history of science — but perhaps there are others with suggestions there. SIGCIS, an organization of scholars who study the history of computing, has a [really useful resource guide](vhttps://www.sigcis.org/resources) which a section of "Key Books and Articles on the History of Computing" that includes descriptions of the various books. The one book I tend to recommend to people who want to branch out of the version of the history of computing that computer scientists tell themselves is Paul Edwards' _The Closed World_, which is about the connections between the development of modern computers and the military-industrial complex in the Cold War and how to think about them not just as technical artifacts but as technopolitical systems that also inscribed certain ideologies into physical practice.   On the last question — there are sort of two ways to think about this. One is the issue of historians vs. scientists, which is sort of the old "Science Wars" approach. Most of that seems kind of passé at this point, largely because there aren't as many people blaming postmodernism for all of society's woes (now they blame people who teach about race, which is its own problem, obviously). The other is historians of science vs. other historians. My experience is that non-historians of science can often feel that historians of science are WAY too interested in the content of the science for their own good; they regard us as being much more technical (and they themselves are often pretty proudly ignorant of scientific matters). (Scientists, of course, never view us as technical-enough, so nobody is ever _that_ happy with us. I think this is an advantage, in the end; historians of science are born "boundary crossers" and pretty comfortable in all sorts of crowds. I work at a STEM school where practically all of the historians are historians of science/tech, so this is not an issue I have to confront much anymore.) Similarly, historians of science tend to get very annoyed when historians who haven't studied any history of science say very silly and unexamined things about science, which can happen all of the time. In general though, the history of science has done a good job, I think, in having many of its "big ideas" penetrate into the broader historical community at this point, so it is not as awkward as it might have been in the past.  I would note one thing though — today, most historians of science, while they may have had some training in science, almost always have substantial training in history. There are very few people who are "merely" former scientists anymore. That wasn't always the case (Kuhn was a physicist who became basically self-taught in history, for example), but it has been that way for the past several decades. It is a fairly mature historical field. Whereas the history of computing is still a field where, as you note, a lot of the people who write about it are basically "participants" — computer scientists first, without formal training in history. That isn't a totally bad thing, obviously; it does take considerable subject expertise to write a history well, and participants have that, and can learn to be good historians. But I do see it as a sign of an "immature" field when the ratio of former participants to people with PhDs in the subfield of history are skewed; it tends to lead to insufficient historiographical self-reflection, for example, and too much reiteration of internal stories of development at the expense of other ways to think about it. History of computing has come a long way in the last decade or two, though, so it may not be fair to characterize it this way; there is an ever-growing crop of younger historians of computing who have always been that. (If you are interested in talking with them, SIGCIS is the group to join!)	1642732086.0	htjmjq2	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htixvc4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htjmjq2/

96gqp	> 130 "carriers" not carriers.  Ok, if you want to be a pedant about this, we can go all day, bro.   In the period after Dec. 7, 1941, and bounded by September, 1945, the United States built something close to 130 aircraft carriers of all types. Of those, if we _only_ consider fleet carriers important, 24 Essex-class fleet carriers were completed during the war, with another eight canceled, two in mid-construction. During that time, if we discount the useless liner conversions and  escort carriers (as you seem to be doing with your sneering "carriers") Japan built only the Shinano (sunk by a submarine on her maiden voyage) and the Taihō, also sunk by a sub.   Does that materially change my point?	1642734694.0	htjskjr	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjnvfo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjskjr/

itaexggd	Thank you for pointing out CIGCIS resource guide! Some of the books on the list are going to be on my ever-growing to-read list :P  Computing as a field, in general, is merely a century old so it makes sense that the history of computing, too, is a relatively new field.   I'm wondering, are you aware whether the history of computing/technology has had many interconnections with the philosophy of technology and/or technocriticism? I've read a little bit on the contemporary debate among computing professionals on the issues of technological instrumentalist and determinism, but surely the level of discussion among computing professionals would be lagging behind those who are philosophers first.	1642735454.0	htju9sy	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htjmjq2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htju9sy/

i6kyb	Hopefully /u/Iphikrates won't mind me butting in here, but I'll say that the medieval chapters are quite good. Christopher Allmand is one of the leading military historians of the late Middle Ages, which Bernard Bachrach has been the mainstay of Early Medieval military history for fifty years.  I will say that you should disregard some of Bachrach's biggest numbers. He's one of biggest proponents of big Carolingian armies and generally big High Medieval armies, but often he goes higher than the evidence allows. Charlemagne at his height, for instance, likely did have a pool of 35 000 mounted men to draw on, but there's relatively little evidence for large numbers of infantry (barring armed servants driving wagons, and even these often had no more than a club).   Similarly, the suggestion that Alfred the Great had a paid force of 27 000 men in his burhs is based on a tentative suggestion put forward by Nicholas Brooks (and subsequently made less tentative) that has, in recent years, been heavily criticised. Likely these men were primarily for the *maintenance* of the fortifications and might have served as garrisons in war time, but they're unlikely to have been a standing, paid force.  Still, Bachrach does well for the most part, so just be careful when he suggests numbers of more than 15-20 000 and look more at his descriptions of fortifications, the importance of infantry and the effect of political fragmentation on manpower available to an individual ruler.	1642736019.0	htjvirp	t3_s83m6b	t1_htif15v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/htjvirp/

2ycwtyy0	Definitely! As I said, Westerners living in China at the time found this whole process ***incredibly*** frustrating. The western powers were primarily concerned with getting mail into and out of the country reliably, so there were a number of post offices set up for western mail, but even then once it got there nobody really had any idea what to do with it beyond hand it off to a courier and hope for the best. This caused each nation to set up their own specific postal routes, policies, and practices, which just added to the confusion and frustration.   Sir Robert Hart (British) founded the Imperial Post in 1896, but I think the fact that China didn't join the International Postal Union until 1914 should give some insight into how confusing the entire thing was. The ancient courier relay system had served China perfectly well for hundreds of years precisely because only a very small elite class of people were able to utilize it. Once the Western powers began establishing their presence in large numbers in the late 1800s, though, it became clear that flaws which were easily manageable on a small scale created pretty significant problems on a larger scale.	1642741338.0	htk6klc	t3_s88meg	t1_htjmu20	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htk6klc/

izvvt	This is a bit of a broad question as many different historians in many different fields will use a variety of different historiographic theories, some more so than others. Some historians don't use a lot of theory in their work while others are incredibly theory-heavy.  In addition to that, Marxism and historical materialism as a theory itself has evolved and changed a lot over the past 50-60 years. I'll try and map some of those changes and show how aspects of historical materialism are still very much used in work published in my field, 20th-century Caribbean history, with an emphasis on Trinidad and Tobago. Other historians can answer how much Marxism is relevant in their own fields.   A common critique of historical materialism as a theory has been that it is too deterministic and does not give historical actors enough agency. In one of Karl Marx's most famous quotes in his 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, he states "Men make their own history but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past". Many Marxist historians have tried to introduce agency into their work, and show how the proletariat gains class consciousness. Arguably the most famous of these examples is E.P. Thoompsons *The making of the English working-class* published in 1963. In it, Thompson argues that the working class was "present at its own making" that "class is a relationship" and that Thompson's overarching goal was to rescue the working class from the "enormous condescension of posterity" Many consider Thompson's work the first piece of "cultural marxism" that shows that the proletariat forms itself when it feels that its rights are being trampled on, and that the working class does not simply form when economic conditions are poor, but that instead, class is formed by relationships of men between each other. The book has received its due criticism over the course of the past 60 years. The book is gender in a very male-dominated way and Thompson is incredibly hostile to the methodist church of England. However, it is arguably one of the most important pieces of Marxist texts and started to open the door for a more wide-ranging kind of Marxist history.   The famous gender historian Joan Scott began to tackle the issues of gender in Marxism in her work *Gender and the Politics of History* published in 1988. In it, Scott argues that   "Identity becomes not a reflection of some essential reality but a matter of political allegiance. Feminist history approached this way changes Thompson’s story. It refuses its teleology and retells it as a story of the creation of political identity through representations of sexual difference. Class and gender become inextricably linked in this telling—as representation, as identity, as social and political practice."  Scott is challenging the typically male-gendered nature of class and asking for a more analytical approach to working-class politics, "one that recasts our knowledge about gender and class." I'm not a gender historian but I bring this example up, along with the Thompson example, to show that Marxist historical analyses begins to be mixed with other kinds of historiography and that studies of class become intersectional with studies of race, gender, and post-colonialism  To breach now more into my field to show how Marxism is still very relevant in contemporary work on the Caribbean, and specifically Trinidad and Tobago. I'll try to keep this somewhat brief to the best of my ability as this section will read more as just examples of how Marxism is still used. I understand you would probably like a more broad-reaching answer to your question, but I can show how in my field Marxism is still very frequently used.   In writing about the Black Power Revolution in 1970 in Trinidad and Tobago, historian Brinsley Samaroo in the book *Black Power in the Caribbean,* published in 2019, argues   “The view among those who challenged the existing system was that the black-led government of the People’s National Movement (PNM) had concentrated on capturing the administrative machinery of power but had left economic control in the hands of the colonial (European) and neocolonial (North American) capitalist classes and the local comprador bourgeoisie"  Here you can see Samaroo uses a mix of Marxist and Post-Colonial ideology to argue that the Eric Williams-led PNM government of Trinidad and Tobago had sold out to colonial capitalist interests that would end up leading to a revolution taking place that had mixes of anti-capitalist sentiment and Black Power ideology. However, it should be noted that NJAC, the group that would lead this revolution, very much felt that they were a vanguard party of a socialist revolution in the country.   Kate Quinn, in the same book, points out how one of the strongest forces of Black Power in the Caribbean as a whole and in Trinidad and Tobago specifically, was its economic critiques. Quinn argues “The Black Power critique of Caribbean economies centered on two fundamental issues: foreign ownership and control of major resources and the domination of the local economy by minority local elites, who were mostly lighter-skinned.” Once again, here we see a mix of Marxist class critique mixed with decolonial language.   James Millette in examing the Black Power Revolution of Trinidad and Tobago takes on a more purely historical materialist perspective. Millette argues that Williams had abandoned the working class of Trinidad and Tobago when he was elected Prime Minister and that “Williams had signified his willingness to put himself at the head of the national bourgeoisie”.  Millette was a professor at the University of the West Indies at the time and was a leader of the NJAC group that would lead the revolution, so his perspective and bias should be called into question in his writing about the event decades later, but he very obviously believed that Black Power Revolution of 1970 was a socialist revolution that was going to overthrow Bourgouise capitalist interests in his nation.  These are just three small examples of how in my narrow field, Marxism and aspects of historical materialism are still very much in use. Pure Marxists and pure economic determinism has fallen out of favor, but in looking at elements of class formation, class relations, and aspects of revolutionary consciousness through a Marxist lens are still very much relevant, often with ties to post-colonialism.

i6kyb	Gerry Milligan's *Moral Combat: Women, Gender, and War in Italian Renaissance Literature* has been on my reading list for a while and would seem to be the most recent and up to date book on the topic, at least so far as cross-dressing women and warfare, but Margaret Tomalin's *The Fortunes of the Warrior Heroine in Italian Literature: An Index of Emancipation* and Lillian S. Robinson's *Monstrous Regiment: The Lady Knight in Sixteenth-century Epic* should also be on your list.  Although not directly related to women dressing as men, [this article](Is This Love? Same-Sex Marriages in Renaissance Rome) on a same-sex marriage in the 1570s includes a reference to men who dressed up as women during the ceremony, and you might find it profitable to look into same-sex communities of the time and see if cross-dressing was common beyond just the one known instance of a wedding ceremony. And speaking of the possibility of transwomen, there was possibly one in [mid-14th century Venice](https://www.ilgazzettino.it/nordest/venezia/rolandina_roncaglia_transgender-4416039.html), although you'll probably need to do some real digging to verify that.   How much Italian can you read? I suspect that most sources will be easiest to find if you know the right terms to search academia.edu and Google Scholar for Italian scholarship.	1642744143.0	htkbrmv	t3_s8pm4m	t3_s8pm4m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8pm4m/instances_of_female_crossdressing_in_renaissance/htkbrmv/

168sly	This is going to be difficult to answer not only because it's a "why didn't x happen" and because of the 20 year rule.  Keeping both in mind - as for why Ukraine didn't aspire to join NATO in the 1990s through 2002, during the period when countries like Poland, the Baltics, or the Czech Republic did have stated policies to join the alliance, there are a few factors in play. A major one is that it just scored incredibly low on Ukrainians' radars. Polls from the late 1990s showed that interest in NATO membership, or in joining pretty much any international organization, were incredibly low on regular Ukrainian people's minds compared to economic issues, which makes sense given that Ukraine was going through a massive economic disruption caused by the end of Soviet central planning (the Ukrainian economy still technically hasn't recovered to 1991 levels). This general lack of interest went hand-in-hand with low Ukrainian media coverage of such topics, and a feeling among the Ukrainian political elite that since membership was such a remote prospect (it should be noted that even Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were not invited to join NATO until 1997, and didn't become members until 1999 - Slovakia was noticeably not invited in this round because of perceived undemocratic tendencies of it's then-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar), it really wasn't an issue worth addressing. Even that NATO expansion was strongly opposed by Russia, which already also spoke of Ukraine (and other former Soviet states) in terms of a "Near Abroad", not quite separate from the Russian sphere. The West itself at this time didn't necessarily see Ukraine as completely independent from Russia, and usually subordinated concerns about the former to focus more directly on the latter.   On top of this, there was a consistent minority that was against NATO membership when pollsters pressed on the topic. When asked in 1997 if Russia's opposition to NATO expansion was justified, 24.8% of Ukrainian respondents said yes, 55.2% of respondents didn't know, and only 20% said no. Similar numbers said that NATO expansion to include Ukraine would be against Ukrainian interests and contradict its Non-Aligned status. Indifference really was the order of the day across the country, but on top of this resistance to Ukrainian membership in NATO was especially strong in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine (especially the Donetsk region) where almost 50% of respondents opposed NATO membership, while Western Ukraine showed much stronger favorability to NATO membership. Ethnic Russians - concentrated in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, also tended to be more hostile to the idea of NATO membership. Regardless of their feeling, Ukrainians who saw international relations as a pressing issue numbered in the single digits - it just wasn't a pressing concern.  On top of this, the political landscape of Ukraine was very different in the 1990s from today, and was very similar to what was happening in Russia at the time. In the 1994 and 1998 elections the largest number of party seats went to the Communist Party of Ukraine (86 out of 450 in 1994, and 121 out of 450 in 1998). The KPU (which was more heavily based in the Ukrainian south and east) looked very fondly on the Soviet period and not very fondly at all on the West. This was a major political bloc against greater integration with NATO and in favor of closer ties with Russia. Ironically, worsening Ukrainian-Russian relations led in part to the political downfall of President Leonid Kravchuk and his defeat in 1994 by Leonid Kuchma, elected with strong support from the south and east, and favoring better ties with Russia. Kuchma began to move towards a more independent-minded foreign policy, but moved towards unoffiical cooperation with NATO, joining the Partnership for Peace program and signing a partnership charter with the alliance in 1997. But still because of political considerations, the official position was that Ukraine was a neutral state, and even when President Kuchma (after his 1999 reelection) pushed for closer ties with the West, it was specifically with the EU rather than NATO, again reflection a greater popular concern about economic matters.  In short - there were big regional and ethnic constituencies opposing involvement with NATO in the 1990s and early 2000s in Ukraine, and most Ukrainians were far more concerned about economic issues than what were perceived as international matters.  As a postscript, even well into the 2000s there was close division in public opinion between supporters and opponents of NATO membership, and a clear and overwhelming majority favoring NATO membership is something that is *extremely* recent to Ukrainian public opinion - like, in the last year or so - and highly shaped by events since 2014 which are beyond the scope of this sub.  This information and more can be found in a 2000 study titled "The Effect of NATO Partnership with Ukraine on Inter-Ethnic Relations within the Country" by Sergey Khrychikov available [here](https://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/98-00/khrychikov.pdf)	1642746793.0	htkg7tw	t3_s9168p	t3_s9168p	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9168p/why_did_ukraine_not_join_nato_with_the_rest_of/htkg7tw/

mdu63	I summarized some surroundings on medieval liturgical candles of bee wax in later medieval Sweden  before in: [Were candles a purely cottage industry in the middle ages?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q3yhhl/were_candles_a_purely_cottage_industry_in_the/), but I'm not 100% sure to what extent these conditions were the same across Europe (at least there seemed to have been candle maker guilds for animal tallow candles in more urbanized parts of Europe).  +++    Some very basic summarized points of the linked post are:    * There were actually two kind of wax in medieval (pre-Reformation) Europe: While animal tallow were widely used also in secular buildings, the church used candles made of bee wax exclusively. These two kind of wax must had a bit different chemical traits like melting points as well as smells, but I have not unfortunately read any relevant primary texts or secondary literature that discuss which traits of bee wax (or candles of bee wax) was favored by medieval churchmen.      * Bee wax was certainly luxury, and it occupied considerable part of the total purchase of individual local (parish) churches as well as more rich churches like cathedral in 15th century Sweden.   * Account records from late medieval Sweden almost exclusively mention the purchase of bee wax itself. neither candles made of bee wax nor animal tallow. It means that the clergy probably made candles by themselves or by their own servants.	1642747245.0	htkgwv3	t3_s8yzy9	t3_s8yzy9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htkgwv3/
k55aq	> I realize that this is so common now it seems silly to describe, but it's tough to overstate how revolutionary the design was. The N64, with its weird trident shape had just one trigger and one stick, and its design meant that it was impossible to use all the buttons on the controller without moving your hand around it. You could use the analogue stick and pull the trigger or you could use the face buttons, but you couldn't do both at the same time. What the Xbox controller did was give players the ability to use both sticks and triggers at the same time — and still allow the user to use one stick and face buttons.  The original [Dualshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock) controller predates the release of the [XBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console\)) by 4 years. 3 years before [Microsoft's acquisition of Bungie & Halo's move to being an XBox exclusive](https://web.archive.org/web/20060501214618/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Jun00/BungiePR.mspx). And according to sources I can find, Microsoft didn't commit to making the XBox until after Sony had announced the PS2 in March of 1999. ([here](https://venturebeat.com/2011/11/14/making-of-the-xbox-1/2/), [here](https://www.ign.com/videos/2015/07/02/podcast-unlocked-201-3-xbox-bosses-share-secrets-of-the-consoles-past)).  > Bungie took this design and ran with it, creating a control scheme that was so brilliant that in retrospect it seems obvious. Left stick to move, right stick to aim, trigger to shoot. These are the primary verbs of the FPS, and for the first time on a console, players could do them without needing to move their hands — just like on a PC.  From [Gamespot's review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alien-resurrection-review/1900-2637344/) of Alien Resurrection for the original Playstation, which was released on October 11th, 2000, more than a year before the release of Halo:  > The game's control setup is its most terrifying element. The left analog stick moves you forward, back, and strafes right and left, while the right analog stick turns you and can be used to look up and down. Too often, you'll turn to face a foe and find that your weapon is aimed at the floor or ceiling while the alien gleefully hacks away at your midsection. Add to the mix a few other head scratchers - such as how the triangle button controls item and health use - and you'll be wondering how Sony let this get by without requesting a few different control configuration options.   While they clearly didn't like it, they are *clearly* describing the modern dual-analog control scheme that has come to be standard.	1642747622.0	htkhhrz	t3_s7eef4	t1_htc8p4a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7eef4/what_was_it_that_made_halo_combat_evolved_such_a/htkhhrz/

9c89xxn	>That legendary scientist whose theory you just learned published a bunch of shitty papers  I wouldn't do that, because I wouldn't want the focus to be on the person, but on whatever work he did that's relevant to the topic. Same reason why I wouldn't mention if he cheated on his wife or beat his dog. I'm not trying to present a "fair and balanced" picture of the person, that's a job for biographies or tabloids. And if I were to bring up his other papers, I'd probably pick those foundational to science, not the ones that were "shitty". If they were wrong, they're not part of science anymore, and it seems a bit mean-spirited to bring them up just to say hey, look at this crap he wrote. "Fair and balanced" is a motto for news anchors, not a concern for science.  >that theoretical innovation which was useful for research at that time period turned out to have a devastating sociocultural impact  Again, that doesn't sit comfortably with me. I have a distaste for politicizing science, and "devastating sociocultural impact" is often not a clear cut objective fact, but has many nuances. It's a human tendency to assign blame, and it seems a bit wrong to give folks a target for hate, when in reality the picture is far more complex.  I'm not arguing that there's no value to these things, of course there is. But these are complicated topics that need a lot of context to explain, and even then, people may come to different conclusions because judgments are partly subjective. It would require a book or a proper class in history of science to treat them seriously, and I'm not sure a science lecture can do justice, or convey much more than the lecturer's own opinion. Which is at best worthless, and at worst, agenda-driven.	1642748203.0	htkiddz	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htjswja	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htkiddz/

1s8d9k78	Faith. Faith is an extremely powerful tool for a pope. Most Christian monarchs were genuinely faithful, felt like it was part of their duties to promote religion and support the Church, and believed in the legitimacy of the Pope. It's very hard to denounce or even attack someone you believe to be the messenger of you deity on earth, even if you personally disagree with them. Not to forget that your countrymen are faithful too, and that the local clergy is very influential; in any conflict between you and the Pope, you have no guarantee that the people will side with you. This is what happened during the Guelphs and Ghibellines era (XII and XIII centuries). Some towns and states sides with the Pope, others with the Holy Roman Emperor, and it created a conflict that lasted 50 years and had consequences for centuries more. For a long time, excommunication was also a very real threat to a monarch's power. And the Pope had exclusive control over that.  Even with taking faith out of the question, medieval and Renaissance Europe was very much a case of everyone knowing each other and having a web of political alliances, and this includes the Pope. Although Italy was not yet a state in itself and was divided in duchies, realms, princedoms and republics, there was still very much a sense of Italian nationality. Most popes were Italians, and most cardinals were as well. These men had (powerful) families which themselves had many alliances.  For example, Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) started his papacy with a tight alliance with the Sforza family, which controlled Milan. For this, he married off his daughter to a Sforza and named Ascanio Sforza Vice-Chancellor of the Church. When this fell through, Alexander VI remarried his daughter to the Aragon family of Naples, and one of his sons also married a member of that family. When this fell though again, he then allied himself to Louis XII of France through a partnership with his oldest (still living) son, Cesare. And Alexander VI was not a "popular" pope among his peers, a main reason for this being that he was a Spaniard and not Italian by birth. All this to show that no matter what, the Papacy always had allies who could fight with it. And while the Papal armies were far from being the most powerful at the time, they weren't a small force either. (Not to mention that any army wanting to attack the Vatican would have to cross Italy from either the north or the south, which had no chance of being welcome by the people ruling over those lands. Armies have a tendency to pillage and destroy towns on their way.)  So while military action against the Pope wasn't unheard of, it was a very risky endeavour that few monarchs dared to attempt.	1642752295.0	htko4ic	t3_s927c7	t3_s927c7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s927c7/historically_why_did_the_kings_tolerate_the_papacy/htko4ic/

They felt if they could turn it into a grind then the US would negotiate better terms with them and hopefully they could retain some of their imperial territories.

96gqp	No, that's literally the exact opposite of their war aims, [as I explained here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3dxlh4/what_did_japan_hope_to_accomplish_by_attacking/ct9l1wz/). The entire goal of their Navy, and the reason for their doctrine and tactical orientation during the interwar period, was to defeat the U.S. navy in one decisive battle (in which the U.S. navy would have been attrited steaming westward towards, say, the Philippines) after which the U.S. would have been forced to sue for peace. This is why they trained elite aviators, but few of them; this is why they practiced night fighting but not damage control; this is why they built a few super-battleships but not many of them -- because their industrial base could not sustain a long war.   To illustrate this: When Japanese A6 Zero fighters rolled off the production line, they were dragged by oxen to the airstrip where they flew off to the fleet.	1642757731.0	htkv7vu	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjukyt	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htkv7vu/

itaexggd	I'll chew on your comment for a while. There are two aspects in which I don't agreeing with you, although I do agree that whether a scientist was a dog-beater is usually irrelevant.   First, I teach middle and high school students which brings about its own challenges. Their attention spans are shorter, and many do not want to be in the room. Grabbing the attention of a student sometimes involves history trivia. Furthermore, when teaching K-12 students, the pedagogical purpose of science courses is not merely for them to gain a precise understanding of scientific concepts, but also as a part of a holistic common education curriculum that tries to get students interested in things. This is purely my personal conjecture: a K-12 student who understands that scientists overcame many failures to reach discoveries will be more encouraged to experiment with ideas themselves. I find it to be highly educational to introduce students to a particular theory that turned out to be false, and to give them the challenge of designing an experiment to disprove it. Of course, the higher up in grade the students go, the less time a good teacher must spend on diversions.   Yet, I wonder, must nonscientific context always be removed from university-level courses as well? An introductory AI professor spent around 10 minutes of one of the lectures discussing incidents in which bias in AI caused societal issues. 10 minutes of a semester driving home the point that bias in AI is both an objective technological problem and a subjective ethics problem to a room full of potential AI developers is essential. Especially since the CS curriculum at my university does not mandate an ethics course. It is just too difficult to cram everything useful into a curriculum, so sometimes essential topics such as ethics in CS get relegated to the margins of introductory courses.   The second example is Morgan's canon, which states that one must choose the simplest possible explanation for an animal's behavior. Although Morgan's canon was useful in preventing anthropomorphic bias, it also prevented the scientific study of animals' emotions and intelligence for many decades, which in turn may have contributed to animal abuse, in both scientific experiments and in wider society. Surely, a quick mention of this historical context of the Morgan's canon in an introductory animal behavior class would not be irrelevant in a room full of potential biologists who may be conducting animal experiments in the future?	1642760153.0	htky6v5	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htkiddz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htky6v5/
7j9p6	So this might not be a "simple question" but I was looking at [[flying aces in WW2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_flying_aces) and well, it's shockingly German. Greatest non-German ace on that list is 94, yet the Germans had dozens of pilots all with over 100 kills to their name. The Germans ultimately lost the war. They lost the battle of Britain. As far as I know, the Germans were losing consistantly against the RAF with their raiding in the blitz in terms of aircraft killed.   So how come? Obviously aces only tell a small part of the story (well, as small as it can be when one man shoots down 200 aircraft) but it sure looks like the Germans were just better pilots overall.	1642761678.0	htl03db	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htl03db/

mdu63	Thank you for your response!    I can unfortunately answer neither of your follow-up questions (additional scent or regulations on the size) with certainty, based on my knowledge of narrow specialty.    +++  >additional scent to candles  Previous research of candles/ lighting tend to characteristic (burning smell) by main material like bees wax or tallow, or even spermaceti (whale oil) in the 18th century. While I don't have enough evidence to refute the possibility of adding scent completely, it would be not so realistic to negate the original negative smell of main material (the preference for commoners/ secular building was mainly determined by relative price of each material, so if additional scent cost too much, the merit of preferring a cheap but bad odored material itself would be annulled).   +++  >regulation on the size  As mentioned above, some English towns and boroughs had a guild of tallow chandlers (candle makers made of animal tallow) in Later Middle Ages, and city/town or borough ordinances regulated activity of guild members. Their "assizes" also stipulated the basic price, size and weight of some important dairy products like bread, and tallow candle seemed to have been no exception.    The following is an excerpt from [medieval document of chandlers guild in Leicester, England](https://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/tallowPagesfromVolume15.pdf):    >"Furthermore it is ordained that every occupier of the foresaid craft or occupation shall keep the price and assize[" prise and sise " in the original] accustomed that is to say when a pound candle is assized by the mayor for 1 d. that none of the said occupation of the town buy tallow above viii d. a stone And when a pound candle is assized at 1 1/4 d. none exceeding x d. a stone and when a pound candle is assized at 1 1/2 d. ls non exceeding xii d. the stone on pain of Forfeit every time any of the occupation known or found with the contrary vi s. viii d. thereof to remain with the masters iii s. iv d."    Here "stone" means the tallow part of the candle.    The entry of Mar. 19, 1300 of Mayor's Court Roll of London also alludes to the "Assize of Candles" stipulating the price, though it does not say directly about the size and weight of individual candles.    >"Thomas le Chaundeler was summoned to answer the Mayor and Aldermen in a plea that, whereas Matthew le Caundeler and his fellows were chosen to keep the Assize of Candles when Parliament was sitting, a certain Robert, servant of Sir John de Droknesford, wanted to buy a pound of candles for 3d, and the defendant refused the money; thereupon Robert had complained to Matthew, and the latter, in accordance with the ordinance made by the men of that craft, had caused the candles to be delivered to the servant for the above price, and afterwards the defendant had abused Matthew and struck him as he was standing in his shop. The defendant denied the offence, and a jury of Candelwykestrate was summoned for Tuesday, on which day the parties made agreement on terms that the defendant pledge five casks of wine, to be forfeited if he were convicted in the future of any trespass against Matthew. He was mainprised by Richard Fiz, ceynturer, and John le Chaundeler of Ismongerelane to come up for judgment quo et quando &c. for his trespass against the officers of the craft, and the Mayor and Aldermen."   Source: https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/mayor-court-rolls/1298-1307/pp46-91#h3-0049  On the other hand, as long as candle-making remained the domestic cottage industry as I illustrated above for medieval Sweden, it is likely that the size of individual candles was not uniform.	1642765748.0	htl5lxr	t3_s8yzy9	t1_htkjx5a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htl5lxr/

If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1642766052.0	htl62du	t3_s98a31	t3_s98a31	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98a31/why_was_george_6th_and_wallis_simpsons_marriage_a/htl62du/

34tylnyo	To add in my favorite extra detail thay really drives the point home. Just those 24 Essex Carriers can deploy 2,400 planes. The entire Japanese navy at it's peak could deploy around 650. The entire US Navy peaked above 5,000 planes. And, those numbers are less lopped sidded than the subs.	1642749068.0	htkjmsw	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjskjr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htkjmsw/

8k7p4	It seems like a strange combination: they at once realize they can't hope to outgun the US, yet hope to defeat them in a single climactic battle the likes of which is almost certain to go to the side with far superior firepower. Given the numbers you provide earlier, success seems so far beyond the realm of possibility that nobody would've banked on such a plan.  Were the Japanese misguided in terms of just how far-and-away the US could outproduce them (10:1 as mentioned earlier), or did they really just have such extraordinary opinions of their own prowess that they thought they could overcome those odds by training elites (despite presumably also having less experience with the equipment than the Americans; correct me if I'm wrong there).	1642759476.0	htkxd9i	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htkv7vu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htkxd9i/

96gqp	It is a strange combination, but essentially the Japanese government was caught in a bind where they needed the resources of southeast Asia (oil in particular, but also rubber and other various minerals) to continue to prosecute the war in China, or face a coup attempt. The decision to attack the United States was not well judged in retrospect, but one has to keep in mind that conflicts with China and Russia had previously been decided by a decisive naval battle, after which the much larger country had been forced to grovel. The grand flaw in Japanese plans, of course, was the assumption that an attack on, say, the Philippines would immediately send the American fleet on a crash course to a decisive battle, but it's also the only way in which the strategy would have worked.   If -- and this is a very big if -- the Japanese had, say, formally declared war and "only" overrun the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in the Pacific, and if -- and this is a very big if -- Hitler had not unilaterally declared war on the US on the day after our hypothetical attack -- would the US have fought a more limited war in the Pacific, or not been a participant in Europe? We don't know, but given the drift towards war that was ongoing in the Atlantic/European theater, it seems likely that the United States would have been involved at some point, with a degree of public support that's debatable for any of those hypotheticals.	1642769965.0	htlciyv	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htkxd9i	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htlciyv/

9c89xxn	I'm not opposed to trivia to catch their attention. Learning requires concentration, which is fatiguing, so it's useful to include pauses and diversions to give them a break.  My objection was more to the formulation "that legendary scientist whose theory you just learned published a bunch of shitty papers", which can be interpreted in many ways, and some of them belittle the achievement. "Shitty papers" are only shitty if they show laziness or stupidity, not merely because they were wrong. We are not gifted with any magical insight. Each effort solves a bit of the puzzle, if only by ruling some things out.  I would have no problem explaining a sequence of events, such as "he tried this but it didn't work, so he thought some more and discovered a faulty assumption which he corrected in the next experiment, but it produced unexpected results so he realized there was something fundamentally wrong with his theory ..", and so on. There are wrong assumptions and failed experiments along the way, but nothing I would call "shitty". It's the opposite of shitty - it's the human intellect staring into the unknown, charting a path to a destination you can't see. The amazing thing isn't that you took some wrong turns along the way, but that you used each mistake to narrow down possibilities until you found the one thing that worked. It's a very deliberate process, mistakes and all.  >Science's tendency to regard animals as mindless automata may have contributed to animal abuse, in both scientific experiments and in wider society.  I'm not sure I agree. Morgan's Canon isn't exactly science, as in a discovery, invention, or explanation. It's just a reminder that one shouldn't draw conclusions in excess of the actual data. If you think an animal displayed an emotion, or reasoned its way through a problem, then show us what evidence you base that conclusion on. It's not enough to say "I would have felt that emotion" or "I'd have reasoned the same solution".  I don't think science has a "tendency" to regard animals as mindless automata; it's compatible with whatever position the evidence supports. Perhaps you are unhappy with the null hypothesis, to not assume things until we have reason to assume them. But it's really not possible to do it any other way.  Perhaps this did lead to some animal abuse (though I think science is incidental to such things, people have been both torturing and worshipping animals since long before Morgan was born), but science is really neutral about such things. Science can only say "biologists haven't provided any evidence yet that this species feels emotions", but if you take that to mean "therefore I can torture it and ignore the screams", that's on you. Science is not normative, it's people who are moral or amoral.	1642771513.0	htlfhc1	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htky6v5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htlfhc1/

j3tt7	Wow – thanks so much for this!  >What is the spectrum of professional opinion on the Kennedy assassination?   This is pretty much exactly what I was wondering.   I respect both of u/eternalkerri's responses you linked to, but they seem to focus more on *why JFK conspiracies are impossibl*e, and less about *citing actual opinions from modern historians about the assassination*.  In other words, I'm more interested in a meta-analysis of what historians think. I'm assuming there have to be some good books and sources out there on this topic but I'm having trouble finding them.	1642772171.0	htlgt2y	t3_s8zk8u	t1_htjuk8v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8zk8u/is_there_a_consensus_among_modern_historians/htlgt2y/

8brve	The area of overlap — again, from my not-extensive reading of things (honestly, most of my understanding of the "state of field" comes from having been on three job searches relating to the history and philosophy of computing, and reading a lot of CVs) — is that there are many philosophers now interested in things like ethics of AI, but they are mostly pretty abstract or, if they are not abstract, are purely interested in software implementations. Whereas in the history of computing, most of the work so far has been on hardware issues, but there is starting to be a small but growing group focused on software. Those historians who work on software (and algorithms, etc.) do spend a lot of time talking and thinking about the ethical dimensions of it (and that's a lot of their motivation — algorithmic bias, for example). But that's only one possible approach the philosophical aspects of it.   I think one thing I'd note is that while there are a lot of younger scholars branching into this area, a) the job market is rough, and b) a lot of the work of younger scholars is trying to achieve success on that market, so it is tweaked towards topics that are broadly already known to people and could be adapted to several different kinds of jobs (e.g., algorithmic bias is both "hot" and could be the way into several types of positions). I think in another decade or so we'll probably start to see a lot more variation as some subset of those scholars get comfortable and start working on less obvious, more risky things.	1642773675.0	htlk28h	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htju9sy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htlk28h/
2rzmr8ac	The answer is: flags.   Before Nelson's era, like in the 1600s, the English used a simple flag system.  *Fighting Instructions,* 1653. *Fighting Instructions* was a book of maritime tactics (21 in all), so there are only 2 pages dedicated to flag signaling in it I think.  I'm not sure the particulars, but it was something like a red flag meant attack, a blue flag meant retreat or follow me, etc.  This worked well enough when fleets were small and you only needed a few simple commands.    Over the next 100 years, they kept adding flags of different shapes and colors for more complex commands, and this got unruly.  The British Admiralty then adopted various codes; such as the Popham Code written by Admiral Popham around 1800.  This was sort of a visual flag code, and it allowed a fleet commander to spell entire words with flags.  So the infamous quote from Nelson at Trafalgar, "England expects that every man will do his duty", it was sent from ship to ship using a combination of flags in a flag code.  You can see a visual representation of that phrase here:  [https://sites.google.com/site/kidicrypt/poham-s](https://sites.google.com/site/kidicrypt/poham-s)  Note that even to signal the two letter word "do", you have to raise 3 flags.          Under the Popham code, there were 10 square colored flags and then some additional triangular penants.  There were about 1000 "words" and additionally any word could be spelled out letter-by-letter. Various combinations either represented a number, or a letter.   There were also codebooks (because the enemy could see your flags, too) and shortcuts; and each ship would have had identical codebooks and notes. These codebooks were sensitive military intelligence.   Also, you're probably aware of the phrase "ship of the line" and perhaps "crossing the T".  British doctrine at the time had warships usually going to battle in long lines.  That meant that a ship could really only see the ship directly in front of it when a fleet was in a long line.  So there was a long time lag between when the first ship ran up a flag signal and it was spotted by the 2nd, who then had to relay it to the third, etc.  Like the childhood game of "telephone," except that each ship had to raise somewhere between 3 and 27 flags to communicate a message.     At night they used lanterns hung from the masts or rear of the ship in various shapes to send signals. Later, ships adopted shuttered lights and used those to send code (and eventually Morse code) messages between ships at night.	1642773741.0	htlk7do	t3_s88vs3	t3_s88vs3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88vs3/how_would_have_a_naval_commander_in_the_19th/htlk7do/

m2k8u	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1642773929.0	htlkme5	t3_s9bb5g	t3_s9bb5g	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bb5g/are_there_any_examples_of_historical_figures_who/htlkme5/
14m5kd	Not sure exactly how "in-depth" I can get with this answer as, ultimately, its asking *why* Stalin thought/prioritized the way he did. And unfortunately we can't read his mind nor did he leave us some kind of extensive journals detailing his personal thoughts. So in the end all I can provide is the more or less official reasoning and what logical factors *may* have influenced this.     So Trotsky was, by far-and-away the biggest political rival to Stalin during effectively his entire tenure in office. It's pretty widely known that Lenin did not want Stalin to remain General Secretary and this meant that Trotsky was most likely to take the mantle of leadership in the party. Even once sidelined and forced into exile the fact still remained that Trotsky had probably the most "legitimate" claim to leadership of the Soviet Union, he merely lacked the skilled political maneuvering and friends in high places to make it a reality. But this was not a guaranteed constant. In exile Trotsky was basically defined by his near constant campaigning against Stalinism. While somewhat marginal compared to the influence of Stalin, it nonetheless represented the most notable opposition within the left to Stalin's near-monopoly in the communist sphere.     This was a large part of why Stalin wanted Trotsky dead already, to hopefully put an end to this leftist opposition to Stalinism. This motivation was likely exacerbated by Trotsky forming the Fourth International which was purposefully intended to be an alternative power-base for communists outside of the Stalin-led Comintern. While again the Comintern/Stalin still held decisively more power/influence than the 4th Intern/Trotsky, it did not mean that he was not still viewed as a threat. There's a variety of ways in which *potentially* the 4th Intern/Trotsky could throw a wrench into Stalin's plans or potentially even threaten his leadership of the Soviet Union. Whether or not they ever realistically could have done this is irrelevant, the fact of the matter as far as Stalin was concerned was that it was *possible*.     Notably in the Great Purges Stalin did not solely purge leftist/Trotskyists. He also purged rightists like Bukharin, Tomsky, and Rykov who had previously sided with him in his power struggles against Trotsky. Clearly Stalin was not above killing those he viewed as a threat, regardless of loyalties, politics, or even evidence. So why shouldn't he go out of his way to kill the person who was arguably the biggest threat to his rule. He killed plenty of notable Bolsheviks who did not publicly (or sometimes not even privately) criticize him or his rule, why shouldn't he kill a notable Bolshevik whose defining feature was criticizing him and trying to oust him from power? Not only that, but Trotsky was also, arguably, only second-to Lenin in terms of notable Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution and Civil War. We're talking about a seriously famous and influential figure, he may be exiled and erased from the history books, but he was certainly not *forgotten* by most anyone in the USSR.     So the crux of your question seems to me to be "Why was Stalin obsessed with killing him if he didn't realistically pose a big threat?" To which the answer, as best I could think of it, is that *to Stalin* Trotsky was the biggest threat. Even if he was not at present able to render much of a threat the fact remained that he *could* at some point in the future, and had already gone much further in organizing an anti-Stalin movement than arguably anyone else. So if Stalin was in the process of eliminating any and all threats to his rule (which he was) then Trotsky is a natural target.     I would recommend "Stalin: A New Biography of a Dictator" by Oleg Klevniuk for info on Stalin and his reign over the Soviet Union.  You could also read Trotsky's own words on the subject in ["Stalin Seeks My Death"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1940/05/stalin.htm) Where he explains basically what I did here: Stalin viewed the exile as a mistake and that Trotsky could still organize an opposition to his rule even from abroad and this had to be put to an end as soon as possible.	1642774016.0	htlktca	t3_s8xv1f	t3_s8xv1f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8xv1f/why_was_stalin_so_obsessed_with_assassinating/htlktca/

nz52j	> I don't agree with you that the historians are "furious",   Well, one of them is. To quote the linked article:  > “Het is waanzin om zo’n ernstige beschuldiging te baseren op iets wat iemand zegt gehoord te hebben, in het kader van zijn eigen berechting. Dat is flinterdun bewijs voor dit verhaal. Schokkend gewoon.” [...] “Ik kan mij hier echt over opwinden.”  - Bart van der Boom, lecturer at Leiden university.   My translation: "It is madness to base such a serious accusation on something someone claims to have heard, in the context of his own trial. That is paper-thin evidence for this story. Just shocking." [...] "I get truly worked up about this."  That sounds fairly furious to me. (Van der Boom did much of his research on the Jewish Council that features in this theory.)  But other reactions I've seen are much more measured, and indeed did include praise for finding the transcript of the original anonymous note, as well as more critical remarks.	1642775275.0	htlnoer	t3_s65cqd	t1_ht5vauc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s65cqd/what_is_the_current_consensus_on_recent_articles/htlnoer/
9i89m	Think of a village of 100, a fixed population, and not much traffic in and out of either goods or people. There's one baker, and he keeps the place supplied with bread. A worker trained in his shop sets up shop, and suddenly there's competition for the market of 100 bread eaters. First , prices are lowered, until both bakers are barely getting by. Then one baker begins to throw sawdust into the flour, make loaves just a tiny bit smaller. That doesn't work, so he sends his relatives to attack and smash up the other bakery. In the process, bread becomes terrible and often unavailable, and the village is divided into supporters of one or the other bakers. A  baker with a larger shop  miles away hears about this, and begins loading up a wagon with bread twice a week and sending it into the village: now, both of the village bakers are in trouble. Medieval trades tended to concentrate: Frankfurt had books, Nuremberg had metalworkers. Competition in a large city simply magnified all these problems.  It's to avoid all of these problems that guilds were created. They would be definitely a kind of cooperative: they would try to maintain a minimum price, and in their later forms could also provide services to their members- like, making sure they had a proper burial if they died, loaning them money for materials and supplies, providing a network for obtaining and assessing apprentices, journeymen. They would typically get a charter from the local ruler or government granting them the exclusive right to practice that trade in that town, and to get that charter they would argue the need to maintain quality standards. When for example, in the 16th c. the gunmakers in London applied for a charter, to be separate from the blacksmiths guild, they pled that imperfect barrels were being made that were dangerous, and there was a need for regulation by trained gunsmiths. After getting the charter, they were in charge of proofing barrels- testing them to make sure they were safe. At a time when government was quite limited, guilds provided a way to regulate a lot of the economy without having bureaucrats.  Guilds would also be social. This was a world filled with hierarchies, and guilds had their own. They would celebrate religious holidays or have feasts. There were some guilds that went out of existence as trade groups and simply because prestigious civic organizations like the Worshipful Company of Bowyers.  There was once a common belief that guilds discouraged technological innovation. This is not quite true- there are examples ( like the watchmakers of Geneva) where innovation happened with the support of the guild. But under it all was very much the medieval notion of a fixed market in one place: only so much room in the village for a baker. The industrial revolution changed all that, but , even before, as trade increased and technology improved, guilds had a harder and harder time being relevant. The Gunmakers Guild might have sway over all the guns made in London, but someone there could simply get a gun made somewhere else. The London gunmakers also would be able to load their guns onto ships and send them to distant markets. Paris watchmakers would out-compete English watchmakers, Geneva watchmakers out-compete Paris watchmakers, and watchmakers next door in the Jura would provide cheaper watches than Geneva. As economies became more international, markets more reachable and it was possible to production centers to move, guilds became more irrelevant.	1642775397.0	htlnyog	t3_s8t6ju	t3_s8t6ju	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8t6ju/maybe_a_rather_basic_question_but_what_were/htlnyog/
itaexggd	Your critique of my diction "shitty" is valid. I see now how it was sloppy.   I've thought long and hard about where our disagreements in the second point lie. I think it is because I'm talking about "science" as an institution that is composed of humans. You are talking about "science" purely as a methodology. When I say "science has a tendency to regard animals as mindless automata", I mean that scientists have a [bias](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36722977-underbug) to try to model animals as automata, even when that is not the best approach. When I say "science...may have contributed to animal abuse", I mean that the [way](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128092651/conceptual-breakthroughs-in-ethology-and-animal-behavior) scientists conduct science - in combination with other societal features - may have contributed to animal abuse.	1642775634.0	htloimy	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htlfhc1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htloimy/

8brve	All you need to track a solar year is some way of keeping track of how high the Sun rises and its movement over the course of the year. Which is nothing more complicated than a stick in the ground that casts a shadow (a gnomon), or even just a rock with a hole in it that you can view from a consistent angle from day to day (Stone Henge has alignments like this). Given the importance of the solar year to things like the seasons, and given the importance of the seasons to many aspects of prehistoric cultural and material existence, there are many reasons to suspect that this is a genuinely prehistoric thing and probably was figured out by many different people over many different periods of time. Certainly many prehistoric structures and artifacts display an awareness of equinoxes, solstices, and so on, which are exactly this phenomena.	1642777422.0	htlswhn	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htfa880	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htlswhn/

jt30f	I've discussed that question a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lrtsho/why_did_japan_believe_that_the_united_states/), but to summarise: there was absolutely a voice within Japan that called for occupying Southeast Asia without attacking the United States, but such a move was politically impossible within Japan, due to the Navy's desire to turn the Army's desired Southern Operation to its advantage.   The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had spent much of its existence fighting the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) for standing within Japan, first as a co-equal branch of the military, and--later on--for shares of resources. The IJN had--in particular--wanted an increased share of national resources (including defense budgets and portions of national steel production) for construction of an increasingly powerful fleet. At the same time, some officers in the IJA General Staff had wanted those same resources invested in building up Japan's domestic industrial base in the hopes of establishing an autarkic state in preparation for a potential war with the Soviet Union. However, the outbreak of the war in China changed the situation dramatically. What was supposed to be a quick sharp war to cow Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government and secure Japanese access to the resources of northern China evolved into a long, drawn out war that was rapidly consuming the very same resources IJA General Staff had wanted to be invested into developing the industrial base.  As with everything involving Japan in the late 1930s and early 1940s, nearly everything comes back to the war in China. The IJA sought several routes in an attempt to force the Nationalists to the negotiating table. First, by destroying Nationalist armies in the field, then by occupying the Nationalist economic heartland in the Lower Yangtze, and--when neither of those options brought Chiang to the negotiating table--the IJA ultimately identified foreign aid to China as the lifeline which sustained the Chinese war effort. Thus, the IJA began seeking out ways to cut off that foreign aid, by occupying remaining ports in Southern China, occupying northern Indochina (to cut the Haiphong-Yunnan Railway), and placing diplomatic pressure on the West. However, at the same time, the United States--which strongly disapproved of Japanese aggression in Asia--had been placing economic pressure on Japan in an effort to curtail Japanese activities. With the outbreak of the war in Europe, the Japanese sensed an opportunity in Southeast Asia to simultaneously seize the vital resources present there, but also to drive out the Western imperial powers, cutting off China from external aid, and thus--hopefully--bringing the war in China to an end on Japanese terms.   Interestingly, it was the IJA that began seriously pressing for a Southern Operation aimed at occupying Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. The IJA particularly was interested in doing so *without* expanding the war to include the Americans, but the IJN strenuously objected to this. There were a multitude of reasons for the Navy's objection, but first and foremost was a desire to use the Navy's support for the Army as a bargaining chip in internal political struggles for shares of national resources. The IJN had long justified its existence by pointing and comparing itself to the U.S. Navy. With the Army now interested in a southern operation, the Navy sensed an opportunity. The Navy insisted that war with British and the Dutch would have to mean war with the United States as well, and that if Japan was to go to war with the U.S. then the IJN would need both the resources and time for a massive building operation. While the Navy did not think it would be ready to challenge the U.S. fleet, the IJN was prepared to use the developing situation to its advantage by demanding major concessions from the IJA in exchange for support--concessions that it would not be able to demand if the war target did not include the United States. The Navy justified this position in a multitude of ways (which I discuss more in the above linked post), including highlighting the threat that American forces in the Philippines could pose to Japanese supply lines from the East Indies, but--ultimately--the inevitability of war with the United States was simply the stated view of the Navy. If the Army wanted the Navy's concurrence and support to carry out the Southern Operation, they would have to concede.   So, to answer your question: yes, there absolutely was a voice in Japan that called for only launching an attack against the British and Dutch, avoiding war with the United States, especially within the Army. However, the IJN had pre-determined that war with the United States was necessary, because the threat of the U.S. Navy was how the IJN had justified its own demands for increased funding. The IJN thus played for a larger share of Japan's domestic resources by making war with the U.S. a precondition for its support of the Army's hoped for Southern Operation.	1642778165.0	htlusld	t3_s8yukr	t3_s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/htlusld/

685yd	Just two observations regarding beeswax. Burning beeswax has an extremely intense smell. It would probably be difficult to significantly alter the characteristics.   I would think the easiest way to sent candels in older times would be by using oils that themselves had been used in liquid extraction of scent from whatever was desireble. However adding oil to wax would lower the melting point of the wax. Wikipedia gives the melting point of beeswax at 62 - 64 C. I believe that lowering their melting point much more would result in loss of physical integrity particularly when several candels where litt close to each other.  Question: In looking for why the church preferred bees wax have there been any references to the beeswax candels having an incense like function?	1642778449.0	htlviqp	t3_s8yzy9	t1_htkjx5a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htlviqp/

47g7nn0v	It’s very possible that there are things like that we haven’t discovered yet, that’s what makes archaeology so exciting!   New sites are being discovered all the time, such as the mosaic of Achilles recently discovered in a farmer’s field in England. The mosaic wasn’t created in isolation—who knows what might be hiding in the area if the owners were to let the whole field be dug up?  Unfortunately, as you mention, not everything is as simple as excavating an open field. An example I like to bring up is Alexandria in Egypt which faces quite a few problems when it comes to this. First, the modern city is built directly on top of the Ancient one which makes it immensely difficult to find enough space and money to dig it up. The Citadel of Qaitbay was built on the ruins of the lighthouse and is in and of itself an object of important cultural heritage so the chances of a lighthouse excavation are nothing.   Another problem is that much of the ancient city is currently underwater, and would take an immense amount of time, effort, and money to make accessible. In recent years, the city has taken a great deal of interest in these underwater sections and made a big announcement for an underwater museum several years ago but have yet to actually do anything.   So, to answer your question, a huge possibility. There could be a manuscript containing the entire rest of the Iliad lurking somewhere. The trouble is actually getting to a point where you could find it.	1642778757.0	htlwbll	t3_s99g43	t3_s99g43	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99g43/whats_the_actual_possibility_that_there_are_still/htlwbll/
8za88	> unarguably one of the best medium tanks of the war.  I'll argue it. Cramped as all hell and was a dead end design, the last of a long line of Christie cruisers. The front line service life of the tank was extremely short, being replaced in short order by the far superior Centurion as soon as they could be built. The only saving grace was that the 77mm didn't suffer the same SVDS accuracy problems as 17pr, so at least the gun was reasonable (Which is in itself interesting as the projectiles were identical), but at that, you still get more 'bang' for out of a slightly (not much) less cramped Sherman Firefly.	1642779094.0	htlx7lt	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfnuco	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htlx7lt/
14m5kd	Oh boy James Bond! It's a pretty simple question to answer so upfront I'll just say: No there was not any kind of significant controversy surrounding the films portrayal of the Japanese as stalwart allies of the Western powers in the Cold War. And the reason for this is simple: they were our allies.     But that's a little boring on its own so I'll go into a bit more detail: Effectively at the end of WW2 occupation of the Axis powers and their territories were split between the Allied powers largely according to pre-made agreements at Yalta for territory and spheres in Europe. In Asia however the occupation zones and spheres were much more haphazard. The sudden entry of the USSR into the Pacific war threw a wrench into things that was not entirely anticipated. This led to the division of Korea, played a large role in the changing tide of the Chinese Civil War, and subsequently a realignment of the political order or East Asia. Unlike Germany however, the occupation of Japan was not split between East and West (not counting South Sakhalin which was incorporated directly into the USSR). Japan was solely occupied by the Western powers and particularly the United States.     The United States occupation of Japan had an issue with shifting goal posts. Firstly they wanted to stabilize the country and ensure a smooth transition to peacetime occupation. This involved an influx of grains and milk to combat the near-famine that Japan was experiencing and the disarmament of its massive military (which was not entirely successful as some small portions of the Japanese military stayed overseas frequently to participate in ongoing conflicts like the first Indochina war or the Chinese Civil War). Part of this goal included banning Japan from waging war at all, this is a clause still enshrined in the Japanese constitution and remains controversial, though it is still a largely popular clause in Japan today. It also included punishing those who had set up the militarist government and hopefully reforming Japanese institutions to make them less militarist or at least less capable of militarism.     However the rapidly developing Cold War meant that certain ideals would have to be brushed aside and certain steps would have to be taken to help make Japan a strong, western-aligned power in East Asia. This was represented in the "Reverse Course" wherein the US policy shifted to focus on strengthening Japan rather than punishing it. To this end, some figures who likely should have faced charges for war-crimes and crimes against humanity were let off the hook. Notable examples would include Nobusuke Kishi (known colloquially today as the "Monster of the Showa Era") who ran Manchuria with an iron fist, taking slaves by the tens of thousands and profiting heavily off the opium trade to finance his lavish lifestyle. He would later become Prime Minister of Japan from 1957-1960 and is the grandfather of recent prime minister Shinzo Abe. A more controversial "pardon" would be Emperor Hirohito, whose role and agency in the war are incredibly controversial topics in Japan today. Simply put: many figures of the Statist era would be reintegrated into the reformed Japanese government because they were either useful or expedient for the rapidly developing anti-soviet needs of US foreign policy.      With the victory of the Communists in China and the outbreak of the Korean War the US now was in a position wherein a militarily strong Japan was desirable. So a rearmament of Japan began, in a way that was still suitable to correspond with Article 9 (anti-war article). This is why today Japan has the eighth largest military budget despite not officially being able to declare war, in keeping with this the Japanese military is known as the "Self Defence Force". This military was formed in 1954, shortly after the end of occupation, but the basis of it originates from the start of the Korean War wherein the Japanese formed a "National Police Reserve" of tens of thousands of "police" with small arms.     So this was all done to make Japan into a strong economic and military power for the Cold War, a shift that was rapid and went against the grain of wartime rhetoric. But with the emergence of what was now being portrayed as an even greater threat (The Communists) it was not particularly hard to publicly justify this rapid pivot of opinion towards the Japanese. Indeed this is a recurring theme throughout the Cold War, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And it was not much more difficult to shift public opinion in favor of Japan than it was to shift public opinion against them during the war. There was now a great enemy threatening the US, and the Japanese were among the first and best defencive lines against them.     Thus in Cold War culture and spy films, the Japanese could effectively be portrayed as sort-of "the good guys" of Asia. They were the strongest allies to NATO in the region in terms of their economy, military, and politics and that was far more important than what "some crazy generals" did a few years ago.     For more reading a good general history would be "A Modern History of Japan" by Andrew Gordon. "Hirohito" by Herbert Bix also covers this remolding of Japan in the post-war years.	1642779144.0	htlxcfe	t3_s99rlz	t3_s99rlz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htlxcfe/

8za88	The other point about British use of Valentine in the desert is that they were not unusually pressed into service in the cruiser role, partially due to lack of cruisers, and partially because they were surprisingly fast. The official top speed was still a slow 15mph, same as Matilda II, but the vehicle had a lot of power reserves so didn't lose speed for obstacles or even curves. Combine with it being one of the most reliable British tanks to come out, and a unit of the things could get from A to B remarkably quickly compared to the expectations put out by tanks like Matilda II or A13.	1642779477.0	htly7sb	t3_s89fqq	t1_hthv8tg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htly7sb/

yfege	* *Tampa Tribune*, 1954: "Mrs. Beulah Walker, 65, was arrested by City Detectives yesterday in connection an abortion on a 23-year-old woman. Police said the operation was performed with rusty wires broken from old coat hangers." * *The Shreveport Journal*, 1970: "Some women destroy not only the fetus but also themselves in attempting self-abortion. Coat hangers, umbrella ribs and knitting needles have been used. SO has a goose quill dipped in turpentine." * *Pub-Med*, 1993: "The self-induced abortion had been attempted with a coat hanger ... The reason for the attempt was lack of money for a therapeutic abortion."   Which is to say: yes. It's important to know, though, a wire hanger represented more than just a tool used to provide an abortion, it was used by activists to represent several of their core arguments for legalizing abortion: the desperation and risk created by anti-abortion laws. (I've used spoiler tags when quoting medical professionals or historians talking or writing about specific details related to illegal or unsafe abortions.)  ##A Symbol of Desperation  A wire coat hanger is an ubiquitous item, found in nearly every home and is easily recognizable to people of all genders. It's also a tool that could fulfill the basic function of an abortion - emptying the contents of a uterus. In effect, the image says, "imagine how desperate you'd have to be to put this inside your body?" The goal of this messaging was to make it plain that keeping abortion illegal didn't stop abortion - it just made desperate people more desperate. (More on the history of anti-abortion laws [here in this Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qkdhi8/megathread_roe_v_wade_and_abortion_in_america/) we did in December.)   The humble wire hanger served as a physical representation of that desperation and was used in all sorts of ways, including as [early clip art as seen in the header of this 1971 article](https://imgur.com/a/Sg0ZTH6) about a planning meeting for a national women's conference later that year. One of the participants, a founding member of the *[Women vs. Connecticut] project, (https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/womenvsconnecticut.html)* movement, Doctor Barbara Roberts, spoke about the desperation she saw:  > I have seen atrocities during medical school and in hospitals. >!I have seen a woman with half her bowel hanging out of her vagina from a criminal abortion. I've seen women in hospitals drunk, drug addicted, suicidal. I've seen battered and burned babies in morgues and emergency rooms. I have seen hysterical women in my own office...!< we must fight the sanctimonious friends of the fetus... the only good abortion law is no abortion law.   This desperation, though, wasn't felt equally by everyone seeking an abortion. Those with social and economic capital could usually acquire a safe one. A trustworthy personal doctor might manufacturer a health risk and recommend a hospital abortion (where the pregnant person may or may not be turned away, usually depending on the person working the admissions desk) or the person could pay a provider who was known to be safe and trustworthy. Networks such as *The Jane Collective* were formed to connect as many people seeking abortions as possible with providers who followed medical sanitation and were discrete, but even though they worked to keep the costs affordable, such solutions had other costs - time away from work and family, possibility of others finding out, travel costs, etc. Meanwhile, even if someone could find a safe abortionist they could trust to be discrete, the illegal nature of the service meant there was a power imbalance. from Leslie Reagan's foundational book, *[When Abortion Was a Crime](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520216570/when-abortion-was-a-crime)*:   > Some abortionists took advantage of their clients’ vulnerability in this increasingly secretive situation to sexually harass and exploit them. These men equated abortion with sexual availability and tried to turn their patients into prostitutes. >!One woman, who had an illegal abortion in the mid-1950s after being raped, recalled the humiliation she felt when the abortionist remarked, “ ‘You can take your pants down now, but you shoulda’—ha!ha!—kept’em on before.’ ” When he finished the abortion, for which he charged $1,000, he offered to return $20 if she would give him “a ‘quick blow job.’ ” Other abortionists insisted on a trade: sex for abortion. When one sixteen-year-old was propositioned, she walked out.!<   ##A Symbol of Risk  The wire coat hanger is not surgical equipment. They're often made of bare metal - uncoated. People who could afford to pay someone else to perform the abortion might be able to reduce the amount of risk they faced, but not always. Those who couldn't , had to make do with whatever they had access to:   > When domestic efforts to produce an abortion failed, pregnancies progressed and the danger of later instrumental abortions increased. Many women ended up in hospital emergency rooms. Some ended up in morgues. >!Dr. Maximillian Herzog, a professor of pathology at the Chicago Policlinic, asserted in 1900 that “by far the largest number of criminal abortions” were induced by women taking abortifacients, which caused hemorrhaging. Some women mixed their own home remedies.! One Chicago woman told of applying a mustard plaster to her abdomen to induce an abortion. Women employed a wide array of instruments found within their own homes to induce miscarriages, including knitting needles, crochet hooks, hairpins, scissors, and button hooks. One physician testified that patients at Cook County Hospital in Chicago used hairpins and cotton balls to irritate the cervix and induce abortions. A domestic servant resorted to using a bone stay out of her corset to induce a miscarriage. A farm woman used a chicken feather. Dr. G. D. Royston, who interviewed patients at a St. Louis dispensary in 1917, reported that “introduction of catheters, crochet needles, etc., by the patients themselves are first in frequency."... !<  Other medical providers reported that douching with soap or bleach was one common and frequently fatal method used by women trying to self-induce abortions. One man who worked at a hospital said he saw:   > >!... young women coming to the hospital who had taken pills or been “injected with lye” to induce abortions... Some aborted themselves with instruments found at home, including the now infamous coat hanger. One woman described taking ergotrate, then castor oil, then squatting in scalding hot water, then drinking Everclear alcohol. When these methods failed, she hammered at her stomach with a meat pulverizer before going to an illegal abortionist.!<  Finally, the wire coat hanger represented one of the central arguments behind anti-abortion laws: bodily autonomy. By using the coat hanger as a symbol, not only could activists speak to desperation and risk, they could represent the idea that regardless of the law or any possible punishment, people who are pregnant who do not want to be pregnant will do whatever it takes to end that pregnancy. This central idea, that we have the right to control how our body is used is reflected in the coat hanger as an activist symbol. That even when lawmakers and the government goes to great lengths to force a pregnant person to stay pregnant, they will do what they need to do to maintain control over how their body is used.   ___  Modern day update: It's important, I think - especially this weekend, the 49th anniversary of *Roe v. Wade* - to dip a bit into modern politics. Reproductive justice advocates began moving away from the imagine of the wire hanger as a way to represent self-induced abortions in the early 2000s, as medical abortions became safer and more affordable. Currently, a pregnant person who no longer wants to be pregnant can self-induce a medical abortion by taking a combination of two commonly-available gynecological medications, provided they learn of the pregnancy early enough.

7j3q5	The main thing is that Carthage couldn't.  They suceeded once (in 215, under Bomilcar) by sea, and tried several more times by Land - though the Romans successfully intercepted the reinforcing Army and defeated them (Metaurus River, in 207, and Insubria, in 203 - though notably, this was just a landing in Liguria, not a complete overland march across the alps.)  The first thing to consider is the strategic situation - there are ultimately two ways to get from Carthaginian territory to Italy, by Sea, or by overland via Carthaginian Spain, through Transalpine Gaul (Southern France), across the Alps, into Cisalpine Gaul  (Northern Italy/Po Valley) and then into the Italian Peninsula.  In normal circumstances, it is relatively easy to sail across the Mediterranean from Carthage to Rome.  However, during wartime, this is extremely difficult, and transports always are extremely vulnerable to hostile warships.  To get around, this you could escort them with warships - but Classical warships have an extremely limited operational range - they were very compact, and there was very little room on board other than for the rowers.  This meant that these warships could only spend a few days at sea before having to pull into land to restock/resupply.  Enough to sail from, say, Carthage to Sicily, or Carthage to Sardinia, but not enough to go all the way from Carthage to the Italian Peninsula and still fight at the end.  Rome won control of Sicily during the First Punic War, and stole Sardinia during a Mercenary revolt a few years later.  This meant that to get a fleet to Italy, Carthage would need to take one or the other.  While Carthage would make several attempts to attack Sardinia and Sicily (including supporting Syracuse during its revolt against Rome), they were ultimately unsuccessful, due to the local Roman naval superiority.  The other option, which is the one Hannibal (and eventually his brothers Hasdrubal and Mago took), was to do the overland route.  Hannibal managed this in 218 after capturing the Roman-allied city of Saguntum.  Hasdurbal and Mago would also eventually make this trip, over a decade layer - which is where we need to look at  Rome is doing outside Italy.   On his way to the Alps, Hannibal had bypassed a Roman army sent to intercept him on the Rhone, near Marseille,  under Publius Cornelius Scipio (The to-be Scipio Africanus's father) and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio (Africanus's uncle).   Publius sent the army on to Rome under Gnaeus, while he went back to Italy (to get wounded at the Ticinus, before rejoining his brother with reinforcments in 216).  During its time, this army, with its accompany navy, defeated the Carthaginian Fleet in Spain (Battle of the Ebro) and secured a foothold on the Northeast Spanish coast around Tarraco (modern Tarragona).  This therefore blocked the overland route from Spain to Italy.  This Roman presence was a major nuisance, and had even caused the diversion of a fleet intended to support Hannibal to Spain instead.  While the Scipio brothers were defeated in 211, they were replaced by Scipio the Younger (not Africanus yet), who had even more success in Spain (though notably, one of his victories, at Baecula, let Hasdrubal slip away to the North, which is how he ends up in Italy in 207 to get smashed by Nero and Livius at the Metaurus)  Some resources here:  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44079847.pdf](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44079847.pdf) Steinby, C.

qrcu9	The year is 1380. A storm is gathering in Kulikovo. To face off against the innumerable heathen Tatar hordes are the 1.3 million noble knights of Muscovy and her allies, led by Prince Dmitry, whose glorious victory in this battle would have him go down in history forever as Dmitry Donskoy, or in English, Dmitry of the Don. Kulikovo is where the Russian nation has born, where the shattered heathen would never more dare steal from the righteous folk and their lands.  ...  If that sounds like a tall tale, you're on point dear reader. The caprices of High Medieval chronicling aside, the rise of Muscovy was not outlined by setpiece battles or daring acts of defiance. Indeed, many attempts from various Russian princes met negative results ranging from inconvenient to disastrous; more often the latter. In such an environment, Muscovy did not rise through acts of heroism, but through patience and... trade. And so, while Kulikovo was not an insignificant battle, we must go back further, before we can understand in what way it mattered, and what came after.  The Rus peoples' trial with the Tatars go further back than Muscovy, which itself was a vassal principality in a then insignificant part of modern Russia, little more than a trading settlement along a tribituary of a tribituary of the Volga. So for such a dark horse canditate to rise, you might be thinking that several things might have had to go right, and you'd be correct.   Muscovy was in luck for three reasons:  The first of these reasons was that the Mongol invasion and the subsequent, almost habitual razing of Rus centers of population and trade meant that the old centers of gravity for Rus culture no longer held their importance. Muscovy itself was also pillaged and set to torch in this period, but, owing to its remote position, and not much wealth and significance to begin with, it emerged relatively unscathed. From here on came the second reason for Muscovy's rise.  Muscovy had a series of wise princes; under the Tatar yoke, a prince had to be wise or he would not last long at all. The most significant one in the build-up to the Battle of Kulikovo, and the one I want to talk about, is Ivan I of Moscow, or as his pals and debtors called him, Ivan Kalita, or in English, Ivan the Moneybag. [Now I've talked about Kalita a bit in another question,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pamfct/comment/ha7itai/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but to repeat myself, Kalita, after witnessing the execution of three of his predecessors for either insubordination or being victims of court intrigue at the hands of Öz Beg Khan, decided the best way to keep his head was to keep it down, avoid any military adventurism, and above all, pay his tribute in time and in full. To achieve this, he had to build a strong economy resilient to the usual adversities an agriculture-taxation based economy would have in the geographical conditions of Russia, and so he prioritized the promotion and expansion of trade and a vibrant city life, one that counted on a large and concentrated population. To achieve this, he purchased captured slaves from his Tatar overlords, invited refugees, and resettled people in his lands. Using these riches he was able to gather through his shrewd management of the economy as well as excellent diplomacy with his overlords (he managed to convince them to allow hereditary succession for Muscovy so that his son could succeed him), he engaged in what's curtly described as loan sharking to peacefully take over the nearby lands of Russian rulers small and larger. His successful diplomacy, willful obedience and economic cunning made him the earliest identifiable figure in the Russian ascendancy, and expansion of Russian soft power through these peaceful means would remain the only successful and viable way for the next 150 years.  Now that last sentence there may be a bit of a spoiler, as Ivan, being Dmitry Donskoy's grandfather, reigned only 18 years before him, so Kulikovo can't have accomplished all that much if, quoting myself, nothing much could have been accomplished outside peaceful means in this time period. But before we get there, I want to get the third reason why Muscovy was lucky out of the way:  The Golden Horde, the friendly neighborhood Mongol Empire remnant, had high levels of infighting. Now, any medieval polity had infighting, but nothing brought a people together than being subjugated by another, and nothing led to as much infighting as being a martially inclined society with few external opponents but several claimants, each of whom could muster massive armies. Kalita's rule saw Muscovy more or less subsume every significant Russian principality with the notable exceptions of Novgorod and her periphery, and the parts of Ukraine and Belarus which were conquered by the Poles and Lithuanians instead (not yet together, these were separate conquests and the two nations wouldn't come together until a hundred years from then on). So, Muscovy had grabbed all there was to grab, was slowly extracting concessions through obedience and timely payment of taxes, and their overlord was essentially having a crisis on every succession. All Muscovy really had to do, at this point, was to bide their time, and wait for the Golden Horde to crumble on its own.  In 1359, the Khan was killed, and the Golden Horde erupted into civil war. The Khan's son-in-law, a Warlord known as Mamai, played the role of a kingmaker in this time, and consolidated his control over a part of the horde. After a few Khans, he briefly installed his own wife as the Khanum, whom was replaced later with another puppet. So it is fair to say that he was the ruler of the Golden Horde in this period, though his hold would have been tenuous given that he was not a descendant of Genghis Khan, but simply someone who married one of his descendants. After Mamai consolidated enough power, he decided to punish Dmitry, who had refused orders from him to give up the throne of Vladimir. In 1378, this culminated in the Battle of Vozha River, which Dmitry won. Gathering a larger force, it would be in 1380 that the Battle of Kulikovo, the one I led with, would be fought. This was a larger battle with nevertheless indeterminate numbers; the million and change I led with is from a medieval source that is more dramatic than historical (as sources of the period wont to be), and the more likely number is far less than 100.000 on the Muscovite side. Nevertheless, Kulikovo was won, and it was significant; it was the first major victory of Moscow and is considered to have hinted the Tatar decline.   Unfortunately for Dmitry, the decline hadn't come fast enough. The defeat of Mamai in Muscovite hands made Tokhtamysh the undisputed ruler of the Golden Horde, who, after defeating Mamai handily in a battle, moved on to sack Moscow in 1382, and force Dmitry to once again give his oath of loyalty as a vassal. Does this mean all of this had been for nothing? Of course not! Dmitry's son, Vasily I, would be the first Grand Duke of Muscovy to accede to the throne without permission from the Golden Horde, and the Tatar hold would continue to decline over the next 100 years up to the Stand on the Ugra River, which, if such things are reasonable to have in the context of history, was the point at which it can be said that Muscovy was practically no longer under Tatar suzerainty. Between Kulikovo and the Stand (called as such because two armies met but retreated without a fight), Moscow was of course burned by Khans more than once, so it's difficult to say that things moved along in an entirely linear fashion. But the progress was there, and, though it took time, Muscovy went on to emerge as the dominant Russian principality.	1642780193.0	htm02yo	t3_s8r5cx	t3_s8r5cx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5cx/out_of_the_all_the_various_rus_princedoms_why_was/htm02yo/

Do you focus on the outcome, or what might have happened in fact, or what might have happened based on the information the actor had at the time? As a silly example, if someone offers you a coin toos bet where you have to win 2 out of 3, but have 10 to 1 odds, the good decision is to take that bet. Even if you lose, which you likely will, taking the bet was still a good decision (probably, depending on how much you wager).  Pearl Harbor ddn't work out for the Japanese's benefit in any way, but can't it be argued that it **could have**, and that the risk was worth it? They underestimated the risk, and it was never likely to succeed, but it was also the only possible path to the outcome they wanted and there were reasons to think it could possibly succeed.	1642779192.0	htlxgy9	t3_s8r0wm	t1_hti11bo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htlxgy9/

9c89xxn	As I said, perhaps early scientific theories did lead to some animal abuse. But I think it gives science too much credit, for both good and bad.  In the 1890's when Morgan proposed his "canon", flogging was still legal punishment for crimes, public hangings were common and often regarded as festive events to bring wives and family. Cockfighting, dog fighting, bear baiting were officially banned, but widespread as a semi-tolerated vice, often involving significant betting activity.  We have come from medieval torture dungeons, drawings and quarterings, beheadings and disembowelings, to a time when many countries have abolished capital punishment altogether, and even imprisonment is seen reformatory rather than punitive.  It seems a bit simplistic to me to ascribe the ill treatment of animals to Morgan's canon, when in fact society was much more tolerant of violence to both man and beast alike. Nor do I view the changes as some sort of progress of science, from a more brutish state towards enlightenment. There are numerous causes, including the democratization of society, affluence resulting from the industrial revolution which made hardship and deprivation less tolerable, the control of infectious diseases that made life less cheap than it used to be, the decline in birth rates, and a profusion of new ideas about the dignity of life. Just to mention a few. Science may be involved, but only incidentally.  I do not believe that animals were treated any better before Morgan's canon, or that it somehow made the situation worse. Perhaps it was used by some as justification for what they were already inclined to do, much as Darwin's theory led to "scientific racism". You could turn it the other way around and claim that science has in fact improved our behavior, shown us how violence does lasting damage to our mental health. Many countries banned corporal punishment of children in schools on such scientific grounds. But this would be simplistic too, I think.  I think such accounts are more in the nature of just-so stories we tell ourselves, conclusions we reach by starting from our biases and then cherry picking facts or explanations that tend to support them, ignoring the messy complexity all around.  >I mean that scientists have a bias to try to model animals as automata, even when that is not the best approach.  I am a neuroscientist by profession, and I don't know of any better approach. I don't believe in some immaterial soul or spirit, I think all we think or feel has a basis in physical, chemical, biological processes in the brain. Depending on which you turn off, people stop thinking, stop feeling, stop pretty much any mental activity they are capable of. True, there are many unanswered questions about cognitive phenomena, the nature of consciousness, the subjective experience of free will. But the answers are all there in the material of the brain, and we're trying to understand what there is in the nature of this "automata" that produces such things.  Not to get into philosophical arguments over determinism or not, this is pretty much how science proceeds.	1642781151.0	htm2lm3	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htloimy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htm2lm3/

mdu63	Really thank /u/LimesLemonsOranges for tagging me.    >In looking for why the church preferred bees wax have there been any references to the beeswax candels having an incense like function?    AFAIK there is no such a reference.    The majority of annotations ascribes this preference to the religious symbolism of bees' and bees wax as a sign of pureness in Christianity, rather than the symbolic meaning, rather than pragmatic concerns (Husberg 1994: 72-74). /u/wotan_weevil also pointed out the cultural tradition inherited from Roman one as another possible reason before in: [How did beeswax come to Europe in the Middle Ages?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dh7bvw/how_did_beeswax_come_to_europe_in_the_middle_ages/)  It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that Catholic church in principle lifted the restriction of non bees wax candle for liturgical use, as also illustrated in [the classic entry of Catholic Encyclopedia (1907)](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01347a.htm)	1642781939.0	htm4ona	t3_s8yzy9	t1_htm0ct1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htm4ona/

bwnsx06	It is very unlikely that *entire* epic poems or other complete texts are lurking somewhere undiscovered, though not impossible. Ancient people largely used papyri or parchment scrolls, both of which are susceptible to degrade over time except in dry conditions. This is why so much papyri was found in Egypt. However, even the papyri found in Egypt were largely take from ancient "dumps" placed in a desert and were already fragmentary in nature. Practices of antiquities dealers like cutting up papyri or separating pages of codices to turn a higher profit also don't help this situation because manuscripts that were once larger or more intact are often separated today. Additionally, in the period when many papyri were initially excavated, the tactics were more "hit and run" than scientific, largely because, in addition to lax archaeological and cultural history standards, they were working against a rising water table (that would destroy the papyri) and the practice of harvesting *sebbakh*, a rich mud used for fertilizer in Egypt's exploding agricultural industry of the late 19th/early 20th century. *Sebbakh* was often found near archaeological ruins (which probably helped it be so rich) and was the type of soil in which papyri were often found. So while papyri fragments can still be found in Egypt, much of the material may have been destroyed even in the last 100 years due to environmental conditions and antiquities trafficking. There are certainly fragments of literary texts hiding in the huge collections of papyri in institutions and private collections around the world; usually the "flashiest" pieces are identified and published first, but there really is quite a bit of material to get through a limited number of people able to decipher these texts. So all in all, small pieces of ancient texts might be found, but it's unlikely that we find an entire collection.     It is true that archaeological methods are always improving, like with the Herculaneum scrolls. Techniques to read these charred papyri have allowed people to get at the texts without completely destroying them. That library mostly contains philosophic texts, not any epics. Another famous example from outside of Egypt are the Dead Sea Scrolls; these texts were mostly Hebrew Bible and Apocrypha. Both of these examples are from extraordinary archaeological contexts, one being the volcanically-preserved Herculaneum and the other being the Qumran desert caves. You are right to point out that many potential archaeological finds have been built over by succeeding generations. This is why the city of Rome has such a slow time of [expanding their subway system](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/22/630532760/romes-subway-expansion-reveals-artifacts-from-the-ancient-past)\--every time they dig to expand, they stop to consider the archaeological finds. So while there is a lot to be found under modern cities, it's not yet possible to unearth that material without a lot of destruction. Even if modern scholars could fully excavate anywhere they like, it's important to remember that the environmental strains of being under settlements (water, sewage, etc), in additional to the local weather, make it unlikely that fragile items like papyri or parchment would survive. Even if they did, it's unlikely they would survive to reveal anything in its entirety.  Sources  Davoli, Paola.

96gqp	The thing is that this was very much **not** the "only option" for Japan, and was in fact planned very late in the process (if one can call it that) of war planning for the IJN, with formal plans only starting in early 1941. During the interwar period (one should remember that Japan was allies with the Western powers in WWI), Japanese plans coalesced around a "decisive battle" in which a successful invasion of the Philippines would draw the American fleet west, to be attritted by Japanese long-range airpower and submarines, and then decisively defeated by large fast battleships. The Pearl Harbor attack as a pre-emptive strike against the fleet developed extremely late in strategic thinking, and was not in any way "necessary" -- one can imagine scenarios (as Japanese planners did) of simply attacking British or Dutch possessions in Borneo and Indonesia, and hoping the U.S. would stay out of the war; or of completing the invasions of Borneo, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines without the strike on Pearl Harbor.   For more reading on this, I would recommend David C. Evans and Mark Peattie, *Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887-1941*, and Peattie's follow-up volume *Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941*.	1642783179.0	htm80l1	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htlxgy9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htm80l1/
a3bwx	The Continental Army didn't have to start from scratch, not entirely. The military system was quite a lot different from today's, and there was a built-in flexibility to take a people's military force from dormant to active by embodying the militia, and by recruiting regulars from the militia. This of course couldn't handle the full load of necessary recruitment, but it did help to ease the burden.  Early battles in the War for Independence were fought almost entirely by colonial militias and British regulars, and early, high-profile come-from-behind victories - or those that could be spun as victories - meant that there was a great deal of enthusiasm for the cause, which, while support had always been fairly high, waxed even more after Bunker Hill and the Siege of Boston. Before I get into mechanisms of recruitment, though, I want to speak to your point about *taking on a powerful empire with little hope of success*.  Men who looked to join the Continental Army didn't think of it that way. They saw their cause as *righteous*, it was about freedom from rhetorical slavery, about patriotism against brutal tyranny. The numbers looked bad on paper, but at the start of hostilities the British regulars were massively outnumbered even by the scattered patriot militias, and patriot forces, both militia and regular, typically maintained that numerical superiority throughout the war. It cost time and money and took a good deal of management to shift huge numbers of soldiers from England and other colonies into North America. It took naval superiority to disembark, support, and resupply them. So while one might have looked at numerical assessments of the strength of the empire, its actual ability to project that force was subject to a great deal of complexity. The patriot cause also had a rhetorical and philosophical advantage, which was itself a kind of irony: for all their rhetoric about brutal jackbooted tyranny, many patriots knew that righteous men in England would support them, and from the start, the War for Independence had some political allies even in British parliament. Their cause was *rational* and *righteous*, who but Providence might stand against them?  While most of the writing about the conflict from the patriot side comes from officers - whose perspective can be quite a bit different from enlisted men - there were some enlisted men who wrote about the war and their reasons for joining. Joseph Plumb Martin, one of the more well-known voices from the war, writes of his desire to "paint himself a soldier" in a humorous retelling:  > And notwithstanding I was told that the British army at that place was reinforced by 15,000 men, it made no alteration in my mind; I did not care if there had been 15 times 15,000, I should have gone just as soon as if there had been but 1,500. I never spent a thought about numbers; the Americans were invincible in my opinion. If anything affected me, it was a stronger desire to see them.  The numbers didn't matter. The cause was holy. Right was on their side. Patriots had already won several engagements, if anyone had believed British regulars invincible at the start of the war, they could be shown they were in error, even by the summer of '76.  All of which is to say that the reason many men joined was not simply because of pay, but because of a kind of patriotic fervor supposedly grounded in rational calculation and adherence to providence. If this sounds like it's an incoherent set of conflicting beliefs, it's because it is. Even Martin, whose reasons for joining were timelessly boyish - the desire for action and adventure, as well as patriotic ardor - describes vividly the appeal of cash bounties paid to enlistees when he first saw a recruiting station in a nearby town:  > I found most of the male kind of the people together; soldiers for Boston were in requisition. A dollar deposited upon the drumhead was taken up by someone as soon as placed there and the holder’s name taken, and he enrolled with orders to equip himself as quick as possible. My spirits began to revive at the sight of the money offered; the seeds of courage began to sprout; for, contrary to my knowledge, there was a scattering of them sowed, but they had not as yet germinated; I felt a strong inclination, when I found I had them, to cultivate them. O, thought I, if I were but old enough to put myself forward, I would be the possessor of one dollar, the dangers of war to the contrary notwithstanding.  To Martin, the cash bounty is connected irresistibly to the heroic cause. The sight of the recruitment bounty literally stirred the "seeds of courage" in him, and over the subsequent months he plots and schemes for a way to secure from his grandparents permission to join up. Eventually, he joined a regiment bound for New York on a six-month enlistment, hoping for "a primer" rather than the whole coat of paint. His enlistment is further encouraged by another omnipresent element of military recruitment: homosocial bonding. Martin runs into friends and acquaintances in town, all of them looking to go a-soldiering as well.   But for all his fervor, he hesitates when holding the pen to write his name on the papers. He makes several dry-runs, careful not to touch his pen to the paper, until another friend jostles his shoulder, and the nub scratches a line on the paper. "O, he has enlisted!" the man called. Martin then wrote his name fairly upon the paper and "now I was a *soldier*, in name at least, if not in practice."  This also shows us a little bit about how recruitment was actually done. There were a handful of more or less permanent recruitment offices. Samuel Nichols, the commander of the American marines, maintained an office throughout the war to recruit marines, and larger cities like Boston and Philadelphia maintained active recruitment stations as they could. But for the most part, recruitment was done as a sort of traveling show. An officer with a couple of senior non-commissioned officers would roll into town with a drummer and piper, play patriotic tunes as they marched down the street, and then set up shop at a convenient public place, usually on or near the commons or at a public house. As Martin described, the drum itself would become a sort of table and stage to display the cash bounties and sometimes even as a surface on which recruits could sign the articles. At various times during the war the enlistment bonus was increased to *far* more than the dollar that stirred the seeds of courage in young Martin - this became a problem for long-term veterans after a few years, because some of the enlistment bonuses were more than the already-enlisted soldiers were paid, and were especially hard to take when enlistment bonuses were handed to new soldiers and the veterans had their pay in arrears for *years* - but the promise of cash, right there and then, was a strong part of recruitment.  There's also a class element to recruitment. In a world where the political ideas were rooted in the community, the militia was looked upon as the more patriotic, balanced, laudable service, and the *regulars* were shifty, untrustworthy mercenaries who had to be motivated by *pay*. Rhetorical attacks against the British regulars often included the idea that the British regulars were automatons who had been beaten into an inhuman mechanical killers. To become a soldier was in some sense to surrender one's humanity for money. In this sense, it tended to be the young and impressionable - like Martin, who, remember, had a great anxiety over convincing his grandparents to give their permission for him to join - or the desperate or greedy. In later American conflicts, like the '98 crisis, when word got out that an army was being formed for a possible war with France, the secretary of the army's desk was flooded with *hundreds* of applications for the officer positions, but recruiting the enlisted men only ever attracted dozens.  And we should bear in mind that though the American Continental Army was molded into a very competent fighting force, the vast majority of fighting on both sides was done by militia. Patriot and Loyalist militias could embody quickly for a purpose and disband just as quickly, and their presence could make the difference in critical battles, such as at Saratoga, which is probably the rhetorical high point of the "minuteman" ideal.  So in answer to your last question, no, soldiering was not looked at as just another job. It was simultaneously a patriotic, adventuresome burden to bear for posterity and a righteous cause, and *also* an alluring, dangerous threat to the soul. The course of the War for Independence provided many different opportunities for men to serve, in violent capacities as well as non-violent, and joining up with the regulars was definitely not the only way to do so.  _____  I highly recommend reading Joseph Plumb Martin's memoir, it is a highly entertaining and emotional perspective on the conflict that's brimming with detail.  I also think you'd enjoy the classic work by Charles Royster, *A Revolutionary People At War*	1642783302.0	htm8cs4	t3_s8ran4	t3_s8ran4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ran4/how_did_the_continental_army_recruit_soldiers_and/htm8cs4/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?"

Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642783736.0	htm9jj4	t3_s98aq7	t3_s98aq7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98aq7/has_any_real_life_historical_princess_ever/htm9jj4/
n4bht	That's really because there isn't a meta-analysis -- again, as I wrote, there are no serious historians who believe such.  If you're interested in the historiography of conspiracy theories, a pretty recent approach is  Conspiracy Theories and the People who Believe Them. (2018). United Kingdom: Oxford University Press.  although if you want to seriously study such things, you should step outside of the US-sphere, since conspiracy theories are quite a global phenomenon (you just don't hear about so many of the other local ones). One advantage to going global is it makes it easier to realize just how strange the perspective is; it's tempting if you are immersed in a culture to believe a sliver of some conspiracy theories, but when you start to learn about, say, South Africa believing Mandela died and was replaced by a clone double (as opposed to the Western theory of "some people went to an alternate universe"), it becomes more apparent that "believability" is simply being manufactured by culture. Try, for instance:  Roniger, L., Senkman, L. (2021). Conspiracy Theories and Latin American History: Lurking in the Shadows. United Kingdom: Taylor & Francis.  or one of my favorites to cite, the time in Java in 1999 there was a rash of "ninja-sorcerer" sightings causing 100+ people to get killed by people thinking they were witches.  Siegel, J. T. (2006). Naming the Witch. United States: Stanford University Press.	1642783999.0	htma9my	t3_s8zk8u	t1_htlgt2y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8zk8u/is_there_a_consensus_among_modern_historians/htma9my/

128xjc	Pretending for a moment that I have some expertise, I'd love a decent one about 17th century Canadian frontier. We kinda got one with the recent show Frontier but I wasn't super blown away. For a show about the fur trade it was just a fairly normal vengeance trope. Give me some Game of Thrones style political intrigue, but from the perspective of the Native American tribes. European explorers, fur trappers and missionaries are coming in but focus on the rest of the continent. No more pioneers and European armies battling it out.  Although on that topic, I'd also probably eat up a series on the War of 1812 and just how messy it could be.	1642785278.0	htmdqrn	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htmdqrn/

168sly	Oh this is actually an easy one.   HBO should make a season 2 of *Chernobyl* that covers the 1988 Gyumri earthquake in Armenia. Boris Shcherbina was in charge of the relief efforts in both so you even get to bring back Stellan Skarsgård.  Probably a series about the Russian Revolution/Civil War/basically World War I is long overdue, especially as the First World War has come back strong into popular memory, and the Russian Revolution needs to be placed back into that context (it long was treated as its own world historic event that WWI was a footnote/sideshow for). It would be very helpful to thread between being overtly anti- or pro-communist, which it seems like even contemporary films about the USSR really struggle to do (maybe *Chernobyl* comes closest but still falls into inaccurate tropes). I'm not even sure there has been a big Western film treatment of those events/period since *Dr. Zhivago* and *Reds*, except maybe the BBC *Zhivago* remake from 2002.	1642786207.0	htmgadd	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htmgadd/

abfzitd7	>The grand flaw in Japanese plans, of course, was the assumption that an attack on, say, the Philippines would immediately send the American fleet on a crash course to a decisive battle, but it's also the only way in which the strategy would have worked.   It wasn't a flaw, it was part of American war plans like War Plan Orange that an attack on the Philippines would cause the US Fleet to steam across the Pacific thus playing into the Japanese hands.  This is why Pearl Harbor was such a big mistake for Japan; by forcing the Americans to rely on their carrier force it meant that there would be no steaming into decisive battle and instead a slow and methodical advance across the Pacific. As you point out, with no Pearl Harbor there would have been a limited war in the Pacific with unknown degree of public support for using American troops to protect European colonial possessions.	1642787092.0	htmipfo	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htlciyv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htmipfo/
96gqp	War Plan Orange was fairly continuously revised in the years leading up to Pearl Harbor, and while the American fleet was initially (say in the 1920s) committed to a full-scale retaliatory attack, planners and plans grew more nuanced as time went on and the importance of carriers (and/or the wildcard nature of carriers) became more known. The best book on the subject is probably still Edward Miller's *War Plan Orange: The U. S. Strategy To Defeat Japan, 1897-1945*; although I can't recommend it for entertaining reading, it is _highly_ detailed.	1642787863.0	htmkueh	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htmipfo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htmkueh/
14m5kd	The Baseball bit is absolutely true. Baseball is *huge* in Japan and notably is not a particularly popular or notable sport in the majority of countries outside North America. This was absolutely popularized through the occupation and spread like wildfire as a sort-of US sanctioned recreational activity. To this day Baseball is one of the most popular sports in Japan. So that bit is absolutely true.     As far as American interest in Sushi, anime, or Japanese culture. That's another story and much more complicated. The basic jist is that there has long been a fascination with Japanese culture in the Western world, dating all the way back from the opening of the country by Perry in the mid 19th century. There's even a term in the art world "Japonisme" for works and styles influenced by Japanese art and style which was incredibly popular in the later 19th century (even Van Gogh has several [paintings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Van_Gogh_-_la_courtisane.jpg) in a Japanese influenced style). This reflected a general western fascination with the country and east Asia in general. We would today know this as Orientalism. Even the secretary of war for the US in WWII: Henry Stimson, went on a honeymoon to Kyoto before the war. So there was a cultural fascination that had already existed around the world.     Sushi did not get popular in the US until long after the occupation, only really beginning to enter the mainstream of US cuisine in the 1980's (and even then was limited, mostly popular among travelling businessmen and rich/famous people, not something a family from New England would go get for dinner). It really entered mainstream popularity in the 21st century but I don't want to break the 20 year rule ;)     As for anime, anime as an industry largely did not exist prior to or even during the occupation, save for a few short films and one feature length propaganda film. The first anime tv series came about in the early 60's with things like Astro Boy and Gigantor. This would be about 10 years after the occupation ended. However these series would be broadcast in the United States in roughly the same time frame, of particular note was "Maha Go Go!" or as we know it "Speed Racer". So these three series would probably be the first major western exposure to Anime. But the popularity of anime would only start to emerge around the 80's with films like Akira and the advent of VHS tapes, though again this was still quite niche. The popularity of Anime in the US would only really explode with things like Toonami and specifically Dragon Ball Z in the late 90's and shortly after Disney purchasing the rights to Ghibli films. This basically overnight brought anime to a much wider audience than it had so far seen.     You'll note that both of these started to come to prominence in the 80's and later became popular in the 90's. This was an era in which the Japanese economy was booming and many in the US were anxious of the Japanese economy possibly overtaking our own (Japan was the second largest economy in the world by this point) and as such there was a new wave of both fascination with Japanese culture and a phobia of the Japanese. But this is all getting very far beyond the scope of the original question. In short: Baseball: yes. Sushi and anime: no.	1642787898.0	htmkxyb	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmgbg5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htmkxyb/

14m5kd	It's mentioned a little in some other books about the related conflicts (Indochina War and Chinese Civil War) but I could not tell you which at the moment. I should note that the number who stayed behind was quite small: a couple hundred in Vietnam, and a couple thousand in China/Korea. Not to mention the various Japanese holdouts in various islands and jungles across the south Pacific. This might sound like a lot but considering the massive size of the Japanese army its a fairly small number.     The Kwangtung army actually fought for an extra day after Hirohito's proclamation of surrender and a couple divisions continued the fight still for a few days after that (a common thread among the Japanese military officers in WWII: not following orders). Of this massive army that was spread over a massive and perilously thinly connected theater it was very easy for any soldier who wished to slip through the cracks to do so. The notable example of this is Imamura Hosaku who stayed behind with many of his unit to be basically mercenaries for the Nationalists in China. I'm afraid there's not a ton of sources or info on these Japanese "stay-behinds" as it were, it would seem this is largely because it was not really an organized/coherent effort but rather a couple disparate officers and units opting to do so.     I'll see if I can dig up some good books/sources on them but even my knowledge of them is pretty limited.	1642788626.0	htmmyiu	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmg2f8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htmmyiu/

51ju0t3o	Mystics. I want to see actors transform into sheep or walking on water.   More seriously, perhaps a drama about Dowager Guo of Wei. From important clan and an intelligent woman but sent to the palace as a hostage for region revolt, entering the harem of a prince who struggled to be heir. He would go from a quiet, intelligent young man to a flamboyant Emperor, she would grow closer to him and it caused friction to his marriage with first love Mao and eventually her death despite Guo's attempts to avoid trouble. Two years later, Cao Rui would die with Guo made Dowager. It would... not be a smooth time. There would be three young Emperors before her death in 264 with the empire falling three years later. There would philosophical tensions between the regents Cao Shuang and Sima Yi which saw Cao Shuang overthrown and killed and someone at court (perhaps Guo) using ranks to signal they doubted Sima Yi was being as loyal as claimed. There would be a series of miliatry revolts claiming doing it on her behalf to rescue the Empress Dowager, the Sima's would claim to be acting on her behalf, edicts blatantly written at sword-point and constant plots. She was unable to resist the deposing of Emperor Cao Fang but she outwitted Sima Shi in open court to install her choice of successor and keep her authority. Later Shi's younger brother Zhao would take the young Emperor Cao Mao and Dowager Guo (a rather unusual move) on camapign against the rebelling Zhuge Dan becuase he couldn't trust what they would do if left behind. Cao Mao would attempt a fightback in 254 and was killed in the streets, the Dowager's authority used to fabricate a series of farcical claims to downplay this but her power would be broken and her authority reduced.   Big characters, political plots, miliatry action at court and a wily brave woman who tried to save a dynasty against men who controlled the army.	1642788948.0	htmnuia	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htmnuia/

is2b2	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

for0hho1	In Nelson's case I think you have to supplement the "flags" answer with the extensive preparations the commander and captains made so they could fight without making many signals during combat.  Nelson regularly issued tactical memoranda explaining what he expected his subordinate captains to do in different types of situations. This established a body of doctrine. He also prepared written battle plans with sketches showing how he wanted anticipated engagements to unfold. These formal written communications were supplemented by meetings and conferences as well as personal correspondence and relationships with the captains, who formed a "band of brothers" around Nelson. The point of all this was to ensure that every captain knew how to handle his ship, knew the overall plan, and had a pretty good idea what the other captains would do, minimizing the need for communication, which as u/YouOr2 points out was somewhat time-consuming even using the Popham code (which was quite efficient for its time).   In some of his battle plans, Nelson spelled out alternatives or phases that were keyed to particular flag hoists. His general preference, though was to have his fleet go into action as rapidly and violently as possible without many preliminaries and without the captains ever waiting for orders once he had indicated it was time to fight. A famous sentence from [the memorandum Nelson issued shortly before Trafalgar](https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106127.html): "But, in case Signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood, no Captain can do very wrong if he places his Ship alongside that of an Enemy." Nelson encouraged aggression and initiative.  When the fleet was speeding into action at Trafalgar, Nelson's second-in-command Collingwood, aboard a different ship, saw that the flagship HMS *Victory* was hoisting a long signal and remarked to a staff officer, "I wish Nelson would make no more signals; we all understand what we have to do." Of course, that long signal was the "England expects" message which could be rendered in today's parlance "You got this." HMS *Victory* sent only one more signal until the battle's end: "Engage the enemy more closely," which Nelson characteristically hoisted during battles. That was the only order he felt necessary, such was his confidence.	1642789603.0	htmpncz	t3_s88vs3	t1_htlk7do	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88vs3/how_would_have_a_naval_commander_in_the_19th/htmpncz/

14m5kd	Actually, I've been rewatching the entire series with a friend recently (part of why I took this question) and one of the most interesting things about the Bond series is actually how little the actual Cold War factors into it. In all the Connery films Bond is squaring off against SPECTRE which exists outside of any individual state and is trying to extort both the East and West or otherwise goad them into a larger conflict. Similarly in later films Bonds almost always fighting some quasi-supervillain who has little to no direct relationship to the USSR or Red China. The closest the series comes to it is For Your Eyes Only (1981) wherein a UK encryption machine is trying to be fenced to the East by some villain. But here the Soviets are not portrayed as the villains, only the buyers. And in the next film Octopussy (1983) wherein the villain is a rogue Soviet general who's fed up with the Politburos passivity towards the West. There are even a few films wherein Bond works WITH the KGB such as The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and View to a Kill (1985)     Off-topic a bit and sort-of geeky but I thought it was interesting on rewatch just how little the Soviets are presented as the villains in the series. Ironically they only really started being portrayed that way with Goldeneye (1995). It's honestly bizarre considering the reputation the series has as a cold-war espionage.	1642789680.0	htmpv46	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmm9fh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htmpv46/
70uvo	I am coming to this real late, and I would just add to this outstanding answer that Great Auks don't need to be particularly delicious to be better than the ordinary fare on a transatlantic voyage. Regular accounts of food onboard do not exactly whet the appetite, and fresh meat was always sought-after. I'm thinking particularly of Shackleton's crew's account of finding dog meat to be just delightful after subsisting on penguin and seal, or Melville's account of the delicacy of whale. Compared to hardtack I'm sure all were in fact toothsome.	1642789879.0	htmqenm	t3_rezj7v	t1_hoe3ms2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rezj7v/i_have_heard_that_the_flightless_great_auk_of_the/htmqenm/
yfege	There are some, but it's very limited. From Reagan's book:   > Most disturbing, the number of women who died because of abortion increased. New York City data documented the worsening patterns of abortion. Between 1951 and 1962, the absolute number of abortion deaths nearly doubled in this eleven-year period, from twenty-seven deaths per year in the early 1950s to fifty-one per year in the early 1960s. [Graph](https://imgur.com/a/ExF3edy). The observed rise in abortion deaths was not simply a function of growing population. When standardized to one thousand live births, the rate of deaths as a result of abortion had practically doubled as well.* >  > *Vital statistics cannot be used to track mortality due to illegal abortions for a variety of reasons; see Christopher Tietze, “Abortion as a Cause of Death,” AJPH 38 (October 1948): 1434–1437. Abortion-related deaths are presumed to be undercounted because physicians protected their patients (and themselves) by assigning other causes of death on death certificates. These New York City data are the best we have.	1642789963.0	htmqmyq	t3_s8tr7p	t1_htmoen0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8tr7p/were_coat_hangers_ever_really_used_for_athome/htmqmyq/

52gm1	I just finished The Land of Enterprise and it definitely answers why toy companies were being acquired in the late 60s/early 70s. Waterhouse describes it as taking the idea of decentralized management to its extreme end--that you can run just about any company from afar the same way. I've emailed Waterhouse to ask about toy companies being sold off/let go to be independent in the 1980s, and in the meantime I'll start on An Extraordinary Time.

pmgxogo	Usually they're just called hostages. For example from [Encyclopedia Britannica:](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hostage-warfare)  >The practice of taking hostages is very ancient and has been used in cases of conquest, surrender, and armistice. The Romans often took the sons of tributary princes and educated them at Rome, thus holding a security for the continued loyalty of the conquered nation and also instilling a possible future ruler with ideas of Roman civilization. The British adopted this practice in the early period of the occupation of India, as did the French in their relations with the Arab states of North Africa. Hostages were detained as prisoners of war until treaty obligations were carried out (as was the case with John II during the Hundred Years’ War) or a king’s ransom was paid (as with Richard I). In ancient times they were punished or put to death in case of treachery or refusal to fulfill promises.  The entry is relatively archaic in some of the language used (basically unchanged from the 1911 edition) but the definition stands.	1642791871.0	htmvlgy	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htlutev	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htmvlgy/

pmgxogo	Definitely not. While yogurt was probably invented in multiple places at different times, it has a long history in the Middle East going back to early Mesopotamian history, c. 2000 BCE, more than 1500 years before even the earliest plausible Turkic or partially-Turkic groups arrived in the region. Yogurt was easier to store and preserve than fresh milk and may have been the primary dairy product consumed by early Mesopotamian cultures.

7rvatyyv	I've posted about this before, but the life of Stalin pre-1917, essentially the book *Young Stalin* by Simon Sebag Montefiore turned into a series.  From being a student at a seminary who was kicked out for developing socialist thought, to an agitator in the Baku oil fields and then the Batum warehouses, to editing his own revolutionary newsletter, to his Siberian exile(s), meeting Lenin, Stalin (still known as Jughashvili) had a wild life before 1917, and it would be perfect for a series like that.	1642794639.0	htn37ru	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htn37ru/
9tg9p	I just wanted to provide a little addendum to explain a little bit of the martial arts community's internal role in these martial arts myths. As a historian and a martial artist myself (nidan, Shitou-ryuu karate) this is something that I've looked into in a semi-amateurish, semi-professional (in that I'm equipped with the historian's toolset) fashion, and the study of the self-perception of martial arts is a somewhat fertile, if limited, academic field right now. While nothing that I'm going to say I think is particularly groundbreaking, I think it's still worth saying because the discourse surrounding martial arts, especially in the western hemisphere and probably *particularly* in internet circles, often has a rather poor grasp on this admittedly somewhat emergent area of study. The work on this sort of thing is ongoing by people like Paul Bowman, his colleague and co-editor Benjamin Judkins (whose [blog](https://chinesemartialstudies.com/) I highly recommend to anyone interested), and others, many of whom are mentioned in your bibliography.  Pretty much all modern martial arts disciplines are based on some kind of internal conceit, usually to do with lineage and authenticity. There are practical reasons for this. It's important to demonstrate how your school or style has been battle-tested/is more effective/is derived from authentic techniques for the same reasons that it's important for a university to be accredited. This holds as true for East Asian martial arts, which typically demonstrate this authenticity with reference to lineages (even when they're imagined), as it is for the recent contemporary practice of HEMA, which in the absence of a living tradition to refer to instead utilizes period manuals and practical demonstrations to prove the same point. Martial arts styles are, at their core, systems of techniques built around a central philosophy for how hand-to-hand combat should work. Pretty much all modern martial arts systems, regardless of country of origin or type, are mixed systems, drawing from countless other systems that have in turn been influenced by the very same systems that they influence, or their predecessors. This is almost trivially easy to demonstrate, and has been shown repeatedly by Bowman et al. It's also acknowledged openly in many schools, although others downplay it. A textbook example is in karate, which is a combination (mainly) of indigenous Ryuukyuuan techniques, southern Chinese styles (predominantly Fujian White Crane), and indigenous Japanese techniques, among many others. Different periods of karate's development show a greater or lesser influence of different parts, and different styles emphasize or de-emphasize different elements. Many traditional Shoutoukan doujou, for example, de-emphasize the Chinese aspect of karate, while instead emphasizing the deep, stable stances and longer-range strikes that typify Shoutoukan as being "traditional" but which are relatively recent additions to the curriculum. In many ways a style like Shitou-ryuu, while being technically more recent, can claim to be more "authentic," in that its creators combined several different styles together and were to a certain extent trying to "recover" an older form of the martial art as it had been practiced in the Ryuukyuu Islands before coming to mainland Japan.   It's in this context that the imagined origins and lineage of karate develop. Many people have heard, for example, the myth that karate developed because Okinawan peasants were forbidden from owning weapons or practicing martial arts and instead developed empty-handed techniques that mimicked weapon techniques, which they hid in elaborate dance-like kata. Both parts of this are, of course, untrue: karate's traditional weapons are police weapons, not converted farming gear, and the martial art's Ryuukyuuan roots derive mostly from anti-riot techniques, which is why there's so much of an emphasis in most styles on multi-directional combat against poorly-armed opponents. Likewise, students are often surprised to discover that this supposedly Japanese (or at best, "Okinawan") martial art uses Chinese names for most of its high-ranking kata, and that the idea of the kata itself as practiced in karate (where it's a lengthy solo routine rather than a partner-based practice of a single technique as is typical in mainland Japanese martial arts) is a Chinese development--indeed, prior to Funakoshi-sensei's changing of the writing to the homophonic 空手 the name of the martial art was originally written 唐手 "Tang (i.e. Chinese) hand," which is still used by the Korean, Shoutoukan-derived martial art Tang Soo Do. Why isn't this better known in karate doujou? The origins of the habit are certainly to a large part nationalistic--Funakoshi-sensei found the Chinese influence, which at the time of karate's arrival in mainland Japan was very strong, on the martial art embarrassing, and more importantly a near-insurmountable obstacle to its adoption in Japan--but with karate a globally practiced martial art it's hard to see how this would continue to perpetuate. To a certain extent there are again practical explanations rooted in the evolution of martial arts. Contrary to the common view in the western hemisphere, which has long dismissed East Asian martial arts as impractical and rooted in unchanging traditions, these styles evolve, and they evolve quite rapidly. Within less than a generation of Funakoshi-sensei's rebranding of karate, much of the style's internal philosophy had changed, replacing much of the southern Chinese-derived dynamic movement and wide, circular motions with simpler, more powerful strikes and more of an emphasis on set piece movements, converting from its essentially combat-focused roots to a more competition-based form. In that sense, then, the mythical origin of karate as a populist, secret martial art that, the story goes, became increasingly more ritualized and frozen reinforces the martial art's own internal philosophy, regardless of whether it's actually true or not.	1642794809.0	htn3ox4	t3_s8ddl3	t1_hths5ox	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/htn3ox4/
2dsdz655	You might be thinking of the term "ward" which is a minor who under the protection of a guardian appointed by the parents or court.   It's used in fiction like Game of Thrones where Theon, the son of the Lord of the Iron Islands, is the ward of Ned Stark of Winterfell.  And famously Robin is the ward of Batman.

9tg9p	**2/2**  Another thing that happens is that many techniques in East Asian martial arts are very old, or because of the rapid evolution in fighting styles and warfare the circumstances under which they were developed quickly become irrelevant and the original purpose of the technique or feature of the style becomes obscure. One of my go-to examples is the tassels traditionally found on spears or swords in many Chinese styles. Western students often find these things very funny, and it's hard to explain why they're there, practically. The usual explanation, that they serve to distract the enemy, is obvious nonsense. These tassels are, of course, insignia or just plain decorations in origin, but that isn't especially important. What *is* important is that techniques, often quite effective, have developed around the interpretation that they're there for distraction, long after the practical purpose of the feature has been rendered irrelevant. In that sense, the myth becomes more important than the reality.   Here's an example that I've been doing some research on recently. Again, karate is a good example because of its highly mixed origins. Many kata have features that are totally obscure to modern practitioners, and which in many cases were already unclear in the 1930s. The kata Chinte--a Chinese kata, one of the oldest in the martial art--is so old that the point of several movements is disputed. The funny "eye poke" thing is one of them, but compare the [Shoutoukan version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou14EWbogB0) with the [Shitou-ryuu one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsPkdwqBgXE&t=10s). The Shoutoukan version has three hops added at the end of it not found in any other style to practice the kata. Why? Some Shoutoukan masters will say that it's an adaptation of an older movement that's lost its meaning and purpose. But this seems suspect, because there are cases where other styles have preserved older movements in more practical form than Shoutoukan. And indeed, the [Shourin-ryuu version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcdM7pW14ms) is substantially different, preserving several intermediate movements that are not found in either of the other two versions or that are significantly simplified, such as the insertion of a leg sweep and downward punches, the much slower version of the "eye poke," and the "windmilling" of what's just a low block in the other two versions, clearly some form of throw and takedown. So what happened here? Is this another case of Shoutoukan removing a Chinese influence that Shourin-ryuu (often considered more conservative) preserved and that Shitou-ryuu (founded at least in part as an attempt to "restore" older forms that had dropped out of many styles) "recovered?" Is Shoutoukan actually preserving, in modified form, an older version? Are the three hops there to return the martial artist to his start position, since in the Shoutoukan version you end the kata well in advance of where you started, which is considered bad form? Who the hell knows--what's important is that each style preserves its own justification for its own variation. And the justifications, mythical or not, encapsulate and reinforce lessons about the style, and the style's own philosophy. Shoutoukan, highly formalized and founded by a sensei whose overriding concern was not the practicality of the form but getting it accepted by mainstream Japanese society, claims either that the hops were added as a holdover from an earlier movement that was somehow forgotten, or were added for purely aesthetic, performance-based reasons. Shitou-ryuu, which often claims to have recovered techniques lost to other styles, usually points to the Chinese origin of the kata to explain its otherwise obscure movements. And Shourin-ryuu's version is almost entirely rooted in practical application. Regardless of the actual origin of the kata's movements, you can see how the different philosophies of the styles are reflected by how they interpret and then justify the kata. You get stuff like this all the time. The legendary origins of Fujian White Crane, that Fang Qiniang tried to hit a crane with a stick, are obviously mythical. But the way the story's told it emphasizes the basic philosophy of the style, which is to attack and defend in a single movement, even if it's unlikely in the extreme (to say the least) that the style was developed by watching cranes. Similarly, the existence of a mythical southern Shaolin temple helps many southern Chinese schools explain obvious Shaolin influence on their styles, despite Shaolin being considered a northern style. Combine this with nationalism, regionalism, the need to justify techniques with reference to practical application (most easily done by pointing out similarities with a tried-and-true style), and the constant mixing of martial arts styles and you've got a potent mix that's self-reinforcing.	1642794832.0	htn3r5r	t3_s8ddl3	t1_htn3ox4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/htn3r5r/

flouu	I'd love to see something about the 'seven men of Spandau' (or the Breda Four, but that's even more obscure). Nazis always get views, and this is one view of Nazis that has been seriously lacking. The viewers would be treated to the sight of Nazis bickering over nonsense as the Cold War rages overhead. The world has moved on, former allies are now bitter enemies - and yet, right in West Berlin, the epicentre of the Cold War, the USSR works together with the western powers in a cavernous prison built to hold 400 but now with a population of 7.  The miniseries 'Speer and Hitler' (specifically part 3) does an excellent job of showing what happened and I recommend it, but it only really covers the incarceration of Albert Speer, and there was so much other crazy stuff going on. You could start with the sentencings and the arguments over what exactly to do with them and then go through the next 40 years with flashbacks to how the prisoners got there, culminating with the prison getting knocked down after Hess' suicide. It would have to have a nuanced take on Cold War politics and be respectful of the Soviet side. Actually, it could just be an adaptation of Norman Goda's 'Tales from Spandau' and I'd watch it.	1642795789.0	htn6ddr	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htn6ddr/

acxhi	I have a question about the movie that’s been bugging me lately: The beginning of the movie goes to an awful lot of trouble to take eyes off Bond, going so far as to fake his death and burial at sea. They then immediately send him to  1960s Japan with no attempt to disguise him. How unusual would it be to see a white man in Japan in the 60s? I would have thought his race alone would draw considerable attention.	1642796024.0	htn70ds	t3_s99rlz	t3_s99rlz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htn70ds/

1n19jp1g	I would make a series about Bess of Hardwick (1527-1608). She's quite an interesting historical figure - married multiple times, rising socially with each one, and of course her lifespan ran through the tumult of the 16th century, from Henry VIII's rupture with the Catholic Church and through all of his children's reigns. You could do a LOT with her life paralleling Elizabeth's; and rather than being a straightforward retelling of her biography, the main action could be when she and her husband had custody of Mary Stuart, jumping back and forth in time to show how she got to such a position. With SUMPTUOUS costuming.	1642796831.0	htn98kn	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htn98kn/

2ycwtyy0	So, at this point we are a bit outside of what I know off-hand so I apologize if this seems a little disorganized on my end. If, however, anything I say below is factually incorrect then hopefully someone will correct me.  The process of establishing a British-style postal system (i.e. each street within a postal office's purview is given a name, and each destination a numerical designation with odd numbers on one side and even numbers on the other) was very piecemeal-- there was no singular date at which it was done "all at once." Hong Kong was using a system similar to that as early as 1838, but even after the establishment of the Imperial Post in 1896 the issues with replacing the courier system were infamously difficult. A trade report from 1904 lists only 18 provinces which were using the system, and this is despite the fact that Sir Robert Hart had essentially made it his personal mission to sort out the mess and confusion that was Chinese mail delivery at that time.   While not strictly related to the question you asked, I think it naturally begs the question of why this was so difficult. The shortest possible answer to that is that due to the events of the time the Chinese tended to view foreigners with a large amount of hostility and resentment, and this combined with the monetary interests of the merchants and private couriers who made their living off of delivering things caused the Imperial Post to be seen as yet another form of undue foreign control and influence.   Here, I will let the aforementioned trade report of 1904 speak for itself:  &#x200B;  >\[The 1896 Imperial\] Decree created an Imperial Post for all China, to be modelled on Western lines, the organization and management of which were confided to Sir ROBERT HART, who from that date has acted in the double capacity of Inspector General of Customs and Posts.    Far more obstructive to rapid progress will Native postal agencies prove. These also have had a long life, but, unlike the *I Chan*, they are wholly independent; they consider letter traffic as their legitimate business, and live on it: they will die hard.   >   >\[...\]   >   >These agencies, unfettered by legislation, indispensable to the people, flourished undisturbed at all places till, some 50 years ago, the appearance of steam brought also for those working at places along the coast and the River a new order of things. Yet for a long time no particular notice was taken of their doings, and when supervision over them became necessary, they were found to have organised themselves into strong bodies holding a monopoly for the transmission by steamers of all inter-port Native correspondence.   >   >\[...\]   >   >In a country like China, where exchange is so erratic and banking transactions difficult and costly, \[...\] Native agencies flourish, and it helps them not a little to retain their customers for other postal operations. The Remittance Order of the Imperial Post Office is one of the means by which this traffic will be curtailed and the public freed from risk and capricious exactions.    ***- Returns of Trade and Trade Reports for the Year 1904; Report on the Working of the Post Office***	1642798279.0	htndaf4	t3_s88meg	t1_htmef0n	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htndaf4/

A series of fiberglass tunnels brings visitors to the sea floor, some 20 feet below the surface, where more than 2,500 relics stand.

14m5kd	They are often lactose intolerant today but I'm not sure how many people were at the time. Nonetheless milk is still a common drink for children in Japan. Moreover it was an efficient means of providing fat to their diet, if not consumed as milk it could also be used to make cheese which is considerably lower in lactose than regular milk. I am not sure how much thought was given to the dietary norms of the Japanese, but milk was a common food item shipped because of the high production numbers in the US dairy industry, high-in-fat/calories, and use in other food preparation (cheese, baking). Obviously grains and milk were not the only foods brought to Japan but they were some notable food stuffs brought in large quantities.	1642798728.0	htnejjy	t3_s99rlz	t1_htnd0cs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnejjy/

14m5kd	Sorry yes, I was referring to the Japanese soldiers who "defected" to fight for the Nationalists. I *believe* and I could be wrong, that the majority of the Japanese fighting for the Communists were former POW's taken by the Red Army who "escaped" and signed up with the communists though I am not certain of this.      But as you said there's not a lot of info available and I think that's largely because of the less-than-official nature of this occurrence. So exact figures for either side are difficult to state, or in the very least are not my expertise, so I opted for a vague number for the Nationalists, which I've heard estimates of about 5-6,000 or possibly more. But lacking exact sources I wasn't willing to put a precise number on it. Thanks for the additional info though!	1642799322.0	htng7mi	t3_s99rlz	t1_htne9wx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htng7mi/
ph4ds	If I may interject, one of Richard Nixon’s books (maybe “Leaders”) introduced me to Shigeru Yoshida and the groundbreaking work he and Douglass MacArthur did in creating modern Japan post war. Sadly I’ve never followed up on this thread. I’d love to know your thoughts on their time directing Japan and would appreciate pointers on further reading in English.	1642799647.0	htnh4a9	t3_s99rlz	t1_htlxcfe	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnh4a9/

bwnsx06	I think it is possible, just because there is so much unpublished material, but it's going to be a rare occurrence. The early papyrologists were especially interested in literary texts, so that tended to be the first stuff published. There could definitely be things in private collections or less-studied institutional collections, but I want to make sure to emphasize the caveat of interest in literary texts early on. The controversy around Dirk Obbink and his "new Sappho" show that things can pop up, but they  generate a lot of questions when they do.	1642800105.0	htnidzd	t3_s99g43	t1_htmfu3o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99g43/whats_the_actual_possibility_that_there_are_still/htnidzd/

yfege	While there were a number of reasons, it's likely the most significant factor was that poor women, especially women of color, were no longer able to afford safe but illegal abortion as the cost of skyrocketed in the 1950s. The next paragraph in the book:  > The risk of dying from an abortion was closely linked to race and class. Nearly four times as many women of color as white women died as a result of abortions. Mortality data revealed the racial inequalities in access to safe abortions. Between 1951 and 1962, the number of abortion-related deaths of women of color more than doubled, from an average of nineteen abortion deaths per year to forty-one. In contrast, ten white women died per year because of abortion in the early 1960s. Abortion deaths accounted for half of the maternal deaths of women of color, compared to 25 percent of the maternal deaths of white women. >   This meant that their only affordable options were unsafe abortionists or self-inducing.	1642800839.0	htnkfmw	t3_s8tr7p	t1_htnevwr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8tr7p/were_coat_hangers_ever_really_used_for_athome/htnkfmw/

fsldsue9	I see, is your number previous to the defeat of the nationalists on the mainland(pre-1949ish)?   I think that the Japanese support for the nationalists has always been more official after the retreat to Taiwan given the nature of the alliance structure post-World War 2 and you have Japanese military advisors posted to Taiwan in official capacity after the nationalists' retreat to Taiwan for Operation "retaking of the mainland" and related internal security operations to root out communist operatives. Japan filled the role Germany played at one point as KMT's foreign military advisor after the retreat to Taiwan and before United States will also do the same later on. However, my reading on the subject seems to indicate that the KMT was much more adverse to using Japanese personnel previous to the retreat to Taiwan as offers of an unofficial stay behind plan by the Japanese was seen as just a prelude to more Japanese imperialism, but some local warlords under notation KMT command did so secretly. In addition, I think it depends on how you count the numbers since I think a number of Japanese personnel on both KMT and CPC side did not see active combat and were technical staff that kept the factories running and supply lines open rather than front line soldiers.   There were also the large number of collaborationist Chinese forces under Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China. Heck, there is even the participation by Koreans(ethnic Koreans or Korean-Chinese/Chinese-Korean) in People's Liberation Army during the Chinese civil war, which will form the backbone of the spearhead divisions by North Korea to take Seoul in the first wave of the Korean War. So the Chinese civil war was a giant multifaceted affair.	1642801009.0	htnkwuw	t3_s99rlz	t1_htng7mi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnkwuw/

i6kyb	I don't know who I'd cast, but I do have an idea of what I'd like to do in that scenario: the Crecy campaign, but from a French perspective. The first episode would start off with the Genoese leaving Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue due to a lack of payment, feature the English landing and the main POV would be a boy who is captured and forced to serve as a page for an English man-at-arms. Since the English vanguard sees most of the action, the man-at-arms will be part of Sir John Liston's retinue and he'll be constantly worried about an unpredictably violent and exceedingly petty young mounted archer named John Hawkwood and his best friend, the less unpredictable but very emotional William Gold.  The French side will mostly be told through the perspectives of Colins de Beaumont - a herald in the employ of Jean de Beaumont - and Louis the count of Blois. Through Colins we get to see the perspective of the men-at-arms and common soldiers of the army while through Louis we get to see the high level planning. The French side of things focuses on how the French are scrambling to scratch together an army to resist the English and slow/stop the English so that an army *can* be fielded. It's going to lean very heavily into the idea that the French basically had the right idea about slowing/stopping the English but struggled to execute it for various explicable, not comically incompetent, reasons.  The seventh episode is the battle of Crecy, and it's where Louis of Blois dies, along with a lot of the men-at-arms we've come to know through Colins. They mostly die in the first 20 minutes of the battle and the rest of the episode is the French trying to recover from the initial disaster and includes the King of Bohemia making a suicidal charge to try and extract the French vanguard after the English sallied and began to surround it.   Episode 8, the final episode, is all about the aftermath of the battle. The English are exhausted, and also a little horrified by the sheer slaughter in the area where the vanguard was destroyed, but the main focus is on Colins as he's sent with other heralds to identify the dead. As he finds the bodies of more and more friends, hears stories about how some were captured but then killed due to disagreements over who captured them and can't identify other bodies because of the damage done to their shields, surcoats/jupons and faces, he comes closer and close to breaking down. He eventually sites down and begins to write a poem about it.  >When the summer is in decline,  > >And the sun abandons its lofty course,  > >And the weather gets cold,  > >And the chill withers the foliage,  > >And renders the green trees yellow,  > >And one sees come to death  > >All the fruit that issued from the blossom.  The end for the boy is similarly bitter. After the battle he's release from service by the man-at-arms who forced his service back in episode one in what is meant as a kindly gesture but, hundreds of miles from home, having seen his countrymen killed, been randomly beaten by Hawkwood for minor mistakes, been forced to run arrows to the archers at Caen, looted peasant farms for what little food hasn't be taken or burnt, run arrows and waters to the archers at Crecy and then been forced to strip and bury the bodies from Crecy, he's at a loss for what to do. So, when a Norman man-at-arms arrives as part of an escort for a messenger and is asking about a friend of his from Caen, the boy attaches himself to the man-at-arms as a page, is given a spare sword and a poor horse and told that there's more fighting to be done, and this time he'll be on the winning side.	1642801283.0	htnloa0	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htnloa0/

14m5kd	No I was referring to Imamura Hosaku who defected with a contingent of his unit to serve as Mercenaries. I believe you are correct that Japan did not officially support the Nationalists in a great capacity until after the Civil War was already effectively lost. The Japanese troops who fought for the Nationalists did so in an unofficial capacity, as-in joined or were hired by the NRA rather than be repatriated.      Again I must stress that Japanese volunteers in the Chinese Civil War are not my area of expertise and I'm still not certain of any good English language sources on them as they definitely seemed to exist but were not necessarily recruited or incorporated in the most orderly or documented fashion. I think that what we're both getting at here is that the Chinese Civil War was a very sprawling and messy conflict for which there are a lot of factors that are still quite difficult to fully parse.	1642801649.0	htnmoaw	t3_s99rlz	t1_htnkwuw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnmoaw/

ib0bk	I'm not sure I understand.  It's specific enough to be about Dong Zhuo in comparison to other warlords. We have details about what they did - Some I know, some I can't set into a bigger picture, and lots I don't know of. And someone who knows about this stuff can provide the context that, more or less, I'm asking for.  > lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  I don't see how this applies. At the core of the question, you can answer with "Yes, he was that terrible - While e.g. Cao Cao did X and Y, socities moral system at the time would find incedents like Dong Zhuo throwing spears at his servants more terrible". I'm assuming a historian about the time would have enough knowledge about how society worked to give a somewhat accurate picture of how Dong Zhuo's reception might differ from others. I find it feasible enough to find (no) support for the notion that he is a great scapegoat for modern media, but that's not the core question.  -------------  Is there a way to change the question to be more fitting?	1642801859.0	htnn9bw	t3_s9krg7	t1_htnkwdv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9krg7/in_the_chinese_three_kingdoms_period_was_dong/htnn9bw/
1n19jp1g	To add to /u/EdHistory101's point, I would note that your logic is a bit flawed. A significant amount of unprotected premarital/extramarital sex was occurring before the 1960s (the 1950s are also a high for illegitimate births); what we call the sexual revolution is the cultural changes resulting from the development of and increase in the availability of the Pill, which allowed women to have sex without the danger of a pregnancy - particularly the middle- and upper-class women who had a great deal to lose from a pregnancy out of wedlock. It didn't necessarily result in more unplanned pregnancies.

yfege	The challenge is that historians don't generally use words like "terrible" to describe historical figures. In effect, what you're asking is for someone to pass judgement, which isn't good historical practice. You're welcome to ask about Dong Zhuo's reputation when he was alive, especially in comparison to his contemporaries to his predecessors. We can't promise someone will answer, but that should get you closer to getting information regarding the context around him without getting into a special judgment.

flouu	I think dark comedy would definitely work, especially the scenes in the prison itself and the bickering of the prison directorate (and perhaps a montage of other Nazis being released during the 50s?). Maybe it could be a more serious type of thing overall, but with moments of levity interspersed.

1mpdb	An interesting tangent is the Japanese reaction to these foods being brought in. While adults may have understood the scarcity situation and perhaps even appreciated that the occupiers were trying to provide food, did children understand this?  When I lived in Japan, starting in the 1990s, several older Japanese people told me they had been upset / angry that the USA "forced" milk, cheese, and iirc bread on them (instead of giving them rice, I believe) when they were young. No idea if this is a widely held belief, but maybe there is research on the Japanese populous' reactions to these foods?	1642804941.0	htnvjx8	t3_s99rlz	t1_htnejjy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnvjx8/

7sxro	Absolutely. As a general rule, courts/legislatures/monarchs don't like to restrict how people dispose of their private property. It is a fundamental principle of property law that people are free to alienate their property (e.g., sell, lease, mortgage, devise, manumit their property) as they see fit, subject to few restrictions for public policy reasons.   Sure enough, "[s]laves were converted to Islam and frequently manumitted after several years' service, for such manumission counted as a pious act on the part of the slave owner." *Imperial Harem*, loc. 558. And it "is clear [] that women of means upheld the forms of Muslim *noblesse oblige* which required individuals of wealth and status–male and female alike–to contribute to the public welfare by endowing religious foundations, freeing their slaves, or undertaking other forms of charity."

kfhe9	**Content warning: depictions of rape and torture**  The recent book *La campagne d'Egypte* (2018) by historian Jacques-Olivier Boudon includes a chapter detailing the violence and war crimes that took place during the campaign of Egypt. Boudon cites the primary sources - letters et memoirs from French soldiers and civilians who participated in the campaign - that mentions the rape incidents, which are also featured in other recent accounts, notably Strathern, 2009 (that you cite) and Dwyer, 2014.  Some context first: in July 1798, French troops led by general Desaix marched across the desert from Alexandria to Cairo under a scorching heat. They were soon exhausted, suffering (and dying) from thirst and diseases, and found themselves in a guerilla war where they were harassed by enemies in hit-and-run attacks. A few times, terrified soldiers woke up at night believing they were under attack and shot at each other in the dark, killing several of their own and losing horses.   According to several testimonies, several straggling French soldiers and civilians were captured by the Bedouins (or "Arabs"). They were at best ransomed and released (after being mistreated and in some cases raped), at worse mutilated, tortured and killed.    Here's a roundup of the most significant ones (mostly drawn from Boudon):  **The testimonies**  The frankest testimony is found in the diary of Charles Antoine Morand, an officer who served under Desaix and was part of the march to Cairo.  > The Bedouins harassed us the whole way, which was only six miles, and killed several men. They were content to rob others. Others that were captured and taken were splendidly buggered [*enculés*] by the children of Ismail and then sent back; two dragoons of the 20th regiment were submitted to this rude ordeal [dated 2 July 1798]  Morand's testimony is the most direct and credible. This was a personal diary, where he gives the victims' unit, and uses a crude word for the act (rather than an euphemism drawn from classical literature). The word *enculés* would not have been published outside pornographic books. Morand is more precise (and even cruder) in another part of his diary:   > Woe to the unfortunate one who falls into their hands. They strip him and, before giving him death, they satisfy their abominable passion on him. Sometimes, opening the anus with a knife, they seek some horrible pleasure in the bloody wound. Or, inserting a rifle cartridge, they set fire to it before abandoning their victim.  Other members of the expedition also wrote about those incidents.  Diary of gunner Louis-Joseph Bricard:  > The Arabs, fearless with bladed weapons, but afraid of the cannon, did not dare to obstruct the march of our troops. But these brigands, mounted on small fast horses, flitted around the columns, stopped and massacred all those who strayed from them. Several who had been caught by these villains had the good fortune to escape and returned to Alexandria in the most appalling state, having for several days satisfied the cruel passion of these monsters. There was even a French woman who was among them.  Pierre Amédée Jaubert, orientalist and translator for Napoléon, in a letter to General Bruix, dated 9 July 1797:  > The Arabs and Mamelukes treated some of our prisoners as it is said that Socrates treated Alcibiades. One had to die or suffer it: a grenadier was killed. They had only beaten the women they had taken from us.  Captain Rozis, writing to his friend Grivet from Alexandria on 9 September 1798 (letter cited in Larchey, 1866):  > In principle, they [the Arabs, Mamluks, and Bedouins] took very few prisoners, and if any escaped death, they were reserved for their brutal passion.   From another officer, Jean-Gabriel Niello Sargy (memoirs published in 1825):  > We soon recognised how dangerous it was to deviate alone from the march of the columns without being escorted; it was to run the risk of being murdered, or of becoming the victim of an infamous passion very much in vogue in that country, especially on the part of the Bedouin-Arabs. Several of our grenadiers had been killed while resisting their violence; others had succumbed. Several Frenchmen, in the city of Alexandria itself, had been kidnapped at nightfall, and had suffered this dreadful fate.  Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, Napoleon's secretary, tells in his memoirs published in 1830 how Napoleon interrogated one of the victims:  > The next day, a deal was struck with the Arabs for the release of the men they had abducted the day before; they were bought back for a hundred piastres: one of them, who was distinguished from the others by his manners, was summoned by the general-in-chief, who wished to obtain some information about these half-savage hordes. At the first question, how he had been treated, this man burst into tears: "Why are you crying?" He sobbed that he had experienced the treatment so well known in the Orient. "Big fool, you are very sick! You have paid for your imprudence; you should have stayed with your unit. Thank heaven that you are free so cheaply. Come, weep no more, and answer me." The few hours he had spent with the Arabs, and their conduct towards him, had prevented him from making the slightest observation. Nothing could be learned from him.  Bourrienne's memoirs (and memory) were heavily criticized at the time for being full of mistakes (a "fact-checking" book was even published, see A.B., 1830) but this particular story was not among those claimed to be fake by his critics.   The story told by Bourrienne is also found in Alexandre Dumas's memoirs (1863). Dumas's father had been part of campaign of Egypt (he left in March 1799 after coming into conflict with Napoléon). The novelist wrote extensively about his father (who died when he was 4). It is likely than Dumas drew from Bourriennes's account and embellished it, but he may also have been in contact with veterans who knew his legendary father well:  > About ten men were missing. The Bedouins were in the act of beheading their prisoners, and had already accomplished a third of their task, when they learned that there was a hundred piastres reward for each prisoner brought back alive. As men who put business first, and put commerce above all else, they stopped at once, and contented themselves with indulging in another amusement over their prisoners, less cruel, but more extraordinary, in the eyes of the captives, than that which they had at first feared.    >The result was that, when Bonaparte brought these prisoners before him for questioning, he was quite astonished to see them blush, turn away, and stammer like shameful young girls. At last, urged on by the general-in-chief, who, hearing always of the misfortunes that had befallen the captives, wanted absolutely to know what those misfortunes were, an old soldier told him, weeping with anger, that it had happened to him and his companions what would have happened to the angels of the Lord between Sodom and Gomorrah, if they, who had the advantage over our grenadiers of having wings, had not ascended to heaven without losing a moment.    > Imbecile! said Bonaparte, shrugging his shoulders, you are very sick. Come, come, thank heaven that you have been paid off so cheaply, and do not cry any more.  In his memoirs (written before 1823), Captain Charles-François François, a veteran of Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, does not mention the rapes suffered by French soldiers during the march to Cairo, but describes another incident where a group of French employees, soldiers, and bakers were killed in El Khanqah north of Cairo, early August 1798. These people had been tasked with setting up ovens to make bread for the army, but were left behind when French troops had to retreat for a few hours. When the soldiers returned, they found that the villagers had massacred those men:  > The peasants and Arabs, after having sodomised them, cut off their noses, ears, arms, legs, etc., and even their private parts. Those who escaped death after these operations were forced to heat the ovens they had set up and were put into them by these cannibals. On our arrival, I saw these unfortunate victims roasting in an oven.  Like Bourrienne's memoirs, those of François were criticized for their lack of verisimilude and for plagiarizing previous works (Caron, 1904). François seems to be the only source for the El Khanqah atrocities. Another officer, Jacques Miot, who had been in charge of setting up the ovens, barely mentions the incident in his own memoirs, only saying that the villagers of El Khanqah, described as "looking more like ferocious beasts than warriors", assassinated some workers and destroyed the ovens. Miot spends more time describing how he was attacked by his own camel! In his report to his superiors, Captain Malus is equally brief about the incident. He tells that the villagers had assassinated "our bakers and butchers", and only slightly damaged one oven, which could be quickly repaired. However, he also notes that the troops' morale was "badly shaken" and that "the soldiers were loudly expressing their concern", which could be explained by the horrors they discovered when returning to the village (letter of 6 August 1798, cited in La Jonquière, 1899).   It must be noted that other testimonies about the march do not mention rapes at all. This is the case of the memoirs of lieutenant Desvernois, general Belliard, and engineer Martin. Others only talk of abductions: the soldier Lacuée, in a letter to his uncle, mentions the "poor Desna, taken by the Bedouin more than a month ago" (letter cited in Larchey, 1866). An abduction featured in several memoirs is that of an officer named De Nanots (or Denano, or Delanau, allegedly a nephew of scientist Lacépède), made prisoner by the Bedouins and executed after his captors disagreed about who would get the ransom (Desvernois, Martin, Miot).  *-> Part 2*	1642808359.0	hto4dw8	t3_s5b2oe	t3_s5b2oe	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s5b2oe/the_violation_of_napoleons_troops_at_the_hands_of/hto4dw8/
logg879	In general, self identified feminist groups did not have much to say about the video game industry or its methods in these decades. However, the arguments which have dominated feminist criticism about games have existed since at least the era of the NES.  One exception to this general rule was the feminist-spurred protest aganst the selling of Custer’s Revenge by American Multiple Industries. My friend Kate Willaert touches on this point in a [Kotaku article](https://kotaku.com/porno-hustlers-of-the-atari-age-1847622176) on the subject. Groups like Women Against Pornography objected the the portrayals of sexual acts in the game and did legitimately succeed in getting some retailers to not carry it.  Beyond that, in the early 80s there were not many female protagonists but this didn’t seem to bother the majority of female players. I hesitate to give estimates about how much of the arcade playerbase was female, though I’ve seen some numbers. In general though, once both the arcade and home video game crashes hit (these were two different events) games centered around a hardcore audience which was predominantly male, in the child-to-young adult age bracket.  Conventional wisdom in the video game industry became that only those types of players would spend the type of money required to recoup the costs of an arcade cabinet or at retail for cartridge games. The reasons for this lay deep within consumer culture and the position of video games within the toy industry. However it’s a bit beyond my current ability to easily surmise, so just suffice to say that the male demographic became a noted focus when there once had been more marketing directed at general family activity.  While there was some lamentation of the loss of a female player base after no game came to follow up *Pac-Man*, *Frogger*, or *Ms. Pac-Man* in terms of broad appeal, the question of women in games did not become a specific issue again until the success of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo of America was not at all secretive about saying that its target market was 6-12 year old boys, brought about for the reasons of the Crash as stated above as well as their position within the toy market. They were happy for other people to buy their games or for other publishers to have different priorities, but Nintendo did not put any extraordinary effort towards appealing to markets other than the male child.  With the success of the NES came a litany of criticism about the types of players that Nintendo inspired. In what would become a repeated cycle of commentary about video game systems as they reached new heights of success, the major controversies would go as follows:  1. “Nintendo’s turning my kid into a zombie! Are video games making kids obsessed?” 2. “Violence is a major theme in video games and is being marketed to children. Should parents be worried?” 3. “Violent themes dissuade female players! What is the video game industry doing to change it?”  All of these steps are part of the continuum which honestly does repeat itself over and over again with future consoles. The earlier video game consoles had violent themes, but they didn’t have the representation aspect which was achievable on the NES. Atari 2600 cartridges could certainly drive people to obsessive lengths, but NES games challenged people to slog each game to reach an end. A few female characters and protagonists had appeared on the earlier consoles, but now in a world with realized characters which could differ from each other, some commentators noticed that the most popular games only featured female characters and in a periphery role.  You can take what you want from each of these criticisms, but they are all explicitly tied together. It was a social justification for the reaction to the NES and subsequent consoles, as well as a call to the game industry to change their approach to each of these subjects. However, these were not feminist groups advocating for the change. These were generally concerned individuals - likely some whom would identify themselves as feminist - but not a systematized critique on the medium.  The article “Guns and Barbies: Girls take shots at sexist beliefs about Nintendo” from the February 27, 1990 issue of The Baltimore Sun is a good example of this. More than just highlighting girls who played video games as a counter narrative, they place things in social terms.  >“For boys in this country between the ages of 8 and 15, not having a Nintendo is like not having a baseball bat,” says Rick Anguilla, former editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine.   >   >But for many girls a Nintendo is as important to their play as a Barbie doll.  This specific article commented more on the fact that the marketing was missing out on a segment of the population that was, nevertheless, gravitating to Nintendo’s product. The professionals quoted in this piece specifically refute the idea that women were turned off by the violence and were more than driven to compete.  >“The competitiveness is different,” said Kate Fenton, who works on a general pediatric floor. “The girls are just as skilled, but they play on an individual basis, competing with themselves. The boys are more likely to gather around, playing round robin in a group, competing against each other.”  The more persistent note was that of representation. More than one report made passing comments about Mario rescuing Princess Peach, which was a well known point of contention within feminist criticism of fairy tales. Few were going to the lengths of calling Nintendo outright sexist, but concern was being shared about the absence of females in protagonist positions.  Some companies, though, saw the market deficiency and took it as an opportunity.  >The development of entertainment software like “Little Mermaid” and “Barbie” \[for the NES\] is part of a larger trend in the video game business toward what’s known as “niche marketing,” or marketing for a specific group whose interests are different from that of the mass audience.  This need for representation was not universally shared among female players though.Not that the sparsity of female protagonists seems to bother most girls.  >“I don’t care what it is running around on that screen,” said Rosetta \[Moore, 10\], voicing a sentiment that girls seem to share. “I’m the one that’s playing it."  This isn’t easy to quantify. Again it’s part of the greater question of how media and marketing might fit into general society.  The harsher criticism accelerated at a crucial moment of change for the video game industry. As the era of the Genesis and Super Nintendo took off, games started to portray more realistic situations. The characters stopped being purely cartoon-like - to the American eye - and the violence stopped being quaint. The desires of game creators to take on the same style as Hollywood brought in complaints that the interactive nature of this media made it extra harmful to portray certain actions or ideas.  Charges of adverse effects on women in particular were not far behind. This scathing opinion piece on the question in the September 18, 1992 issue of the Sacramento Bee should be perfectly familiar to those familiar with feminist criticism of games today.  >“They’re horrendous,” says Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children’s Television. “It doesn’t take a lot of research to see that the images of women in these games are really negative.”   >   >“They perpetuate myths that women are helpless, need men to rescue them, or are ruthless in business,” says Charren, whose group promotes quality TV programming for children and who has studied video games as well.  Again, the lens of these quotes is not as part of explicitly feminist media but rather the greater movement of encouraging media to support what they saw as positive messages to young children. The organizations and people commenting on the industry came from a background of psychological study rather than an explicitly political standpoint. They pushed for regulation of content in games the same way that children’s television content had been regulated.	1642808528.0	hto4t1m	t3_s70fq3	t3_s70fq3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s70fq3/during_the_80s_and_90s_what_was_the_general/hto4t1m/

kfhe9	**Conclusion and additional remarks**  So, were French soldiers and civilians raped by Bedouins during the march to Cairo in July 1798 and in other occasions during the campaign of Egypt? To my knowledge, there is no direct evidence of these events, such as medical records: there is no mention of this in the memoir of Dr Larrey, the army's chief surgeon, who otherwise talks a lot about the health (of lack thereof) of soldiers's testicles. Still, it is very likely that the answer is yes. The testimonies of Morand and Bourrienne were based on their notes taken at the time. One notable aspect is that they are both quite accusatory against the victims, described as careless stragglers who basically "asked for it". There is little empathy directed towards the soldiers. While the Arabs/Bedouins/Turks/Mameluks are called half-savages and ferocious beasts by nearly everyone, the focus remains on those girly Frenchmen who got "splendidly buggered" (really) and could not stop weeping after that. Bourrienne's account shows a man suffering from serious PTSD and being mocked for it by his commander-in-chief. This is hardly something that shows the French army - and French soldiers - in a good light, so the propaganda aspect seems minimal. There are inconsistencies in the testimonies, about how many men were raped, and whether women were also raped, but one can guess that such sensitive, "shameful" stories circulated by word of mouth among the soldiers and civilians who took part in the campaign, with details being added, removed, embellished, or worsened.   I'm less convinced by François' account of the rapes and executions at El Khanqah, but it is possible that this actually happened but was less publicized, since in that case the victims were not mindless stragglers, but people had been literally left behind and were slaughtered as a result.   In any case, the campaign of Egypt was brutal, and those rapes should be put in a context of extreme violence, which was unsettling even to the many veteran soldiers in the army, causing some to desert or to commit suicide. As some men wrote in their letters, it was "worse than Vendée": the counter-revolution war in the Vendée in 1793-1796 had been particularly gruesome, with mass massacres of civilians and soldiers carried out by Republican and Royalist troops. Egypt was another level of awful.  Napoléon's promises regarding Egypt - that Egyptians would greet the French as liberators, and that French soldiers would find riches in Alexandria and Cairo - were unfulfilled. But the Republican soldiers, rather than bringing Revolutionary-style freedom to the Egyptians, found themselves in a merciless war where they were both perpetrators and victims of atrocities. In their reports and in private letters, soldiers and officers told about the horrors brought upon them - tortures, mutilations, and rape - and about those they committed themselves: the pillaging and burning of entire villages, the abduction and rape of women, and the mass killing of civilians. Captain Charles-François François describes one of these operations:  > We killed about 900 men, not including the women and children who remained in their houses, which we set on fire with our musketry and artillery [...]. Before leaving this village, we finished burning the remains of the houses or rather the huts in order to give a terrible example to this half-savage and barbaric people.  Napoléon quickly forgot about his initial pledge of respecting the local populations, their traditions, their women, and their livelihoods. He himself proudly wrote to his generals how he had "five to six heads" cut every day and then paraded through the streets of Cairo. When general Kebler was assassinated in June 1800 by a Syrian student, the latter had his hand burned and he was executed by impalement in the presence of French officers (Dr Larrey collected the corpse for examination).  The male-on-male rape issue must also be put in the context of the perception of homosexual relationships in the 18th century. In the Ancien Régime, (male) homosexuality was, with bestiality, an unspeakable "crime against nature" (and thus often spoken of in Latin) that was punishable by death at the stake. This had happened for the last time as recently as 1750, when Bruno Lenoir and Jean Diot were strangled and burned in the Place de Greve, after a watchman had spotted them having sex in the rue Montorgueil. In 1791, the Constituent Assembly had omitted "sodomy" from the Penal Code, making it *de facto* legal. Still, men who engaged same-sex relations could be fined or sentenced to jail if it was found that they committed a "public offense against decency". So, though tolerated officially, homosexuality remained extremely taboo and shameful. Of course, in the case of the soldiers in the story, we are talking about rape, not homosexuality, but it certainly looks from the testimonies that the victims were shamed for having "participated" in such acts and for not having chosen death instead (Sibalis, 2001).  Another related bit of context is the perception in the West of men in the "Orient" as being naturally "sodomites" (see Bleys, 1996). The philosopher and orientalist traveller Volney had published in 1787 an influential book about his travels in Egypt and Syria. Here is what he wrote about the Mamluks, the knightly military class of Egypt:  > They are especially given to that disgraceful kind which has always been the vice of the Greeks and the Tartars; it is the first lesson they receive from their master of arms. One does not know how to explain this taste, when one considers that they all have women, unless one supposes that they seek in one sex the piquancy of the refusals of which they have deprived the other; but it is no less true that there is not a single Mamluk without a stain; and their contagion has depraved the inhabitants of Kaire, even the Christians of Syria who remain there.  So not only the Mamluks were naturally depraved, but they "contaminated" the other inhabitants of the country!   Another French traveller, naturalist Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt, published in 1798 his own travel book about Egypt. Between considerations about gerbil anatomy and the preparation of coffee, he offered the following assessment of the sexual orientation of Egyptian men, this time described - all of them - as bisexuals with a preference for men.  > The inconceivable taste which disgraced the Greeks and Persians of antiquity, is the delight, or rather, the infamy of the Egyptians. It is not for women that their amorous songs are composed, it is not to them that they lavish tender caresses; other objects inflame them. Voluptuousness, for them, is no longer amiable, and their transports are no more than the convulsions of brutality. Such depravity, which, to the shame of civilised nations, is not foreign to them, is generally widespread in Egypt: the rich, as well as the poor, are infected with it; contrary to the effect that it produces in less warm climates, that of being exclusive, it is combined there with an inclination for women.  This particular strand of orientalism certainly informed the already unpleasant perception of the local populations by the French soldiers, and did inform the (later) colonial view of North African populations. Almost one century later, doctor Adolphe Kocher wrote in his treaty about criminality among Arabs in Algeria that "like all Oriental people, the Arab is a sodomite" (Kocher, 1884; Gouriou, 2010).  *-> Sources*	1642809084.0	hto67eo	t3_s5b2oe	t1_hto4dw8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s5b2oe/the_violation_of_napoleons_troops_at_the_hands_of/hto67eo/

logg879	This was one of the driving factors behind the famous [December 1993 Senate Hearings](https://www.filfre.net/2021/04/the-ratings-game-part-2-the-hearing/) on video game violence. The panel which was to oppose the video game industry was composed of people who were part of the regulating media movement. While the majority of focus was on the details of gory portrayals of violence (in the case of *Mortal Kombat*) and violence against women (see: *Night Trap*) there was also a strong tenor of opposition against general portrayals of women within these games.  Marilyn Droz, part of the National Coalition Against Television Violence, struck a moralistic tone when she opened her statement with “Shame on you!” directed at the video game manufacturers. Eugene Provenzo, author of the psychological study on video games *Video Kids: Making Sense of Nintendo*, also brought up the issue of gendered division.  >During the past decade, the videogame industry has developed games whose social content has been overwhelmingly violent, sexist, and racist, issues that I’ve addressed extensively in my research. For example, in Video Kids I explored the 47 most popular videogames in America. I found that 40 had violence as their main theme, and thirteen included scenarios in which women were kidnapped and had to be rescued — i.e., the idea of women as victims. Although men were often rescued in games too, they were never rescued by women. Videogames have a marked tradition of extreme violence which is also combined with gender discrimination.  (I must note that Provenzo has received a great [deal of criticism](http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2012/03/book-review-video-kids-making-sense-of.html) both in how he classifies violence and the conclusions he draws psychologically, based on his very limited data set.)  Ultimately the question of the particular effects of video games on women would be sidelined to the greater goal of indicating violent content. Not long after this hearing, the breakthrough in CD-ROM multimedia also created an opportunity for niche markets to find a broader audience. This had been difficult in the days of extreme expense at retail dealing in cartridges and floppy disks, but CD-ROM technology broadened the horizons of games that could be developed.  The November 10, 1994 issue of The News-Messenger shows an early glimpse into this market, highlighting products like King’s Quest VII, Hawaii High, and Hello Kitty interactive CD-ROM products. The breakthrough in this area though would be Barbie Fashion Designer in 1996. It became one of the biggest software products of the year and became a signal for what’s been titled the “Games for Girls movement”.  With a defined market segment that appealed directly to a female audience, much of the criticism would fall away for a while. There were certainly some concerns about popular female protagonists like Lara Croft and her conventionally attractive looks but in general the critics had received what they desired. It would only be with the broader mainstreaming of video games after the PlayStation 2 that there would be a unified commentary on female audiences and protagonists, this time under a more explicitly feminist lens.  \------  **Women in the Industry**  While we’re here in the games-for-girls movement though, it is worth discussing the other side of the coin here. Not the public reaction to video games in a feminist lens, but the role of women within the creative process of the industry through that perspective.  Women were not absent from the late 70s and early 80s period of video games. Notable programmers and designers like [Carol Shaw](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,52278/), [Roberta Williams](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,60/), and [Carla Meninsky](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,104056/) were present alongside those in supporting roles like [Connie Goldman](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,94538/), [Junko Ozawa](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,186082/), and [Anne Westfall](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,241/). Within executive positions, women were found most in marketing at video game companies. The early profile “[Welcome to the club](https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US/page/n50/)” in the March 1983 issue of *Video Games* covers this subject rather neatly.  It was true though that basically no video game companies were owned by women, nor did women tend to have particularly long careers as center stage game creators. Not many people did, but while there were plenty of male outliers, Roberta Williams was basically the only female one. Many factors can be attributed to this, but the world reacts to the trends rather than the reasons.  Several female-lead studios emerged after this period specifically to challenge that notion and capture the game audience for girls. Probably the first created to this end was [Rhiannon Software](https://www.mobygames.com/company/rhiannon-software), founded by Elizabeth Stott and Lucy Ewell. They created games specifically tailored to the female audience exclusively, a series of graphical Adventure games focused on puzzle solving.  In a 1985 article, they stated a more direct intention for their business model.  >“We’re clearly feminist,” Ms. Stott said. “It’s just that people misinterpret what that means. There’s this remedial effort needed. We’re going for the girls.”  Rhiannon Software saw it as their mission to get girls interested in computers to expand their career paths. A bit ironically, they didn’t credit their programmers, though that was the norm back in the day. It’s uncertain if they managed to put out their [initial four game set](https://twitter.com/katewillaert/status/1397942040114122754) commercially and the company collapsed before it got very far.  As stated above, some felt that the feminine influence was needed if games were to ever have proper representation. It was not enough to rely on the portrayals by men which they felt were almost universally problematic. To these critics, the lack of women in the sphere was keeping more women from entering computing. To the defendants, they were doing nothing unusual as far as the broader cultural values were concerned.  >\[Perrin\] Kaplan \[of Nintendo\] adds that most of the games were developed for that target audience of 8- to 15-year-old boys. “I don’t think anybody said, ‘Let’s make a sexist game.’ The ideas and the creation of the programs come from the designer.”   >   >That’s the point, says \[Stevanne\] Auberbach \[director of the Institute for Childhood Resources\]. “Why have they decided to ignore the girls? It goes back to who has the programming jobs that create the programs. Men. If more women were creating the programs… we would see more of a balance in the number of games for girls and more positive roles for girls. But traditionally, girls don’t go into programming because they’ve also been told they’re not good with computers. Because they’re not really given the same amount of exposure to computers as the boys. It’s a chicken and the egg thing.”   >   >The sexist stereotypes in the video games only reflect our culture, says \[Christopher\] Geist \[professor of pop culture at Bowling Green State University\].   >   >“We’ve always blamed the latest trend for promoting the wrong values,” says Geist. “In the ‘50s it was the comic books, now it’s video games… I’m not saying I approve, but you can’t blame video games for creating a cultural pattern which suggests women are weak. That has been part of our Western culture for a long time.”  How strong each of these takes can be evaluated again relies on bigger questions than can be answered here. The 1994 report actually says something rather interesting about how the quality of games can affect young girls’ perception towards computers.  >“If little girls don’t like a game on the computer, they aren’t going to say it’s the game they don’t like. They’ll say computers are ‘yucky.’ To them, the game and the computer are the same,” says Lucinda Finley, a professor of gender law at State University of New York, Buffalo.   >   >“This is part of the concern, given the increasing importance of computers to education and society and careers.”  I have no idea how true this is or what sort of data she was going off. What this should clearly demonstrate is that the questions have been tackled in rather nuanced ways even from this early period. Understanding the types of games that women like to play and their reactions to technology within the societal framework has shaped the conversation in the years since that moment.  The final case study to look at is HeR Interactive, the noted leader in the games for girls movement that still exists today. It was originally a subsidiary of the multimedia-focused arcade company American Laser Games, which gave them a head start on CD-ROM technology when it came to PCs. With such a strong focus on the female market, they were one of the first companies to properly identify the encroaching “casual” gaming market which would explode with the dawning of the internet. Games which could run on low powered PCs, could be engaged with on and off over many sessions, and didn’t apply intense pressure on its players like action games.  With the wave of PCs entering the homes of those not attuned to technology in the mid-90s, games which could appeal to this market had a massive “in” with the female sector as well. Their best known and best selling products have been the Nancy Drew-licensed “hidden object” style point-and-click adventures. The games found a massive appeal with that casual female audience and have continued to sustain them ever since, despite some rocky moments in their history.	1642809326.0	hto6syh	t3_s70fq3	t1_hto4t1m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s70fq3/during_the_80s_and_90s_what_was_the_general/hto6syh/

logg879	**Conclusions:**  Feminist criticism towards the content and creation of video games is not new, though it grew out of talking points not explicitly tied to feminist movements. Media critique, lobbying groups, psychologists, and marketing agents have long pointed out the distinct differences between the representation of men and women in the video game sphere. It grew out of larger social movements related to the regulation of content within media for what they felt was a positive effect on society. Sex-related criticism was only one piece of the larger puzzle in larger movement tackling video games as a medium and its social implications.  This subject is definitely interesting to me, but I feel it really does need to be approached from the standpoint of scientific data in order to be properly accessed. In the United States, we as a society have settled on a very light hand on regulating mass media content as a tool for bettering society. Other countries have placed their governments in a more active role on this front. Of course I don’t really have a great enough understanding of feminist movements in other countries or language skill to tackle this question in places other than the United States.  Certainly the gaming landscape has been enriched by the presence of female creators, but is it because they bring a distinctly different sensibility to male creators? Are the 80s and 90s so lacking in general diversity of content and situation as we accept as common wisdom? Has the games for girls movement as a distinct market been a positive benefit to the development of gaming as a whole? What about the changes in artistic design in the hopes to appeal to broader audiences?  These are questions we get left with when attempting to sum up the legacy of gender divides within the video game medium. I intend to tackle this in broader terms in the future, but thanks for asking the question! It was a nice way to collect together my resources on this.  &#x200B;  Speaking of!  Sources:  Ballou, E.

I didn't know lip reading was that limited even among those who do it well. If that's the case, you're right, it probably wasn't ever something that was a big part of watching silent films.  I also did some more poking around in this sub since I asked that question and found this thread and the one it links to very interesting: [Did people talk through silent films (when shown in theatres)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7o30ir/did_people_talk_through_silent_films_when_shown/).  It mentions that (1) silent films weren't all that silent; (2) the philosophy of watching film was different, i.e. people came in and out as they pleased even in the middle of a film and cared more about the experience than following every element of the plot.	1642810795.0	htoaf3w	t3_s7gfn4	t1_htgjbgg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7gfn4/was_lip_reading_part_of_the_silent_filmwatching/htoaf3w/
gw25ofvm	This entirely depends on who you ask. Most modern scholars will not deny that Alexander had some form of relationship with Hephaestion, the extent and exact nature of that relationship is debated; older scholars such as Tarn 1948 often argued that any suggestion of Alexander's homosexuality had been invented and/or exaggerated in irder to portray Alexanderas "something less than a man", this view has been largely outgrown in the academic commimity but certainly seems to persist in the general public if the popular reviews of Stone's 2004 film are to be believed. Bosworth 2012 (in Worthington) outright calls Hephaestion Alexander's "lifelong friend, lover, and second in command"; Green 1991 is more ambiguous, reffering to Hephaestion as "his (Alexander's) inseperable companion". I assume the film you are referring to is Stone's 2004 film which portrays Hephaestion and Alexander as having "the most powerful emotional bond" (Baynham 2009 in Heckel and Tritle); Stone himself aslo stated that there initially was "some Bagoas stuff that we trimmed" (from the original cut of the film) which was removed to focus on "the more important relationship with Hephaestion".  Multiple scholars also highlight the Homeric parallels between Alexander and Hephaestion, and Achilles and Patroklos (Briant 2018, Green 1991, Ogden 2009, Heckel 1992, O'brien 1992, Wilcken 1932, Arrian). Alexander undoubtedly had a relationship with Alexander, it may have been mostly emotional, but it was there.   As to his relationships with females, he certainly had at least one sone so he did have a sexual relationship with at least one woman. He may well have been bisexual, although, there is some suggestion that he may have been indifferent to women and simply fulfilling his duty to produce an heir: this is shown in how late in his life he eventually produced an heir. O'brien 1992 recalls Alexander's apparant refusal "to take advantage of any tens of thousands of women" and that his "unconventional behaviour in the presence of women" has fuelled the debate over Alexander's sexuality. Carney 2009 (in Heckel and Tritle) suggests that Olympias and Philip II shared a "parental concern, Alexander's sexuality"; Green 1991 highlights Roxanne's pregnancy as "in the last year of his (Alexander's) life, after Hephaestion's death" the implication being that Alexander and Roxanne only shared a sexual relationship after Hephaestion's death. This suggestion is possibly supported by Philip II's exile of many of Alexander's inner circle, with the sole exception of Hephaestion, this is also referenced in Stone's 2004 film.	1642811299.0	htobntq	t3_plagoc	t3_plagoc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/plagoc/alexander_the_great/htobntq/

nt6eu	Slavery did not last until the Cuban Revolution. It was legally abolished in the 1880s and had long since been ended in all forms by the 1950s.  &#x200B;  Rural laborers were still exploited in various ways, of course, such as the colono system where big sugar cane mills would charge low prices for sugar from smallholders and sharecroppers, but this was different from slavery.   &#x200B;  I am guessing that the misconception here comes from the meme online that 'lol you are just mad that Fidel expropriated your family's slave plantation'. The meme started as an overstatement and I think that while the creators knew it was half jokingly calling large landholders slave owners, I don't think a lot of the people who come across those memes in the wild always get that it's meant to be partially joking. At most I've seen people defend it as 'wage slavery', but that is different from just calling it 'slavery' since normally that implies \*chattel slavery\*.  &#x200B;  It is true that the first big wave of post-1959 Cuban immigration was made up largely of middle class and wealthy Cubans, including many big landowners, but they were not slave owners.  &#x200B;  For a summary history of Cuban immigration to the US, you can read Felix Masud-Piloto's \*From Welcomed Exiles to Illegal Immigrants: Cuban Migration to the U.S., 1959-1995\*. For a broader history of the Cuban Revolution that covers this kind of thing, check out Aviva Chomsky's \*A History of the Cuban Revolution\*. I'm also more than happy to make even more specialized bibliography recommendations but for the purposes of this specific question I don't think it's necessary because the idea that slavery survived into the 1950s is patently false.	1642812830.0	htofebo	t3_s7bj7c	t3_s7bj7c	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7bj7c/why_did_it_take_as_long_as_the_cuban_revolution/htofebo/

653zd	This was a great answer! The few Marxists I know IRL had always led me to believe historical materialism was wholly discredited, so I’ll have to look into some of those sources.  Also, I hope this question isn’t too far afield, but would you recommend *The Making of the English Working Class* to someone looking for a broad introduction to early 19th-century British leftism, or is there a more recent book along similar lines that I should read instead? It’s been on my reading list for a long time, but I somehow never realized it was as old as it was. If it matters, I’m not a historian or coming from an academic background, but am comfortable reading denser/less accessible books as well as stuff written for the general public.	1642813568.0	htoh66g	t3_s8nnvk	t1_htka2ao	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htoh66g/

izvvt	*The making of the English working class* is usually required reading for a lot of historiography classes for first or second-year graduate history students. It's a bit of a tome and is quite dense, but as you said, if that's not something that bothers you, I'd give it a read. It's considered a pretty integral part of Marxist historiography and Thompson makes a strong argument, in my opinion, about how class formation is not just some sporadic thing that happens when certain economic conditions are met but instead, class consciousness is something that people form themselves and that elements of human relationships with one's own class are incredibly important.   Labor relations in England is not my field so I can't really recommend anything specific, but Thompsons' work is still referenced by a lot of Marxist and Non-Marxists historians.  I would say there are few pure historical materialists historians, but Marxism and its theories for history have evolved a lot over the past 60 years and that brings in a lot of mixing Marxist theories with other forms of historiography. I would recommend the Joan Scott book in my answer to anyone, even non-gender historians because it's incredibly powerful at showing the history and analytical structures of gender history and how it can be combined with other theories as well.	1642815292.0	htolbmh	t3_s8nnvk	t1_htoh66g	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htolbmh/

8ea0h	So there are a few things to break down here. First with the Manhattan project it is impossible to uncouple it from the economy. The cost of the Nuclear project was on par with the cost of all small arms material not including ammunition by the US in WW2. Such a program is incredibly challenging to undertake without a strong economy. Also timing is important. By the time the fruits of the Manhattan project were deployed the war in Europe had been won and the outcome of the war in the pacific was no longer in doubt. The  All that was left was a question of how long the war would go on and how its length would affect the post war geopolitics as well as total casualties. As far as casualties u/restricteddata put together a pretty complete answer here [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q6cmsw/the\_estimated\_american\_casualties\_for\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q6cmsw/the_estimated_american_casualties_for_the/).  &#x200B;  That leaves the code talkers which is a lot harder to quantify. Would the lack of code talkers have meant the US and allies lost WW2? Highly unlikely. There were only around 400 code talkers by the end of the war so many messages were still transmitted in other codes and languages yet operations without the code talkers still managed to succeed in their objectives. Yet the personnel anecdotes of those who served with them were very flattering of the code talkers. The signal officer of the 5th Marine division was quoted saying “Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.” Of course you have to take into account that this is an individual whos primary mission and focus is around communications and keeping them secure so his view of the code talkers is going to be influenced by that.  &#x200B;  So long story short, yes the economy was most likely more important then the code talkers and was for sure both essential to and overall more important then the Manhattan project.	1642815546.0	htolx1m	t3_s9olx6	t3_s9olx6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9olx6/did_new_mexico_play_a_crucial_role_in_the_outcome/htolx1m/

9c89xxn	To me, the examples you offered seem more illustrative of a lack of science, not the history of science. Anyone who's been in a rainfall knows that particles a lot bigger than 5 microns can travel farther than 6 feet. Perhaps the issue had been politicized already, as the WHO was at many points during COVID. Enforcing separation of over 6 feet essentially means shutting down all businesses and other establishments, which carries severe economic impact. Not to mention logistic problems such as how will people eat if grocery stores are closed.  It may have been policy issued from higher up in the organization to recommend 6 feet, which the folks lower down had to repeat. Or perhaps it was a more complicated issue, like "sure, particles bigger than 5 microns can travel that far, but those bigger particles will be trapped by the mask we're also asking people to wear, so it's the small ones that pass through makeshift masks that are the bigger concern." Or maybe "of course 6 feet of separation don't stop transmission, but our epidemiologists calculated that they will decrease transmission by this percentage and bring the R value down to more manageable levels." Bureaucracies have many levels of obfuscation, some of which are even well-intentioned in their own opinion. Of course, I am opposed to all levels of obfuscation because lies and half-truths eventually get discovered and lead to loss of credibility. Not to mention, the public isn't as stupid as some bureaucrats think, and can often make sense of complex information without the need to oversimplify it.  Returning to the topic, as I said, I am totally in favor of teaching the history of science. The question addressed the narrower point of teaching it in science classes. Or even narrower, where I explained in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htlfhc1/) that it was to a particular formulation of what teaching it involves.  I do agree that science needs to be more widely disseminated, which (besides science class at school) is usually done through popular books, documentaries, science journalism. I totally support all those endeavors; I've written a few science articles for the general public myself.	1642817587.0	htoqr0x	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htnjvbq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htoqr0x/

bkb37	I immediately thought of the Russian Revolution as well, and hopefully in a way that accurately captures the process of bureaucratization. The last thing I want is another *Trotsky* miniseries. I want a complex, embattled, hard-nosed and rhetorically ruthless but also kind and cheerful Lenin, you know, a gray blur efficient bureaucrat Stalin, and i want to see them slowly and anguishedly coming to the belief that they need to centralize the party and raise production and then institute the NEP to save the revolution. And if we're talking unlimited budget, I want the Red Army capturing Ungern-Sternberg in a thousand-yurt city in the middle of the most vast Mongolian grassland you can imagine, thousands of soldiers charging through a snowstorm across the Gulf of Finland towards Kronstadt, and a NEP-era jazz scene to rival Babylon Berlin.	1642818320.0	htoshlx	t3_s9bcte	t1_htmgadd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htoshlx/
4qz6gnsm	I can tell you to begin with that the question is going to be impossible to answer for a couple of reasons.  The first is that there is no existing record of the inception of any language from scratch.  The vast majority of evidence for Proto Indo European for example is lexical in nature rather than grammatical on a discourse scale because it is all extrapolated from a variety of different modern languages rather than having a primary source we can refer to.  The best we’ve got is that PIE was very likely to be inflectional and probably had a default Subject-Object-Verb word order.  Probably.  The second is because ‘complex’ in terms of comparing one language to another is kind of a vague notion.  Within a single language we talk about certain things being ‘marked’ as a kind of way to distinguish between what is basic and what is more complex, but that doesn’t really work cross linguistically.  For example, Japanese has a rather unusual alignment split from a typologically common nominative/accusative system to a less common direct/inverse system for their give/receive verbs.  This is notoriously difficult for new learners of the language and could be considered ‘complex’, but native speakers have no issue with it and it is productive and usable in every day life.  English speakers think it’s weird and complex; Japanese speakers think it’s just normal.    So that means that English uses a more simple system for expressing those same concepts right?  Well…no.  English has its own mess regarding primary and secondary objects and more vs. less marked structures.  For example, why can I say both “I gave a present to him” and “I gave him a present.”?  What is the difference on a functional level and which is more complex or basic?  Why am I not saying “I gave a present him” or “I gave to him a present”?  Why is that little ‘to’ so meaningful one way or the other?  It can be difficult for non-native speakers to master, but a native speaker might not even think about it because it feels so simple that it isn’t even noticeable to them.  Japanese doesn’t have this kind of distinction at all, so I’m that sense is less ‘complex.’  What I’m trying to explain, perhaps poorly, is that relative “complexity” of a language isn’t really a measurable thing, even when comparing a language to older versions of itself.  Each linguistic feature is connected to all others within the language and can’t be singled out and analyzed in a vacuum.  Language change over time is driven by the opposing forces of distinctiveness vs ease.  Humans are lazy, so they want to pronounce words as easily as they can and use as few words arranged as simply as possible as they can get away with, but at the same time they want to be unambiguously understood.  ‘Complexity’ typically comes from a need to disambiguate or create contrast.  This is one of the things that drives language change over time, so languages often trend towards simplicity via weird routes that create new complexity.  “Today’s morphology is yesterday’s syntax” is a fun quote I remember hearing a long time ago.  To give a current example, English has what is basically a syntactic future tense marker in the words “going to”, for example “I’m going to do this.”  Because we’re lazy, we often slur this into “I’m gunna do this” and everyone understands us.  But if “gunna” is just “going to” slurred together, why can’t you say “I’m gunna the store”?  This is grammaticalization and language change happening in front of us as “gunna” is splitting off from “going to” and becoming its own distinct form.  English currently has no future tense affix, but I have high hopes that hundreds of years from now we will be sticking the na- of “gunna” onto the beginnings of verbs to indicate future intent.  Or maybe it will die off.  No way to know right now.  I think I’ve gone way into left field about linguistics on a history sub, and my apologies for that.  My only defense of myself is that historical linguistics is my favorite linguistics, and language change over time is fascinating.  I would recommend reading more about the field of historical syntax and grammaticalization if this sounds interesting.  Thom Givon’s ‘Syntax’ and ‘Functionalism and Grammar’ are old favorites of mine that touch on the subject while also providing a much broader context for understanding it.  Some of the more focused literature might be a little obtuse without that context.  If you’re interested in the history of change over time in English (and English is the most absurd mutt of a language so there’s a lot to this) ‘A History of the English Language’ by Albert Baugh is good and maybe more in line with the spirit of this sub.  I am afraid I don’t have a recommendation for any literature that discusses the history of the discovery and development of our understanding of Proto Indo European from around the 1650’s when the idea of a common ancestor to a lot of languages first started appearing through modern times- if anyone does have such a recommendation I would be interested in reading it.	1642818344.0	htosjlf	t3_s9pspb	t3_s9pspb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9pspb/languages_seem_to_have_been_much_more_complex/htosjlf/

fz8r3	There was for about 15 years.  You can see [a couple answers to a related previous question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8tstbi/why_has_america_decided_youre_old_enough_to_vote/) on this by /u/BlossumButtDixie and /u/needledknitter which runs through the basic overview here.  In short, many states lowered the drinking age to 18 in concert with the 26th Amendment, road fatalities rose substantially in the 16-20 age bracket over the next decade, and a successful lobbying effort in the early 1980s prompted federal legislation to 'suggest' to states to raise it back by cutting off highway funds if they didn't.  South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two holdouts that finally folded in 1988; both did so extremely reluctantly but given the massive amount of their budgets that they'd lose they had no choice, which was the intention of the legislation.  For once, I'll make the rare choice to use three Wikipedia maps to illustrate the progression since they're vastly easier to see exactly how this worked (and since it's Friday and I really need a drink myself, also vastly easier than copying tables and formatting them for reddit.)  Here's [1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state#/media/File:Legal_drinking_age_in_1969.png), [1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state#/media/File:Legal_drinking_age_in_1975.png), and [1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state#/media/File:Legal_drinking_age_in_1983.png).  Note the West Coast being at 21 through all of this; this had a bit to do with both leftover alliances between the Progressive and Prohibition movements - one of my favorite pre-18th Amendment laws by the states was an 1873 one creating a 2 mile dry zone around UC Berkeley, which apparently worked well enough so it was expanded to other institutions of higher education - as well as concern over drinking off military bases by very junior enlisted that had to do with their experiences of World War II, like the [Zoot Suit Riots](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qo2gbr/during_school_i_was_taught_that_the_us_saw_world/hjvwvbd/).  While the lead up to Prohibition and then (more relevant to this question) its repeal created a whole state-by-state patchwork of changes to the drinking age as a whole and is more of a top level question, [this is a useful gif](https://vinepair.com/features/external/minimum-drinking-age-map.gif) that gives an overview of year by year changes since 1933.  A few interesting things from it: Oklahoma didn't allow hard liquor sales until 1959 for anyone (discriminatory policies against Native Americans played a huge role in this - they were legally barred from drinking off reservation until after World War II), Kansas didn't repeal Prohibition until 1949 (the Anti-Saloon League had strong support in it long before Prohibition - Charles Curtis made his early career enforcing state Prohibition laws as early as the 1880s) and Mississippi didn't repeal Prohibition until 1966, although that had far more to do with being able to selectively enforce it against African Americans as a Jim Crow law than not allowing Whites to drink.  Also a top level question is the whole history of the 26th Amendment; I've written very briefly on it before, but its history really dates back all the way to the late 1800s when Republicans started initiating voter registration laws to suppress Democratic turnout in the North, Midwest, and West; as such, it had a very different origin and supporters than Prohibition.  What changed in the late 1960s was both the the moral argument about the disenfranchisement of servicemembers in Vietnam as well as a belief by both parties that the very loud political activities by young Boomers would translate into electoral gains for their own party if they were just allowed to vote.  As it turned out, the latter belief was dramatically disproved over the years as the 18-25 cohort has been at a historically significant turnout deficit to other age groups.  It is probably fair to view some of the lowering of drinking ages following its adoption as political calculus to try to appeal to that hard-to-reach demographic, but unfortunately off the top of my head I don't know any sources that cover lobbying efforts and the history of the drinking age legislation introduced in the early 1970s that would provide good evidence of this.	1642819070.0	htou9va	t3_s9iuqi	t3_s9iuqi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9iuqi/the_us_lowered_the_federal_voting_age_to_18_in/htou9va/

3ovw7qc2	Russia permanently occupied eastern Europe after WWII, the west did not approve of this as these countries had always been free nations before WWII. This is what basically immideatly fired off the cold war, some would say the cold war already started before Berlin was even occupied with both armies rushing to be the first to capture it.   Ukraine is different having a lot of common history with Russia and having been part of the Russian empire prior to WWII. Ukrainians were nicknamed "little Russians" by Russia. That is not to say Russia and Ukraine were real buddies, as there were several instances where Ukraine tried to become independent.  Russia did a lot to supress Ukrainian culture+ language and of course there was also holodomor which did not help their relationship.   I think the only thing that both instances have in common is that the west feels countries should be able to pick their own destiny and that the west worries that Russia will once again try to dominate (parts of) eastern Europe trough hard and soft power.	1642820640.0	htoxzpp	t3_s9rjmb	t3_s9rjmb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9rjmb/how_does_the_current_situation_with_russia/htoxzpp/
9c89xxn	>The Wired article I linked is a good read. It answers this question and all of your hypotheticals.  I did read the article, and found no answers.  >it's about a woman who was already researching the 100 micron misconception a decade before COVID and her difficulties in convincing other scientists  On the contrary, it says she had no difficulties convincing other scientists, **until COVID**. It says that (a different branch of) WHO had no problem accepting that big particles hang around much longer, they had been accepting it for 20 years, but a different part of the WHO objected when the same argument was applied to COVID.  The article is a bit more ambiguous on other points, such as whether the person who was rude to her was actually a medical scientist. They use the generic term "experts", but WHO has "experts" from many fields, some unrelated to medicine or science. It's also non-specific about which medical textbooks she read that claim aerosol transmission doesn't occur via droplets bigger than 5 microns, because I looked up a couple of my textbooks on infectious diseases, and they don't make that claim at all.  Regardless, none of this relates to my objections. I am in favor of teaching more science, I am in favor of teaching more history of science. My initial comment was simply the observation that these are two different fields, and an expert in one is very likely not knowledgeable about the other. Furthermore, the focus in science class is to trace the evolution of a scientific idea, so any history they provide tends to be related to that rather than to its societal impact.  This would have been the end of it, because that's all I really had to say on the topic, but the discussion continued when I got the response "that legendary scientist whose theory you just learned published a bunch of shitty papers", because it doesn't seem relevant to science, it's more a "your idol has feet of clay" or "everyone's an asshole" kind of statement; saying more about the speaker than the science. From the science perspective, were those papers really "shitty", and if so, in what way?  As you say, it's unfortunate that the conversation has strayed into other areas, but that's how free-form discussions go, without a buzzer reminding us when we stray. I'll desist, I've already said pretty much what I wanted to say on the topic, anything else should probably involve a different forum since we seem to be abusing this one.	1642820928.0	htoyo3f	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htot94m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htoyo3f/

8brve	Just a note — crediting New Mexico with the entire Manhattan Project is no more justified than crediting Washington State, or California, or Tennessee, with it. Many states made huge contributions to the project. The New Mexico component was substantial, but it is not necessarily "important" in the sense that if it had not taken place in New Mexico, it wouldn't have taken place elsewhere. There had been alternative sites considered for Los Alamos, there were even alternative sites considered for the Trinity test. New Mexico was largely chosen for its role in the Manhattan Project because Robert Oppenheimer had been there several times and liked it.	1642822141.0	htp1gff	t3_s9olx6	t3_s9olx6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9olx6/did_new_mexico_play_a_crucial_role_in_the_outcome/htp1gff/

hyiwj	I work in a fairly major museum, and let me tell you that "mundane" describes a pretty significant chunk of our collection. But don't discount the historical value of something mundane. Exciting, exceptional, noteworthy events and objects are a very small percentage of history. Pretty much all of human history occurred on everyday days.  My advice would be to write out absolutely everything you know about how your grandfather got the objects, even if that's just what you put in your post, take photos of as much of it as you can, and get in touch with any major museums nearby, or one that's big enough to be able to organise to have them picked up.	1642822761.0	htp2vbi	t3_s9qsbu	t3_s9qsbu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qsbu/how_do_i_ethically_get_rid_of_inherited_nazi/htp2vbi/

47g7nn0v	The main source is Venetus A which is a somewhat convoluted medieval manuscript containing (among other things) an excerpt from a much earlier work by someone named Proclus. This gives descriptions for every work in the Epic Cycle except for the Cypria which it did have at some point, but Venetus A was damaged and the Cypria description lost.   There are passing references to various parts of the Epic Cycle in other ancient works, but none tell us so much about the plots as Venetus A which is why the loss of the Cypria description is so annoying. We do have a fairly good idea of what happens as well as about fifty lines of the actual text, but there are still bits and pieces that we don’t know about.	1642829263.0	htpg9yq	t3_s99g43	t1_htpcikj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99g43/whats_the_actual_possibility_that_there_are_still/htpg9yq/
hxfc4	As it happens, there is no direct mention of a right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution, amendments, or federal law although you are right that in many legal contexts privacy is talked about as a right. Probably the most interesting part of the discussion to be had here are all the *different* contexts in which something called privacy might come up and how it is conceptualized slightly differently in each but that's probably more interesting from a legal/philosophical view than a historical one. What's important to recognize is that *recognizing* a right is done by legislation or the courts and, in the US it was done by the courts.  The first really significant legal salvo in this direction was *The Right to Privacy* an article by Samuel D. Warren and the (incredibly influential and respected) Louis D. Brandeis published in the Harvard Law Review, Vol. 4, No. 5 (Dec. 15, 1890).   "It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is." *id.* at 197. Before concluding that the law did, already, protect privacy the authors spoke of the "necessity" of privacy rights as the modern world of the 1890s was too hectic, with a press too invasive, for a person to navigate without some private retreat. As happens often in common law legal systems, the authors looked at prior case law for their point, largely drawing the right to privacy from **property** rights cases, specifically ones where someone asked the courts to prevent the dissemination of images taken of them (among these being *Prince Albert* [yes, THAT Prince Albert] *v. Strange*, 1 McN. & G. 25 (1849) regarding some private etchings the mere possession thereof was seen as a breach of privacy).  I'm not sure how interesting the various legal arguments they trace out are to you (can go into that if you'd like) but, to oversimplify almost to the point of taking it out of the legal realm, the article concluded at various points that while courts *claimed* to be resting their decisions on a property rights to images, or trade secrets, it was really the right to privacy which was driving these outcomes. Cites to property rights were a fig leaf of precedent the courts were using to get to just decisions, but the decisions were felt to be just because someone's privacy, not property, rights were violated.  Having concluded that we already recognize privacy rights, the authors then try to define the actual boundaries of this right (e.g. "The right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest." *id.*), and suggest some remedies, drawn from existing causes of action for defamation. Essentially they try to make it easy for the courts to start to openly recognize this right by providing them with tests and limits to it so the judges don't have to do it for themselves (and can cite the esteemed Brandeis in doing so).   So that's the first significant legal push for a legally recognized right to privacy in the US. Two things to notice. First - the authors first talk about the positive outcomes having a right to privacy would lead to and only then suggest that such a right has been there all along, if hiding behind the euphemism of property rights. Second - the discussion doesn't mention or rely on the U.S. Constitution generally or, more specifically, its Fourth Amendment. Although the right of the people to be secure in their papers from unreasonable government search and seizure sure sounds like the right to keep stuff private from the government, the start of the argument for property rights was to found it in English common law almost exclusively.  This was not the case with the Supreme Court decisions which 1) formally recognized a right to privacy; and 2) grounded that right in its interpretation of the U.S. Constitution rather than in common law.   The first of these is the little-talked-about today but in retrospect critically consequential decision *Pierce v. Society of Sisters*, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), where the State of Oregon tried to mandate every student attend public schools with no exceptions, and attempted to prohibit private schooling. The Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary was a private religious school that challenged the law on various grounds including that the law interfered with its property rights (there they are again) because its grounds were only suitable to be used as a school so outlawing that use amounted to taking their property (also outlawing the contracts between parents and school amounted to interference with right to contract). The court began by saying that, as a corporation, the school didn't get constitutional due process protections for its contracts if they were impaired by proper government action. But, looking to property law cases, the Court concluded that the Oregon law was *not* proper in that it interfered with freedoms of families and school.   The reason this case is such a huge deal is that this was the very first time the Supreme Court recognized 1) 14th amendment due process protected individual civil liberties; and 2) the first time the court explicitly (instead of in *dicta*) recognized constitutional rights applying to corporations.  The seminal case to truly cement privacy as a Constitutional right was Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), which held a Connecticut law criminalizing contraception illegal for violating the Constitutional Right to Privacy. The Court famously found this right in the 'penumbrae' of the amendments to the Constitution (1, 3, 4, 5, and 9, specifically). In doing so it cited past cases where Constitutional rights were held to have penumbrae. In *Griswold* the Court discussed how, for example, inherent to the freedom of association is the right to be private in who you associate with, how inherent in the 4th amendment's protection is the right to keep your papers private, etc. It concluded that making contraception illegal violated the right to "marital privacy."  It was about 75 years from the first article about a right to privacy until it was central to a major Supreme Court holding. Whether you consider that long or not, it doesn't seem to have been much of a battle - it was a right that was slowly recognized by the courts rather through a big public debate. The consequences and extent of that right to privacy **after** it was recognized is where the real debate and battle appears to have been, with it underpinning *Roe v. Wade* (and progeny) and *Lawrence v. Texas* (holding anti-sodomy laws unconstitutional).	1642829432.0	htpglg0	t3_s9gyk2	t3_s9gyk2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9gyk2/the_us_recognizes_a_right_to_privacy_how_did_we/htpglg0/
12vbngri	The south of Mexico was the least westernized region of Mexico. The Spanish during the colonial era didn’t conquer the Maya until the 18th century. Even then, their grip on power in the Yucatán peninsula was always weak and superficial.   It’s also important to note that the Maya are an enduring civilization and put up a big fight against the Spaniards. Spain always had a hard time “colonizing” Maya.	1642829771.0	htph95k	t3_s3loje	t3_s3loje	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s3loje/the_yucatan_peninsula_has_a_higher_rate_of_native/htph95k/

cs3ziqy3	The earliest domestication of animals (goats, pigs, sheep, cows) has been traced back to about 12 000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent (Catal Huyuk comes to mind). Other animals in other regions followed. The domestication of the Llama in Peru (~6 000 years ago) indicates the process happened independently, in multiple locations.  The linguistic evidence suggests that horse domestication in Eurasia was complete around 5000 BCE, when the Steppe Peoples brought horses and the Proto-Indo-European language to Europe.  Assuming that horses on the "American" Continent went extinct 10 000 years ago, there is not much of a "window" for domestication.	1642829861.0	htphffc	t3_s462tw	t1_hth8csg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s462tw/native_americans_and_horses_were_both_in_america/htphffc/

They also had a program started around 2010 to bring in Western (mainly American) teachers to work across the country: Teach and Learn with Georgia, or TLG. Though the plan was to have thousands of them, I think it peaked at a couple hundred (I was part of that program myself in 2014). After Saakashvili left office TLG was largely ignored by the government, who came from the opposition party.	1642830479.0	htpil8h	t3_s68982	t1_htp1hap	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htpil8h/

2tq3ork	It is something humans did around the world in a lot of places, but not in *all* times and places, and the factors that lead up to domestication events are one of those hotly debated things with no clear answer.    In fact, one theory (among many) is that the loss of megafauna made hunting much less rewarding and nudged humans towards the more effort-intensive strategies that eventually - in some places - led to domestication of crops and animals. As long as the hunting strategies were working, there wasn't much incentive to take those steps. All the domestication events we know of (except dogs) took place thousands of years after the megafauna dieoff.	1642834234.0	htpp117	t3_s462tw	t1_hth8csg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s462tw/native_americans_and_horses_were_both_in_america/htpp117/

By 1917 (the year is written at the top of the first photo), the Belgian army had shifted to a khaki uniform cut in the style of the French uniform (though officer uniforms resembled that of British officers). The second photo contains the most clues as to the army of origin. The soldiers pictures including your Great Grandfather show them wearing Adrian helmets, the standard issue helmet for both the French and Belgian armies as of 1915. The same photo shows the soldiers posing with the *Fusil mitrailleur modele 1915 CSRG* or *Chauchat*, a notoriously poor quality light machine gun produced  by the French and was supplied to the Belgians.   The second photo shows a hint of the right most soldier's boot and to me it doesn't look French to my eye. The French, post-1915, utilised puttees to protect the wearer's feet form water. These were strips of cloth that would be wrapped tightly from the ankle to just below the knee, sealing the top of the boot. The Belgians instead used leather gaiters that would be buckled around the ankle and lower leg to achieve a similar result. I think I can see a hint of leather gaiter in the group photo. That and the cut of the great coat strongly suggests Belgian to me but I cannot not be 100% certain.	1642836562.0	htpsol5	t3_s9sn6i	t3_s9sn6i	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9sn6i/does_anybody_know_anything_about_this_ww1_uniform/htpsol5/

a107fowh	One of the oddities of Pearl Harbor was that two Americans taught the Japanese to do it.  The second was President Theodore Roosevelt, who cheered on the Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Squadron at the Battle of Port Arthur of 8–9 February 1904. Ten Japanese motor torpedo boats made a surprise night attack inside the port, but the damage was limited by anti-torpedo nets and shore batteries that began to pound the Japanese into beating a hasty retreat.  The first was US Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan (September 27, 1840 – December 1, 1914) was a United States naval officer, historian, and, according to John Keegan "the most important American strategist of the nineteenth century."  His book *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History*, 1660–1783 (1890) was translated by Kanô Jigorô, the founder of *jûdô,* and his colleagues at the *Kaiji Kyôkai* Maritime Affairs Association within months of its publication; eventually many if not most of Mahan's works were translated into Japanese and were very influential upon the development of the Imperial Japanese Navy, where his concepts and histories were taught at all levels of professional development.  Mahan's strategic theory has been shortened from the three volumes essentially to  the concentration of a nation's fleet in order to seek out and destroy the enemy fleet in a decisive naval battle. Decisive naval battle in the early days of the 20th century meant large surface combatants, which were limited in the arms treaties Japan adhered to until the final one expired.  Only late in the game did the Japanese get interested in naval aviation - when then Captain Yamamoto Isoroku went to his assignment as the Japanese naval attaché (essentially an openly declared intelligence collector) for the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C., from 1926 to 1927, his predecessor advised him to pay attention to what the Americans were doing with naval aviation. His predecessor went back to Japan and become the brains behind Japan's naval aviation effort.  Mahan's 'decisive naval battle' in part led the Japanese to focus on large surface combatants, the culmination of which was the Yamato class super battleships. One aspect of their strategic planning was the correlation of forces - some Japanese took 1936 as the optimal time to attack the US Navy, when a number of new Japanese capital ships came online and before the production capability of America could be used to overpower Japan.  The focus on surface warfare diverted resources from other assets that probably would have served the Japanese better. The Yamato class superbattleships were hugely expensive, but obsolete before their keels were laid down.  Others have written well on the 'logic' or lack of it, but at some level it was meant to weaken the US Pacific Fleet before the 'decisive battle', no matter how unlikely it looks in retrospect. But Yamamoto himself warned against attacking Pearl Harbor; his time in America convinced him that Japan could never outproduce America if it mobilized its massive resources and industry.	1642830938.0	htpjf0k	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htpjf0k/

tpoig	THANK YOU for this post.  I am usually the first one chiming on on donating them. You can get credit or donate anonymously and usually write off the value of the donated materials on your taxes.  Your job now is as u/Sir_Lord_Brit said, doing some homework on documentation about the person, the man and his military career, and how and where he got them and they came to you. (My neighbor was a secretary and stenographer during the trials.) This is all provenance and the context is needed for intellectual as well as legal reasons.  Then you will do some research into WWII museums, [there are a number of them out there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:World_War_II_museums_in_the_United_States), and specifically look for ones with strong archives. And, of course, there is always the Smithsonian, National Archives, and Presidential Libraries (NARA). Stanford and Harvard Law also have major collections specifically about the trials. Then look into their archive holdings for other Nuremberg materials or maybe even collections related to your g-g-grandfather's unit. (If you need help, DM me. I will need the details though. I have helped many manuscript materials get to good collections.)  Then you could pick one, or a few, and send them details about the collection to gauge their interest. They will know what will best fit with their collecting policy and what they can support and have room for. Where it eventually goes might depend on how much material there is and how complete it is as a research collection.  And if they turn it down, it is usually due to how it works with their collections—don't take it personally—but it will find a home.	1642828054.0	htpdy08	t3_s9qsbu	t1_htp2vbi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qsbu/how_do_i_ethically_get_rid_of_inherited_nazi/htpdy08/

jh6xg	It seems you are asking about the background and reasons of anti-Jewish and/or antisemitic sentiment throughout history. Posts of this type are common on the subreddit, so we have this reply which is intended as a general response that provides an overview of the history of antisemitic thought and action.     The essential point that needs to be emphasized: the reason for anti-Jewish hatred and persecution has absolutely nothing to do with things Jewish men and women did, said or thought. Religious and racial persecution is not the fault of the victim but of the persecutor and antisemitism, like all prejudices, is inherently irrational. Framing history in a manner that places the reason for racial hatred with its victims is a technique frequently employed by racists to justify their hateful ideology.     The reasons why Jews specifically were persecuted, expelled, and discriminated against throughout mainly European history can vary greatly depending on time and place, but there are overarching historical factors that can help us understand the historical persecution of Jews - mainly that they often were the only minority available to scapegoat.     Christian majority societies as early as the Roman empire had an often strained and complicated relationship with the Jewish population that lived within their borders. Christian leaders instituted a policy that simultaneously included grudging permissions for Jews to live in certain areas and practice their faith under certain circumstances but at the same time subjected them to discriminatory measures such as restrictions where they could live and what professions they could practice. The Christian Churches – Catholic, Orthodox, and later Protestant – also begrudgingly viewed the Jews as the people of the Old Testament but used their dominant roles in society to make the Jewish population the target of intense proselytization and *other* them further by preaching their fault for the death of Jesus.    This dynamic meant that Jews were the most easily recognizable and visible minority to point fingers at during a crisis. This can be best observed with the frequent accusations of "blood libel" – an anti-Semitic canard alleging that Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals – in situations where Christian children or adults disappeared, the communal panic immediately channeling itself as Jew-hatred with tragic results. Similarly, religious, ideological, and economic reasons were often interwoven in the expulsion of Jews to whom medieval rulers and kings owed a lot of money; in fact, one intersection of crisis-blaming and financial motive occurred during the Black Death, when local rulers were able to cynically blame Jews for the plague as an excuse for murdering and expelling them.      These processes also often took place within negotiations between social and political elites over state formation. One of the best examples is the expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain by the rulers of Castile and Aragon after the Reconquista in 1491. Expulsion and forcible conversions progressed toward an institutionalized suspicion towards so-called New Christians – Jews who’d recently converted– based on their "blood". This was an unprecedented element in antisemitic attitudes that some scholars place within the context of Spanish rulers and nobility becoming engaged in a rather brutal state formation process. In order to define themselves, they chose to define and get rid of a group they painted as alien, foreign and different in a negative way – as the "other". Once again Jews were the easily available minority.     Jews long remained in this position of only available religious minority, and over time they were often made very visible as such: discriminatory measures introduced very early on included being forced to wear certain hats and clothing, be part of humiliating rituals, pay onerous taxes, live in restricted areas of towns – ghettos – and be separated from the majority population. All this further increased the sense of “other-ness” that majority societies experienced toward the Jews. They were made into the other by such measures.     This continued with the advent of modernity, especially in the context of nationalism. The 19th century is marked by a huge shift in ways to explain the world, especially in regards to factors such as nationalism, race, and science. To break it down to the essentials: the French Revolution and its aftermath delegitimized previously established explanations for why the world was the way it was – a new paradigm of “rationalism” took hold. People would now seek to explain differences in social organizations and ways of living between the various peoples of the world with this new paradigm.     Out of this endeavor to explain why people were different soon emerged what we today understand as modern racism, meaning not just theories on why people are different but constructing a dichotomy of worth out of these differences.    A shift took place from a religious othering to one based more on nationality - and thereby, in the minds of many, on race. In the tradition of *völkisch* thought, as formulated by thinkers such as Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, races as the main historical actors were seen as acting through the nation. Nations were their tool or outlet to take part in Social Darwinist competition between the races. The Jews were seen as a race without a nation - as their own race, which dates back to them being imperial subjects and older stereotypes of them as "the other" - and therefore acting internationally rather than nationally. Seen through this nationalistic lens, an individual Jew living in Germany, for example, was not seen as German but was seen as having no nation. For such Jews, this meant that the Jewish emancipation that Enlightenment brought provided unprecedented freedom and removed many of the barriers that they had previously experienced, the advent of scientific racism and volkisch thought meant that new barriers and prejudices simply replaced them.     Racist thinkers of the 19th century augmented these new barriers and prejudices with conspiratorial thinking. The best example for this antisemitic delusion are the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion*, a fake political treatise produced by the Tsarist Secret Police at some point in 1904/05 which pretends to be the minutes of a meeting of the leaders of a Jewish world conspiracy discussing plans to get rid of all the world's nations and take over the world. While the Protocols were quickly debunked as a forgery, they had a huge impact on many antisemitic and *völkisch* thinkers in Europe, including some whose writings were most likely read by the young Hitler.     The whole trope of the Jewish conspiracy as formulated by *völkisch* thought took on a whole new importance in the late 1910s, with the end of WWI, the Bolshevik revolution, and subsequent attempts at communist revolution in Germany and elsewhere. Jews during the 19th century had often embraced ideologies such as (classical) liberalism and communism, because they hoped these ideologies would propagate a world in which it didn’t matter whether you were a Jew or not. However, the idea of Jews being a driving force behind communism was clearly designed by Tsarist secret police and various racists in the Russian Empire as a way to discredit communism as an ideology. This trope of Jews being the main instigators behind communism and Bolshevism subsequently spread from the remnants of Tsarist Russia over the central powers all the way to Western Europe.      This delusion of an internationalist conspiracy would finally result in the Nazis’ Holocaust killing vast numbers of Jews and those made Jews by the Nazi’s racial laws. While this form of antisemitism lost some of its mass appeal in the years after 1945, forms of it still live on, mostly in the charge of conspiracy so central to the modern form of antisemitism: from instances such as the Moscow doctors’ trial, to prevalent discourses about Jews belonging to no nation, to discourses related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to the recent surges of antisemitic violence in various states – antisemitism didn’t disappear after the end of the Holocaust. Even the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the conspiratorial pamphlet debunked soon after it was written at the beginning of the 20th century, has been consistently in print throughout the world ever since.    Again, anti-Jewish persecution has never been caused by something the Jews did, said, or thought. It was and is caused by the hatred, delusions, and irrational prejudices harbored by those who carried out said persecution. After centuries of standing out due to religious and alleged racial difference, without defenders and prevented from defending themselves, Jews stood out as almost an ideal “other.” Whether the immediate cause at various points has been religious difference, conspiracy theory, ancestral memory of hatred, or simply obvious difference, Jews were and continue to be targeted by those who adhere to ideologies of hatred.

3qdt4v79	Barbarossa actually largely performed as expected it was prepared not by Hilter but by the German High Command so trained Generals.  The chief issue was poor intelligence and wishful thinking when that intelligence was found to be poor. Barbarossa was built around poor intelligence on the strength of the Soviets, particularly on the scale of their reserves, and wishful thinking based on a campaign plan that had mortgaged Germany's entire future on a war that would be over in 1941 and so made any suggestion of one that might stretch into 1942 and beyond unacceptable.                The poor intelligence dogged the Germans from the start and by August of 1941 it was clear to the Germans that their assessments of Soviet strength had been badly, and systemically, off. The Soviets continued to oppose the German invasion despite losses far greater than German intelligence had predicted they possessed and with troops and equipment that had come as complete surprises to the Germans. For example, pre-war estimates put the Soviet tank park at 10,000 vehicles, less than half its actual total. From the start, the Germans knew their intelligence on Soviet strength contained huge gaps and was constructed largely out of inference. It was also continually being revised upward. In August of 1940, when planning for Barbarossa began, the Germans estimated 170 Soviet divisions opposing their invasion. By February of 1941 this number had crept up to 180, but as pre-attack reconnaissance intensified it ballooned to 226 by the time of the invasion in June, as the Germans continually discovered heretofore unknown enemy formations. This level of new discovery clearly indicated the inadequacy of the intelligence but the Germans took their chances and attacked anyway.                Writing in early August, seven weeks into the invasion, OKH chief Franz Halder noted explicitly how badly they had underestimated the Soviets. Despite this awareness, the Germans continued to accept optimistic assessments that this time the Soviets were on their last legs. In September, they underestimated Soviet reserves before launching Operation Typhoon and then in October they overestimated the effect of the initial (admittedly amazing) success they achieved at Vyazma and Briansk in wiping out another half-a-million Soviet soldiers. This led them to conclude that Moscow was now theirs for the taking, and led to a string of poor decisions. German leaders would subsequently point out that the intelligence in October was telling them the Russians were finished but by then they should have known that such intelligence was based on guesses that had already been shown to be regularly wrong.                One of the reasons for this serial wishful thinking by the Germans was because doing otherwise would be admitting defeat, not just of the 1941 campaign, but for Germany and the entire war. By the summer of 1941 the German Reich, for all its size, was a precarious house of cards. Resources were stretched and the Germans needed a quick victory over the Soviets to allow them to demobilize a large chunk of the army, save on ammunition expenditures, and gain the oil necessary for the following naval and air campaign against the UK and USA (which Hitler considered a belligerent long before the official declaration of war). Even as the Panzers were rolling across the Soviet frontier, production was being shifted away from ammunition and tanks for the army, towards aircraft and ships for the following western conflict. In June of 1941 the Germans mortgaged their future on conquering the Soviets by the end of year. Were that not to happen all the subsequent finely balanced plans would collapse in on themselves and the future of the Reich's entire war effort would be placed in lethal jeopardy. As such the Germans were conditioned to grasp at any straw that seemed to offer the possibility of a victory in 1941, no matter how improbable. This conditioning was so bad that it remained the root of a lot of "if only we did X different, it would have worked" in memoir writing after the war, such as taking Moscow before the end of 1941, and endlessly repeated by pop-historians since.	1642858269.0	htqoe1j	t3_qynft7	t3_qynft7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/qynft7/why_did_the_germans_expect_the_invasion_of_the/htqoe1j/

96gqp	Hi there -- we've removed this question for being a what-if; the idea that DNA tells us something about someone's ethnicity is very much a modern creation, and we simply have no idea what a 23andMe profile would tell us about a given citizen of ancient Rome. (As an aside, in the modern day they aren't much use either; all they do is compare one's genes to people who live in what Benedict Anderson has so delightfully described as "imagined communities" which may or may not have any relevance to when our ancestors migrated.) You are welcome to ask about how a "Roman" identity formed, or the city-states that were granted Roman citizenship and how those ebbed and flowed over time. If you'd like help formulating such a question, you are welcome to send us a mod-mail to ask.	1642859556.0	htqqss8	t3_sa0uiv	t3_sa0uiv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa0uiv/if_23andme_and_other_dna_apps_existed_in_times_of/htqqss8/

kwbn6	First, thanks for the answer, which I found fortuitous as I just rewatched one of my favorite films yesterday, and it happens to take place within this time period: Andrey Rublev. Now, the film is by no means meant to be a history lesson (it wouldn't be a very interesting film if it were, and it definitely wouldn't start with a scene involving a hot air balloon a few centuries ahead of its time) but I'm curious to know if you have any thoughts on it (if you've seen it, but if you haven't and are at all interested in auteur-driven cinema, I very much recommend it), be they of a historical nature or not.	1642860151.0	htqrydd	t3_s8r5cx	t1_htm02yo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5cx/out_of_the_all_the_various_rus_princedoms_why_was/htqrydd/

8wwxj454	Hello. I’m a Masters student in the UK who’s has done a dissertation of the Levellers (with a heavy focus on the Putney Debates) and now doing my Masters on sedition in the reign of Charles I (with a chapter which will be dedicated to the Trial of the King). As far as I am personally aware I do not believe such a volume exists. However I would highly recommend J. P Kenyon ‘The Stuart Constitution’ which has a lot of primary documents for this team including some you have mentioned here, and it can usually be picked up second hand online for about £3. Also the the Levellers I would recommend Andrew Sharp’s ‘The English Levellers’ for most of the main Leveller texts. The Putney Debates and Trial of Charles are rather long documents (and both rather repetitive) so the segments you normally get in such collections should suffice for general reading, however if you want the full text then looking on Early English Books online should be your best option for the Trial of Charles I. For the Putney debates full transcript you would be best searching through the Clarke Papers which were edited and published by CH Firth. All the documents you’ve asked for though are available online for free (I believe) so not completely out of luck! Sorry I couldn’t exactly help when it comes to a complete collection, but hopefully this helps you track down the texts you wanted in some capacity.	1642861288.0	htqu7hd	t3_p6vu5o	t3_p6vu5o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/p6vu5o/asking_for_a_book_recommendation_collection_of/htqu7hd/

jduzx	The answer is no. There is no such evidence, and there is nothing that even comes close to suggesting anything romantic between the two. The way Engels and Marx wrote to each other, was well within the norm for how men wrote to each other at that time. This idea that Marx and Engels should've had some homoerotic affair has no foundation in reality. Furthermore, compare Karl's letters to Jenny with his letters to Engels; Marx is far, _far_ more romantic and loving in those letters, writing poems, describing her beauty, his longing, and so-on, even in periods where they were separated in less than a month. To Engels, you find maybe a "Dearest Friend" or "Life-friend," normal forms of address among 19th century German friends. Maybe signed a "yours truly" or "your friend," but nothing nearly as loving as we see with Jenny. The same goes the other way around; Engels wrote to Marx well within what was acceptable for the 19th century gentleman of Engels' standing. In addition, Engels was a known to have little respect for marriage, and had plenty of extra-marital affairs with other women; something that was at odds with Marx's far more romantic ideas about love, and at times meant that Jenny Marx wouldn't talk to him, if he brought his mistress to the Marx's home.  On the story of the illegitimate child, I assume you're referring to the child of *Lenchen*, aka Helene Demuth, the Marx family housekeeper, and Friedrich Engels. There is nothing that proves that Karl Marx should be father of Friedrich Demuth, the child, and Engels himself claimed fathership. We also know that Lenchen and Engels were each others confidants, that Engels wasn't the type to stay within the confines of his marriage, and that the two, later in life, formed a professional couple, along with Lenchen moving to the Engels estate, to take on the position of housekeeper. I'm repeating myself here, but there is nothing that, in any way, supports the claim that Marx should be the father of Friedrich Demuth.   The final point I want to raise, is that the idea that Engels' (and Helene Demuth's) work with publishing _Capital_ should be an expression of some love, makes no sense. Engels and Marx were lifelong companions and comrades, they worked on many of their works together. It was only obvious, that Engels would organise and publish the two other volumes of _Capital_. To claim that it was an expression of love, would you also say that the young Karl Kautsky, who met Marx in London, had some feeling of romantic or sexual attraction towards the older Marx, since Kautsky was responsible for publishing _Theories of Surplus Value_?  ***  Sources:  III.

9i89m	Robert Morris is an interesting figure, a very important person during the Revolutionary War and in the Confederation that followed it. He emigrated with his father to Maryland as a teenager in 1747, and when his father died was apprenticed to a merchant in Philadelphia, Charles Willing. He did well, and set up his own company with Willing's son when he was still quite young, and as the French and Indian War was breaking out. Morris quickly figured out how to make money from supplying that war, and afterwards kept making money, expanding business into the Caribbean and overseas, investing in projects like mines and mills. His firm would also invest in other merchants' projects: the colonial financial world was rather small, and there was a lot of pooling of resources, working connections-  marriages and bloodlines mixed up many if not most of the eastern merchants, and therefore some historians have referred to the Robert Morris group...there was Robert Morris, and there were the relatives, friends, associates he could call for help.  Unlike Jefferson or John Adams, Morris had little idealism, and it is a bit of a mystery whether his support for the revolt was mostly might have been based on his financial interests. He thought the new taxes imposed by Britain were an abomination, but he also allied himself initially with Dickinson in opposing separation. He abstained from voting for independence, but signed the Declaration of it. He also talked in glowing terms of how much money could be made from the War. Being in the Congress, and on the Secret Committee, gave him plenty of opportunities for doing that, and he did. That attracted plenty of negative comments from the idealists- Tom Paine denounced him as a profiteer.  But the hard truth was that the colonies needed an enormous amount of  stuff to fight their war- not only guns, gun powder etc but food, wagons, clothes, blanket. That stuff had to be found, purchased, and gotten into the armies, and Morris was able to work his connections and do that. That it was still not quite enough, that the army was still pretty ragged, ill-fed and badly equipped is true, as is  the charge Morris and his group took a fee from all those transactions that seemed more than patriotism would allow. But alone among the Continental Congress delegates, Morris seemed to know how to do it.  It's for that reason they made him Superintendant of Finance in 1781, and Morris was able to set conditions for accepting; he got broad powers to hire and fire and run his own business as well as the Congress'. He took away logistics of supply from the states; his plan was also to create a Bank of America that would assume at least some of the states' war debts in return. He also stopped paying soldiers- feeding them was going to be enough, and the Bank would pay them back after the War.   Now, all this was a Good Thing, and your tour guide and others have sometimes tried to make Morris the Man who Saved the Revolution. That's not really true- he took his job as Superintendent close to the end of the conflict, only a couple of months before the seige of Yorktown.  And after the British surrender at Yorktown,  Morris's plans to strengthen the credit of the US with a national mint and national Bank ran into trouble because the states didn't want devote money to fund it. He resigned in 1784, and would be a delegate at the Constitutional Convention, siding with the other Federalists for a stronger national government.  Alexander Hamilton would take his idea of the federal government assuming states' war debts and manage to implement it.   His mixing up of Congressional business and his own unfortunately became a problem when Congress asked him for his accounts during the War. Morris does not seem to have been admired or well-liked, and when he could not separate his group's private transactions from the public ones, there was no sympathy. In 1795 he was billed $93,312. Morris would join a number of other merchants who would get little gratitude.  Silas Deane, who put together the first shipment of goods from France, would also end up  ruined for his efforts when he could not justify his accounts( and to the same Delegate who went after Morris, Arthur Lee) and Oliver Pollock, of New Orleans.    Morris also then overextended himself in a number of bad ventures, mostly land speculation. As a result, Morris would lose everything and go to debtor's prison in 1799, be there for three years. Perhaps because of  embarrassment over the spectacle of such an important figure being in jail, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act of 1800, that did away with debtors' prisons.    For a detailed look at the web of businesses supplying the War, Robert A. East's * Business Enterprise in the American Revolutionary Era* is old but still interesting. For a general narrative of the Congress and the Revolutionary War, John Ferling's *A Leap in the Dark*  is also quite good.	1642862850.0	htqxi55	t3_s9puly	t3_s9puly	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9puly/how_much_power_did_robert_morris_have_over_the_us/htqxi55/

mdu63	Hello, sorry for very late response.   Since OP had apparently got some basic areal and chronological outlines of medieval fur trade centered at north-westernmost part of Eurasia (NW Russia~ Arctic circle~ Fennoscandia) in the cross-post in /r/askhistory, my following post focus on some not so well answered points of OP's original question.   +++  >Did they actually use traps or more bows and muskets?   Trap was the main means of hunting, together with bow with a special (blunt-tipped) arrow head either of iron or horn for small fur animals, at least in NW Russia from 10th to the 13th centuries (Makarov 2006: 126).    +++  >Was the primary quarry sable, hares, and harts? Or were there others?   Sable was certainly OK, but the most of the most important export of fur from medieval NW Eurasia are in fact missing from the suggested list: (Eurasian) beavers, (northern gray) squirrels, ermines and martens.   Scandinavians had also traded the fur with arctic hunter-gathering peoples, knowned as "the Finns" - not conflated with modern Finlanders, but usually identified with the Sámi people since the Viking Age, and the following account of the middle to late 12th century lists the fur animals living in Fenno-Scandia (now Finmark region in northern Norway):    >"Bordering the length of Norway is a vast wasteland, separating it from the pagan peoples. This waste is lived in by Lapps and by the wild animals whose flesh they eat half-raw and whose skins they wear. ......There is no limit to the number of wild animals there: bears, wolves, lynxes, foxes, sables, otters, badgers and beavers.......Among the Lapps are also a great many squirrels and ermines, and every year the Lapps pay the skins of all these animals as large tribute to the kings of Norway, whose subjects they are." (*History of Norway* (about 1150-1175): Translation is taken from [Kuninrans. 2001: 5f.]).    As numbers and good hunting places of beavers decreased in course of the High Middle Ages (12th and 13th centuries), the main export of fur from NW Russia shifted from beavers to northern squirrels, and Novgorod (a city in NW Russia) functioned as a hub of collecting fur from their tributary hunter-gatherers (up to the White Sea) as well as the export center to the Latin West (one of the the 4 trading posts of the Hanseatic merchants was located there).    [This famous map](https://imgur.com/CXXPTNq) shows the location of Novgrod's tribute taking stations (in forms of fur), based on the donation charter of Prince Sviatoslav of Novgorod in 1136 or 1137 (Martin 2004 (1986): 56). It was customary of counting furs by 40 (40 furs) as 1 *sorochok* in medieval NW Russia, and 436 *sorochoks* in total from these stations are mentioned in the charter - they consequently amounts to 17,400 furs. 174,00 hunted furs (probably of squirrels) were expected to be collected these stations alone, and also, in a single year (Noonan & Kovalev 2004: 654-56). In the 14th century (1320s), there was also a transaction record in Novgorod that trade the large-scale estate with 20,000 pelts of squirrel (Martin 2004 (1968): 68).   Medieval City Novgorod had a further unique kind of primary document, [Birch bark Document (linked one, no. 210 (middle of the 13th century) is unfortunately not relevant to fur trade at all)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Birch_bark_document_210.jpg). Some of the documents mention tribute-taking in form of fur, such as No. 683 (fragmentary text, middle to late 12th century): "......Novik's 6 *kunas* (unit of money in medieval Russia).....bag (sack) of squirrel pelts, 18 *sorochoks*, which he concealed in Onega region, are in the hand of Neshka......" (the translation is taken from Noonan & Kovalev 2004: 56).    This no. 683 is a kind of medieval business letter, excavated from the building of Novgorod's Mayor, and it also reveals that furs had already been counted by 40 (*sorochok*) and packed with the seal at individual stations before they were sent for Novgorod. And a researcher (Ianin, Russian authority of medieval archeology of City Novgorod) suggests that [these wooden cylinders (11th and 12th centuries)](https://imgur.com/sYfWLY7), with the place name of Onega river region (SE to the White Sea) were used to "seal" sacks of squirrel furs at the tribute-taking station.    As for popularity of these arctic furs, Martin cites some examples of medieval British royal members: Queen Philippa of Hainaut (wife of King Edward III) of England had five garments of northern squirrels for the banquet after her birth to their first son, and the namesake princess of King Henry IV of England put a gown with trimmed ermines and squirrels. Later medieval English sumptuary act tries to prohibit the use of northern gray squirrels (thus imported from NE Eurasia - non native in England) out of ranked nobility and upper stratum of knights (Martin 2004 (1986): 64).    On the other hands, sables, ermines and martens were also popular in Islamic world, and as shown in [this map (Favereau 2021: 157)](https://imgur.com/iy5XeSn), the Golden Horde (Jochid Ulus) took over the main trade route to SE Russia in the 13th century. Crimean Peninsula was another export hub of Russian fur trade, and Italian merchants like Genoa and Venice played a role of middlemen in the fur trade on this side in the Eastern Mediterranean. Though not the most popular one, one or two scholars had suggested that it was fleas hiding in the exported fur from Crimea by the Italian merchants that spread the Black Death across the Mediterranean (now grain export from Crimea became the latest popular culprit instead of fur - Cf. Favereau 2021: 248-49).   References:    * [Kunin, Devra (trans.) *A History of Norway and The Passion and Miracles of the Blessed Óláfr*, with an intro. and notes by Carl Phelpstead.

i0exqncy	Does anyone have recommendations on sources for medieval peasants hunting and trapping? By my understand, nobles hunted in large groups where everyone had a role, and it was more of a past time for socializing with other nobles. But how did peasants hunt?

4s4vd	No, he didn't have a role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. At this time he was working with Anatoly Sobchak who was a mayor of Saint-Petersbourg. So, you could say he was relatively important in Saint-Petersbourg but not country-level important at all.  If by "a coup against the government of the USSR" you mean GKCHP (ГКЧП), I think it'd be oversimplification to say that this event was organized by KGB. One of them truly was the head of KGB) but still, it didn't look like organized attempt at anything at that time and doesn't look like organized attempt at anything now. Anyway, Putin's boss, Anatoly Sobchak, didn't think he had to do what GKCHP wanted and Putin immediately quit KGB.  All of this happened 8 years before the beginning of Putin's presidency.  In 1996 Sobchak lost another round of elections, so Putin lost his job. After that he came to Moscow, where he was invited to work in Yeltsin's administration. Two years later he became a head of FSB (KGB successor). Three years later (1999) he became a prime minister.  It seems that the main role in his promotion was played by Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's son-in-law. Yeltsin and his closest associates were worried that after Yeltsin all the progress on the way to democracy would be lost. And maybe they were worried about their future fates also. Yeltsin as a politician wasn't in a good shape, he almost lost his own President elections in 1996 (and some says that he really lost it, but it's quite hard to say if it's true or not). Anyway, all these years there was a fear of communists' comeback, so Yeltsin's associates (sometimes this group of people is called Family, *Семья*) wanted to have a good successor. The one who wasn't communist, the one who owes them a lot, the one who wouldn't betray them. They wanted guarantees.  Putin at that time seemed for them as a good choice. He believed in democracy, he had his own code of honor, he was loyal to them. And he really owed them a lot. So, he was chosen not because he was an influential politic with a lot of connections or was a rich guy with a lot of money and power. He was chosen because he wasn't. For people he was a relatively unknown. He had worked just several months as a Prime minister, and before that he was a head of FSB (not a really TV celeb), and before that he was an official in Yeltsin's administration (not a really TV celeb also).  So, the question is: did it work for the Family? Yes, it mostly did. You can say a lot of bad things about Putin, but he is obviously loyal to those who is loyal to him. Valentin Yumashev is still his advisor. Roman Abramovich is still a billionaire and so on.  Some people who helped Putin on his way to presidency fell out of his favor though. The most prominent example is Boris Berezovsky, who wanted to control Putin right after the elections. It didn't work out for him. In 2006 he ran to London, after that he gradually lost a significant part (maybe, most) of his assets, and in 2013 he was found dead at his London house (suicide). But even Putin's critics won't say Putin betrayed Berezovsky. If there was a betrayal, it was the other way around, and after that there was a revenge.  Did it work for democracy? You know it didn't.  But, actually, during the first 8 years, it was quite okay although Putin tried to control the media right after he became a President and there was a quite strange and tragic story with Russian billionaire Mikhail Khodorkowsky. But democracy and freedom of speech didn't just disappear in one day, it was a slow and painful process.   Obviously, Putin's experience in secret service have some influence on his strategy and decisions, but I don't believe it was his plan from the beginning. He was very lucky because before him Russians were very poor, and during his first eight years they became much more richer and happy. If he quit, he'd be remembered as one of the best Russian rulers of all time (despite some of his mistakes and shortcomings). But he didn't quit, and he'd changed.   If you want to read more about this, I can recommend an excellent *All the Kremlin's Men: Inside the Court of Vladimir Putin* by Mikhail Zygar. Also, *Berezovsky's time* by Peter Aven (not sure if there is an english translation). But please bear in mind that this is still quite modern history for Russia, some parts of this history are literally dangerous to touch, a lot of people who could tell us something prefer to keep their silence, so there is a lot of gaps, and misunderstandings, and mistakes, and downright lies in all the books about that.	1642865721.0	htr3ydr	t3_s9k7qp	t3_s9k7qp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9k7qp/did_vladímir_putin_have_a_special_role_during_the/htr3ydr/

7rvatyyv	I wouldn't call de Waal a "genocide denier" and don't think that is what the letter you linked here is saying. Their specific words is that he "contributed to denial of the Armenian Genocide," which is obviously still a serious charge.  That said, I am not a genocide scholar or expert, and certainly not one on the Armenian genocide, so take anything I say here with that in mind. But from what I've read of de Waal (and I've read nearly all his books and academic articles, if not all of them), have not found that to be true.  I should also note that most of the scholars signed onto that letter are of Armenian heritage (the surname ending -ian or -yan is Armenian), and while I certainly do not want to make any claims like that, it could be a case that they are more personally involved in the matter (de Waal has no family connection to Armenia or the Caucasus, as far as I'm aware). The Armenian Genocide is a very politicized topic, so it is not surprising to see people of Armenian heritage try to give it the prominence they feel it deserves (again not a critique, nor a denial of the genocide by any means). I would be interested to see if some non-Armenian scholars also feel this way, and am quite open to seeing if de Waal really does have some views that are less than savory.	1642867578.0	htr8dww	t3_s68982	t1_htpnk2d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htr8dww/
7rvatyyv	It was one of the first books published in English that was not written by someone either directly associated with the war, or related to Armenia or Azerbaijan (which are often biased to their side). Rather de Waal has been criticized by both sides for his coverage, in that each side feels he favours the other, and that is always something I consider a good sign.   It has also held up in terms of being used as a major source since it was published: nearly any reputable publication on the war will cite *Black Garden* (along with others, of course), and while that is of course not always a sign of someone supporting the works, that it continues to be referenced suggests it is at least worth looking at.	1642867733.0	htr8r8v	t3_s68982	t1_htpo3a6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htr8r8v/

3w4spkpx	> Rather de Waal has been criticized by both sides for his coverage, in that each side feels he favours the other, and that is always something I consider a good sign.   An analogy: do you know how the difference between Gaussian and equal distribution looks? Obviously they are not the same, but when you say that "both sides" criticizing somebody or that somebody being "in the middle" is a good sign, one would think you don't understand that.  Point being that usually one side is closer to the truth and another is farther from it, and standing in between is absolutely useless for determining anything if it is a conflict.  Also he is a genocide denier, as others said. For anybody familiar with the situation closer, he is obviously biased to the Azeri side, just insufficiently for Azeris. I don't see any reason to consider him a credible source, but some acquaintance is useful, of course.	1642868148.0	htr9ra4	t3_s68982	t1_htr8r8v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htr9ra4/

Anna was extremely brave journalist, but she wrote mostly about Chechnya and Chechen wars, so there is a very special angle in her work. It's not bad per se, but I'm not sure you'd get a full picture of Russia from her works, and she wasn't trying to do that.  I didn't read her *Putin's Russia* though. My impression about her is mostly based on her articles.	1642869171.0	htrc9sy	t3_s9k7qp	t1_htrapad	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9k7qp/did_vladímir_putin_have_a_special_role_during_the/htrc9sy/

You are wrong, "he said - she said" is not an argument.   >  I've also not seen any criticism of him being pro-Azerbaijan coming from anyone who isn't overtly pro-Armenian  That's like saying that a critique of works denying Holocaust always comes from people who are overtly pro-Jewish/pro-Allies/... - you get the point (I hope).  Now facts are available thankfully, so don't pretend to be neutral, ok?	1642869659.0	htrdhny	t3_s68982	t1_htrbidl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htrdhny/
2m8yl53s	>“…in the world in which Islam was born, the Bible circulated orally in Arabic mainly in liturgical settings…such written biblical texts as may have been available in synagogues, churches, or monasteries in this milieu were in the liturgical languages of the several communities, Hebrew or Aramaic among the Jews, and Greek or Aramaic/Syriac among the Christians.” (Griffith, pg. 2)  Christians in the Near/Middle East, whether they were Arabs or not, used Greek and Syriac as their liturgical languages, and so they used Bibles written in those languages.  Greek wasn’t the native language of the region and it’s unrelated to the various native Semitic languages, but as the language of the eastern part of the Roman Empire, it was the common administrative language and even a common secondary spoken language for almost everyone, Christians or Jews. For Christians it had the added prestige of being the language the New Testament was written in. There was also an older Greek translation of the Tanakh and other Hebrew scriptures, the Septuagint, from the 3rd or 2nd century BC. The Septuagint was the basis of the Greek Old Testament for Christians, and it was also used by Hellenized, Greek-speaking Jews.  On the Semitic languages side, there was an early translation of Bible into Syriac, maybe dating to the 2nd century. The most common one today is the Peshitta but there were other translations circulating in antiquity. The Old Testament was probably translated from the Hebrew and the New Testament from the Greek (although maybe the whole thing was translated from the Greek). There was also other extra-Biblical literature in Syriac, notably the Diatesseron, which was sort of a summary of the Gospels.  Other Christian communities translated the Bible into their own languages too - the standard Latin translation (the Vulgate) was done in the 4th century, but there were earlier partial translations as well (the “Vetus Latina”, the “old Latin”). By the 5th century there were translations into Armenian (an Indo-European language like Greek and Latin) and Georgian (neither Indo-European or Semitic), as well as other Semitic liturgical languages, Coptic in Egypt and Ge’ez in Ethiopia.  By the 5th century, using a Bible in Greek or Syriac or any of these other languages also depended on the specific sect of Christianity and not necessarily a person’s native language or ethnic origin; among other things there were disputes over the exact nature of Christ’s humanity and divinity, and after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, there were the “Chalcedonian” churches in Constantinople and Rome, since they agreed with the conclusions of the council, and the “non-Chalcedonian” Syriac, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopian churches who adhered to a slightly different interpretation. Syriac was also the liturgical language of the non-Chalcedonian Christian communities further east in Persia, central Asia, and India.  As a Semitic language, Syriac is closely related to Hebrew, and more distantly to Arabic. Syriac, or really the various dialects of it, are forms of Aramaic, which was the common spoken Semitic language all over the Near East and Middle East. There are even bits of Aramaic in the Bible, notably in the Book of Daniel, and a few words spoken by Jesus in the New Testament. The Jewish scriptures were written in Hebrew, but by the Roman period Hebrew was a liturgical language and Jewish people often spoke Greek and/or Aramaic instead. Some Jewish literature was also written in Aramaic (such as commentary on the Tanakh, which was known as the Targum, from the Aramaic word for “translation”).  Aramaic had its own script; the “imperial Aramaic” form was used as far east as Persia, and may have even influenced the development of the Brahmi scripts in India. Imperial Aramaic script developed into the Hebrew square script, which Jewish authors used to write both Hebrew and Aramaic. It also developed into the different Syriac scripts, the “classical” Estrangela, the eastern Syriac Madnhaya, and the western Syriac Serta, which were used for the various Aramaic/Syriac dialects in Palmyra, Nabataea, etc. The script used for the Nabataean dialect is probably also the origin of the Arabic script.  So, any Jews and Christians further south in Arabia who spoke Arabic already had Bibles and related literature in Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic/Syriac. Hebrew and Syriac are pretty close, but it's not quite the same as having a Bible in their own language. Could they have translated their scriptures into Arabic too? Maybe, but they probably didn't, at least not before the rise of Islam in the 6th and 7th centuries. The reason for that is simply that there were no books in Arabic before the Qur’an. Although there are short texts and inscriptions in pre-Islamic Arabic, it wasn’t considered a literary language and no one wrote any lengthy literature in it.  Jews and Christians must have transmitted Biblical literature orally though, and their fellow Arabs evidently learned about Biblical people and events from them. The Qur’an introduces older prophets (Noah, Moses, Jesus, etc) and situations without much or any explanation, as if the intended audience already knew about them. And while there are no surviving examples in Arabic, Christian communities in Europe often translated short passages or the bits that they considered most important, especially the Gospels and parts of the Old Testament like the Psalms. So there might also have been very short texts in Arabic, along with any other material that was primarily transmitted orally.  (I should also mention that the early Muslims could have encountered Biblical literature from the Ge’ez versions in Ethiopia, where they were welcomed after being temporarily expelled from Mecca, but I don’t think the Ge’ez version had much influence on Arabic Bibles.)  After the Qur’an was compiled and standardized in book form in the 7th century, Arabic was now seen as a worthy literary language, and Jewish and Christian Arabs now had a model for composing their own holy books in Arabic too. They probably started writing in Arabic soon afterwards in the 7th century, and definitely by the 8th and 9th centuries. We can be pretty sure that substantial (if not complete) translations existed by then because Muslim authors were also interested in them. They wanted to understand the Bible and show how Judaism and Christianity and their scriptures were deficient compared to Islam and the Qur’an. For example, the jurist Najm al-Din al-Tufi examined the Christian Gospels from a Muslim perspective in the early 8th century. He was presumably working with an Arabic translation.  Meanwhile, thanks to the spread of Islam, Arabic became the dominant language further north in the Near East and Egypt, although it probably wasn’t the majority language just as Islam probably wasn’t the majority religion. The population was still mostly Christian for a long time, and they still spoke Greek and Syriac, and Coptic in Egypt. But they gradually began to adopt Arabic, the language of the ruling class. While Muslims were translating Greek philosophy and literature into Arabic in the translation centres in Damascus and Baghdad, Christian communities were translating scriptures and all sorts of other works into Arabic too.  However,  >“Translations of the whole Bible into Arabic in one perhaps multivolume work seem not to have been undertaken under Christian auspices until the sixteenth century.” (Griffith, pg. 129)  So, in brief, Arab Christians and Jews had Bibles in Hebrew, Greek, and Syriac, which were the common liturgical languages in the Near East/Middle East at the time. They certainly transmitted Biblical stories orally in Arabic, even if they didn’t translate them in written texts until after the arrival of Islam, when Arabic became a literary language for the first time. By the 9th century, Christians and Jews were producing Bible translations in Arabic, but there probably wasn’t a full translation of the entire Christian Bible until relatively recently in the early modern period.

8xdm0	Thanks /u/keloyd for the detailed reply! Curious to hear your perspective on Asimov's tome when you have a chance to read it in full.   I will also take a look into Karen Armstrong's books. I certainly have interest beyond Christianity, so also helpful to know she has written more broadly on Judaeo-Christian history, including on Islam. As /u/MagratMakeTheTea mentioned below too, I appreciate the additional background on Armstrong as I agree trying to keep in mind the unavoidable biases of authors will be critical.   Also, lucky you can try and attend a class if you wanted close by!	1642870464.0	htrfjbv	t3_s68dfl	t1_ht2exhg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68dfl/what_are_some_updated_alternatives_to_issac/htrfjbv/
8xdm0	Thank you for the recommendation and your review! This seems like a decent option to consider starting with for a causal reader.

eb71vhfe	As historians such as E. H. Carr and Hayden White argue, historical inquiry is subjective and heavily dependent on what the inquirer chooses to look for and focus on, which shapes the historical knowledge "produced". Put simply, if you're looking to learn about the pre-industrial history of East Asian economies, you'll probably be searching for sources relating to pre-industrial East Asian economies, be writing historical publications about pre-industrial East Asian economies, and so on.  Why does this matter? Because much of our historical knowledge and primary historical sources are written by elite men, often heteronormative and cisnormative especially in the Western/European setting. This is generally because such people had the ability to do so which others did not: namely fluent literacy from good education, and influence and freedom in spreading their views due to social/political/economic power. They are mostly going to care about and write about topics relevant to *themselves*: your noble lord will concern himself more on collecting land taxes and managing military forces than on textile weaving methods used by peasant women. Thus in many historical fields, we often end up with huge amounts of historical knowledge relating to this demographic, and with lots of primary sources focusing on them then means lots of secondary and tertiary sources also focusing on them.  Studying and evaluating history with a deliberately different inquiries and approaches will then help us consider new perspectives, "forgotten" sources, and unique arguments. That diversity of knowledge in turn contributes to a "better understanding" of history, in the sense that history is once again a rather subjective field which relies on an understanding of how, how far, and why our historical knowledge is subjective.  For example, choosing to look at women's household work in agarian societies can direct us to searching for sources relating to that, especially if from and regarding women. On top of written texts that may be rather scarce, considering unconventional methods could provide extra insight, such as archeological discoveries of weaving tools in female graves. We can then hopefully put together a fresh narrative and learn new information: perhaps (as a hypothetical example) that certain aspects of postharvest processing were treated as household work, but varied across communities and over time!  Alternatively, we can try new readings of existing sources: perhaps to consider potential references to homosexuality in artworks and cultural artefacts, which may introduce contrasting viewpoints to common perceptions of the society in question. Could a "confusing" poem actually make sense if treated as a parody of conventional marriage expectations?  Finally, we can still gain a better understanding of the context of those elite men's sources. What does their portrayal and referencing of women and "effeminate" men tell us about their sociocultural values and biases? Why are female deities and elites treated differently than female peasants and slaves?  All these matter as they will shape and affect how we evaluate and handle such knowledge. It's also important to keep in mind that the influence of gender in the study of history can have big impacts in our present day: gender issues continue to affect lots of real people, and awareness about its past supports its modern prevalence and movements. Pop culture can also be quite an accessible medium to practice such skills: how do early Disney animations and Sean Connery's James Bond films depict women, and what can they suggest about expectations by their film creators?  For more in-depth reading, you can search for all kinds of gender historians and gender history publications. I think [Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1864376) by Joan Scott and [The Growth of Gender and Women's History](https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/growth-gender-and-womens-history) by Lyndal Roper are good starts!	1642871237.0	htrhjkv	t3_s97efi	t3_s97efi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s97efi/how_does_looking_at_gender_help_better_understand/htrhjkv/
8xdm0	Thank you for the range of suggestions and general advice when approaching this topic /u/MagratMakeTheTea !  I also appreciate my request was a difficult one. Asimov's Guide was hardly concise, and even then, a generally treacherous task for any single publication to handle such a large swath of recorded modern human history. I will keep in mind maybe trying to start with a smaller segment than "The Bible".  I also appreciate the additional background on Erhmann to keep in mind! Your recommendation at first pass, certainly does seem in line with Asimov's general attitude.	1642871452.0	htri3az	t3_s68dfl	t1_ht2xn4s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68dfl/what_are_some_updated_alternatives_to_issac/htri3az/

However, we will remove questions that put a deliberate slant on their subject or solicit answers that align with a specific pre-existing view.	1642872098.0	htrjr1n	t3_sa72op	t3_sa72op	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa72op/was_there_any_good_nazis/htrjr1n/
8xdm0	Thank you for the recommendation and some of the high-level summary. This was actually one book I came across when doing some searching of my own.    It seems like it might be interesting to read Dever as well as the recommendation for Erhman's *Misquoting Jesus* on textual criticism as it seems like Dever is highly focused on archeological evidence, almost to the exclusion of textual analysis. At least, that is my sense from a few reviews and having obviously not read it yet.	1642872132.0	htrju40	t3_s68dfl	t1_ht50we7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68dfl/what_are_some_updated_alternatives_to_issac/htrju40/

88vwr8h8	In the Tanakh (the Jewish Bible, known to Christians as the ‘Old Testament’), merchants and traders are always Canaanites, never Israelites. Later, in the 1st century CE, Josephus (the noted Jewish-Roman historian) recorded that Jews ‘do not indulge in commerce either by sea or otherwise’. The *Jewish Encyclopedia* (first published in 1906) also asserts that, in antiquity, ‘not much attention was paid to commerce’ by Jews. The encyclopedia cites, among other evidence, the fact that Jews didn’t mint their own coinage until the Maccabean era (beginning in the 2nd century BCE).  After the Jewish-Roman wars, the Roman conquest of Judea, and the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, Jews began to widely migrate throughout the Roman Empire. By the 5th century CE Jews were well-established in the lands of the Empire, particularly in the Western Roman Empire. In 476 CE the Germanic king Odoacer deposed Emperor Romulus Augustulus, and the Western Roman Empire fell, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) to take up its mantle.  In *Yiddish Civilisation: The Rise and Fall of a Forgotten Nation*, Paul Kriwaczek explains that:  > Roman trade had been largely under official control, but with the coming of the barbarians, the imperial economic bureaucrats had vanished back to their great hereditary farming estates and cultivated their own gardens, in the process establishing themselves as the new, local, nobility. Jewish smallholders, on the other hand, whose produce was insufficient to pay taxes to the king, whose faith prevented them from dedicating tithes to the local bishop and whose traditions were hostile to providing manpower for war - the three obligations placed on landowners in the new dispensation - faced the difficult prospect of either abandoning their property and retiring to the towns or fleeing overseas, otherwise finding themselves for ever tied to their patch as unfree serfs or villeins in a feudal system that became ever more rigid by the century and which, moreover, insisted on conformity to the Christian religion. It wasn't much of a choice and unsurprisingly most elected to leave the land. >  > The new kingdoms of Italy, Gaul and Spain, however, desperately needed experienced businessmen. The rough new lords of the West knew little about finance and less of economics, while the arcane art of bookkeeping, which had already been mastered by the Hebrews in Babylonian days (there are clay tablets to prove it from Marashu and Sons' banking and trading house of Nippur, Babylonia, in the fifth century BCE), and without which no commercial concern can successfully operate, must have seemed to beer-quaffing German warriors like so much magic. To them, the Jews of their kingdoms represented the highly valued last remaining survivors of Roman commercial practice.  These events marked the beginning of the European Jewish association with trade and finance. A notable example of such a a new lord of the West was the 9th century Frankish king Charlemagne.   Charlemagne invited Jews from the Mediterranean to settle in his agricultural lands of Provence and the Rhineland as royal clients, outside of the feudal system, and develop trading communities there. Most pre-WW2 Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Europe had their origins in the Jewish culture, language, and liturgy that developed in the Rhineland roughly a thousand years ago.  ---  During Charlemagne’s reign he instituted various financial reforms and did much to standardise currency in Europe. But economic development in medieval Europe was hampered by the fact that merchants typically needed to maintain a large amount of physical currency with which to trade. This was logistically impractical and also economically fragile: currency loses its value as inflation rises, which happened more-or-less constantly during this period. Currency can also be used to purchase assets which maintain their value, such as land. The drawback with the latter is that if one’s capital is tied up in assets, it cannot be quickly liquidated when extra currency is urgently needed. The solution? Investing in loans, and charging interest to compensate for the currency’s loss of value over time, ie. proto-banking.  Christian doctrine forbade lending money to fellow Christians and charging interest. But Jews could lend money to Christians and charge interest. This system was of vital importance for economic grown and development in Europe, and moneylending became increasingly indispensable in Europe, not just for monarchs but also nobles, merchants, and even peasants.  The Jewish religion is inherently community-oriented, requiring a *minyan* (a quorum of ten adult men) for many important prayers, and a need for locally-available kosher food and wine. This, combined with the widespread prohibition against Jewish land-ownership in medieval Europe, led to the majority of Jews to settle in urban areas. Trade guilds began to emerge in Europe in the Middle Ages, from which Jews were always excluded, thus forcing them out of the skilled and artisanal trades and crafts popular in cities and towns. Consequently Jews became vastly overrepresented in European commerce and moneylending, they had little choice.  ---  Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, William the Conqueror invited Jewish merchants from Normandy to settle in England, believing that their commercial knowledge and skill would help increase England’s prosperity. Later, under King Henry I (as in many kingdoms of mainland Europe at the time) the Jews of England were considered the property of the Crown.   English and other European kings frequently exploited Jews financially, using them as a source of income. For example, In England the office of Exchequer of the Jews was created, following the 1194 Ordnance of the Jewry. The Exchequer taxed all Jewish transactions on behalf of the King of England, essentially making the king a ‘sleeping partner’ in Jewish moneylending and trade. Furthermore, if the king’s courts and officers aided Jews in recovering debts, the king was entitled to ten percent of the sum recovered. Ever-increasing anti-Jewish violence (massacres, blood libels) and legislation (requiring Jews to wear badges, further monetary exploitation) in England ultimately culminated in the 1290 Edict of Expulsion, which expelled all Jews from England, seized their property, and ruled that all outstanding debts to Jews should be paid to the king. Jews were not able to return to England until the mid 17th century, under Oliver Cromwell.  ---  Countless books and dissertations have been written on this subject but, in short, Jewish involvement in finance and commerce was almost entirely involuntary. It developed over a long period of time and for manifold reasons related to their vulnerable minority status since the exile from Judea. Despite this fact, Jews became symbols of money and exploitation, and were frequently used as scapegoats by monarchs, nobility, and moneyed landowners to direct anger from serfs and peasants away from themselves. This ultimately resulted in Karl Marx (himself a Jew, albeit one remarkably ignorant about Jewish history) writing his antisemitic 1843 essay *On the Jewish Question*, in which he stated that ‘The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew’.	1642872719.0	htrldfb	t3_s4xi7r	t3_s4xi7r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4xi7r/were_jewish_people_in_medieval_europe_forced_into/htrldfb/
gh16flt8	Modern media does not do them justice, Hitlers speeches were notoriously exceptional, public speaking was his main great skill. This goes back to 1919 when xxxx picked him out whilst giving lectures to ‘nationalise the army’, and he was renowned from his very early days speaking in Munich, right up to the big rallies, that held hundreds of thousands of people. There were even instances of people convulsing and deficating in excitement at his rallies! Think like a political version of a televangelist.  However, why people voted NSDP was a different issue. It is a somewhat complicated issue, that is still researched and debated, but I will try to summarise what I see as a few key points.  In spite of how good he was at speaking, he was not a ‘pied piper’ who put people under his spell and magically got them to vote for him - they had their reasons, that Hitler snd the Nazis brilliantly exploited. However, that is not to say that the figure, and ‘charisma’ (in the Webian sense) of Hitler was not absolutely paramount to the regimes popularity, as Kershaws ‘The Hitler Myth’ has shown.  A key factor in the rise of the popularity of the NSDSP was the Great Depression. In 1928 the NSDSP received 2.6% of the vote in the Reichstag elections of that year - this increased to 37% in 1932! The Depression took a huge tole on a Germany, already ravaged by the hyper inflation of 1923, not to mention the war, and near civil war (with the extensive political chaos of the early 20’s). People, who had faced unemployment and economic ruin, were not only desperate for anything that could get them out of the mess, but they had lost all confidence in the status quo and conventional political parties in order to do so. So, whereas all the other parties (except the communist KPD, who were the only other party rise in popularity in this period) represented a resumption of the - perceivably failed - status quo, the NSDP offered something innovative, new, fresh, and untarnished by the perceived failures of the Weimar Republic.  In addition, the NSDAP was able to organise brilliantly (especially with the input of Gregor Strasser), and appeal to a wide range of the electorate, and therefore siphon votes from the more traditional parties - from socialists to conservatives - was absolutely key. Not to mention fully exploring the figure of Hitler, and his speaking, as the leader who could lead Germany not only out of the depression, but towards a national redemption, which could be seen as very appealing to a hitherto proud nation, that had experiences enormous political and economic strife.  They also managed to portray themselves as the party of law and order, and of national unity - ‘ein volk, ein reich, ein Fuhrer! Germany (a relatively new nation, politically speaking) was divided politically, something that was exacerbated considerably by the depression and chaos of the early 20’s. The Nazis however offered unity, and end to division and infighting, that all Germans were part of the ‘peoples community’ (volksgemeinschaft), which again was extremely appealing. Furthermore they stepped up violence against the communists on the streets, portraying them as an enemy of the German people (fully exploiting the terror in the Russian civil war of the early 20’s), so any violence against the communists was portrayed as the Nazis protecting the German people, as a necessary step in state security (this would also be used later to justify the ‘Reichstag Fire Decree’, and camps like Dachau for alleged political enemies).  What people did not vote for was antisemitism, racism, eugenics, war and extermination camps. During the early 1930’s, Nazi propaganda and political agitation about Jews was toned down considerably, as they knew it would be seen as being too extreme for all but the most right wing ideologue of the party.  In order to appeal to the masses, they again focused on the economy, denigrating other political parties, and protecting Germany from socialism and socialist revolution. It is worth remembering though, that although Hitler did not hypnotise people through his speaking, his figure, and the mythos that was quickly developing around his character (call, by Joseph Goebbles, his ‘greatest achievement’), was still a key element in appealing to the electorate, and as a means of addressing their dire needs.  Some books you may find useful are, Kershaw, I The Hitler Myth, and Rees, L The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler.	1642872844.0	htrlp57	t3_sa5xt5	t3_sa5xt5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa5xt5/were_hitlers_speeches_good_how_did_he_convince_so/htrlp57/

It's good to call out those who are not willing to meet such basic standards; my only concern is that it sometimes can go to far in the opposite way (which is something that can happen in any serious topic).

i2kk6jsw	Names were viewed differently during those times. A person would change their names multiple times, and the new names would have a new meaning attached to them. For instance, the Tokugawa clan was called the Matsudaira clan when they were serving the Imagawa and Tokugawa Ieyasu's name was Matsudaira Takechiyo.    In the case of artists, they usually adopted a name instead of using their real one and the name would change when the artist would switch their master(s) or school(s). Hokusai published his first prints under the name of Shunrō, which was bestowed on him by his master Shunshō. For a while, he was associated with the Tawaraya School and adopted the name Tawaraya Sōri to indicate the same. He later on gifted this name to one of his students. One of his future names, Katsushika Hokusai signified his birth place Katsushika.  His name before he died, Gakyō Rōjin Manji, meant 'old man mad about art'.    Hokusai's name changes are indicative of his different influential periods in his life, his art styles and/or emotions. This practice was quite common in Edo period and is said to have started in the Heian period, though the naming patterns were different for other professions and positions. However, Hokusai's monikers are more than that of any other prominent artist.

Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?".

I think most of the people say that are just looking for ways for the NT to be a bunch of made up stuff so they aren’t thinking about it in an unbiased way.

dmhrar6n	I'm sorry to cut you off, but I wonder if you could elaborate on your [older response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lwmrfr/comment/gpjrh1x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I’ve read it, and I wanted to ask a question, but it was archived. So I came here to see if you could help me clarify something.  You mention that two famines were factors in the creation of a rural artisan industry. I don't fully understand the connection. Also, did they ever just export their metals (iron) as is, as in not as finished goods like weapons and muskets?	1642879766.0	hts3g6e	t3_s535wg	t1_hswwc5a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s535wg/why_were_queens_seondeok_and_jindeok_and_their/hts3g6e/
8za88	Apparently a coincidence. From [https://www.liguorian.org/files/Liguorian\_JPII\_intro.pdf](https://www.liguorian.org/files/Liguorian_JPII_intro.pdf)  *THE COAT OF ARMS OF POPE JOHN PAUL II features a gold cross set against a blue backdrop. The cross represents the central Christian mystery of the Redemption. The vertical part of the cross has been shifted slightly to the left to make room for the majestic capital M, which reminds us of Mary’s presence at Jesus’ death on the cross. The motto of John Paul II, which accompanies his coat of arms and  expresses his devotion to Mary, is the simple Latin expression “Totus Tuus.” It means “Totally Yours!” Located directly behind the pontiff’s personal coat of arms are the symbols of papal authority: the tiara and the keys of Saint  Peter. The papal tiara, or triregnum, is formed of three crowns and symbolizes the triple power of the pope, for he is father of kings, governor of the world, and Vicar of Christ. The keys, which represent those given by Christ to the apostle Peter, are*    *crossed and tied with a cord. Since the fourteenth century, the two crossed keys have been the official insignia of the Holy See.*	1642879804.0	hts3jow	t3_sa5ygs	t3_sa5ygs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa5ygs/the_coat_of_arms_of_pope_john_paul_ii_was/hts3jow/
4qz6gnsm	This is a really good answer.  One thing that I would add is that this kind of thing is still practiced in modern Japan to some extent and isn’t something that is lost to the past, especially in artistic or cultural endeavors.  For example, someone who achieves a certain level of official certification in Tea Ceremony will be given a new name by the governing body that their own teacher is certified in.  For example, a woman named Ayumi might receive the ‘tea name’ Soumi, keeping just the ‘mi’ character from her own name and adding a somewhat archaic character to the name.  No one would ever call her this in daily life, but she would sign the name on anything tea related if necessary.  Sumo wrestler names are similar as well- they might change names multiple times in a career or sometimes not.  There is a retired Yokozuna whose birth name is Hanada Kouji- he started his sumo career under the name Takahanada with the understanding that he would be allowed to take his father’s ring name if he reached a high enough rank.  He did, and eventually surpassed his retired father’s rank under the same name, Takanohana.  He kept his ring name when he joined the council of sumo elders, but many choose to change their name when they join that group.  Publicly he is a celebrity known as Takanohana.  Privately it’s unlikely anyone calls him that.  That’s three names for one guy and he passed on a typical option of a fourth name.  And lastly there is the tradition of renaming someone after their death, which is still a very common practice.  Typically a family pays a Buddhist temple to provide a posthumous name to a deceased family member as part of funeral traditions.  TL;DR- Japanese renaming traditions still have a place in modern Japan and aren’t just a historical phenomenon.	1642879982.0	hts3zq3	t3_sa52pf	t1_htrv7sa	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa52pf/japanese_artist_hokusai_was_known_by_at_least/hts3zq3/

i2kk6jsw	Thank you for educating me. I've never really pursued any material pertaining to post-1945 Japan and assumed the naming patterns would be different today, which was a blunder on my part.   Would the example of Ayumi be reflecting the practice of giving youth names(developed in early Heian period and carried over in the later periods), _yōmyō_, which were only used until they came of age?

jt30f	The oil embargo--and, more particularly, the U.S. asset freeze--did the exact opposite of what the U.S. hoped, by solidifying Japanese decision makers around the need for a Southern Operation. Prior to the U.S. actions, while the predominant opinion within the IJA was for the Southern Operation, there were still groups of officers who instead argued for attacking the Soviet Union instead. However, when the U.S. asset freeze rolled out, even the most assertive of officers for war against the Soviet Union were forced to acknowledge the need for an attack against the south first prior to war with the Soviets (even if the German invasion briefly revived hopes of an attack north, before these too were put aside).   I'm a bit uncertain what you mean by the second part of your question. The Japanese had attempted to try and gain favorable trade concessions from the Dutch colonial government in Batavia (now Jakarta) prior to the outbreak of war, but these had been roundly rebuffed. Similarly, while the British had bent slightly to Japanese pressure by closing the Burma road, the British were also participating in economic efforts to curtail Japan, and were not about to hand over Malaya and Singapore to the Japanese. The reason the Japanese were interested in pressing the Southern Operation in the first place was because they saw that their diplomatic options had been played out, and saw the only way they could gain a strong enough position to insist on a new order in East Asia was war. The only question remained what war would take place, with the IJA hoping that war could be limited to the British and Dutch, while the IJN was adamant that any such war would have to include the United States as well.	1642881454.0	hts7mrw	t3_s8yukr	t1_htpno9r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/hts7mrw/

gkv5n	Sorry for the delay, took a little more digging than I expected and I'm still not 100% sure. Took a look through casualty records from 1963, and yes, quite a few of the officers' service numbers on them follow the pattern of O+five digits, same as the ones on the graduation list. The format of serial numbers seems to have changed rather often over the years, and I'm not seeing an immediately-available source on the formats other than Wikipedia (which suggests that serials starting with O were for "some Army specialist officers," but unhelpfully does not have a citation for its section on Vietnam-era service numbers). But based on the casualty lists from about the same time, seems likely that those are their serial numbers, at least until the next time the format changed.

4qz6gnsm	I don’t actually have an answer to that that I can support off the top of my head, but I’ll crack some books when I get a chance because it’s an interesting question.  I’m not familiar enough with childhood name conventions to really say, but I don’t know of any examples where a childhood name has a shared character that remains when a name is changed-  for example, I know that Tokugawa Ieyasu’s childhood name was Takechiyo, and the artist Toyokuni I was named Kumakichi or something similar as a child  My gut feeling based on that though is that the way the tea naming works is more descended from art school naming conventions though.  The ‘take one of your teacher’s characters and keep one of your own’ format for names is pretty well established in art.  The Utagawa school for example had teacher > student lineages like:  Toyokuni was the master of Kuniyoshi, Kunisada, and Toyoshige among others.  Kuniyoshi was the master of Yoshitoshi and Yoshiiku.    Kind of an aside, but the list of artist names of the students of the original Toyokuni is a glorious mess of different people taking the same name and changing back and forth to the point where you almost need a flow chart to keep it all straight.  If I can find anything more definitive regarding childhood names I’ll post again.	1642883479.0	htsckbo	t3_sa52pf	t1_hts78lz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa52pf/japanese_artist_hokusai_was_known_by_at_least/htsckbo/
6mgfuvle	Isn’t the President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars and Co-Editor of Genocide Studies International a good enough?   But of course targeting the ethnicity of the others is the best approach here.   Would you be also targeting Lempkin     as a Jew to have legalized this new type crime as genocides. Of course you would not. In some countries you would go to jail for that. The « charge » is clearly explained in the article, but of course ad-hominems is easier.   At the end of the day, bothsidism, minimization are tools to genocide denial and serve the aggressor and target the victims and their descendants further.

i0kro	[The text](https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/786967/22):*  Original Kanbun: >諸大名参勤作法之事   続日本紀制日　預不公事恣不得集己族　京裡二十騎以上不得集行云々　然則不可引卒多勢　百萬石以下二拾萬石以上不可過二十騎　十萬石以下可為其相應　蓋公役之時者可随其分限矣  Yomikudashi: >諸大名参勤作法ノ事。   続日本紀制シテ日ク、公事ニ預ラス、恣ニ己ガ族ヲ集ムルヲ得ズ。京裡二十騎以上集行スルヲ得ズ云々。然レハ則チ多勢ヲ引卒スベカラズ。百万石以下二拾万石以上二十騎ヲ過クベカラズ。十万石以下ハ其レ相応タルベシ、蓋シ公役ノ時ハ其分限ニ随フベシ。  Translation:   >The rule all daimyōs must follow when reporting for duty:   The rule as recorded in *Shoku Nihongi* says that unless entrusted with official duty one is not allowed to gather his clansmen as he wishes, and no more than twenty horsemen are allowed to gather in the capital. Therefore one is not permitted to lead a large force. Those below 1,000,000 koku and above 200,000 koku are not not allowed more than twenty horsemen. Those 100,000 koku and below are to have a proportional number. However, when on official business, one is to [have a number] appropriate to his rank.  The English translations I have on hand (including Wikipedia) interprets "capital" as Edo. However, as the article references *Shoku Nihongi*, the current academic consensus in Japan is that the "capital" is in fact Kyōtō. There's some disagreement on whether this would be to the Imperial Palace (the Emperor) or Fushimi Castle (the Edo Bakufu), but either way the regulation is for when reporting to Kyōtō.  As you can see above, the attendance part of alternate attendance goes way back in Japanese history to at least the Heian, if not the Nara period. Both Kamakura and Muromachi Bakufu had their own attendance rules. However, this article does not lay out the rule for the alternate  (*kōtai*) part of alternate attendance for Edo Bakufu. That does not appear in Bakufu law until [article 2 of the 1635 version](https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/786967/24):  Original Kanbun: >大名小名在江戸交替所相定也　毎歳夏四月中可致参勤　従者之員数近来甚多　且国郡之費且人民之労也 向後以其相應可減少　但上洛之節者任教令　公役者可随分限事　  Yomikudashi: >大名・小名在江戸交替相定ムル所ナリ。毎歳夏四月中参覲致スベシ。従者ノ員数近来甚ダ多シ、且ハ国郡ノ費、且ハ人民ノ労ナリ。向後ソノ相応ヲ以テコレヲ減少スベシ。但シ上洛ノ節ハ教令ニ任セ、公役ハ分限ニ随フベキ事。  Translation:   >It is not ruled that daimyōs and shōmyōs [small daimyō] are to alternate their location with Edo. They are to report for duty in the summer during the fourth month of every year. Lately the number of followers [to Edo] have been excessive. This depletes the provinces and districts, and exhaust the people. From hence forth, the number is to be appropriately reduced. However, when reporting to the capital one is to follow the rules [assumed to be article 9 of the 1615 version above] and when on official business to [have a number] appropriate to his rank.  From this we can see that by 1635, some sort of alternate attendance was *de facto* in place. It seems that prior to this, various daimyōs simply did it on their own accord to demonstrate their loyalty to the Edo Bakufu, as it was already the tradition for samurai to spend considerable amount of time in the service and have their family live at their lord's castle town, and as already mentioned, attendance laws go way back in history. The 1635 law simply sets out how it is supposed to be conducted.	1642884801.0	htsft8a	t3_sa4slo	t3_sa4slo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa4slo/what_is_the_meaning_of_article_9_from_the_1615/htsft8a/

1jn5r7q	In some respects this is answering a negative rather than a positive, because it is essentially "why DIDN'T rugby become similarly popular in Germany or Spain".  Rugby (pre-split) was played fairly widely around Europe, for instance Hannover 96 & Vfb Stuttgart in Germany & Servette in Switzerland were initially rugby sides, but no other country has a deep rugby culture like France's.  Rugby was seeded into France at multiple points principally through traders and ex-pats.  Le Harve formed as a dual code club (association & rugby football) by a British railway manger in 1872 & Bordeaux had a club formed by a British wine merchant & those in the textiles trade in the 1870s too.  Pierre Coubertin was a key figure, mainly remembered today for founding the Olympics, he also helped introduce rugby to France through his book *L'education Angleterre* which focused on the positive aspects of Rugby School under its famous headmaster Tom Arnold.  Following France's military defeat to Prussia in 1871 & the Paris Commune there was a serious crisis of culture, what had lead to this humiliating defeat and subsequent uprising and what could we do to stop it in the future?  Coubertin looked to Britain and the role sports played in its culture.  Many *lycees* took to the game and former pupils of Condorcet & Monge schools formed Racing club in 1882, while former pupils of Saint-Louis formed Stade Francais.  Both of these are still prominent clubs and recent French champions today.  France didn't have the hang ups on competition like the British did and thus formed a Club Championship in 1892 (first competed for by Stade & Racing).  This helped spread the game and by 1914 the titles are spread around the areas the game is strong today, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Bayonne, Lyon, Perpignan.  From the British newspaper archive we can see that in the Edwardian era the Leicester Alliance (local select side, not the main Tigers)  toured France but also Germany, while Rosslyn Park went to France but also Austria-Hungary (specifically Prague, Vienna & Budapest).   Here we get into the murkier reeds of motivations.  Casual readers need to understand British class and more specifically the professional/amateur split that happened in rugby in 1895.  This was a proper schism.  Prior to WW1 the "northern Union" (what would become rugby league) had almost as many members as the "Rugby Football Union".  The RFU was desperate to not lose any more ground to their opponents, we can see this in the handling of the 1908 professionalism allegations in the Midlands where Leicester, Coventry & Northampton were basically whitewashed of all the claims against them.  The committee investigating Leicester gave their verdict on the morning of an England international held in Leicester (that was awarded after the inquiry started).  France had lost to New Zealand by only 2 tries in 1906 and regular friendlies against first England then Wales & Ireland showed they were competitive and a draw for crowds, so one reading is purely to do with skill on the field.  France also had a popular club game where players' professional careers often coincidentally seemed to result in them moving to a job just where a top team needed a player. A strict interpretation would only result in them "going north", so they were to be kept in the tent and the excesses of their shamateurism overlooked in all but the worst cases.  There was no danger of Germany "going north" so they didn't need to be included.  We then get the Great War, this of course saw France as a major theatre of war and saw the mass importation of British Empire troops, there were games behind the lines between the ANZAC & British or locals, at the time Canadian football was not so different from rugby and the Canadians played too.  France as an ally was then included in all the victory games, while Germany was specifically banned from playing against the home unions.  In the 1920s rugby became part of France's national culture, the Championship game was first broadcast on the radio in 1923 and it was Bayonnais rugby fans who popularised the Beret (or inspired the popularisation).  This was also the decisive moment, US Quillian out right poached half the Perpignan team in 1927 and the game was burgeoning in Toulouse. "Professionalism" split the game into two competitions, the FFR with their relaxed atttude & the UFRA (Union Francais Rugby Amateur) which wanted, sort of, an amateur game. Perpignan (in the UFRA) said "in order to keep our players amateur we have to pay them twice as much").  In 1930 France came within 1 match of an historic Five Nations Championship and a crowd of 50,000 came to watch them play Wales.  But the 11-0 loss, with two tries (then worth 3 points + conversion) agitated the crowd so much the referee kept play going until it was naturally near the tunnel so as to safely escape the crowd.  In 1931 they were expelled until they enforced the amateur regulations & abolished their championship.  France had formed "FIRA" (Federation International Rugby Amateur), but Germany was a key member and the organisations official language was German.  In 1928 Germany beat France and in 1938 20,000 watched them play in Frankfurt where Germany won again.  Other than to France, Germany lost only 2 internationals in the 30s.  In both world wars lots of rugby internationals lost their lives but Germany was particularly hard hit in WW2 losing 16 internationals, the most of any nation.  FIRA helped spread the game in Italy, Romania and elsewhere in Europe.  France didn't return to the Five Nations Championship until after WW2, which as many can imagine changed things somewhat again.  French rugby in the second world war is a whole different kettle of fish (the Vichy government regarded Rugby union & league as the same game, so when they banned all professional sport and forced them amateur they rolled the league game wholly into Union).  There is a suggestion that the IRB was less than keen on FIRA and again invited France back in to try and (succesfully) decapitate the organisation.

n4bht	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question.

820vw	There are two elements to your question, firstly "twisting a cord" and secondly "on Sunday morning".  To address the first, "twisting a cord" at Newton's time was a common way of strengthening twine or yarn for all kinds of uses. [String, twine, yarn, cord, rope etc](https://www.the-ropewalk.co.uk/ks2th2.pdf) were all part of the same continuum of  objects, because it is possible to make thicker rope by twisting together thinner ropes.   Cords were made as part of the making of whatever object the person wanted to have hold together. It could have been anything; his clothing, a wrapped parcel, documents, a cord to suspend something from his bedroom ceiling, we don't know and Newton himself would likely have considered doing that to be a mundane part of normal life. *Working* life.  Which brings us to the second element, the Sabbath. [Strict Sabbatarianism](https://sci-hub.mksa.top/10.2307/3165251) was a Puritan doctrine however by Newton's youth it had become sufficiently widely accepted among English Christians to be practiced by Anglicans also, hence the presence of this, and "making a feather", "making a mousetrap", "making pies" etc in Newton's list.	1642888028.0	htsnqgf	t3_sa50ad	t3_sa50ad	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa50ad/what_does_newton_mean_when_he_mentioned_the_sin/htsnqgf/

11im0u	Thanks for the detailed answer. Would you mind expounding a bit on France "not having hang ups on competition like Britain did"? Does that have to do with the amateur/professional divide?	1642888207.0	htso694	t3_sa2hd5	t1_htshqdy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa2hd5/how_and_why_did_france_become_the_odd_one_out_in/htso694/
7sxro	Thank you; I'm very glad you thought it was fascinating. So do I.  The answer is perhaps surprising: the dynasty did not kill itself off—not once from 1323 to 1922! It's pretty amazing, actually.   It's worth noting that the Ottomans experienced internecine (brother-on-brother) war for the throne between 1400-1450, and then officially practiced fratricide for 150 years between 1450 and 1595; it did not occur for the entire 600-year dynasty.  There is no evidence that the sultans had trouble siring heirs. Every sultan between 1400-1595 (except one) had to kill at least one brother in war or execute his infant/child siblings. The reason the practice of fratricide ended in 1595 is because Sultan Murad III had 7 consorts, 22 sons, and 28 daughters. His heir Mehmed III ascended the throne and immediately executed all 19 of his living infant brothers, which caused huge public outrage.	1642888672.0	htspars	t3_s7sm1l	t1_hter33y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/htspars/
1jn5r7q	Yes, the people who ran the RFU believed that professionalism was an inevitable consequence of competition (and they were right really) and competitions even local ones were at best frowned upon and were actively discouraged.  The Calcutta cup (competed for by England and Scotland annually) was originally donated to be an equivalent to the FA cup, to be awarded to the best team in England but the RFU would not countenance that for another century more or less. The cup in England did not start until 1972 and the league until 1987.  There were big cups in Yorkshire and Lancashire that obviously declined post 1895 and the Midlands Counties Cup was a biggish thing until Leicestershire split from Warwickshire in 1920 but nothing else really until the 70s	1642889171.0	htsqjhf	t3_sa2hd5	t1_htso694	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa2hd5/how_and_why_did_france_become_the_odd_one_out_in/htsqjhf/

kfhe9	My turn of phrase was a little bit unclear: what makes the story credible (and not propagandistic) is that it showed those French soldiers as fundamentally weak: they not only got themselves captured, but they had let another man have his way with them, and then they cried about it. The death of general François Mireur on 9 July 1798 is another example of the reluctance of accepting "weakness": according to an officer (Desvernois) who claims to have found his body, Mireur committed suicide in the desert after criticizing in front of Napoleon the entire goal of the campaign, but official reports said the he had been assassinated by the Bedouins.   In any case, you're right about the fact that officers (in the letters at least) do not seem to express much sympathy for their soldiers. In the case of Mireur, Napoleon did claim in his memoirs that the general had been killed by those "wretches" and called him "one of the bravest men [he] had ever known" but he still blamed Mireur for his lack of prudence (letter to the Directoire, 24 July 1798).	1642889312.0	htsqw51	t3_s5b2oe	t1_htqlxgq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s5b2oe/the_violation_of_napoleons_troops_at_the_hands_of/htsqw51/

If animated: Animated by Studio Ghibli. (The closest I'll get is *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* which is, to be fair, pretty close.) No idea who I'd cast but the reason I pick it is that it's my favourite book.

2nwv9ekt	I won't be able to provide an answer as detailed as the link already provided but I read a lot of books around life in the trenches and suicide in the trenches occured.  I can however tell you what I found on the French side.   First, suicide is commonly mentioned in most testimonies or fiction stories by veterans I have read in French:  - Memoires de poilus -Les croix de bois by Dorgelès  As per those testimonies, suicide could take several forms. Some men would put a bullet through their heads. Others would come out of the trench and run toward the enemy. Those ones would not be considered as having committed suicide even though by all witnesses is was clearly one. For this reason, it would be difficult to establish what is a suicide and what is not and thus, the numbers are always inaccurate.    As I saw your question I searched quickly in French to see if the topic had been covered.  What I found is this [article](https://www.france24.com/fr/20180815-premiere-guerre-mondiale-suicide-poilus-sante-mentale-rehabilitation) which seems rather well sourced (France24 is a rather legit media).   This article quotes several estimations based on samples. For example Xavier Trochu, a French historian checked 93000 soldier records. From that sample he estimated the amount of suicide in the french army at 4000.  The French historian Denis Rolland estimated between 4000 and 5000 suicides in the French army.  So one can assume it must be around this number.  Both historians explain the difficulty to trace this number. First, because some suicide will not be considered as such (as I explained above) but also because suicide was an extremely taboo topic. To the point where both historians mention that in hospitals doctors would not always acknowledge a suicide as such because it was seen by them as a failure of their own ability to help the patients. Finally, a suicide was seen as dishonorable. A suicided would not earn the title "Fallen for France" which would allow their relatives to receive money from the government. Some suicides were therefore hidden by the direct officers who would not deprive the families of their fallen men from that money.	1642890285.0	htstc7k	t3_s8dc4j	t3_s8dc4j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8dc4j/what_were_suicide_rates_in_the_trenches_during/htstc7k/

i8393	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1642892220.0	htsy4rv	t3_saehp4	t3_saehp4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saehp4/what_is_the_difference_in_the_nature_of/htsy4rv/

2i47exce	Thanks for getting back to me :) why the outrage for Sultan Murad though? Almost 200 years of fraticide and suddenly it crossed a line? Was it because 19 babies were killed as opposed to teenagers and adults (not that it's any better)?

ft5sujfd	This is a great answer, thank you so much!  The role of superintendent of finance seems like he was very powerful, but that power was limited to carrying out the will of congress, which I assume was basically to win the war?  Was it controversial when he took logistics of supply from the states? That sounds like a major step towards the centralized authority that so many of the states feared at the time.   Finally, what was the secret committee?

nxyvc	Hey there,    Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.    If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, [consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) (rather than why what didn't happen didn't happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!	1642895340.0	htt5o0m	t3_sa8msb	t3_sa8msb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa8msb/why_there_are_no_large_empire_in_moanda_congo/htt5o0m/
nxyvc	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1642895383.0	htt5rzr	t3_saep2w	t3_saep2w	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saep2w/what_is_the_difference_in_the_nature_of/htt5rzr/
nxyvc	**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642895435.0	htt5wp8	t3_sadiuc	t3_sadiuc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sadiuc/are_there_any_early_examples_of_the_assassination/htt5wp8/

7sxro	I asked myself the exact same question out of pure curiosity. Neither *The Imperial Harem* nor Kate Fleet's *The Cambridge History of Turkey, Vol. II: the Ottomans as a World Power 1453-1603* had a clear answer. I came to the same conclusion as you did: the Ottomans may have thought that executing one or two kids was just the price of doing business, but 19 infants was a bridge too far.   Fleet does mention in *History of Turkey* that “there are hints in some chronicles that the practice of fratricide always displeased the sultan's subjects….” P. 792. Likewise, when Suleiman the Magnificent's two sons began fighting for the throne before Suleiman's death, he said, “you may leave all to God, for it is not man's pleasure, but God's will, that disposes of kingdoms and their government. If He has decreed that you shall have the kingdom after me, no man living will be able to prevent it.” *Imperial Harem*, loc. 789. The more you read about it, the more it seems like the Ottomans considered fratricide an ugly necessity, not an objectively good idea. And yet... they practiced it for 200 years.  What happened to extra brothers after 1595? It “seems to have been public revulsion at the slaughter of [nineteen] princes that put an end to the custom of fratricide and to have initiated the practice of secluding princes so that they could not present a danger to the reigning sultan.” *History of Turkey*, p. 793. “Secluding” feels like a little bit of a euphemism there, because princes were kept under house-arrest in the kafes (Turkish for “cage”), the apartments within the royal harem where unwanted brothers languished under constant surveillance by palace guards. The last Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI, took the throne at age 56; he had lived his entire life until then in the kafes!

7rvatyyv	My point in mentioning the background of the signatories is that when they are clearly biased towards one side like this, they are going to hold a strong opinion on it, and that should make readers take caution. It is similar to noting that the conferences Turkey hosts about the genocide (in which they simply call them "massacres" or some other lesser term): with the overwhelming body of Turkish academia supporting such a view, that is something to take note, and not accept at its face value.  That said, looking at the letter here does raise questions: the most glaring one that jumps out to me is they accuse de Waal of using a narrow scope of dates (1915-1916), while arguing that "most scholars" assert the dates should be much wider (1915-1923). This is far from the truth: most reputable sources would give a range of 1915-1916 or 1917. One of the most authoritative scholars on the genocide, Raymond Kevorkian, uses 1915-1916 in his *The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History* (2011), and as the letter concedes Ronald Grigor Suny uses 1915-1917 in his work on the topic (which I'm assuming refers to his *They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else* (2015); both are scholars of Armenian heritage I'll note, as well.   I'm quite interested in who is using such a late date, and what their justification is, seeing how by 1918 the war with Russia was over, and while the Ottoman forces were invading the Caucasus (en route to Baku), they were stopped by the forces of the First Armenian Republic in a series of battles in May 1918, as well as the diplomatic and military intervention of Germany. Most Armenians were long gone out of Anatolia by that point as well: either dead, dying in the Syrian desert, or as refugees in the newly-formed Armenian state, which was given diplomatic recognition by the Ottoman Empire in June 1918. While there was still some smaller massacres that continued, the focus had shifted as the Ottoman Empire was busy losing the First World War, and would subsequently turn it's attention to killing it's ethnic Greek population, fighting off a Greek invasion related to that, disputing the Treaty of Sevres, and then engaging in a civil war that ended with the formation of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923.	1642896784.0	htt98lo	t3_s68982	t1_htscx3o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htt98lo/

h8ny3uyr	I can’t speak about what the internal Church discussions about the excommunication were, hopefully someone else can.  I can add some information however:   The Catholic Church did do some excommunicating for being a Nazi leader, but it doesn’t appear as if Goebbels was specifically excommunicated for only that.   First, a some background:   Church excommunications of Nazis began in September 1930, when the bishop of Mainz excommunicated every Catholic member of the Nazi party in his diocese, banned uniformed groups from entering churches, and forbade Nazis from taking part in services and ceremonies.   In February 1931, the German bishops had their annual conferences and and decided to support the bishop of Mainz, but limited excommunications to Nazi leaders and activists, and exemptions “followers” who might have supported the Nazi Party for specific policies and without understanding the Nazis’ ultimate goals regarding religion.   In December 1931, Goebbels married. This was the time of his excommunication. While he had considering becoming a priest while younger, by this point he was already quite anti-Christianity, especially against the Catholic Church.   The Church eased its restrictions on Nazi party membership in 1933, at first to accommodate a law requiring all civil employees and union members to be party members, and then as part of maneuvers with the Nazis; cumulating in some public assurances by Hitler and the Reichsconcordant, an agreement signed in July 1933 between the Catholic Church and the German government ostensibly preserving the rights of the Church in Germany (note: Hitler became chancellor in January 1933, and seized full power in 1934). Some Catholics even helped Hitler take power, most prominently Franz von Papen.   With all of this in mind, while his own anti-Church rhetoric and string Nazis ties may well have been preexisting “strikes” that attracted Church attention, I do not believe they were the only reason Goebbels was excommunicated and here is why:  1. His excommunication was not during the general “we excommunicate Nazis leaders as a whole” time of February 1931. His excommunication occurred in at the time of his marriage, in December 1931,. It wasn’t explicitly lifted with the general ban in 1933 either, not even when the Church wasn’t excommunicating Catholics like van Papen for enabling the Nazis to take total power.   2. Geobbels wrote in his diary that he was excommunicated for his marriage, at the time of his marriage. He published an edited version that diary in 1933 before the Nazis took power and when they still the Catholic Church could have been a strong opponent, and then later had all of his diaries processed for posterity, so it is possible that he lied to maintain the fiction that a good Catholic could be a Nazi, but the original, handwritten versions remained, and were published in 2004. They say the same thing.   3. No other major Nazi leaders were excommunicated by name, not even Hitler. Some argue he doesn’t count as he had already made himself an apostate years before so the Church considered him not to be a member, but no one else was excommunicated by name either. If the only reason Geobbels was excommunicated was his Nazi leadership, then why weren’t other Nazis treated similarly?   4. His marriage was going to cause trouble. Catholic canon law from 1917-1983, specifically canon 2319 ​​§1, 1°, said that marrying, baptizing a child, or teaching a child in a belief other than Catholicism was cause for automatic excommunication.    Goebbels married a divorced Protestant, who was only a Protestant herself because she was a Catholic apostate who converted to Protestantism to marry her now ex-husband, in a civil ceremony filled with the leaders of an anti Catholic party, but no priests. This was enough for automatic excommunication, and the high profile of the wedding meant that the Church was sure to know about it.   So why didn’t the Church excommunicate more Nazis?  It is very late for me, and this is in an entire question itself, but the extremely brief answer is that there are two ways to be excommunicated. One didn’t apply most of the time and the other wasn’t worth it to the Church leadership at the time.   The fast way is the automatic way (latae sententiae) that Goebbels did it. Break the wrong church rule, and you get automatic excommunication the moment that you do it. Perhaps there may be some paperwork after the fact, but that is all that it is. You are already out.  Not a lot of what the Nazis did the the pre-war years were covered by these rules. They focused more on internal church matters.  The other is by trial (sententiae ferendae). This is rare, and the existing canon law didn’t apply perfectly to what the Nazis were doing.   Of course it could have been done in some form, as the 1930/31 decisions showed, but the ultimately failed efforts to maintain Church independence in Germany and some ambivalence about some Nazi policies by some in the Church made it not Really Worth It until it was way too late.  Then, the war was on, oppression was already great, Hitler’s ally Mussolini was also a strong church supporter at home in Italy and couldn’t be pushed too far, and then after that, the war was over.

9v6a6	In that case I would say neither. Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, specifically, is not good book in many ways. It is incredibly dated and reflects very outdated scholarship. It is quite an important book in understanding the evolution of historiography on the war, and also has some use as a *primary* source since Shirer was a witness to some of the events, and his presentation of events in the book reflects his own perception of them, but it just isn't useful as a general history of the Third Reich, long surpassed by any number of better works.  The best suggestion I would offer is the three volume 'Third Reich Trilogy' by Richard J. Evans. It is well researched, well written and engaging, and reflects current scholarship much better than Shirer.  As for Inferno, you could do a lot worse than Hastings, although it wouldn't be *my* personal recommendation. It actually is included on the subreddit booklist as one of the recommended introductory works (with praise from Evans, no less), but my preferred recommendation for introductory book on the war is Weinberg's *World at Arms*. Weinberg is a bit thicker a work though, so Hastings offers a lighter read if that is more your pace (and then Jeremy Black's *World War II* offers a even lighter one).  So if you are deadset on picking between those two, go with Hastings. If you are open to alternatives, Evans is definitely the one you would seem best served by.

gde6c	You might be interested in my [answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7adqkp/did_polygenism_play_a_role_in_the_devellopement/dpa291q).  To summarize the key takeaway, natural historians didn't claim to have "discovered" racial difference; the construction of racial categories began much earlier, in the political sphere. Rather, the earliest works of modern taxonomy (e.g. Linnaeus) already took these categories for granted. Physical anthropologists (e.g. Blumenbach) looked for evidence to identify "scientific" ways in which these self-evident categories might be delieanted. This was never a movement or school of thought; it was just part of regular science like everything else. Candie could have picked up most any book and found something with which to justify his views.	1642907588.0	httyf76	t3_sa9sl8	t3_sa9sl8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa9sl8/how_were_new_discoveries_claimed_in_1800s_racial/httyf76/

2rzmr8ac	This is an interesting question and I've seen versions of it posted several times.  If you define modern as 20th century, then there are numerous men from the American West, from 1805 until about 1870, who fall in this category.  They often held a mix of jobs, freelanced or did contract work, were soldiers, scouts, professional hunters and trappers, Indian fighters, etc.    Without knowing whether you're interested in them (or whether you're considering pre-modern to be before \~1500), I'm not sure how much detail to give.    The Lewis & Clark expedition was a government-funded expedition across the Northern Rocky Mountains  to the Oregon coast, and back, kicked off a boom in the fur trade, causing hundreds of men to start trapping, hunting, and exploring the Plains and the Rockies, starting in about 1807.    John Colter was a member of the expedition, and before the expedition got back, he was honorably discharged in North Dakota and joined up with two beaver trappers to lead them ***back*** into Montana. He later became, probably, the explored the area that is now the Grand Teton National Park, possibly parts of Yellowstone, and probably Jackson Hole.  He was probably the first White man to ever visit parts of Yellowstone, and he reported of unimaginable geothermal activity in that area.  He traveled hundreds of miles in the winter by himself.  He both traded and helped Native American tribes, and also fought other tribes.    Kit Carson was in the second wave of trappers. He was mostly in New Mexico and the southern Rockies.  He went on trapping expeditions, fought the Apache, explored into California and Colorado, went on rescue missions, etc. As a mountain man, he had to hunt for his food, and fought grizzly bears.  He worked as a professional hunter (shooting game to feed settlers) at one point, and was in the military during the Mexican-American War and for the Union during the Civil War (during the brief New Mexico campaign).  He was hired by the government as a professional scout for 3 of John Fremont's expeditions mapping the west.     He was involved in many skirmishes/battles with various Native American tribes, and was later an Indian Agent for the government.  He fought in the First Battle of Adobe Walls in Texas against the Kiowa tribe, and led some brutal/harsh campaigns against the Apache and Navajo (basically, genocide). He could not read or write but spoke English, Spanish, and several Native American languages. He was married thrice; his first wife was Arapaho and he fought a duel against a French-Canadian to win her hand in marriage.  His second wife was Cheyenne tribe.  His third wife was Hispanic/Mexican woman. Blood and Thunder by Hampton Sides tells his story; it's an epic tale and so crazy that it seems like fiction. [https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Thunder-Carson-Conquest-American/dp/1400031109](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Thunder-Carson-Conquest-American/dp/1400031109)      Jim Bridger spent about 20 years blazing trails, trapping, guiding, etc. all over the northern Rockies.  He was probably the first White man to see the geysers of Yellowstone.  He explored the Great Salt Lake.  He also fought bears (common thread with these guys). He was hired as a guide by various parties and was a scout for the government during Red Cloud's War.   These are just three of the dozen or so famous mountain men.  This era sorta closed by about 1840 or so, as the beaver population declined and the price of pelts collapsed because men's fashion turned to silk top hats rather than beaver pelt hats. After the Civil War, there were other waves of settlers and men who also provided various contract mercenary type skills (scouting, guiding, professional hunting, providing security to stage coaches, etc.).	1642909100.0	htu1r9m	t3_s9sy3h	t3_s9sy3h	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9sy3h/was_there_anything_in_the_premodern_era_esp/htu1r9m/

6mgfuvle	Please elaborate on the « background » of Henry Theriault who is the first signatory of this letter.   I see you are easily evading the point so I will ask again: would you dare writing that Lempkin is holding a strong opinion and has bias about Nazi Germany when he did his work about the genocide definition, as a Jew?  Many scholars have an armenian background because the whole world closed the topic after the Lausanne treaty. Genocide survivors and their child became the most knowledgeable on the topic for a lot of reasons (documents available in turkish or armenians for instance). During decades western countries were also blocking research on the topic themselves, whether in France or in the USA.   To focus on the actual topic: de Waal has been called out several times for not naming the genocide by its name until very recently. Literally a turkish state behavior, the rest of the world is passed this for decades already. Since then he had to adapt his language and now minimalize the crime or he would not be able to pose as a so-called expert of the region anymore.   Kevorkian and Ternon have been consolidating every piece of knowlege about the 1915-1923 from the beginning to the complete eradication of the armenian civilization, from the young turks to ataturk. The « smaller massacres » happening in 1917-1923 in the ottoman empire and also … in azerbaijan (echoing the repeat from the 2020 war), the laws confiscating the (very large) wealth of armenians are also included part of it. A genocide is not about small or large number of deads, but state planning, intention and actions.   https://www.amazon.com/M%C3%A9morial-g%C3%A9nocide-Arm%C3%A9niens-Raymond-K%C3%A9vorkian/dp/2021139409/ref=nodl_  You can see the french version of wikipedia using the new dates already.	1642910978.0	htu641e	t3_s68982	t1_htt98lo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htu641e/

pncvt	### I: The Weird Mess that is Manchu Demography  Population figures for the Manchus under Qing rule aren't difficult to reconstruct for a historian with access to the source material, but the secondary sources don't always do a lot of in-depth enumerating, particularly for certain periods like the late 18th century where a population figure might be very useful for comparative purposes. It has only been comparatively recently that there has been significant English-language scholarship looking into Manchu demography in depth. Before we continue it is worth pointing out that Manchu demography is tied up in broader Banner demography, producing a bit of a Russian nesting doll sort of issue: the Banners were divided into Manchu Banners, Mongol Banners, and Hanjun ('Martial Han') Banners, and even then the Manchu Banners included a handful of non-Manchu but broadly Tungusic peoples; there were also 'bondservant companies' not organised into full Banners but instead attached to the other Banners, primarily the Manchus. Not all the sources on population figures divide helpfully between those four categories, although the more detailed ones do.  In terms of sources, there are two broad sorts. The most regular are estimates in contemporary writings, which you would hope would give at least a good sense of trends over time. But these tend to vary heavily, in large part because they don't consistently choose the same metric: are they counting just Manchus, or all 'free' Bannermen, or the total population of Bannermen including enslaved and bonded people, and were they excluding unemployed Bannermen or and only counting those in military or civil service? Rarer, but more useful, are a few detailed surveys of the Banner population carried out at the court's behest.  While these surveys are very precise, they are, it should be noted, very precise on one particular bit of data, that being the number of *ding* 丁 (able-bodied males) in the Banners. What we don't know is the dependency ratio, where estimates range from as little as 1:3 to as much as 1:9, with the latter figure generally incorporating slaves and bondservants who formed their own households for some purposes, but were counted in 'free' Manchu households for others. Mark Elliott, in *The Manchu Way* (2001), opts to offer 1:3 as a low-end estimate, and 1:6 as a high-end estimate. Using the precise breakdowns found in Qing documents in 1648 and 1720, he gives the following figures:  Year | Manchus | Mongols | Hanjun | Bondservants and Others -|-|-|-|- 1648 | 206,961-389,436  | 107,729-202,712 | 171,591-322,881 | 812,002-1,527,937 1720 | 576,786-1,083,480 | 230,508-433,747 | 766,279-1,442,747 | 1,025,202-1,929,113  What complicates these figures further is that not all bondservants were Han. Indeed, perhaps half would have been Manchus at the time these sets of data were compiled. Which means that while the 'free' Manchu population would have gone from around 200-400k to 570k-1m, the *total* Manchu population would likely have been closer to 600k-1.1m in 1648, and 1.1m-2m in 1720.  David Porter carries the demographic data through into the nineteenth century, though he only counts *ding* and avoids the dependency issue; I've reproduce his data, in conjunction with An's, below:  Year | Manchus | Mongols | Hanjun | Bondservants and Slaves | 'Post-Conquest Han'* | Misc. Others* -|-|-|-|-|-|- 1648 | 55,330 | 28,785 | 45,849 | 216,967 |  1657 | 49,695 | 26,053 | 78,782 | 237,338 | 1720 | 154,117 | 61,562 | 204,870 | 239,494 | 34,440 | 5,577 1788 | 201,373 | 72,761 | 148,945 | 67,608 | 31,635 | 6,353 1818 | 222,968 | 72,128 | 143,554 | 50,163 | 29,893 | 4,346 1887 | 229,011 | 75,367 | 143,322 | 27,172 | 32,680 | 4,796  \* Where known  What is important to note is the decline in both Hanjun and bondservant categories there: the late Qianlong period saw a substantial effort to expel certain non-Manchus and Mongols from the Banners for reasons that are debated and which I won't really get into now; then in the nineteenth century there was a substantial reduction in numbers of bondservants and slaves in the Banners. This complicates things as far as Manchu demography goes. Porter suggests bondservants were overwhelmingly Han, which was probably true for his period of coverage in the later eighteenth into nineteenth centuries, but in the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods at least, it seems plausible enough – albeit near-impossible to definitively prove – that most bondservants were ethnically Manchu, but that there was a gradual move to elevate ethnic-Manchu bondservant companies into the ranks of the 'free' Manchu Banners. This, then, means that the shorthand of adding half the bondservants probably no longer works past a certain point, and there seems to be no clear answer on what the ethnic makeup of the bondservant companies was after their dramatic slashing in the Qianlong reign.  Still, assuming we can reuse the 1:3 to 1:6 dependency ratios, then I'd give as estimates for the Manchu population in 1788, 1818 and 1887, rounding to 3 significant figures:  Year | Excluding Bondservants | Assuming 50% of Bondservants are Manchu -|-|-  1788 | 805,000-1,410,000 | 941,000-1,650,000 1818 | 892,000-1,560,000 | 992,000-1,740,000 1887 | 916,000-1,600,000 | 970,000-1,700,000  With all that, then, it seems reasonable to say that by the end of the Qing, the Manchu population was somewhere in the realm of that 1887 estimate, probably a bit larger.  Now, a fair point that can be raised is that this is the *total* number of Manchus in the entirety of the Qing, not just those in China proper. Elliott, unfortunately, only looks at China Proper and doesn't give any figures for Bannermen in Manchuria/the Northeast or in Xinjiang. There is a breakdown of troop deployments by Rhoads, based on the 1887 Banner census and Thomas Wade's 1825 report on the Qing military, although he seems to use 'northwest China' to cover the garrisons in Xinjiang and Mongolia, not just what we would more conventionally term 'northwest China' (i.e. Gansu, Shaanxi, and environs). Per Rhoads, of 260,000 deployed Banner troops, 150,000 were in Beijing and 110,000 were not. Of these 110,000, 16,000 are placed by Rhoads in 'northwest China', and 37,000 in Manchuria. Checking Wade's figures, based on the 1825 Banner payrolls, of 236,000 privates there were about 13,600 in 'Turkestan' (i.e. presumably both Mongolia and Xinjiang) and 40,800 in Manchuria, which would seem to affirm the above read of Rhoads' categorisation. So in short, in 1887 there were around 207,000 Banner troops in China Proper and 53,000 in other parts of the empire; assuming (not entirely correctly) a homogeneous ethnic distribution, that'd mean 80% of the Banner population was in China proper, which in absolute numbers would be about 700,000-1,350,000 people.	1642923346.0	htusqfz	t3_s9ugbx	t3_s9ugbx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9ugbx/about_how_many_manchus_lived_in_china_proper/htusqfz/
pncvt	### II: Movement to China Proper  We need to understand that Manchus did not have a particularly substantial degree of economic or political freedom under Qing rule. Bannermen were, discursively, 'slaves of the emperor', though we need to comprehend this within broader Northeast Asian discourses of slavery. I discuss these at greater length [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jy7m9j/did_china_ever_have_slavery/gd2j5r1/), but in short, pre-conquest Jurchen/Manchu society was nominally organised as basically a pyramid of political and economic bondage, in which freeholders (*jušen*) were subordinated to elites (*irgen*) in what was understood to be the same way that slaves (*aha*) and household servants (*booi*) were themselves bonded to the freeholders; in turn, higher-level political leaders claimed to exercise the same kind of authority over the mid-level elites. While the stratification of Manchu society eroded considerably in the decades after the conquest of China, the discursive idea of bondage to the will of the leader remained: the emperor was understood as holding authority over the lives of the Bannermen at a fundamentally intimate level.  As such, Manchus didn't *choose* to migrate to China proper as such. Because all Manchus were in the Banners, they were, at least from a legal standpoint, bound to the emperor's will. As such, those who were not assigned to the Manchurian garrisons were *ordered* to relocate to China Proper and settle primarily in Beijing. The subsequent dispersal of the Banners into provincial garrisons is an interesting point in itself, as originally, Bannermen were supposed to be rotated in and out of these garrisons on the regular. The problem, however, was that this was not particularly practicable without state subsidies, and it also raised quite a serious *moral* problem because of the practicalities of, well, human mortality – like many other societies in the broader Asian region, Manchu burial practices emphasised burying families together, and if a member of a household died during a provincial posting and had to be buried there, the rest of the family would find themselves having to leave their loved one's grave behind. The eventual 'fixing' of the garrisons, then, was never fully intended, but emerged as a practical consequence of their creation in the first place.  Why have these garrisons at all? To put it simply, the Qing were basically an occupying force. With the Banners being the loyal soldier-administrator caste of the empire, their distribution in populous and/or strategically-vital locations was a critical part of maintaining state security. This was in fact not a fundamental Qing innovation, as earlier 'conquest dynasties', most prominently the Jurchen Jin and Mongol Yuan, had also established interior garrison forces, implicitly out of fear of domestic insurrection. Such fears were far from unfounded: rebellions of various origin would plague the Qing for most of their existence, and even if we only count Han uprisings, the longest reprieve was between 1683 and 1774 – a good run, to be sure, but one in which there were nevertheless notable revolt scares, particularly the Zeng Jing conspiracy of 1727 and the queue-cutting panic of 1768. As the elite mobile arm of the Qing military, the Banners were expected to be able to decisively respond to domestic crisis when called upon.  ### Sources and Further Reading  * Mark C.

2i47exce	Ugh, I meant Mehmed who killed 19 brothers, not Murad.  I'm sorry to sound like a broken record, but wow...house arrest from birth. What kind of staff did the princes have and were they able to talk with people or have families at all, since they were kept in the harem?   You know, I remember hearing about a guy who was kept in a hole in the ground and when they needed him to become Sultan (I think), they hoisted him up and he was terrified to leave the only place he ever knew his whole life. It also doesn't seem like he got to talk with anyone or was educated at all. How was Sultan Mehmed VI after the kafes? I'll have to look him up...	1642927488.0	htuy9x8	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htt8ow5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/htuy9x8/

If possible, please rephrase the question so that it does not call for such speculation, and resubmit. Otherwise, this sort of thing is better suited for /r/HistoryWhatIf or /r/HistoricalWhatIf. You can find a more in-depth discussion of this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1jym/rules_roundtable_vi_no_historical_whatif/).	1642928997.0	htv07v9	t3_sap8lv	t3_sap8lv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sap8lv/what_would_churchill_think_of_britain_today/htv07v9/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).  Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.   Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642929306.0	htv0m1y	t3_sap5vh	t3_sap5vh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sap5vh/who_is_the_most_ancient_person_to_be_referenced/htv0m1y/

3zulbep4	>explain why megafauna also went extinct around the globe in areas with prior interactions with humans  OK, one question. The last glacial period started 115,000 years ago.  The big migrations that led to modern homo sapiens sapiens populating the world started 70 kya.  These migrants seem to have been more sophisticated hunters than the Neanderthals and co.  Could this have made the difference, combined with the disruptive effects of the climatic changes?  Or was there something unusual about the most recent de-glaciation, to explain why the previous ones didn't cause the same level of extinction?  I realize anatomically modern humans made it into the Middle East before the previous interglacial, but from what I recall those were not as sophisticated as the later wave - their tools weren't much different from the Neanderthals.  I hope I didn't get any of that wrong.  It was a while ago that I read about most of it.	1642934905.0	htv7rgj	t3_s462tw	t1_htcu1t9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s462tw/native_americans_and_horses_were_both_in_america/htv7rgj/

8rkx9	I have not run into this in primary sources dating to the nineteenth century. It does occur in later primary sources - movies and TV - but these have nothing to do with the actual West. Movies and TV are accurate primary sources when attempting to understand the "Wild West," a place that did not exist in the nineteenth century.  In 1859, [Hank Monk](https://www.academia.edu/40105570/Mark_Twains_Wild_West_and_the_Presidential_Election_of_1872) drove Horace Greeley across the Sierra 40 miles in four hours, but that was on a road that, while not perfect, was at least prepared to a certain extent.   Riding in a wehicle drawn by a team with horses changed every ten miles (every hour) is one thing, riding a horse is another. Similar surprising feats of speed were achieved by the Pony Express, but here again, riders changed horses throughout their ride as they covered considerable distances in a single day.  How far one could travel in a day on a single horse depended a lot of terrain, and the West is a very large place, so the answer to your question could vary a great deal depending on the circumstance.   People still talk about a certain town being "an hour away." That is understood locally because people tend to decribe the distances they know in terms of time rather then miles. That said, "an hour away" means something very different when considering traffic issues in the Los Angeles area (where "an hour away" might mean 5 miles away) as opposed to that same time in the rural intermountain West (where "an hour away" may translate into 70 miles). There are many Wests, and the asnwer to your question would depend on the local situation.	1642939339.0	htvdlty	t3_saj82j	t3_saj82j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saj82j/old_west_1800s_what_did_it_mean_when_some_one/htvdlty/

3rm66p	There was this anime about rakugo performers where a lot of emphasis is put on their names: the name they were given when they became apprentices, the one they were given (or chose) when they became full fledged performers, and the struggles about inheriting the master's name. Basically, the names define both who you are now and your vision of your art and future artistic routes. The Anime is set in the showa era, so very recent, but rakugo, sumo, tea cerimony, etc, those are all perceived traditional arts. Is this custom meaningful still in perceived modern or imported form of art?	1642943209.0	htvj7g6	t3_sa52pf	t1_hts3zq3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa52pf/japanese_artist_hokusai_was_known_by_at_least/htvj7g6/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.

hiag0s4	I think more can be said but here is a similar question with a good answer. (I assume the comparison is criminal organizations in other countries, but this might want to be clarified if it isn’t correct).   * [Why is organized crime such as Yakuza still thriving but Al-Capone style Italian mob disappeared?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/oir2xr/why_is_organized_crime_such_as_yakuza_still/) answered by u/blackflag415  The gist is that the government and others found the yakuza useful at times. Thus politics, business, and underworld elements interacted for their own ends. So echoing the answer, Japan is just structurally and institutionally different. Here is also an answer regarding the use of the yakuza.   * [I heard that the Japanese government in 60s/70s used the Yakuza to break up union strikes, fight against protesters, etc. Is there any truth to this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8vhl47/i_heard_that_the_japanese_government_in_60s70s/) answered by u/Vox-Triarii  In regards to the origin of the yakuza, I agree more with this answer than the idea the centuries old *samurai* lineage. Some of the modern organizations were just underworld developments, but like the answers (above) attest there isn’t one yakuza.   * [The origin of the yakuza is often cited to be ronin, or masterless samurai. To what extent is this true, and how did they make the transition from Edo-period samurai to modern-day criminal organizations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nlkiom/the_origin_of_the_yakuza_is_often_cited_to_be/) answered by u/foppery-andwhim	1642946094.0	htvo95w	t3_s648hv	t3_s648hv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s648hv/what_were_the_factors_that_allowed_the_yakuza_of/htvo95w/

I did read that there was some memorial which mentioned all the battles they had won and cities captured (like Moscow 1812), but can anyone confirm this and tell me where it is?*	1642947788.0	htvrii3	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htvrii3/

7helxsbg	Thank you for the answer! So if I'm getting it right, it wasn't so much that medieval kings ever outright said "go do this job or we'll kill you," but due to a plethora of societal and legal restrictions it was the only real way for jewish people to make a decent living without also having to assimilate, and medieval christian rulers had an interest in keeping them pigeonholed in that role?	1642948371.0	htvso0m	t3_s4xi7r	t1_htrldfb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4xi7r/were_jewish_people_in_medieval_europe_forced_into/htvso0m/

88vwr8h8	My pleasure! Broadly speaking, yes, your summation is correct.  Obviously my answer is very much looking at the ‘big picture’, and there were specific instances of some Jews having more or less liberty (than other Jews) in certain regions and under certain monarchs.  It’s also important to note than many Jews didn’t make a ‘decent’ living, but just managed to scrape by. And — As the 1290 expulsion from England illustrates so starkly — even the wealthiest Jews were always only one edict away from becoming destitute, or dead, with no recourse whatsoever.  Jews being explicitly forced to do literal ‘dirty work’ has been seen from time-to-time, but was actually more common in the lands of the Islamic Caliphate than in Christendom, eg. Jews were known to have sometimes been forced to clear animal carcasses from roads and towns, and to clean latrines of Muslims, exemplified by the so-called ‘dung-gatherers decree’ in 19th century Yemen.	1642949474.0	htvv0hu	t3_s4xi7r	t1_htvso0m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4xi7r/were_jewish_people_in_medieval_europe_forced_into/htvv0hu/
7cg9y	While not utterly wrong, my answer there -- from seven years ago -- is certainly not up to snuff with current r/AskHistorians answers. I don't think you should link it.  I would not feel comfortable answering this question here today. If I did anyways, I would answer it fundamentally differently. E.g. I would put more emphasis on the imposition of imperial education in the British empire and the extent to which it often was not at all a free choice for schoolchildren to learn English as opposed to other languages.  The one-sentence answer is still that English became the global language because it was first the language of the British empire and afterwards the language of the American 'empire'. (And I'll stand by saying that any suggestion that it had something to do with the linguistic qualities of English is historical nonsense.)  But the five-paragraph answer needs to take into account the distinction between different spheres of communication. The history of English becoming the dominant language of science is different from that of English becoming the dominant language of diplomacy which is different from that of English becoming the dominant language of tourists, etc.  The history of Japan is an interesting example. Up until roughly 1858 the dominant European language being studied in Japan was Dutch, as part of the so-called *rangaku* where Western science was acquired by way of Dutch-language books. After the US deployed gunboat diplomacy to 'open' Japan to the world, English soon eclipsed Dutch, a switch later consolidated and entrenched by the US post-war occupation.  Every country/region in the world will have its own history with the English language. A proper answer needs to take that into account, which my old answer there really did not.	1642949560.0	htvv79m	t3_s8kn8b	t1_htvmuj6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kn8b/how_did_english_become_a_global_language/htvv79m/

Plus upper class women, especially royalty, had social duties and breastfeed was a time-consuming process that took away from that.

43nj0	  The Celts are a very broad term as you had Celtic peoples from Ireland to Turkey. But the Celts that we're talking about are the Gaels who populated Ireland, Man, and Scotland and whose descendants live there today.  According to historian Ronald Hutton in "The Stations of the Sun", evidence is scant on Samhain in pre-Christian times. We know from early Christian monks writing about the Irish that their folklore viewed Samhain to be significant. But that's about all we know.  It's likely that a great deal of the association with the dead and spooky things originated from the Christian festivals of All Saints Day and All Souls Day.  Despite modern Pagans believing otherwise, the historical record doesn't indicate that it was a Celtic New Year.  There just isn't enough information but as Hutton's work shows, it rarely validates the beliefs of modern NeoPagans.	1642951764.0	htw07hl	t3_sadqw0	t3_sadqw0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sadqw0/how_much_evidence_do_we_have_that_there_actually/htw07hl/

9jwvl	It's a privilege and honor that you're taken time to talk to us. Thank you so very much.  So, I know that China is outside of your expertise, but I was curious more about a general phenomenon I've seen occur in things like the Three Body Problem and more pop-cultural, Star Wars, where I've seen 2 seemingly disparate and interrelated philosophies and cultural mainstays blend and meld together, as if they were always a part of one another.  So, my question is: when a work of fiction gains a fandom in a new area or culture that may have some pretty significant cultural gaps from its origins, how are these stories able to form connections with fans in the new region or culture, and what are some of the reasons they don't?  To add on to that, how can things that the fandom in the new area or culture add to the original work that can then influence both the author and fandom where it was created? Also, what can prevent these new interpretations also fail to resonate?	1642952869.0	htw2wm3	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw2wm3/
kfhe9	In the case of French Indochina (and French colonies) I have answered a related question in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/n4zdis/during_the_colonial_era_did_european_nations_make/) that gives a general view of colonial education with a brief mention on those "natives" who were sent to France to study.  The reasons why colonial authorities wanted to send colonial subjects to study in France were multiple.   * They needed trustworthy, reliable, and well-trained native people to interface with the local populations. The colonial education systems were generally not up to the task when it came to higher education.   * It was a way to reward friendly elites for their collaboration with colonial powers: royal families, aristocrats, chiefs, administrators, mandarins, military officers, scholars, landowners, merchants, etc. Some of those families *wanted* to send their children to France, and it was good policy to satisfy them. In some cases, such families had already been rewarded with their naturalization as French citizens.   * In the early decades of colonisation, keeping in France the sons of local political figures ensured the compliance of the fathers: those "students" were to some extent "hostages" (in Africa, some early colonial schools were actually called, at first, "schools of hostages")  * French-educated *indigènes* were the proof that France wanted the best for its African and Asian subjects, and they could be paraded in colonial propaganda: the civilising mission was making progress. Even colonial newspapers praised those bright individuals who had obtained a doctorate in France or passed the difficult *agrégation* exam that allowed them to become professors in France.   Colonial authorities were well aware of the potential danger of sending their young subjects to study in the metropole. Many believed that educating colonized subjects above a certain level was fundamentally problematic. Informed by scientific racism, some colonial theorists were convinced that non-white people were at best "parrots" whose brains were not equipped to process the superior knowledge provided by Western education (there were also doubts of this sort about poor people and women). If colonized subjects were provided with the same education as regular French people, they would become *déclassés*, embittered and angry, and likely to turn against France. In 1889, explorer and anthropologist Gustave Le Bon reminded his audience at the *Congrès Colonial International* that "the war-cry of the educated Hindus instructed by the English [was] 'India for the Hindus'" (see my [previous answer here about the concept of assimilation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pco9sz/this_fb_post_says_all_francophone_africans_know/hd6qrrd/)). Later, a figure like Nguyễn An Ninh, the Sorbonne-educated intellectual turned anticolonialist in the 1920s, was a perfect example of how the higher French education system could turn someone from a reliable background into a subversive. Meeting Ninh in 1924, the Governor of Cochinchina Maurice Cognacq told him bluntly that "we do not want intellectuals".   For French authorities, it was already difficult to control the education of colonial subjects in the colonies, but controlling those people *in France* was harder. Screening potential students was useless if they could be "contaminated" by the wrong ideas when they arrived on French soil. This was not just a problem with students: workers and soldiers (notably those who came to fight in WW1 and WW2) could become tainted too. In the metropole, colonial subjects were no longer ruled by the *code de l'indigénat* - the special penal code designed for the colonized - and could enjoy the full extent of the Liberty, Equality, Fraternity motto. And they did: colonial subjects in France were treated (almost) as normal human beings.  French authorities took serious precautions when it came to accepting colonial subjects in French metropolitan schools. Only a few candidates were granted access and they had to be vetted by colonial authorities. One could not just board a ship, go to France, and expect to be admitted in a French school, though this eventually happened in the 1920s. Typically, one had to be an individual exceptional enough to be given a scholarship, or/and to be from a family known to be friendly to colonial authorities.  This is demonstrated by the case of Hồ Chí Minh, who was *not* sent to France for his education: the son of minor mandarin, he went instead to the "Franco-Annamite" schools in Indochina that were set up for the colonized. He was eventually enrolled at the Quốc Học high school in Huế, a relatively prestigious establishment from which he was expelled for his political activities. He then left Indochina and travelled around the world as a sailor. In September 1911, while his ship was docked in Marseilles, he wrote a letter to the president of the French Republic, requiring assistance to be admitted in the Ecole Coloniale in Paris:  > I am entirely without resources and very eager to receive an education. I would like to become useful to France with regard to my compatriots, and at the same time to enable them to profit from instruction.  The Ecole Coloniale had been established in 1885 to train colonial admnistrators, and it included a "native" section for colonial subjects. Hồ's application was turned down by the school, on the ground that its regulations required that candidates had to be recommended by the governor-general of Indochina. This was obviously not the case for Hồ Chí Minh: not only he was already known as a potential rebel, but his father was disgraced, having spent time in jail for killing a man.   An example of exceptional individual who could be accepted in French schools was the painter Lê Văn Miến, who had been enrolled at the Ecole Coloniale and later at the Fine-Arts School in Paris in the late 1800s. Though Miến could be critical of colonial policies, he was appreciated (and protected) in colonial circles, and, back in Indochina as an art teacher at the Quốc Học high school, he spoke glowingly of France to his students... including to the young Hồ, which may explain the latter's willingness to go to France to receive a higher education at the Ecole Coloniale.    An example of collaborator family - among many - was that of Đỗ Hữu Phương, a rich civil administrator in Cholon, famous for organizing spectacular Franco-Vietnamese banquets. He married his daughter to a French lawyer and was able to send his sons to France to study in prestigious schools, such as Jeanson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand. His son Đỗ Hữu Vị was admitted in the Saint-Cyr military school and became a captain in the French army. He was the first Vietnamese aviator and fighter pilot.  I have written in a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ot13h5/question_travel_from_africa_to_france_in_the_1880s/h9nuv6z/) of the situation of North/Subsaharan African students in France in the 19th century, and it fits this general pattern, with the additional twist that in some cases the students were also virtual "hostages" (at least in the mid to late 1800s).  So there was indeed an ongoing debate in colonial circles about the pros and cons of education, and particularly of higher education in France. In 1930, the demonstrations of Vietnamese left-wing activists in Paris resulted in the governement trying to stem the flow of *indigène* students and to control more tightly those already in France. This was partly successful, but to some extent too late, as anticolonialist ideas had already taken root.    In any case, most of those students did not turn into fiery revolutionaries. Some did, but many went to work for France, including in the colonial administration. The careers of Léopold Sédar Senghor and Amadou Lamine-Guèye in Sénégal, or of Nguyễn Văn Huyên in Vietnam, for instance, show how one could become part of the colonial apparatus, be critical of colonialism, and later play a major role in the newly independent governments.

nz52j	>  My book discusses the differences and similarities in how white Americans and Europeans saw the West and Indigenous cultures, and the fan communities that they built around Western stories, particularly those of best-selling German author Karl May and Laura Ingalls Wilder.  I too grew up in Europe reading these books, as well as their Dutch knock-off equivalents. But by the 80s, the impression I got was that Dutch children in my age group got most of their perception and understanding of the "wild west" from the (French) Lucky Luke comic books, which were incredibly popular. I was seen as a bit odd for reading the old-fashioned Laura and Old Shatterhand novels.  So my first question is: Did you study the influence of these comics on European perceptions in the post WW2 era? (I have no idea if these comics were popular in the US.) Or did these come too late to be covered by your research?  > My book discusses the differences and similarities in how white Americans and Europeans saw the West and Indigenous cultures  My second question is if you could elaborate a bit on these differences and similarities. My personal recollection is that as a child I read these books vaguely rooting for the Amerian Indian characters, which were often depicted in a kind of "noble savage" cliché way and seemed to be the underdogs. but I have no idea if that was a typical reaction, and if that was the same in Europe and the US or not.	1642953669.0	htw4ww0	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw4ww0/

kv2bx7	Thank you for doing an AMA Dr. Reagin!  I studied in Germany several years ago during Karneval, and I was surprised to see ethnic Germans wearing "Native American" costumes in a parade.

bkb37	Thanks for joining us, Dr. Reagin!  Since you offered it up as a potential topic, I'd love to hear about how Indigenous people have  responded to US and German reenactment and fetishization of their culture, and if indeed their interaction might not be best described by a more active word than "reacted".  I also wondered, as someone interested in historical reenactment myself (and who wears a lot of vintage clothing), if you could shed any light on what the US and German reenactors have thought about reenactment philosophically and if that's evolved at all. In the WWII reenacting community, I've seen first-hand, there's a lot of talk of "respecting the guys" (yes, almost always "guys") who fought in the war, honoring their sacrifices and supposedly gaining a better historical understanding of their experience by experiencing similar physical hardship, when in fact there's always been an underlying element of wanting to go out and play soldier in some fun clothes in the woods with your friends for a weekend. (Not even going to touch on how worrying it is to hear things like that from the German reenactors.)  So what I wonder, then, is whether Western reenactors in the US and Germany make similar claims to authenticity? To they see their practice as a way of "doing history", of similar validity to actual historical analysis, the way WWII reenactors often do? What does "authenticity" look like to Western reenactors, and is attaining "authenticity", material or otherwise, supposed to generate an intimate understanding of the past in the same way WWII reenactors claim?	1642955006.0	htw895x	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw895x/

iovlhi6b	Thanks for that welcome!  I'm afraid that I haven't come across information about Western fans or reenactment in the Phillipines; my research has focused largely on these fandoms in Central Europe and the United States.  Civil War reenactment has become a global phenomenon, however, and it would not at all surprise me if there were groups in your country who pursue this hobby.  I'd recommend Stephen Gapp's work if you're interested in that topic.  He's an Australian historian and active reenactor who looks at the history of military historical reenactment in his nation and globally.  He notes that reenactment focused around another nation's history (and the US Civil War is a popular example) can seem less politically problematic to potential reenactment hobbyists, since it doesn't touch on politically controversial events or issues in the hobbyists's own national history.  That might be part of the explanation for the shift to Civil War reenactment among some German hobbyists, who were previously Western reenactors.  But I think that a stronger reason is that after 1990, the increasing presence and voices of Indigenous North Americans in Germany changed how East German hobbyists engaged with their hobbies.  Earlier generations of fans who reenacted both cowboy and Native American roles had often seen their recreations of Indigenous cultures as helping to preserve what most German Western fans saw as "dying" cultures.  Karl May, one of the most popular German authors of Westerns who had a huge fan following, introduced Indigenous cultures in his earliest works as "vanishing" peoples, who were being brutally eradicated by white American settlers.  But by the late 20th century, the increasing presence of Indigenous North Americans in reunified Germany made it clear that this was not the case, and that the recreation of Indigenous material culture would often be seen as inappropriate, and as cultural appropriation.  After 2000, many German Western reenactors drew back from the public sphere, or sometimes redefined their hobbies.  Some German Western reenactors have gravitated toward recreation of the American Civil War in recent decades. Civil War roleplay can serve the interpretive functions that many German reenactors now find most compelling.  Germans hobbyists from former East Germany  often take the role of Confederates in these reenactments, since Southerners (from their point of view) represent values that resonate with them.  One such hobbyist explained his preference for Confederate roles by saying that in East Germany before the fall of the Wall, he and his friends had been "rebels" against the East German state, and that "the Southerners were rebels."  Another person who grew up in East Germany's Western hobbyist fandom pointed out to me that a key part of their attraction to the fandom had been Western films, which inspired some fans to join reenactment groups.  In those films, he noted, the enemies of Native characters always wore Union uniforms; people who identified with Indigenous North Americans, he said, might gravitate to Confederate roles.  Of course, Southern white had violently displaced Indigenous cultures in the American Southeast well before the Civil War, but this never appeared in the films, he observed.   German hobbyists (like Civil War reenactors in other nations) can pick and choose from a menu of symbols, artifacts, and values associated with each side in the American Civil War and use them as vehicles to express their own regional and personal identities.	1642955313.0	htw90zc	t3_savz63	t1_htw168o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw90zc/

1liuwkln	Thanks for this; as a USian, I was surprised but also fascinated when I learned about the phenomenon you write about.  Now, I'm surprised to learn about the East German Civil War reenactors. I would have supposed that would have happened in a slightly earlier moment. Can you talk about the connections between race and the Cold War in the context of German western historical reenactment? And how did these differences play out different across East and West Germany? Did those differences manifest differently across decades (for example, cold war contestations about Jim Crow versus Apartheid)?	1642955688.0	htw9zrr	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw9zrr/
iovlhi6b	Your cousins' responses were not unusual.  Representations of North American First Nations in German novels, films, and other entertainments were typically purely historical, and often romanticized and inaccurate.  The rise in the value of the German Mark compared to the dollar after 1980 and the end of travel restrictions on East Germans after Germany's reunification meant that many more ordinary Germans traveled to North America during the 1980s and 1990s, and were thus more exposed to modern Indigenous cultures.  Germans' perceptions of the Indigenous peoples they met challenged their earlier, historic or fictionalized stereotypes about these cultures, offering German tourists more modern images, including lifestyles that were not as different from their own as some might have hoped to see.  For more on this, I'd recommend H.

34ekm	My step-great grandmother was a huge Louie L’Amour fan.   Is it a fair assessment that L’Amour’s fandom has transcended generations—at least perhaps from the generation before Baby Boomers possibly to some of Gen X? Does he still have much of a fan base? A NY Times article from 1998 after his death indicated he was still in print and in high circulation at that.	1642956502.0	htwc2za	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwc2za/
iovlhi6b	Good question, and I'd agree with your characterization of this as a "chicken and egg" question. Germans emigrated to many nations during the 19th century, but particularly to the U.S. and Canada, and these settlers became part of a transnational German culture.  They founded German-language presses, whose reports on Indigenous peoples were read in Germany. Some Germans, like author Rudolf Cronau,  visited the United States and met with Indigenous peoples, and then  embarked on lecture tours back home in Germany, or sold art depicting the West, or published successful novels and travel literature.  There was clearly an audience for these types of travel literature/lectures/art, Germans who had already read the novels of James Fenimore Cooper (whose *Leatherstocking Tales* were popular in Germany) along with readers of German authors of Westerns like Friedrich Gerstaecker and Balduin Moellhausen.   For more on the role of German settlers in a transnational German culture, I'd recommend H. Glenn Penny's *Kindred by Choice.*	1642956519.0	htwc4l3	t3_savz63	t1_htw1se0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwc4l3/

168sly	>" British South Africa vs Apartheid South Africa"  I will leave it to someone more knowledgeable to talk about Southeast Asia, but I feel like I need to speak up about southern Africa, because I think this is a false comparison.   If we're specifically talking about Apartheid South Africa, we're talking about a system of racial laws that were instituted after the 1948 South African elections, and dismantled in the late 1980s-early 1990s, more or less ending with the ANC victory in the 1994 election (although vast racial disparities continue to this day). I find it hard to specifically blame that on Dutch colonial rule given that the Dutch specifically only controlled a Cape colony (roughly similar in area to today's Western Cape), and that was occupied by the British in 1806, and formally ceded to Britain in 1814, almost a century and a half before 1948. The Dutch never controlled areas like KwaZulu-Natal, Transvaal or Free State.  Of course, those areas *were* conquered and settled by Afrikaner Voortrekkers in the 19th century. But there's two points here. It's inaccurate to call Afrikaners "Dutch" as if the two nationalities were synonymous. Afrikaans is a separate language from Dutch, not a regional dialect, and so while I personally can't speak to their mutual intelligibility between native speakers this is different even from, say, American English and British English, and even with that example it would be a little inaccurate if we were talking about Anglo American colonialism as synonymous with British Colonialism.   Another point of inaccuracy is that if we're talking about British South Africa as specifically South Africa as a British colony, versus Apartheid South Africa after 1948, it's not exactly different people. Meaning it's not like South Africa was run by Brits or English speakers prior to 1948 and Afrikaners after. It was mostly Afrikaners in both periods.   A specific example would be Jan Smuts. Smuts was born in Capetown, moved to Transvaal, and worked with the Transvaal government during the Second Boer War, eventually even commanding troops in the later stages of the war. After the war's end, the Union of South Africa was negotiated and initiated by 1910, which combined the then-four British colonies in South Africa into a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire, similar in ways to Canada, New Zealand or Australia. Louis Botha (a former Transvaal Prime Minister and Boer War general) became the first Prime Minister of the Union, but Smuts was part of his government, and would later be Prime Minister himself for huge chunks of the period before 1948. Which is to say, the British Empire Dominion was largely run by Afrikaners.  So what changed in 1948? Basically a paradigm-shifting election upset. Without getting too into the weeds, Smuts at the time was still Prime Minister, and in charge of the United Party. South Africa at this point had an almost completely whites-only electorate and quite a degree of segregation, but there were fears among segments of the white electorate that the United Party would give in to gradual changes to this. The National Party promised much stricter segregation, and won a legislative majority with a minority of the vote (much less than votes for the United Party), mostly by winning rural electoral districts. I leave it to the reader to draw any comparisons there to other countries and their elections. The National Party would go on to win every South African election until 1994, and to construct (and eventually dismantle) the legal framework for Apartheid.   Even a comparison between British *Southern* Africa (so not South Africa Proper) and Apartheid South Africa is probably not really useful. For most of the British possessions in Southern Africa had extremely tiny resident white populations, and the one exception - Southern Rhodesia - had a system of white rule that was similar to South Africa's. You could argue that Rhodesia was in many ways worse, as the white population was smaller - something like 5% of the total population at most, compared to white South Africans making up about 20% of the population in 1910 and 10% in 1990, and was very violent in its initial conquest of the territory and in the maintenance of control from 1965 to 1980.  So - I don't think we can really discuss Apartheid South Africa when comparing how the Dutch colonial and British colonial empires were run. Dutch colonial rule was restricted to the Cape Colony (a possession of the Dutch East India Company) from the 1650s to the early 19th century, and many of its particulars of that period (warfare against indigenous people, use of slave labor and an expanding settlement of white "free citizens") honestly wasn't qualitatively different from British colonies of the 17th and 18th centuries.	1642956715.0	htwcn48	t3_sakj6q	t3_sakj6q	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sakj6q/why_were_the_dutch_such_brutal_colonialists/htwcn48/
aqxu6	Thank you for this AMA!  Since you mention the post-reunification transition of German Western reenactors toward American Civil War reenactment, I'm very interested in your thoughts on [a disturbing and incendiary claim](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/06/confederates-on-the-rhine/239724) that Professor Wolfgang Hochbruck made about the motivations of some German reenactors who preferred to reenact the Confederate Army:  > Wolfgang Hochbruck, a Professor of American Studies at the University of Freiburg and a Union reenactor, is less charitable. "I think some of the Confederate reenactors in Germany are acting out Nazi fantasies of racial superiority," he told author Tony Horwitz. "They are obsessed with your war because they cannot celebrate their own vanquished racists." It's an unsettling thought.  Could you respond to Professor Hochbruck's claim? Do "fantasies of racial superiority" and a suppressed desire to celebrate Nazi achievements motivate a significant part of the German Confederate reenactor community? Or is the motivation to be found elsewhere? Are there any points of connection between German Confederate reenactment and far-right politics?  Thanks again for your time!	1642956967.0	htwdb30	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwdb30/
dmjyd	I've heard before that a lot of (white?) American stereotypes about Native people can be traced back to Tacitus' book "Germanica" and ideas he had about Germanic peoples. Do German reenactors themselves see or draw similarities between the Indigenous-colonizer dynamic and the German-Roman dynamic?	1642956968.0	htwdb5r	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwdb5r/
i8393	Dud rates between German and Allied bombs seem to have been roughly comparable. British bomb surveys indicate a roughly 10% rate of failure for German bombs over the country. Modern estimates, meanwhile, suggest that somewhere between 10-20% of Allied bombs dropped on Germany were duds. This similarity suggests that a disparity in the dud rates between Allied and German bombs can't explain why there are more stories about Allied duds in Germany than the opposite. To explain this, we have to look elsewhere.  The simplest answer is that many more bombs were dropped on Germany than on Britain. The Allied strategic bomber offensive in Europe dropped something in the region of 2.5 million tons of bombs. Of these, about 1.5 million were targeted on Germany. In return, the Germans dropped around 70,000 tons on the UK. Taking a dud rate of 10%, then we would expect to see 250,000 tons of dud bombs in Germany, and 7,000 in the UK. This means that (assuming a constant size of bomb) for every hundred dud bombs in Germany, we would expect to see just three in the UK.   Another factor is that the Allies dropped heavier bombs on Germany. The heaviest bombs dropped by the Germans, excluding the V1s and V2s, were the 2000lb (1000 kg) parachute mines. Most of the bombs dropped on the UK were 500kg or smaller. In comparison, the RAF routinely dropped 4000lb 'blockbuster' bombs, and deployed larger 8000lb and 12,000lb weapons. A larger UXB is more likely to make it into international news. It will require the evacuation of a larger area for safety, and, if a controlled demolition is needed, it will be more spectacular. A small bomb is much less likely to make a splash in the international news - [this 50kg bomb, found in the Thames in 2017](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-38682872) only made it into the local BBC news. A 2000lb bomb located in Exeter in 2021 [made it into international outlets](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/unexploded-bomb-wwii-was-safely-detonated-england-180977146/).  We must also consider the fuses of the bombs. Allied bombs mostly used mechanical fuses, while German bombs largely used electrical fuses. The electrical fuses used on German bombs become largely inert once the battery powering them runs down. The same is not the case for mechanical fuses. The clockwork inside can only be rendered inert by corrosion jamming the mechanism. It is largely impossible to know whether or not a mechanical fuse is jammed from the outside. This means that the British bomb disposal teams can be more confident when dealing with unexploded bombs (UXB); they can take less-newsworthy methods like removing the bomb to a safe location for a controlled detonation. German teams, meanwhile, have to take more risks. Blowing up the bomb in situ is much more likely the safest option. This, in turn, means newsworthy evacuations and explosions. There is also much greater risk when making preparations for dealing with the bomb, so German UXB disposal teams (and those civilians who locate UXB) are more likely to take casualties.   Finally, the British were more able to take steps to detect and remove UXB during the war and the immediate aftermath. From September 1940, the British set up a highly detailed system of bomb censuses. These aimed to count every bomb dropped on the UK. Bombs that didn't detonate would be counted by these censuses, and could be dealt with by bomb disposal teams. Germany, meanwhile, had less resilience in their systems for dealing with UXB. The heavy Allied raids often did serious damage to local administration, making it harder to detect UXB when they were dropped. The disruption caused by bombing made it harder for bomb disposal teams to reach the UXBs that were detected.	1642957097.0	htwdn85	t3_sar5v5	t3_sar5v5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sar5v5/i_often_hear_about_the_discovery_of_unexploded/htwdn85/
hhxrz	There are so many factors involved in determining the distance a horse can travel in a day.   The horse's breeding is a huge factor in how far and fast it is able to travel,  heavy draft animals are slower but steady while thoroughbreds are faster but wear out quickly.  Cross breeds are all over the.map in their endurance capabilities.  Age and physical condition of the animal are important factors as are the quality of feed available and amount of drinking water along the route.  You must also consider the length of the trip and number of days you will be travelling and the terrain as hills and water crossings will slow you down.   An average horse can walk at 4 miles an hour.  With prodding you can bump this to around 6 miles per hour.  It can trot at speeds ranging between 10 and 15 miles per hour for an hour or so at a time.   So in ideal conditions with water stops along the road a horse in Prime condition  can walk about 40 to 50 miles in a ten hour day.   If it is in top condition and has lots of high protein feed it should be able to maintain its weight and health.   If the feed quality is lacking it will soon start losing weight and won't be able to  maintain this pace.  An average horse in good condition should be able to cover between 30 and 35 miles in a ten hour day on a good road.   If the trail has rivers and hills to cross the distance it can cover in a day begins to drop.   A hard days ride would include a mix of  trotting and walking.   Pushing it horse this way it would be possible to cover 60 to 70 miles over a ten hour day.   While horses can run at speeds over 30 miles per hour, forcing a horse into a gallop would be counter productive.   Most horses are unable to travel at a run for more than two miles and would quickly play out.   The Apaches were renown for their abilities to cover vast distances on horseback.   It was not uncommon for them to travel  over a hundred miles in a day or even twenty miles further.   But these horses would be worn out at the end of the day and many died during or at the end of these runs.  You could extend your range and help maintain your horses health by bringing another horse along.  Switching back and forth between them gives your mount a bit of a break which would keep them in better condition over a long trip.   Bringing a packhorse along greatly reduces the distance you can travel in a day if you care about your animals.   A rider if fluid moves with the horse as it walks while a pack is dead weight that hangs off each side.   Pushing a pack horse to a fast walk will cause it to get saddle sores.  The rubbing action of the saddle and pack against the horses side will rub through the hair and creates blisters.   Most pack trains seldom travelled more than 18 miles in a day while 12 to 15 miles was the norm.	1642957486.0	htwenf2	t3_saj82j	t3_saj82j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saj82j/old_west_1800s_what_did_it_mean_when_some_one/htwenf2/
gde6c	Thanks so much for coming by!  Two questions:  1. Every modern fandom has those members who complain when their media becomes too "corporate" or when creators try to "pander" to the "mainstream." Is this something that happened in early pulp and Western fandoms? Were long-time fans contemptuous of the Rathbone and Bruce *Holmes* films, or did Western fans bemoan the Disney-fication of the genre after the success of *Davy Crockett*?  2. This might be a bit out of field, but, speaking of Disney, it's common for theme parks to have a Western themed area. Most every park from the 1955 opening of Disneyland through the '70s seems to have one, with already established parks like Cedar Point adding their own during the two decades. Is there any connection between these parks and earlier traveling Western shows, reenactment groups, or living history museums? Does this type of entertainment attraction, in which visitors enter a comic book version of a frontier town, predate the '50s?	1642957536.0	htwerx9	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwerx9/

9i89m	The Continental Congress was the only national government of the United States, but legislative bodies have problems doing executive functions. The Secret Committee and the Committee of Secret Correspondence were created almost at the outset of the conflict to look for funds and supplies , communicate with France, Spain, and the Netherlands to do so.  After muddling along for several years, in 1781 the Congress delegates- even those very much worried about states' rights- generally realized there had to be something stronger for a national executive, because there was too great a need to sort out the war finances and debts, and engage in real diplomacy. So, Morris was made Superintendant of Finance to do the first, Robert Livingston Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and General Benjamin Lincoln Secretary *at(* ( not of) War. All three came in pretty much after the Battle of Yorktown, so while Morris put forward his financial plan, Lincoln mostly worked on clerical matters , quartering and feeding the army, and Livingston mostly tried to deal with the French.  But even though Morris clearly foresaw that he was likely to be hindered and second-guessed by Congress when he demanded broad powers to do what he wanted, he still needed it to approve his national financial scheme, and in the end it wouldn't. Livingston would likewise discover that though he could talk to foreign diplomats, he wasn't given the authority to actually ask for or agree to anything.	1642957894.0	htwfp42	t3_s9puly	t1_htt3s9d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9puly/how_much_power_did_robert_morris_have_over_the_us/htwfp42/

iovlhi6b	Great questions!  German Western reenactors before 1939 commonly developed roles play around both white cowboy and Native roles or *personas;* the first generations of Western reenactors were often inspired by, and were fans of the novels of Karl May.  In West Germany, they continued to do so after 1945.  Indeed, in West Germany reenactors diversified their white roles, developing reenactment as fur trappers, mountain men, etc.  In East Germany after 1948, the fundamental problem with both May's novels and Western role reenactment was they were set in the United States, which was the opponent of the Soviet Union.  Karl May's stories were set in a time and place that East German authorities took a dim view of; stories that celebrated American characters and settings were thus very politically sticky in East Germany.  East German authorities did not allow May's novels to be republished in East Germany until the 1980s, and they could not be imported.  Thousands of East Germans did own copies already, however, and passed them from person to person.  And the Western reenacters applied for permission to refound their clubs and continue their hobbies.  When they first applied, East German reenactors ran into some resistance from authorities, who were taken aback by role play set in the United States.  Authorities suggested to reenactors who lived near Dresden that they might do better to study and recreate the lifestyles of Indigenous peoples in Siberia, who (under the leadership of Stalin) were allegedly marching towards a better future. But East German hobbyists persisted in their focus on the American West, and ultimately got permission to resume their hobby, as a sort of ethnological research on North American Indigenous cultures.    Cowboy role play did not fit well into this rationale, and in order to avoid pressure from the secret police, East German hobbyists gradually dropped the white Western roles, and focused only on the reenactment of Indigenous cultures and roles.  Some older members persisted in performing cowboy roles in private; "after it got dark," some recalled later, "we would take off the feather headdresses and put on the cowboy hats."  But the East German secret police confiscated their revolvers (seen as important for any cowboy role play) and raided their clubs.  Gradually, East German hobbyists dropped the cowboy role play, and became widely accepted by East German authorities, when they gave public performances or demonstrations in their Indigenous roles. As far as I was able to determine, these East German reenactors came from all walks of life in East Germany; involvement in clubs was seen by many of them as an escape daily life in East Germany.	1642958510.0	htwhcb7	t3_savz63	t1_htw1b8u	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwhcb7/

m2af3	The book doesn't seem to be entirely pseudoscience; but there's certainly some of it. The author specializes in "Historical Afrocentrism" and while this isn't always a bad idea, he's obviously not a trained historian or archeologist because there are various facts and dates which are quickly mentioned without any skepticism or parsing of the details (which trained historians and archeologists love to do).   Not every fact in the book is distorted, but there are many issues - notably, the book attempts to flip the Euro-American historical narrative by re-writing African history from an Afrocentrist perspective. Yet in doing so, it begins most of the first 50+ pages with only brief mentions of the paleolithic and neolithic periods and quickly moves on to dense chapters on detailed Egyptian and Nubian history. Asante's attempt to invert the popular narrative ironically perpetuates it, beginning African history with Egyptian history has become the tradition of Euro-American antiquarians since the late 19th century.   The most glaring pseudoscience is found in the first 3 pages of the introduction where he talks about the "Mpumalanga megaliths" in southern Africa, which he says are the oldest in the world being at least 75kyo and up to 200kyo. He assumes that all of the "megaliths" in the region are all from the same or a similar ancient culture, when in reality there are many different cultural groups associated with monuments in the area made ca. 500-1800's CE. "Adam's Calendar" is actually called the Blaauboschkraal ruins. This the term for a series of settlements built by the Koni people on the Mpumalanga escarpment from the 1500's or early 1600's til the 1830's. Below the escarpment are early medieval settlements of other farming societies from the 500's CE onward.   - [Blaauboschkraal stone ruins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaauboschkraal_stone_ruins)  - [The Bokoni Story Unearthed, Mail & Guardian](https://mg.co.za/article/2015-02-26-the-bokoni-story-unearthed/)  - [Prehistory of the Nelspruit Area, South African History Online](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/prehistory-nelspruit-area)  M. K. Asante disparagingly cites Michael Tellinger, a pseudoscientific populizer of the site, because Tellinger suggests these were built via aliens. But ironically, he uses Tellinger's fantastical dates while rejecting the rest of his work! Instead, I'd suggest these sources for the area and time period:  - [The Lost African Metropolis Of Mapungubwe: Secrets Of The Sacred Hill, Timeline Documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szcuw-I2-WI)  - The Golden Rhinoceros: Histories of the African Middle Ages, by Francois-Xavier Fauvelle           - An African Classical Age: Eastern and Southern Africa in World History 1000 BC to AD 400, Christpher Ehret          - Bantu Africa: 3500 BE to Present, Fourshey & Gonzales                                 - The Archaeology and Ethnography of Central Africa, James Denbow    - African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa, Michael Gomez                                    - A Fistful of Shells: West Africa from the Rise of the Slave Trade to the Age of Revolution, Toby Green                                            ​  Being a historian requires a lot of reading, examining, and *thinking* about historical sources. This leads to skepticism, particularly about ancient historians and their obsession with citing outrageous troop numbers for famous battles and detailing elaborate histories of wide-ranging migrations for then-present populations. Historians should push back against these presumptions, so it is shocking that M. K. Asante uncritically cites Herodotus (pg. 12) to say that the *"...Phoenicians, who were also probably black according to their land of origin...[they] appeared in the 16th century BCE in the land that is today called Somalia."* This is absurd, the Phoenicians are the iron age descendants of bronze age Canaanites in the Levant (basically what is now Lebanon), not "appearing" in the 1500's BCE nor coming from Somalia and regardless that wouldn't make them "black" either.   No trained historian would make such a ridiculous assertion, nor should anyone uncritically accept Herodotus' account of migrations (which he says he got from Persian historians, so he's hearing it second-hand). Actually, in the opening of his *Histories*, he says they migrated from the *Erythraean Sea*. This was a vague term which referred to anywhere from the southern half of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and to the northwestern Indian Ocean - a huge area covering the Horn of Africa, the southern and eastern coasts of Arabia, and even coastal Pakistan and Gujarat. Not simply *from Somalia*, it is obvious Asante omits these details for the sake of Afrocentrism.	1642959209.0	htwj5i8	t3_s4hi4s	t3_s4hi4s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4hi4s/is_thr_book_the_history_of_africa_by_molefi_ketr/htwj5i8/
m2af3	M. K. Asante talks a bit about African rock art and this is wonderful, as you can probably tell I'm *very* into the subject and always am glad to see it mentioned since it is so commonly left out of history and art history books. And yet, Asante doesn't go into much detail, and on pg. 17 says that rock art tells us about *"...people who believed in communication and had some idea about how to record their thoughts, ideas, and activities."* Rock art as a method of communication and a record of ideas isn't necessarily a wrong-headed conception but I think it's overly simplistic. Rock art is the history of religion and mythology, it is a record of sacred landscapes, and the re-use of sites over thousands of years speaks to understanding large-scale cultural change. Rock art is sometimes very detailed, for whatever reason (perhaps narrative reasons?), and at other times rock art is very "unornamented" - painted with fingers and symbols being only simple geometrics. And yet these are the most fascinating, as the most abstract are the most metaphorical - sometimes a line may represent an entire concept.   Sure, Asante is correct in his overview, but he obsesses over its range and the number of sites and then moves on. Instead, I'd suggest these sources for details on African rock art:  - Rock Art in Africa, Jean-Loic Le Quellec  - Round Heads: The Earliest Rock Paintings in the Sahara, Jitka Soukopova  - The People of Iheren and Tahilahi, Hallier & Hallier   - Rock Art in Southern Africa, Anne Solomon  - The Rock Art of /Ui-//aes (Twyfelfontein), John Kinahan  - [The African Rock Art Digital Archive](http://www.sarada.co.za/#/library/)  - [Round Head Catalogue: The Earliest Rock Art of the Sahara](https://roundheadsahara.com/)  - [Trust for African Rock Art](https://africanrockart.org/)   Asante mentions Nabta Playa, as one must when talking about ancient African achievements. This is a neolithic pastoralist astronomical stone circle and field of monuments built ca. 7-5kya in the western desert of Egypt/Sudan. This is generally contemporary with the Badarian and Naqadian periods in nearby Upper Egypt. Yet Asante cites Bauval and Brophy's *Black Genesis* (2011) to say the site is 12-14kyo, adding people found ceramics at Nabta Playa "which seem to be among the oldest ever found." He even says Bauval and Brophy "wrote eloquently" about the site (pg. 18).   Yes there are early ceramics in the Nabta Playa region, but there are also just as early if not earlier ceramics at Ounjougou in Nigeria; suggesting that ceramics spread across the Sahara generally in the early Holocene period from these two centers - The Nile and the Lakes Region of West Africa. This early Holocene spread is around the same time they became prevalent in the Near East (ca. 8000 BCE). This larger narrative, the semi-contemporaneous regional spread of ceramics, as far as I've noted isn't mentioned in his work. He mentions Nabtan ceramics as more evidence of early African technological innovation, and this is true; but he's leaving out other important information in my view - Such as that the Diepkloof shelter in southern Africa has eggshell sherds (ostrich eggshell containers) from 45-130kya. And at around 60kya they begin to be decorated. Asante is right, materials innovation is fascinating; but I find it much more fascinating that these innovators were at the tail end of a long line of Southern African foragers who had container storage - some 100k+ years before anyone in Africa had ceramics.   [Thomas G. Brophy](https://www.cihs.edu/team/thomas-g.-brophy%2C-ph.d.) seems to have a foot in both worlds, one foot in science and another (perhaps deeper) in pseudoscience. It's not often that one laughs when reading academic papers, but Malville et al. (2007) got me when they dryly cited Brophy's theories about Nabta Playa's *true* age and *esoteric* meaning...  > Brophy has also suggested that the table rock of Complex Structure A is a map of the Milky Way galaxy dating from 17500 BC...[it] represents maps of the stars of Orion as early as 16500 BC. These extremely early dates as well as the proposition that the nomads had contact with extra-galactic aliens are inconsistent with the archeological record.  > - Astronomy of Nabta Playa, J. Malville et al. (2007) http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~libell/1nabta_africa.html  Besides Malville's paper, here's a few other sources on Nabta Playa.  - [Late Neolithic Megalithic Structures at Nabta Playa (Sahara), Southwestern Egypt, Wendorf & Schild](https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140123/http:/www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html)  - [Tracing the Origins of the Ancient Egyptian Cattle Cult, Michael Brass](https://web.archive.org/web/20060831041649/http://antiquityofman.com/brass_EEF2002.pdf)  Brophy isn't a reliable source of information on African prehistory. As Carl Feagans notes, another pseudoscientist Mark H. Gaffney summarizes Brophy's *The Origin Map* (2002) in saying that Nabta Playa stone positionings "represent on-the-ground analogs of star positions from up to 19[kya]." This is a little strange, since Feagans also notes that Brophy and Rosen's *Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry* (2005) says something else - that these megaliths were constructed "more than 8[kya]." This is a radical difference, and ca. 8kya is a reasonable range for megaliths in the earliest period of pastoralist occupation. Why would Brophy change his opinions one year to the next, change his dates from one publication audience to another publication audience? It is suspicious of an academic, to say the least.  - [Forbidden Archaeology? Pseudo-archaeology and the Exaggeration of the Antiquity of Man, Carl Feagans](https://ahotcupofjoe.net/2018/07/forbidden-archaeology-pseudo-archaeology-and-the-exaggeration-of-the-antiquity-of-man-2/)	1642959254.0	htwj9qn	t3_s4hi4s	t1_htwj5i8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4hi4s/is_thr_book_the_history_of_africa_by_molefi_ketr/htwj9qn/
m2af3	Perhaps M. K. Asante's most shocking statement (besides that the Phoenicians are black), is his comment about Berber/Amazigh people on page 20.   > Prior to 2000 BCE, all of the people of northern Africa were black in color. Furthermore, before the seventh century CE, North Africa was peopled mainly by black people and people who migrated from Europe in the ninth century BCE. There were no large populations of Arabs in North Africa before the rise of Islam and the religious movement that gave rise to the fervor for making converts of other people. Actually, the Amazigh (so-called Berber) people have been in Africa much longer than the Arabs, but certainly not as long as the indigenous Africans.  This is a strange passage. He's referring to the late neolithic desiccation of the Sahara - the end of the Green Sahara period ca. 5-4kya (til 2000 BCE). During this time, pastoralists who'd lived in the central Sahara migrated in all directions though mostly south and west. For a while the Sahara was largely unpeopled, until the iron age domestication of the camel (ca. 3-2.5kya, early to mid 1st millennium BCE). This allowed people, mostly Berber speaking northern Saharans, to fully populate the central Sahara again. This was the beginning of those famous cross-Saharan trade networks. The modern descendants of the Saharan migrations are the Fulani people across western and central Africa.   Asante is suggesting that these Fulani ancestors were "black", and "non-black" i.e. Berber and Arab speaking peoples only entered the Sahara with the spread of Islamic traders. And so, in his terminology, "indigenous Africans" are black and have the longest connection to the land whereas lighter toned Berber speakers don't have as much. This is an absurd conclusion, not only is his distinction between black-indigenous vs. non-black/not-as-indigenous; but suggesting that Berber speakers and Maghrebi's aren't *as African* as Sub-Saharans. Maghrebi's helped populate the central Sahara when the Green Sahara period started in the early Holocene, and the Proto-Afro-Asiatic language ancestor to the Berber languages arose ca. the early Holocene in northeast Africa. East Africans and north Africans have a wider range of skin tones than west and central Africans - this has no correlation to their indigeneity or Africanity; in these passages Asante's "Afrocentrism" takes on racial undertones that is decidedly unacademic.   In the end M. K. Asante's book isn't terrible, his sections on ancient Egyptian and Nubian history seem okay as do his sections on western and central African history from the medieval period onward. The latter half of the book is about modern African issues which I didn't analyze. But there are some problems and flaws with the book, such as his inclusion of pseudo-scientists. Instead, I'd suggest other introductions to African history and archeology:  - African Archaeology: A Critical Introduction, Ann B. Stahl    - Holocene Saharans: An Anthropological Perspective, Augustin F. C. Holl  - Beyond Chiefdoms: Pathways to Complexity in Africa, ed. Susan K.

These entertainments could capitalize on the fact that Western novels (both pulp fiction and more "serious" Western authors) had been popular for decades.  James Fenimore Cooper's *Leatherstocking Tales* were widely read in 19th century Germany, for example, and there were successful German Western authors who fed Germans' appetite for Western tales with best-selling fiction and non-fiction.  Germans were also familiar with the American West because there were often letters, newspaper reports, or travel literature from the German settlers who had emigrated to the American West, or from Germans who had visited there.  William Cody's Wild West show toured Europe from Wales to Ukraine, attracting hundreds of thousands of European visitors.  For more on Buffalo Bill in Europe, I'd recommend Louis Warren's *Buffalo Bill's America,* Robert Rydell and Rob Kroes, *Buffalo Bill in Bologna*, and Julia Stetler, *Buffalo Bill's Wild West in Germany.*  For a discussion of the experience of Indigenous performers in these shows, and how they saw Western entertainments, I'd recommend George Moses' *Wild West Shows*.  These shows, along with exposure to the novels of Karl May and other Western authors, were often cited by German Western fans as key moments that drew them into the fandom.	1642959455.0	htwjsja	t3_savz63	t1_htw23de	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwjsja/

u8x4k	I guess a lot is being talked about to impact of Karl May’s work.  1. why do you think is there a strong focus on the America setting („durchs Wilde Kurdistan“ for example is set in the near east, etc) 2. is there any relationship between post-war interest in the western setting and denazification?

5wkhi4e5	Hello Dr Reagin! I would be interested to hear your thoughts on how/if European notions of North American First Nation Indigeneity have influenced ideas about European Indigeneity, especially as seen in music groups like Wadruna or Heilung that utilize a shamanistic aesthetic that appears (to a Canadian like me) to be appropriating First Nations culture/traditions to reenact imagined Norse/Germanic traditions.	1642961368.0	htwotgn	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwotgn/
iovlhi6b	Thanks for this--these are two interesting entry points into the discussion.  You're right that "reacting" doesn't capture the active and very diverse responses of Indigenous visitors to Germany, when they are exposed to German hobbyists' creations.  Their responses varied enormously, and changed over time.  Before 1939, some German Western clubs had long cultivated ties and exchanges of materials for handicrafts (e.g., feathers and beads) with particular Indigenous communities in the United States, usually Lakota communities.  After the division of Germany in 1948 and particularly after 1970, East German hobbyists and Western fans developed regular exchanges with Indigenous activists in the United States, offering them support in their struggle against the U.S. government for more autonomy and rights.  Some did fundraising for the American Indian Movement, and AIM leaders visited East Germany and met with some hobbyists.  But after German reunification, contacts between Indigenous North Americans and hobbyists (and ordinary Germans) became more frequent, and the responses of the visitors changed and varied, captured in the many interviews with Indigenous people who visited Germany reprinted in *Indianthusiasm: Indigenous Responses*, edited by Helmut Lutz and Renae Watchman.  Some Indigenous visitors to Germany said that they had positive experiences and were treated with respect by German hobbyists, who hoped to deepen their understanding of Indigenous cultures.  Other visitors found the reenactment of their cultures inappropriate and unwelcome, and said so; they often objected to hobbyists' focus on historic lifestyles and material culture, which they perceived as erasing their modern Indigenous identities. Many were bemused or critical of the way that the Plains Indigenous cultures remained the gold standard for Germans' perception of Indigeneity.  One visiting Anishinaabe writer from Curve Lake First Nation, Drew Harden Taylor, commented that "They're \[the Germans\] obsessive about Plains Indians.  Tipis! You never see a longhouse; you never see a wigwam, it has to be Plains, and of Lakota if at all possible. You know, I think that the Lakota had a better publicist or something."  These responses might be one reason that German hobbyists increasingly withdrew from the public sphere after 2000, and many switched to other types of historical reenactment.  To answer your second question, yes, Western reenactors in Germany and the United States pursue "authenticity" in the ways that you describe for your groups.  They do see it as a way of "doing" history, and many went to enormous lengths to ensure painstaking accuracy in their reproductions of historical costumes and artifacts.  Stephen Gapps (a historian who is also active in military historical reenactment) has published some very perceptive work on what authenticity means to reenactors, commenting that it "is a key term in our symbolic vocabulary and often thought of as being part of our 'special responsibility.'  . . . if historians do two things---compose elegant paragraphs and pursue erudition---reenactors craft a theater of history through authentic props and costumes."	1642961590.0	htwpefb	t3_savz63	t1_htw895x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwpefb/

iovlhi6b	Yes, you understood it well: they were very aware of anti-Indigenous racism, and deplored the violence of white settlers against Indigenous peoples, but that did not translate into an understanding of anti-Black racism in later reenactment (at least, not as far as I could see--I did not research the Civil War reenactors in depth).	1642961932.0	htwqb1q	t3_savz63	t1_htwkpsh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwqb1q/

2m8yl53s	There are various suggestions - St. Elmo's fire, smoke, some kind of strange weather maybe. But it was regarded as a sign of impending doom by Greek and Latin Christian sources (who were all writing in hindsight, even if it was only a couple of days after the city fell), and the Ottoman sources don't mention it at all. So it might be more of a supernatural event than an historical one, and therefore not really within our jurisdiction!  I wrote a little bit about it in the past: [“Light” on the dome of the Hagia Sophia in 1453?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/eujtfa/light_on_the_dome_of_the_hagia_sophia_in_1453/ffrbvya/)	1642962532.0	htwrvtc	t3_sayrbi	t3_sayrbi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sayrbi/just_before_the_fall_of_constantinople_in_1453/htwrvtc/
7helxsbg	So, one of the most common images of the mythical wild west is the lone gunslinger wandering around the west. But I noticed, growing up on franco-belgian western comics, that this figure was commonly either used for comedy (Lucky Luke) or not used as the focus at all (Les Tuniques Bleues, Buddy Longway.) But at the same time, they are obviously rather central to spaghetti westerns. So I was wondering, have you noticed any big national differences between the US, Germany and perhaps some other countries, in how central the lone gunslinger figure was to their conception of the west and how he was depicted? And has this changed over time?	1642962654.0	htws71o	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htws71o/

iovlhi6b	>My personal recollection is that as a child I read these books vaguely rooting for the Amerian Indian characters, which were often depicted in a kind of "noble savage" cliché way and seemed to be the underdogs.   You had a lot of company among Germans who read Westerns written by German authors like Karl May, Lieselotte Welskopf-Henrich, and others (and fans of the films based on their novels).  May and some other authors offered romanticized and often very inaccurate portrayals of Indigenous characters, but they were usually rooting for them.  German fans of the West generally differed from their American counterparts in their critical response to white settlers and the treatment of Indigenous peoples by the U.S. government.    I'm afraid I can't comment too much on the comics.  I do know that simplified versions of May's stories (and other Western authors) were used as the basis for best-selling comic books in both West and East Germany, and I think that you're correct that their audience was probably younger than the novel readers were.	1642962816.0	htwsmfs	t3_savz63	t1_htw4ww0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwsmfs/

iwanf	From a pure Jewish law perspective insulin isn't really a question.  Jewish dietary law prohibits eating pigs, but not other ways of benefitting from pigs^(1,2).  This is unlike, say, forbidden mixtures of milk and meat, which are not only forbidden foods but are also forbidden to eat.  Even if insulin were "eaten", people who need insulin are at serious risk of developing dangerous health conditions if they don't take it, and one is allowed to eat forbidden foods if one will otherwise be in danger^(3).  This is without getting into the gelatin debate about whether heavily modified derivatives of non-kosher animals lose their status as being from the original animal--even if it were universally agreed that gelatin is totally not kosher^(4), insulin would be fairly clearly permitted.  As a historical question, though, one could ask whether this raised questions of Jewish law that were posed to Rabbis.  The issue here is that unless something is truly earth-shattering, most questions are asked and answered orally.  Because there's very little novel in the question of insulin, it's not the sort of question which would necessarily be put into writing.  "Can I take this medication without while I will be in serious danger" is an important question, but not one that requires the sort of complex answer that requires being put into writing.  There's already discussion in Jewish law from much earlier periods about medicinal forbidden foods, so insulin really breaks no new ground.  I am personally unaware of any written evidence of the question even being asked about insulin, and cannot find any in a cursory search.  It probably was asked to Rabbis, but the answers not put in writing.  I suspect it would have been asked is that Jews often have an aversion to pork products that goes beyond the technical limits of Jewish law^(5).  Generally the sorts of questions for which there's written evidence is when one Rabbi asks a difficult question to another Rabbi who is "up the chain" and is a widely respected authority, but this isn't the sort of question that requires one Rabbi send a question to another Rabbi.  1. There are Rabbinic restrictions on pigs in other ways--there's a general prohibition on making a living by selling forbidden foods, but for pigs there isn't a prohibition on non-eating benefit, which is not really a relevant concern here. * See, for example, Teshuvot Achiezer 3:61 by R Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, which permits ingesting forbidden foods via a feeding tube because that isn't really "eating".  The person who asked the question thought it ought to be forbidden, but R Chaim Ozer disagreed, and I believe R Chaim Ozer's position is the consensus here.  Certainly an injection is far less eating-like than a feeding tube, and *a fortiori* should be permitted. * For example, *Peninei Halakha, Zemanim 7:5*, which rules that diabetics can eat on Yom Kippur to manage their insulin levels--eating on Yom Kippur is a much more serious issue than eating non-kosher food, generally speaking.  Or *Contemporary Halakhic Problems* Vol 6 Chapter 6 by R J David Bleich, discussing a diabetic person testing their glucose levels on Shabbat, which is also (potentially) a more serious issue than eating pork * Which is the consensus position in the US nowadays * See [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/599037), for example	1642963330.0	htwtxlz	t3_sautz9	t3_sautz9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htwtxlz/

iovlhi6b	>So, my question is: when a work of fiction gains a fandom in a new area or culture that may have some pretty significant cultural gaps from its origins, how are these stories able to form connections with fans in the new region or culture, and what are some of the reasons they don't?  Thank you for that warm welcome, and that insight.  Your question could really be the basis for another book.  It falls into the academic field known as fan studies, and it would be interesting to see work on audience reception that focused on how people respond to fictional worlds based on their culture, that were written by an author from another culture and which is not an accurate depiction of their culture.  This isn't something I've read a lot about, but I can offer one example of this phenomenon, which might help to answer your question.  Karl May is often said to be the best-selling author in modern German history; I'm not sure if that can be verified, but his books sold hundreds of millions of copies during the 20th century, and have been translated into 46 languages, at last count.  But May never visited the American West; indeed, he only visited the U.S. once, late in life, and got no further West than NY State.  His fictional West was based on his ethnological and anthropological research, and of course his own imagination.  And one nation where he has never found a broad readership is the United States; I had never heard of him before I lived in Germany, and I don't think his translations have sold well in the U.S.  His lack of popularity in the U.S. originally might have had something to do with the fact that his novels generally sympathized with Indigenous cultures and condemned rapacious Anglo-American settlers and their government.  He thus inverted American Western's view of who was the "hero" in these stories, and I suspect that dampened sales in the United States, at least among white Americans.    But I'm not aware of any examples similar to what you mention at the end of your query, where fans in the culture being described from the outside, influence or amend the world-building of the author.  I suspect it can and has happened, but I'm not aware of an example.	1642964061.0	htwvsz7	t3_savz63	t1_htw2wm3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwvsz7/

iovlhi6b	I think that your observation was true for many Germans, earlier in the 20th century.  Tacitus's book had considerable impact on how 19th and early 20th century Germans saw the history of their nation and national identity.  I have actually never read that Tacitus had a big impact on Americans' stereotypes, however.  As you probably know, Tacitus describes the Germanic peoples of his day as a tribal culture, and one that valued warriors.  Some 19th century Germans who read this, centuries later, made the connection between Tacitus's description of the German tribes (fighting against Roman colonization) and Indigenous North Americans' struggles against the U.S. government.  Although it might seem very odd to us, many Germans felt a sense of kinship with Indigenous Americans; see H.Glenn Penny's *Kindred By Choice* for a lot more information about this.	1642965004.0	htwy871	t3_savz63	t1_htwdb5r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwy871/

iovlhi6b	That wasn't a key question in my research, but I think one part of my response would be that the "lone gunslinger" is usually a white character.  And as I noted above in some of my other responses, German fans tended to have much more sympathy for (or even identification with) Indigenous characters and cultures than US fans did.   The lone white character is generally not so important, although in Karl May's Westerns, he was often paired with an Indigenous character who was his partner.	1642965887.0	htx0gp8	t3_savz63	t1_htws71o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx0gp8/
9jwvl	Yeah, that story about Karl May reminds me of a show called Avatar: the Last Airbender, which is hugely popular, critically acclaimed, and lauded for its portrayal of traditional East Asian culture.  Never caught on over here, though, and it could be because it uses a dichotomy of good and evil, which isn't how it's viewed here, where good and evil are both complementary and opposing forces. It could be because of marketing. It's a really interesting topic for sure.  Same with SW, it was based in Eastern philosophies and characters, but it then never really caught on here (except for a few pockets of devoted fans) because again that dichotomy of good vs evil compared to having to naturally balance the opposing forces within oneself that then extends to the rest of society and government.  I actually have heard that ronin films and Western films have had kind of a back and forth where they both have actually come out to influence one another. Don't quote me here, haha but I think Westerns were made first, then were imported to Japan after WW2 because of the occupation. It helped to influence ronin films, which then led for their influence to then be carried back across the Pacific to the US, which then had Western pictures evolve further.  I really find it fascinating because as someone who's kind of between two worlds that are vastly different, I'm always curious as to why something like the Marvel movies are hugely popular, but Star Wars isn't. Sci-fi has taken off here, even influencing some really great local authors, but other genres haven't.  I really appreciate your insights, and if you listened to me rambling, also that :)	1642965921.0	htx0js9	t3_savz63	t1_htwvsz7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx0js9/

8uf2h	LARP and reenactment share a lot of common features but a distinguishing feature of LARP is that there's an expectation it include some kind of in-character game element, from competitive athletic combat to unscripted intrigue. I won't pretend the line is super bright, but I think it's usually possible to categorize an activity as either LARP or reenactment. While LARPs come in all kinds of settings, western frontier LARPs are a small minority.   Why has western reenactment generally not included game elements? What's the history of cross pollination, or lack thereof, between the western reenactment and LARP fandoms?	1642966761.0	htx2o2v	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx2o2v/

iovlhi6b	It's a bit out of my topic area, but I'll share what I can.    L'Amour can be seen as the successor (in a way) to Zane Grey.  Grey was the one of the most popular writers of Westerns in the U.S. during the period between WWI and WWII, and more than 100 Hollywood films were based on his novels, in the period between the wars.  L'Amour emerged as the dominant postwar Western writer.  As you probably know, he sold more than 200 million copies during his lifetime and at least 30 films were based on his novels. I think that among fans of Westerns, he still has a big following.  But we would need to see that within the context of the (relative) decline in Westerns' popularity.  For much of the 20th century, Western stories, films, and TV shows had a huge footprint in American popular culture, and were one of our most important cultural exports, globally.  I've read that about 1/3 of Hollywood movies made before 1960 were Westerns, and there were 17 prime time Western series in the U.S. during the mid-1960s.  *Bonanza* was a global hit, and in Germany, it was so popular that I've seen German cultural historians refer to the 1960s as the "Bonanza decade."  So L'Amour was riding a huge cultural wave, so to speak.  There was a rapid decline in Westerns' popularity in the U.S. and Europe after the 1980s.  Very few Westerns were filmed during the 1980s, perhaps due to the epic financial disaster of Heaven's Gate. There was some revival after 1990, but depictions of white settlement changed in many films.  Westerns still have a following, but they are no longer the dominant pop culture genre; instead, they persist on dedicated cable channels like the Turner Broadcasting Network, and have inspired arcade and video games, and other entertainments.  But overall, the genre is not as popular as it was 50 years ago.  The decline in Western fans must impact the following of Western authors, even mega-successful ones like L'Amour.  Nowadays, I suspect that fantasy and science fiction films have replaced Westerns, as the dominant category of US cultural exports.	1642966961.0	htx364o	t3_savz63	t1_htwc2za	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx364o/

iovlhi6b	It's actually not my genre.  I am a historian of popular culture, and a life-long fan of science fiction, fantasy, and Sherlock Holmes.  But I didn't want to focus my book on a fandom that I myself am part of.  Instead, I chose to look at Western fans because while I understand the dynamics and histories of literary fandoms as a whole, this was not my own fan community.

iovlhi6b	Karl May is always interesting to talk about!  I haven't even scraped the surface here.  You're right that his Western novels get a lot more attention nowadays (and, I think, even in the beginning) compared to his Orientalist novels.  I've discussed this with people who are leading members of the May fandom in Germany, and they commented that in general, fans were more focused on the Western stories. I could offer some speculations about why.  First, Winnetou.  He is such a powerfully appealing character for fans, as is Old Shatterhand.  I think that the attraction of those characters for many fans meant that the Western novels attracted more attention.  And second, the popularity of Westerns in Germany even before May.  There were many best-selling Western authors in Germany before May (both English-speaking and German), including James Fenimore Cooper, Balduin Moellhausen, and Friedrich Gerstaecker.  In entering this cultural market, May was latching on to what was already a big wave, in terms of the genre's popularity, so I'm not surprised his Western novels benefitted.  I'm not sure about the connection between denazification and Westerns.  That's because of the enormous continuity in the popularity of Westerns with Germans, since the early 19th century (the authors i list above are only a small fraction of this phenomenon) and also the genre popularity in both East and West Germany.  Germans' attraction to Indigenous cultures and the West is what historian Glenn Penny has referred to as a longue	1642967758.0	htx574g	t3_savz63	t1_htwm7i0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx574g/

f9ocu9u6	I'd argue this is built primarily around the Old Testament concept of the sacrificial lamb. At the time right before Exodus called the Passover, the family had to sacrifice the lamb, spread is blood on the door, and the entire lamb had to be consumed by the family and whatever other people were with them in the house.  As a parallel, John calls Jesus the Lamb of God. Jesus Himself is placed on the cross (his blood spread in a way on the wood), and He is consumed by Catholics in the Eucharist/Communion. In this way we are joined as close to God as possible on Earth, which is why the Catechism says the Eucharist is the source and summit our faith. It's no mistake that Jesus has the Last Supper on Passover.  This was an idea rejected by some even in the Bible, as can be seen in John 6:66.	1642968013.0	htx5up1	t3_sa4oxw	t3_sa4oxw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa4oxw/catholics_believe_in_transubstantiation_the_bread/htx5up1/

lmoso	The Imams’ attitude was covered in Halil Inalcik’s book The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age.  The background was that the Ottoman state never had a tradition that the eldest son was by default the only legally valid successor.  Instead the idea was that the most powerful son would take over. This led to civil was with massive death.   The Imams were needed to legitimize the execution of Sultans’ siblings. They were were brought onboard because in Islamic law there is a principle that an evil can be made permissible to avoid a greater evil.  In this case, if the murder of the sultan’s siblings would prevent civil wars where thousands or tens of thousands of citizens would die, then the murders were the lesser of the evil and would be allowed.  The Imams thus backed this succession practice as an exceptional circumstance.	1642968625.0	htx7eu2	t3_sa2mg6	t3_sa2mg6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa2mg6/for_about_200_years_new_ottoman_sultans_killed/htx7eu2/
iovlhi6b	Those are smart, interesting questions, that I wish I knew more about!    But I'll share what I know.  I can easily imagine that like fans everywhere, there were some fans who felt that the Karl May films weren't completely faithful to the novels (I mean, they really were not, in some cases), but I haven't seen those discussions among May fans.  Similarly, I'd love to know what the Baker Street Irregulars or the Sherlock Holmes Society (among the earliest Holmes fan orgs) made of the Bruce and Rathbone films.  It would have been a treat to be a fly on the wall, when they discussed them; I am imagining that the comments might have been scathing (I mean, Sherlock Holmes tracks down Nazis?).  But sadly, I don't know of any research on that; I'd read it, if there was!  There are clear connections between traveling Western entertainments and theme parks.  But I don't know of any such comic book version before 1945 in Germany, at least.  Western clubs sometimes had their own private grounds, where they met and practiced handicrafts and role play, but these were rarely open to the public.  Today, there is a Western theme park in Germany, south of Munich, "Pullman City," offers visitors a potpourri of fictionalized sites associated with various eras of North American history.  It's on my bucket list.	1642968914.0	htx851f	t3_savz63	t1_htwerx9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx851f/

hdag0	This is fascinating stuff, thank you so much for sharing! My mother's family is German, from Dewitt County. Both of my grandparents spoke German, though not in public, and my mother(b. '54) knew some German from her childhood. I've inherited German-language bibles and a few books from her grandmother. They were proud of their heritage and I never would have ever guessed the tribulations you've detailed here, but surely they would have been aware of it. Fascinating stuff.   I always found it amusing that my grandmother's biggest complaint when I got married(to a black man) was that a) we cohabitated before marriage and b) we eloped instead of a proper church marriage, contrasting to my paternal family who were much less enthused about me marrying a "colored boy", but I guess it might make more sense considering the cultural differences(northern Louisiana Scotch-Irish vs South Texan Germans).

Part of it really got my mind racing...    >* See, for example, Teshuvot Achiezer 3:61 by R Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, which permits ingesting forbidden foods via a feeding tube because that isn't really "eating".     Would you be willing to elaborate on this point? When I think of the term "feeding tube" I think of enteral feeds like a nasal gastric tube or orogastric. This type of feed essentially just skips the mouth and esophagus, but all other digestive processes still occur as usual.

8antg3zz	>The Ossetians are ethnically related to Iranians, and speak a language related to Iranian, and are historically relatively new to the Caucasus (most historians would agree they arrived around the 13/14th century, while some nationalist Georgian historians argue as recently as the 18th century). Compounding the issue was that directly north of this Oblast was the North Ossetia Autonomous Republic, which was part of Russia (the regions were connected by a 3.7km Roki Tunnel, built in the 1960s).  The Ossetians in the Caucasus are still mentioned in the 5th century when they were defeated by the Iberian king Vakhtang Gorgasali.  But Ossetians settled in Georgia in small numbers in the 16th century by Lord Machabeli because Kartli was partly uninhabited (depopulation due to wars).  There was no uprising in South Ossetia because of Gamsakhurdia's remarks, this is a lie.  Gamsakhurdia said that if Ossetians do not want to live in Georgia, then they should go to the North Caucasus.  Ossetians were against staying in Georgia from the very beginning and Gamsakhurdia said all this because of that.	1642969992.0	htxaxo1	t3_s68982	t1_ht4eoc1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htxaxo1/

69l7d	Archaeology and the forensic analysis of human remains can tell us a lot about the health of individuals, while not perfect bones can be used to provide solid guesses for such things as age at death, nutritional deficiencies (particularly childhood malnutrition), stresses of daily life (such as repetitive labor) and some diseases like tuberculosis. Likewise under the right conditions the analysis of soil linked to latrines can provide evidence for the nutritional intake of the population and parasite presence (for example, there has been some interesting work done on this [in Pompeii](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/110623-ancient-rome-human-waste-herculaneum-science-diet-excrement-italy)).  This is all a way of saying that, theoretically, there are tools that could provide pretty illuminating answers to this question, but I am not aware of this work having been done yet (I would be thrilled to be wrong, of course). In general this sort of work on standards of living in the Roman empire is in its infancy, and getting to a level of analysis fine grained enough to distinguish specific sectors (even one as visible as the soldiery) is quite a bit of work. At the moment, probably the best sketch comes from surviving documents that let us know, for a handful of legions, for a handful of years, how many soldiers completed their service of twenty five years and were given an honorable discharge. This is pretty thin evidence to make sweeping claims, but from it we can say that [the rate of mortality of soldiers was not significantly different than the civilian population](http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/110509.pdf). If you factor in the existence of combat mortality this may mean that soldiers were a bit less likely to die of natural causes, and thus were a bit healthier than the population as a whole, but it was probably broadly comparable.  For their physical fitness in terms of "were they swole" rather than "were they healthy" our best evidence comes from *De rei militari*, a military manual written by Vegetius describing the army of the early imperial period. It is problematic because it is not descriptive but rather proscriptive--in other words he is making an argument for what armies should be like based on his understanding of the early imperial army rather than something like a survey work to understand what actual military practice was. That said the book is not fantasy, and is probably a reliable guide to what can be called "docterine". And given this, the emphasis on training and exercise (taking up much of book 1) is striking. [For example](https://digitalattic.org/home/war/vegetius/index.php#b109):  >We are informed by the writings of the ancients that, among their other exercises, they had that of the post. They gave their recruits round bucklers woven with willows, twice as heavy as those used on real service, and wooden swords double the weight of the common ones. They exercised them with these at the post both morning and afternoon.  >This is an invention of the greatest use, not only to soldiers, but also to gladiators. No man of either profession ever distinguished himself in the circus or field of battle, who was not perfect in this kind of exercise. Every soldier, therefore, fixed a post firmly in the ground, about the height of six feet. Against this, as against a real enemy, the recruit was exercised with the above mentioned arms, as it were with the common shield and sword, sometimes aiming At the head or face, sometimes at the sides, at others endeavoring to strike at the thighs or legs. He was instructed in what manner to advance and retire, and in short how to take every advantage of his adversary; but was thus above all particularly cautioned not to lay himself open to his antagonist while aiming his stroke at him.  This is solid exercise, particularly when combined with swimming, jumping, running, carrying heavy packs, etc that is also recommended. It is hard to know exactly how closely this training regimen was actually followed, but at the very least physical fitness was at least considered important.	1642970444.0	htxc4kw	t3_saswy0	t3_saswy0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saswy0/how_physically_fit_were_roman_soldiers_in_the/htxc4kw/

4qjou698	Hi! Thanks for being here!   I am unsure if this fits into your acumen, but perhaps you could point me in the right direction if it doesn’t.    My great uncle was a scout leader for the Boy Scouts of America in the 50s and 60s.  According to family lore and newspaper clippings from the time, he dedicated quite a bit of his life to “researching“ indigenous people in the American southwest, learning things like silversmithing, beadwork, dance rituals, music, and other traditions - particularly those of the Sioux tribe.  He apparently worked with tribes in the southwest and shared his knowledge with them, along with his Boy Scouts troop Who would tour around and perform mock traditional Sioux dances, complete with costumes and music.    The newspaper articles and the old letters thanking my uncle for his work all indicate that there was a sense of respect for indigenous Americans at this time, but I think this was more of “the noble savage“ flavor.    Do you know much about the glorification of American tribes by the BSA?    Was this as well-intentioned yet misguided and offensive as I have a feeling it was?    I have some costume/dance materials that he made (leather and beadwork), and I’m unsure how to feel about holding onto (let alone displaying) them, though they are beautiful and well-crafted.	1642971709.0	htxfgvh	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htxfgvh/

9i89m	Before mass media it was harder for someone to become inundated with tunes: music was manually produced, sung or played live. So, the average person would not be trying to memorize a playlist of thousands of songs.  However, there were "ear worms", catchy melodies that became popular. We know this because once those melodies became popular,  musicians would use them for other things. In medieval music they were called "contrafacta", and a very famous one is the song *L'Homme Armé*, that appeared anonymously around the time of the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453. It was then picked up and used as a melody for offices of the mass by composers like Guillaume Dufay.  Similarly, at a market in England in the 17th c. there would likely be someone selling ballads. Written on various topical themes or humorous narratives, they're now generically called broadside ballads, as they would be printed on single long sheets of paper, and draped over the arm of the person hawking them. There would not be music written out under the lyrics: instead, at the top would be a note as to the melody, like " to be sung to the burden of *Greensleeves* " or "to be sung to the burden of *Packington's Pound*" . As there would be no point in setting the ballad to something obscure,  a surviving broadside ballad gives us an indication as to whether a tune was popular.  Another clue comes from the musical game of theme and variation that would be a standard form for western musicians of the Renaissance and Baroque. A lutenist would be asked to do variations to show off her technique, and of course she would tend to use popular tunes for her themes. Just as Greensleeves and Packington's Pound would be common for English broadside ballads, they were commonly written into English lute books as well.  But you also raise the point about how anyone could remember a lot of tunes? They could of course sometimes be able to write them down. But music written on paper was not always practical, so there was also the Guidonian Hand, a system of memorizing a musical part by referring to different parts of the hand. You can see some singers doing it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmR716ZTqL8). Coincidentally, they're singing *"l'Homme Armé*  Lastly, tunes got memorized better if they had names. If you take a look at traditional Irish music, you'll notice names like My Honest Dear Neighbor I Never Killed your Cat, and traditional Appalachian fiddle tunes can have names like Hog Went for the Fence Yoke and All.   Makes them harder to forget.	1642975649.0	htxpsgi	t3_sawjho	t3_sawjho	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sawjho/did_people_get_music_stuck_in_their_heads_as/htxpsgi/

Rough stuff, page after page of soldiers' letters and memoirs with first-person accounts of mass crimes and suffering, the kind of thing that tends to be glossed over in (popular) history books where the focus is on the big battles where the cavalry did this, and the artillery did that, and it's all shining sabres and glorious violence.	1642976169.0	htxr4dd	t3_sau99x	t1_htw98e4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sau99x/sunday_digest_interesting_overlooked_posts/htxr4dd/

76o33	This article answers your question although this is going to be a Halakahic answer (that is about Jewish law primarily with some history so I apologize for that mods, but this is what was asked)  Now also to explain this one must understand that there are 2 main sources of law, one is from the Torah and the other is from the Oral Law (also called Rabbinic), which in traditional Jewish ideas is seen to have been given to Moses at Sinai with the Torah. This is from the Rabbinic tradition.   So in order to explain that you need a little history, the dependence on interpretation from Rabbis is called Rabbinic Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism is the primary form of Judaism today, and the major Jewish movements are all Rabbinic in origin there are a few exceptions but they are small comparatively. In Judaism typically the more conservative one is the more one believes that this interpretation is the literal 'Word of God' and the more liberal one is the more one would believe that it was all crafted by humans.   The Pharisees mentioned in the Chrisitan Bible are the originators of this tradition, they first appear in the Second Century after John Macabee (from the Channukah story) takes over and replaces the priesthood with the Hasmonean Dynasty. Although the source for this is Josephus he says that they were experts in the law. They are in contrast to (the name comes from the word sperate/part in Aramaic/Hebrew) the Hasmonean priesthood.    This Oral law is codified in the Talmud which is really made up of the law (Mishan) then the discussion around it (Gemara), of which there are two versions, one made in Babylon (modern-day Iraq-ish) where there was a Jewish Diaspora since around 586 BCE. The other was made in Roman Judea/Israel/Palestine both of these were initially collected and written down around 400/500 CE. But there are many debates codified in the Talmud about what some of these items mean, or how to do things properly. it is best described as a sort of legalistic tradition, which has many similarities to Islamic law.    The Babylonian Talmud is considered the authoritative one if the two disagree. It is more robust in its discussions and Jewish life had shifted towards Babylone especially after the Romans sacked Jerusalem and the Temple, enslaved tens of thousand Jews, and forced many out of the area. Prior to writing these were passed from generation to generation (hence it being called 'Oral Law') but after the destruction of the Second Temple, it was decided that it should be written down for fear of losing it.  As I mentioned this is a legalistic tradition so one has law and precedent, and also one looks to see how earlier generations interpreted it. There can also be disputes about how these are interpreted and seen via different people, much as lawyers would debate a law in court. So what you have is sort of a debate across centuries about the 'correct way' to do things.  So to pull an article using the source mentioned above by /u/gingeryid   https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/artificial-feeding-on-yom-kippur-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter  *"Rav Chaim Ozer responded that nonetheless Halacha defines only oral ingestion as eating.  He cites the Gemara’s discussion (Yoma 74b) of the source of the assumption that when the Torah commands us to “afflict ourselves on Yom Kippur” it refers to refraining from food and drink.  The Gemara refers to the verse (Devarim 8:3) that states that first Hashem afflicted us and then he fed us the manna.  We see that the term “affliction” as used in the Torah refers to not eating or drinking.  Rav Chaim Ozer argues that since the Torah records that Hashem fed us the manna to satisfy our hunger, we see that only oral ingestion of food satisfies hunger.  Thus, Halacha defines one as afflicting himself if he does not ingest food or drink orally.  Indeed, people do not find artificial feeding particularly satisfying. "*  So we see in a basic answer to your question that no it is not classified as eating via a tube. This particular answer is about Yom Kippur where the (Jewish) laws of fasting prevent the intake of food or water for about 25 hours, as a side note here the Jewish day (and Islamic one) start at Sunset so you get a little overlap of time where the sun starts to set until it completely sets counting as the end of one day and the start of the new day, hence 25 hours. Although it is an indirect example as the question here is should one use an IV to avoid eating via the mouth if needed.   There are other opinions listed and elsewhere that say it is eating, in case you are interested, for example, this here which specifically asks the question of feeding via tubes  http://download.yutorah.org/1985/1053/735697.pdf  To point out, and tie in the longer discussion above, the first article mentioned both the Gemara and the Torah as 'proof' cases for this particular example. The Gemara source can be read here:  https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.74b.1?lang=bi  This particular passage is about the laws of Yom Kippur the Talmud is divided into several sections one of these sections is about proper observance of holidays.   The Torah proof they use is Devarim 8:3 which would be Numbers for those used to the English/Greek terms although the name in Hebrew here means things which comes from the first words of this section (אֵ֣לֶּה הַדְּבָרִ֗ים) "Here are the things". The proof quote is "He subjected you to the hardship of hunger and then gave you manna to eat", the Talmud again has its own way of interpreting and reading these laws, which some Jews study for many years to get aquatinted with.    However, hopefully, that answers your question.	1642978553.0	htxxexj	t3_sautz9	t1_htx9jsz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htxxexj/

nxyvc	Warry is no more than a brief introduction; there isn't much space to go into depth on any of the controversies. As such, it's a fairly bland consensus piece (nice pictures though). It is, therefore, just as dated, though without quite as much of an axe to grind about the traditional view being unquestionably correct. It would be better to go for a more recent general work like *The Ancient World at War* (ed. Philip de Souza) or *The Oxford Handbook to Warfare in the Classical World* (ed. Campbell & Tritle). Sidebottom's *Ancient Warfare: A Very Short Introduction* openly takes aim at Hanson.	1642981343.0	hty4sg6	t3_s83m6b	t1_htokcyv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/hty4sg6/
5cvxk	This is a pretty simplistic question that's perhaps more of a linguist thing, but what's relative prevalence and history of the term "Fandom" vs "Fanbase"?  Growing up (I'm in my late 20's now, in the eastern US) I always heard the latter term, but then maybe around a decade ago the former seemed to become more prevalent for me. Wondering how representative that is or not!	1642981421.0	hty4z9d	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hty4z9d/

177u1k	This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).    For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.	1642984318.0	htyc0de	t3_sb8acc	t3_sb8acc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8acc/who_are_the_top_9_best_presidents_in_your_opinion/htyc0de/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642984570.0	htyclzz	t3_sb8fkv	t3_sb8fkv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8fkv/watching_the_prestige_im_wondering_who_was_first/htyclzz/

djlwk	That is a very good school curriculum if it gets to discussing Manifest Destiny when speaking of the shared history of the US and the Philippines. I always was of the impression that MD as a concept was limited to the geographical limits of the North American continent, particularly the expansion from east to west. A rethinking of the idea is always a nice discussion to have.   Out of curiosity, what particular school are you talking about? I don't quite remember my relatives who attended Ateneo in high school talking about this particular thing, but then again you also did say that it's a fairly recent development. I suppose I'm just happy to know that there are good history curriculums in *some* areas of the Philippines, because it seems so much like I'm the only person I know around me that has any interest, let alone what meager knowledge I have, in it.	1642987323.0	htyj5k2	t3_savz63	t1_htw168o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htyj5k2/

7rvatyyv	Thanks for the clarification about the arrival of the Ossetians. Like I said there's a lot of discrepancy in sources (largely politically-motivated), which doesn't help with that.  And I should word myself better about Gamsakhurdia: while he didn't directly cause the Ossetians to want to leave (they obviously were looking for an out before), his remarks (or supposed remarks, as I mentioned) only made things worse, as did his later actions. He was really not the best option to lead a newly-independent Georgia, and I do have to wonder what could have happened had Kostava not died before then.	1642991782.0	htytzdm	t3_s68982	t1_htxaxo1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htytzdm/

7rvatyyv	I would not comment on Theriault, as I'm not familiar with him, but as I mentioned initially, my concern was that nearly all signatories were of Armenian background, which I felt is worth noting.   Regarding Lemkin, he didn't focus on the Holocaust exclusively, and neither did the UN (and the other international bodies) when crafting the definition of genocide, so I don't think that needs to be further discussed.  As I wrote in another comment, if de Waal has been called out for misinterpreting facts then that is fine; I'll be happy to review that and see what the issue is, as I'm far from an ardent defender of him. All I initially wrote was that *Black Garden* is probably the best English-language book on the Karabakh conflict. I still stand by that as most other works on the subject are written by people on one or the other sides of the conflict, and inherently biased as a result. If there is something else you'd suggest in lieu of that please do let me know, and I will gladly take a look (I've been to Stepanakert and Shushi, and really enjoyed visiting the region as a whole, by the way).  Lastly, I'll conclude that it's interesting to see the 1923 date used in the French-language text, and I'm curious to see how Kevorkian and Ternon analyze things. My French is not strong enough to read something like that, but from what I can tell this is not a translation of *The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History*, but a new book, no?  I'll conclude here by noting that we are kind of off-topic from the original post, though I do welcome your feedback. Like I mentioned in other posts, I'm not looking to downplay the genocide or be pro or anti one side, so I hope I don't come off that way. I know it is a difficult topic for a lot of people, one I can't pretend to understand, and don't mean to offend if that was what happened in anything I wrote.	1642992407.0	htyvkkf	t3_s68982	t1_htu641e	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htyvkkf/
iwanf	Indeed it is, but my understanding is that it is far from the norm in the manufacturing world.  If one buys random marshmallows in a grocery store it will almost certainly be from non-kosher sources of gelatin (unless it is kosher marshmallows, which usually you only find in the kosher aisle, not with the other marshmallows).  And if one buys random gel-caps from a pharmacy my understanding is it is not going to be from kosher gelatin, even if the manufacturer could theoretically have purchased kosher gelatin.  If that second bit is wrong a lot of Rabbis would very much like to know about it...  Note that there was/is an intermediate position in gelatin kashrut--that gelatin needs to be from a kosher animal, but not from one that is actually permitted to eat.  I.e. you can eat beef gelatin even if the animals were not slaughtered and inspected in accordance with Jewish dietary laws, but not gelatin from pigs.  There are even kosher agencies that hold this position that certify gelatin as being from cows and not pigs, though not in the US.  Strictly-kosher gelatin plus beef-only gelatin combined might make up a decent share of the gelatin production in the world.  However, my understanding is that at some point in the US non-kosher gelatin went from mostly cows to mostly pigs, which contributed to the strict position winning the day.	1642992477.0	htyvrio	t3_sautz9	t1_htx9trx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htyvrio/

13ovwf	I can discuss the history of Japanese Educational systems, and so in this response I will.  As you know, education didn't start with the adoption of the western education system, and indeed in the case of Japan goes back much farther to at least the 6th century, with the introduction of Chinese models for society and the increase in Japanese going to China and returning with new knowledge to teach to their fellow countrymen. Education develops from there through the Heian era (794-1185) with  the establishment of government institutions for study, aimed at the upper class. It is also likely that some people not in the upper class had ways of studying but at that point in time records are scarce as they relate to the lifestyle of commoners.   Skipping forward in time to the Edo Era, which is classified as the Early Modern Era and lasted from 1603 until 1867, the educational systems experienced a great growth for all people regardless of social status.   At the time, the government was organized so that the Tokugawa Family (from which Shoguns were chosen), had direct control over large parts of the country, but still most of the land was controlled by various Daimyo, prominent samurai families who passed their titles and control of their territories through their respective families. The Shogun had the power to remove Daimyo who failed to uphold standards of behavior and rule, and also retained the power to manage foreign affairs amongst other things, but the Daimyo were left otherwise to govern their domains in accordance with their own principles. The result of this is that there was not one unified government sponsored education system, nor a unified private system throughout the country. However, individual domains generally followed the lead of the Tokugawa Shogunate and so their systems in practice are similar.   The first type of school was the Hankou, official schools ran by individual domains and aimed at members of the samurai class. These were run very similarly to the Shogunate schools ran by the Shogunate, so for the purposes of this response you can consider them as essentially identical. These included various levels of education, of which some were similar to western universities in that they accepted adults who were looking for a higher education to advance their career or were otherwise interested in studies for personal reasons. They all had a basis in confician ideology, and taught many subjects, including writing skills, literature, geography, math, economics, foreign language, technology, etc... The yushima seido in edo, which was the most prominent school run by the Shogunate, is a famous example which produced many famous scholars and academics.   The second type were Terakoya, which were aimed at non-samurai children and run privately, most often by the teacher. They had no specific curriculum, but generally taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and history, and were usually attended by children who would now be elementary school age. Boys and girls could attend together, and teachers could be commoners, samurai, doctors, monks, priests, and so on. Schools particularly for certain skills, like music or art also existed, and schools specializing in teaching useful household skills to girls existed as well.   The last major group is the Gougaku, government run schools of various kinds that were seperate from the main Hankou. Some provided education to samurai, some to commoners, and some to a mixed group of both. They are distinguished from Terakoya and private institutions because they were established with government support.   Beyond that, various private institutions and personal tutors also existed, but that has changed little to this day.   So, what changed?   1. The majority of these institutions disappeared when their government backing disappeared, or in the case of Terakoya, when universal education supported by the government came into existence.   2. The subjects and methods of teaching changed in many ways with the adoption of western ideas which challenged confucianism.   3. Admissions practices changed, with the new universities being open to anyone in the country regardless of status or place of residence.   4. The internal structure, with concepts like choosing a major and graduating with degrees such as a bachelor's degree, a graduate degree, a masters degree or equivalent was a new addition not present in the previous system.   5. The idea of paying a fixed fee for a set course was introduced   As a result, essentially every educational institution in Japan is based on the western model and very few remain from before then. Additionally, since the naming schemes are different, the first college in Japan would be the first place to be called a college, regardless of the existence of any equivalent institutions.   Therefore, even with a long history of education, the modern system derives mostly from the western system, and thus the institution of higher education in Japan that based itself on a western model to some extent is the first college.   Incidentally, that would be Keio University, founded in the final years of the Edo Era.	1642994152.0	htz03en	t3_s6wkwl	t3_s6wkwl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s6wkwl/chinas_first_university_the_imperial_university/htz03en/

iwanf	> Would you be willing to elaborate on this point? When I think of the term "feeding tube" I think of enteral feeds like a nasal gastric tube or orogastric. This type of feed essentially just skips the mouth and esophagus, but all other digestive processes still occur as usual. Is this distinction between chewing/tasting, and digestion the key factor?  Basically correct.  To give a much narrower answer than /u/ummmbacon, Jewish dietary laws are often concerned with taste as determinant of dietary law.  This is true in a variety of contexts--both prohibited foods^1 and other ritual food contexts^(2,3).  In some contexts being satiated matters^(4).  One could, theoretically, think that because a feeding tube provides nutrients it should be considered like swallowing a food without chewing or tasting it (that is, that it is "incomplete" eating in some sense--or in Jewish legal terminology, "unusual eating").  But the stuff in a feeding tube isn't really food, and people fed by feeding tubes don't feel "satiated" really, so the consensus became that it is not considered eating at all.  1. In prohibited foods, for example, a mixture where a prohibited food added in small measure to a permitted food is forbidden only if the prohibited food can be tasted in the resulting mixture (though since this is difficult to assess, for most purposes 1/60 is used).  Where a prohibited food tastes the same as the permitted food, the laws of mixtures are different * A person who eats matza on passover by throwing it directly into the back of their mouth without tasting it, for example, has not fulfilled the commandment of eating matza * A person who drinks water to alleviate thirst recites a blessing on it, but not a person who has something stuck in their throat to clear, since they are not trying to benefit from the hydration of the water at all * For example, for reciting the blessing after eating a bread-based meal	1642996056.0	htz4hd0	t3_sautz9	t1_htx9jsz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htz4hd0/
2236wuem	u/udreaudsurarea provides an answer that covers this (and to be specific, we're talking about the Neo-Assyrian empire from about the 8th century on - the largest empire in the world at that time - a scale that was unparalleled before and certainly influences their reputation):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pxlpdw/what\_caused\_the\_assyrians\_to\_and\_i\_believe\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pxlpdw/what_caused_the_assyrians_to_and_i_believe_this/)  To be clear, their reputation was not undeserved, the answer discusses how they weren't necessarily as exceptionally violent as their reputation suggests. That said, they were a militaristic society from top to bottom. Their kings were expected to regularly wage war (and there was no shortage of conflict due to regular rebellions), to the point that each year was named after a campaign (although it was unlikely they campaigned literally every year so this is an example of a tradition that may give them a more warlike reputation than they really were). Their kings, in the Mesopotamian tradition dating back thousands of years, wrote inscriptions both public and votive detailing their successes and accomplishments. Here's the thing though - most of this writing is intended to be propaganda. If you take royal inscriptions at face value, the entire history of the Ancient Near East is a steady progression of strong genius warrior kings who never lost a battle. This is obviously not true (especially since they fought each other! Hittite and Egyptian inscriptions about the battle of Qadesh both claim victory, for example. Obviously, someone is lying, or at least stretching the definition of victory). The leaders certainly omitted details when things didn't go their way. Sennacherib certainly besieged Jerusalem, in the bible his army is slain by angels. Sennacherib doesn't bother to mention why they didn't sack Jerusalem (indeed they had just violently pacified Lachish). Perhaps it was disease, perhaps the siege was too expensive, or perhaps they just came to terms with Jerusalem and it wasn't worth writing about.  The Assyrians also practiced something called "calculated frightfulness." This wasn't unique to them, even at that time, but their execution of it was noteworthy. Their own tendency to describe their exploits and the extremely violent retribution on rebels (true or not) was certainly a part of this. Sieges are expensive and time-consuming and it was more reliable to kill people in a city's hinterlands and put their corpses on display as an act of intimidation to cow a city into surrender (with surely better terms than if it were taken by force). It must be understood then that a lot of their writing wasn't just propaganda for its subjects but intended to frighten would-be rebels or other opponents. It was in the Assyrian's best interest to be as scary as possible; a good way to win a battle is to scare your enemy into surrendering.  Assyria's reputation for violence is often contrasted against their famous neighbors to the South, the kingdom of Babylonia. Part of this is that due to Assyrian tradition and culture their royal inscriptions focused on their military exploits while Babylonian inscriptions focused on building and religious activities. This didn't mean that the Assyrians only waged war, and it certainly doesn't mean the Babylonians didn't! Nineveh was by all accounts an impressive imperial capital just like Babylon would become under Nebuchadnezzar shortly after Assyria's fall. Nebuchadnezzar led the infamous sack of Jerusalem that led to the mass deportation of many Jewish people and left a significant impact on their history, as reflected in the Hebrew Bible. There aren't any detailed Babylonian inscriptions detailing the sack and ensuing violence and deportation, like there would likely be if the Assyrians had done it, but the event left a lasting cultural memory. The writers of Psalm 137 of the Bible certainly were not fans:  >Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,    happy is the one who repays you    according to what you have done to us.    9 Happy is the one who seizes your infants    and dashes them against the rocks.	1642996217.0	htz4um8	t3_s9mr1v	t3_s9mr1v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9mr1v/how_did_the_assyrians_get_the_reputation_of_being/htz4um8/

n4bht	The first thing to remember is that this wasn't Nixon's first run for President. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. was a VP nominee alongside Nixon in 1960, and was in fact under consideration by Eisenhower for his 1952 run; he was a prominent and certainly unsurprising pick, but Nixon lost. Part of the issue with the campaign was a lack of coordination, as Lodge didn't take to a round-the-country touring schedule and sometimes cancelled appearances. Some of his attempts at television went so badly the footage was simply scrapped and never went to air. He additionally was from Massachusetts, and Nixon was running against JFK from the same home state (who had beaten Lodge before, in the 1952 Senate election!) so there was no extra help from that front.  Agnew, by contrast, was still a relatively low-level political operator after being tapped by Nixon, and was grateful for his elevation and was much more willing to work and coordinate with Nixon on overall strategy.  Regarding the home state, Agnew was not picked _just_ for Maryland, but as part of Nixon's entire Southern strategy. So while George Wallace still got Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the Nixon/Agnew ticket managed to grab both Carolinas plus Florida as well as four of the border states.   Agnew was not picked in _contrast_ with Nixon's positioning (who considered himself conservative centrist, and certainly was compared to Goldwater from 1964, with musings about tactical use of nuclear weapons and an acceptance speech about how "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice"). Agnew, though, still had a tough-on-crime stance, and was vocal enough pushing against certain elements of the civil rights movement to make the South happy. Agnew, during the 1968 riots in Baltimore:  >People are fed up with the riots. I’ve tried to be liberal, but at some point you have to stop leading the people and start following them.  and in fact spoke so strongly against black community leaders in Baltimore a former governor (McKeldon) stated "That speech made him the darling of the Strom Thurmond set."  As far as Agnew's loud poltical posture, that was all part of the plan, with Agnew as lightning rod, and while Nixon did not screen his comments, they did meet regularly enough that he wasn't just being a loose cannon when he said things like "if you’ve seen one slum you’ve seen them all". During the Presidency a portrait hung on Agnew's wall signed by Nixon: "To Vice President Ted Agnew, who has demonstrated his character in the ultimate tests of political combat. From his friend, Richard Nixon." Agnew was vocalizing for, as Nixon termed it, the Silent Majority.  This is all consistent with Nixon's own comments in his memoirs about the choice of Agnew:  >Though [Agnew] had no foreign policy experience, his instincts in this area appeared to parallel mine. He had a good record as a moderate, progressive, effective governor. He took a forward-looking stance on civil rights, but he had firmly opposed those who resorted to violence in promoting their cause. As a former county executive….he had a keen interest in local as well as state government. He expressed deep concern about the plight of the nation’s urban areas. He appeared to have presence, poise, and dignity, which would contribute greatly to his effectiveness both as a candidate and, if we should win, as Vice President. From a strictly political standpoint, Agnew fit perfectly with the strategy we had devised for the November election. With George Wallace in the race, I could not hope to sweep the South. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to win the entire rimland of the South – the border states – as well as the major states of the Midwest and West. Agnew fit the bill geographically, and as a political moderate he fit it philosophically.  Certainly everyone still wasn't happy, and Nixon himself eventually soured, and according to Haldeman he pushed for an entirely different VP for his second run (Treasury Secretary John B. Connally) but as noted in the question, that's a story for a different time.  ...  You can watch some "man on the street" reactions right when Agnew was nominated [at the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYS0c3YqSn8).  Holden, C. J., & Messitte, Z. P. (Eds.).

8ey69pyk	It is merely a translation that is not to be taken literally and one that requires context. The passage in that page is from Bernardino de Sahagún’s Florentine Codex, where he lists nahuatl culinary terms and some ingredients sold at markets such as the pre-Hispanic Tlaltelolco here. In this case, “bird excrement sauce” is the literal translation from Nahuatl *totocuitlatl molli*. Although *totocuitlatl* is “bird excrement” in Nahuatl, it was also another name for the chiltepin pepper (*Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum*). Specifically, these names are briefly described to designate a “very small spice” in the Crónica Mexicana, which discusses the history of the Mexica (Aztec would rather be an anachronistic term here). It is likely that this chili pepper’s small size and roundness, reminiscent to that of fecal sacs, is what earned it its name. To compare, there is a similar case with the plant *Ornithogalum umbellatum*, whose edible bulbs were referred to as “dove’s dung,” due to its resemblance to the excrement itself, according to Fernald in Edible Wild Plants of Eastern North America.  About the chiltepin pepper, this common name also pertains to nahuatl *chiltecpin*, or roughly “chili pepper flea,” due to its tiny size and high spice content being comparable to that of a flea bite. Unfortunately, nahuatl terms and names are often mistranslated or require context, such as the commonly accepted etymology for the avocado.	1643001185.0	htzes8i	t3_sam5zs	t3_sam5zs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sam5zs/what_is_this_aztec_bird_excrement_sauce/htzes8i/

The points (simplified, obviously) are the ones I put on my previous post: the attempt from ataturk to liquidate the survivors of the 1915-1916 by chasing them to Caucasus, trying to prevent the creation of armenia as an independent country (for obvious reasons), the massacres, and finally the spoliation of the wealth and erasing any cultural trace of the armenian civilization (down to scientific names of animal species in latin).	1643001490.0	htzfbq9	t3_s68982	t1_htyvkkf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htzfbq9/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1643006422.0	htznhe6	t3_sbf687	t3_sbf687	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbf687/what_famous_regionalnational_dishes_couldnt_exist/htznhe6/

e49gp06y	Depends what exactly you mean. Are you asking for who financed Hitler before the NSDAP? Or who financed Hitler and the Nazis? The first one is a bit harder to answer since Hitler tried (and succeeded) to eradicate a lot of evidence about his own past to simply be able to paint a much more favorable picture of said past. While he was in Vienna and Munich he mostly lived of a mixture Orphan's allowance (half at first because of his father having been dead already and full extend after his mother had died because he successfully claimed to be a Student of Art despite not being one) as well as some financial help from his Mother and Aunt while they were still alive. But he kept running out of money more and more and eventually held himself above water bei moving into a boarding house for men (yes, that was a thing) and started selling some copies of paintings or other famous motives. Often with the help of, ironically enough, a lot of jewish people who helped him sell those.  In 1913 he then got paid out the full inheritance of his fathers fortune (or, well, his share of it) and used that Money to move to Munich. That's where he got caught by the german police because he dodged Austrian military Service. So in the end he was pulled in anyway. So from 1914 to 1920 he was pretty much financed by the Army.  He took part in the Munich Council Republic in 1919 where he even became a Councilor himself but as soon as the Freikorps came in at Mai of that year he pretty much denounced all of his comrades in an instance in order to save his own neck. And career. The Reichswehr pretty much paid him as well for being a contact (known in German as "V-Mann") among the Socialists in the Council Republic and then send him off to take part in seminars against "Bolchewik-Propaganda".  He was released from the Army (Reichswehr) on April 1st 1920 and from thereon he was pretty much making a living of holding Speeches (yes, he got paid for that) and his general work within the NSDAP.  Now the NSDAP throughout the 20s had a multitude of supporters. Many of them members of the aristocracy among which Wilhelm III was a very enthusiastic Nazi who supported the NSDAP and Hitler quite a lot financially or, of course, as well as Industrialists like Fritz Tyssen or Emil Kirdorf. The Nazis really had no lack of powerful an rich supporters.  Hope that answers your question somewhat.	1643015655.0	htzzrbw	t3_sbczey	t3_sbczey	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/htzzrbw/
fw2hd	To start with, while it is generally claimed that in the second half of 16th century the overland route through the Middle East had revived and possibly surpassed Portuguese Cape route, it most likely wasn't by three times. Here is an example, Anthony Reid's [estimate](https://imgur.com/SllqXXX) of pepper exports to Europe, from his article *An 'Age of Commerce' in Southeast Asian History, page 16*. For 1585 his estimate is 1170 tons via Cape route, and 1600 tons via overland route via Levant which is more, but not three times more. And I must mention that his findings are challenged, for example by C. H. H. Wake, who thinks the volumes Reid gives are maximums and only happened when Portuguese failed to nake their delivery (which in close of 16th century happened more often with shipwrecks and piracy). But, it's not really an important issue to be honest, but from it we can make out two things: for one - we really don't have a good way to estimate spice flow to Europe through Middle East, and two - what we can see doesn't really reflect such a large disparity as written in your quoted book.  Now, all this is actually peripheral to your main question, which is:  > I find a hard time believing merchants found it more advantageous to sail around an entire continent than to buy spices from the Middle East. Couldn't European traders just buy spices from the Middle East sail that far to trade directly from India. Couldn't European traders just buy spices from the Middle East sail that far to trade directly from India? Was it really worth it?  First to note is that for centuries, Europeans have been doing exactly that: getting spices in the Middle East. Venetians as the most famous actors but also Genoese, French, Catalans, others have been sailing  to Egypt and Levant and buying spices there. There were some hassles, obstacles and short interruptions but generally speaking this trade was continuously flowing and profitable for all involved. However, what is important is that the prices in Egypt (Alexandria) were substantially higher then prices in India (origin of pepper). M.N. Paerson in his book *Portuguese in India, page 41* gives an [example](https://imgur.com/uscIARO): "a kilo of pepper would cost 1 - 2 grams of silver at production point, 10-14 grams of silver in Alexandria, 14-18 in Venice and 20-30 across Europe. that's a huge difference! Just between India and Alexandria was 10-14 times! Why so much? Due to nature of the transport to take the spice there. Taken from this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ak4cc/as_i_understand_it_columbus_was_trying_to_create/d11syma/) the route looked like this: across the Indian Ocean to Aden, where goods would be transferred from larger ocean going vessels to smaller ships to navigate the more dangerous Red Sea to (Mamluk) Egypt, or branched to other directions like Ormuz and Persian gulf or East African Swahili coast.In Egypt, land caravans from Seuz would take the goods to Cairo, then ship them down the Nile to Alexandria where Venetian traders would buy them and distribute them throughout Europe. It was quite a complicated and established set up, with many middle men, many different transport costs - large ships, small ships, caravans with many camels, cost of loading/unloading. Add many borders and taxes and duties and you get a huge price at Alexandria. And then you need to add cost of distribution from Alexandria and European middle men.    How did this cost compare to the Cape route: well, quite unfavorably actually. While this route was a longer trip, it was a single trip, with no stops, no loading/unloading, no extra borders and duties, no middle men. Not to mention cost of transport on ship was much the cheapest around, much cheaper than transport by camels/horses a caravan through Middle East would take. I've discussed the profitability in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bzuzs8/during_the_17th_century_what_was_worth_more_the/eqxy2ar/). Let's just take from there the relevant part:   > Portuguese cost of carrack that can carry 1000 toneladas of cargo to be 50,000 cruzados (Portuguese gold coins) but the prices fluctuated widely. At the same time, pepper (the cheapest commodity) could be sold in Europe at prices of 28-45 cruzado per quintal (around 51 or 58 kg). If we account for losses and round down that 1 tonelada can fit 15 quintals of pepper, each quintal being worth minimum of 28 cruzados, we get that a 1000 toneladas carrack can have pepper on board worth 420,000 cruzados, almost 8 times the worth!   As said there, a great source for the investigation of profitability is [*Decay or defeat ? : an inquiry into the Portuguese decline in Asia 1580-1645*](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/15783) by Ernst van Veen, who analyzed the Portuguese and Dutch voyages of around year 1600. I can't recommend this article enough for anybody who wants raw number analysis.  To sum up: the Middle East route was expensive. Many middle men, many transfers of cargo on different means of transport, not least of all land transport via caravans, on top of all duties, taxes and customs of numerous borders, as well as personal cuts of all the parties involved made the spices really expensive by the time they reached Europe. In contrast a ship buying at the source and selling at the same prices as these Middle Eastern prices could basically keep it all this profit and expenses for itself (minus the expenses of the trip itself, which was not as gigantic as you might think). With the amounts of spices arriving in thousands of tons, this would pay itself.   Still it was actually a close race (as evidenced that 16th century revival of the overland route) not least due to Portuguese keeping a high price of peppers to maximize their earning, and the Europeans making the Cape Route did not count only on the economic and financial viability of the route to give them advantage, but effectively used force to control the areas of production and monopolize it and prevent competition. They weren't completely successful in it to be perfectly honest. Especially the Portuguese, but stacked together and more and more Europeans joining in the ocean route, the grip was tightening.

He was really not the best option to lead a newly-independent Georgia, and I do have to wonder what could have happened had Kostava not died before then.  Nothing would change, as Russia repeatedly threatened Georgia during that period.  The Georgian army was bombed several times, and Yeltsin also threatened Shevardnadze or Gamsakhurdia (I do not remember which one) to bomb Tbilisi if they invaded South Ossetia.  South Ossetia is strategically important for Russia because it is very close to Tbilisi.	1643016797.0	hu014h1	t3_s68982	t1_htytzdm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/hu014h1/

6hr4g	Given that the "alt right" movements like AfD fare well in Eastern Germany and that Confederate imagery is fairly common in modern alt-right imagery, do you think that the lack of self-admitted link might be due to self-censorship?  Another possible reason for the difference in perception between the treatment of natives and that of blacks in Western / Civil War settings could be that they can identify better with the "natives" being overwhelmed by invaders. By contrast, "blacks" would by seen by those alt-right east Germans as similar to the Middle-Eastern immigrants coming to Europe?	1643017012.0	hu01dqc	t3_savz63	t1_htwpzgg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu01dqc/

nxyvc	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643018142.0	hu02px1	t3_sbhwli	t3_sbhwli	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbhwli/how_did_debatespeech_play_a_part_in_diplomacy_and/hu02px1/

Was being the party that wanted to murder Jewish people their "brand", or were they just known as a right-wing party advocating for policies XY&Z with antisemitism as more of an afterthought?  Was the average citizen explicitly aware that Nazis were antisemites? If so, did they agree with it? If so, to what extent? Did they want or expect anything close to outright ethnic cleansing, or was the expectation maybe more in line with Jim Crow laws?  Did the party have much support among voters who weren't antisemitic but overlooked the antisemitic rhetoric to prioritize other parts of their platform?	1643019481.0	hu04b06	t3_sbczey	t1_hu018jo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu04b06/

nxyvc	Since this question obviously isn't about the advent of names or individual identities but about the use of writing to record them, the real question you're asking is one of documents: What is the oldest piece of writing to include a human name?  Inevitably the answer is going to fluctuate based on how we date pieces of writing and whether a particular label should be seen as a name. You can see in the Kushim article that there is some debate over whether Kushim is actually a name or just a title of office (imagine archaeologists of the distant future asserting that the earliest recorded human name is "Manager"). There is more agreement on Iry-Hor (32nd century BC), as u/kookingpot explains in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3gsvqn/i_recently_read_a_quote_saying_people_die_twice/cu170wv/).	1643021581.0	hu06xiu	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htwhnta	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu06xiu/

4dsoyqkx	Not a Historian but a resident with a fable for local history here.   The site where the Cathedral stands now has had a church standing there since at least 812, possibly longer back to the 5th century. The impetus for starting to build the gothic Cathedral we are now familiar with came when the Archbishop of Cologne in 1164 managed to transfer the bones of the Magi, the three wise kings of the east from the story of christs birth, to Cologne from Milan.   The Cathedral is not the only building in the city that is related to the event by the way , several archways were constructed on the way that the reliquary was carried, i know of at least one still visible today.   Anyway, the presence of the bones lead to a massive influx of pilgrim, Cologne became what we call a "Wallfarhtsort", a holy site that is a destination for pilgrim. The old dhurch from the 8th century proved insufficient for the masses, and in 1248 the foundation was laid for the current building. Progress was financed by donations from locals and the revenue that the pilgrim created.   Progress was very slow, but not unusually so by the standarts of the time. The first parts to be completed were the choir facing the Rhine that houses the reliquary. and the central cross area. I hope someone else can fill in exact details why progress eventually stopped (I suspect it was loss of fervor because progress literally took decades, + the advent of the reformation). But in the the early 16th century work was stopped and the towers were left unfinished with a crane on top.   That crane by the way became a symbol of the city, you will see it on a lot of graphics and pictures from the time, we even have a local saying the the apocalypse will come when the Cathedral is finished.   Construction resumed because Cologne became part of a wealthy new power looking for a prestige project, Prussia. in 1842 Wilhelm Frederick the 4th restarted the project officially. Which was supposed to serve as a symbol of national unity. Important to note that by that point Restoration work and training of a new generation of stoneworkers had gone on since the end of the french occupation in1812. Afterwards it still took 40 years to complete the Cathedral. An important new technology was the use of Steel to build the girder structure for the roof. This prevented the Cathedral from burning down when it was bombed in the second world war.  The building is still not finished today. Attached to it is a place called the "Dombauhütte", a workshop for the Masons that still constantly duplicate and replace parts of the Stonework because of environmental damage. Interestingly the Cathedral used to be white yellowish in colour. The black we are familiar with is the result from it standing next to the central station and decades of coal smoke and environmental polution.	1643022238.0	hu07rn7	t3_saxaeo	t3_saxaeo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saxaeo/generations_of_workers_spent_312_years_building/hu07rn7/
l6to6	My comment will be based purely on linguistics, so this may not be what you are looking for, it still answers your question in a certain way, but not fully.  Both Celtic and Germanic languages are part of Indo-European languages, like most other languages in Europe are. Inside the Indo-European family, different language subdivisions hold different proximity to eachother. For example Baltic and Slavic languages are closer to each other than for example Germanic and Celtic, which is deducted by similarities between the languages, and archeological evidence where possible. By following different languages through time, and looking at new inventions, we find out approximately when a language group split off into two. According to Chang, Will; Chundra, Cathcart (2015) article, Germanic languages split of from Italo-Celtic first, followed later by the split of Italo-Celtic a few centuries later. Another article from 2013 groups Balto-Slavic as the closest group to Germanic, and Italo-Celtic as the second closest. (Also do note that Italo-Celtic has a history of going in and out of favour with linguists and there is no consensus of its existence). I haven't seen a modern study that would link Celtic and Germanic as the closest relatives of each other, and none that would put Germanic as a "descendant" of Celtic, as consensus is, that Germanic languages emerged before Celtic ones.  So to answer your question: no, Germanic people are not descendents of Celtic people, atleast not linguistically. There might be generic evidence that show a different picture (Celts assimilating into Germanic), or there might be archeological evidence that show relation between the people that would explain the possible incorporation of Celtic gods into Germanic pantheon, be it with trade, war or some other way. There are many cases in history where foreign gods got incorporated into new religions, so that might be the answer you are looking for.	1643022262.0	hu07sso	t3_sb6ppa	t3_sb6ppa	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb6ppa/were_the_celts_and_the_germanic_peoples_related/hu07sso/

nxyvc	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

dg00c	> He took part in the Munich Council Republic in 1919 where he even became a Councilor himself  This is somewhat true but it's important to be clear what this means. Hitler continued to serve as a soldier throughout the Republic, from when he returned to Munich from Traunstein in February 1919, to when the Republic collapsed at the end of April 1919. He was stationed in the Second Infantry Regiment's Second Demobilization Company. He was not a politician at this point, and had no involvement in Munich government politics.  However, within the army, Hitler did get elected to serve as a representative of his fellow soldiers. He was elected at some time prior to April by the soldiers of his company to serve as their *Vertrauensmann* (Soldier's representative). This was a minor position which was intended to facilitate the smooth running of the regiment.    On April 15 Hitler stood for the *Bataillons‐Rat* (Batallion Councillor) elections and was elected by his company as *Ersatz‐Bataillons‐Rat* (Deputy Batallion Councillor). This again was a soldiers council, not part of the Munich Council. He acted as his company's deputy representative on the council of their Batallion. While technically this can be said to have give him a position of influence within the Munich regime, it was a very minor position, and any influence or authority he had was exclusively within his own military unit. This lasted until the Freikorps arrested him on May 1st as they invaded the city.  >as soon as the Freikorps came in at Mai of that year he pretty much denounced all of his comrades in an instance in order to save his own neck. And career. The Reichswehr pretty much paid him as well for being a contact (known in German as "V-Mann") among the Socialists in the Council Republic  After being released, on May 19th Hitler, in an effort to stay in the Army as his current batalion was being disbanded, volunteered to serve on the 'Investigation and Decommissioning Board' of the Second Infantry Regiment. He did inform on the men of his old company, and used his knowledge as his company's old V-Mann or *Vertrauensmann* and *Ersatz‐Bataillons‐Rat* to provide informaiton to the board about his old comrades political leanings. But he had been transfered out of his old company at this point, and so wasn't a spy within their ranks.	1643023048.0	hu08tlb	t3_sbczey	t1_htzzrbw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu08tlb/

e49gp06y	Sorry, by Wilhelm III I mean Crown Prince Wilhelm the son of Wilhelm II. He is the very reason the Hohenzollern won't get their former property back because it was proven by a very in depth and detailed assessment in Germany that the Crown Prince was substantially supporting and aiding the Nazis to their rise to power. Including financially. I can give you a links to all four assessments but I'm afraid they are all in German\^\^   And, yes, sorry. Thyssen. Little typo there. And, yup, that is that very Thyssen. There are many big German Industrialists who supported the Nazis. Even if a lot were hesitant and only got more cozy with the Nazis after 1933.	1643023492.0	hu09f1j	t3_sbczey	t1_hu048i9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu09f1j/

e49gp06y	Oh absolutely. The best example of that wouldn't even be Germany however but rather the USA. The successful Revolution and the subsequent Takeover of the Bolsheviki just added even more to that. Especially in Germany which already saw it's own Revolution in 1918 and 1919 which, however, failed even if the Communists and Socialists didn't really give up on it until much later. The KPD remained a very prominent Party in the Reichstag and had pretty consistently good turnouts and results.	1643024117.0	hu0a992	t3_sbczey	t1_hu018jo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0a992/

e49gp06y	A Meeting held by the (back then) "DAP" (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) on February 24th 1920 in the "Hofbräuhaus" in Munich decided two very important things. First of all that they would be renamed into NSDAP and second of all their new electoral program called the "25-Point-Program".   Point 4 in this Program reads:   "Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of creed. Consequently, no Jew can be a member of the race."  Points 5-8 don't make the point much better because they very much talk about Jews because of the precedent set in point 4. So in a way the NSDAP was clearly motivated and influenced by Antisemitism from the very moment on it even became the NSDAP. After that there are a multitude of speeches Hitler held in the Hofbräuhaus and elsewhere which make his intentions towards Jews clear beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Well as you can see the intentions of the NSDAP were very obvious and very clear for everybody to see. In addition you have "Mein Kampf" in 1925 which makes this issue even clearer. Everybody who supported the Nazis had every opportunity to know exactly what the Nazis stood for. Even in the 1920's you had to have looked away very deliberately already to not notice the Nazi's antisemitism.    Considering that Antisemitism was an extremely widespread issue at the time I'd say people who supported them agreed with that very much. It's nothing that can be empirically proven of course. Especially because many just lied about it after the war or actually because disillusioned.   Segregation was already a given with the 25-Points-Program but point 8 made an even more definitive statement:   "8. Any further immigration of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since the 2 August 1914, be forced immediately to leave the Reich."    The implication of the first stages of an ethnic cleansing can already be seen in this. Further there are the speeches of Hitler himself which give an even clearer indication. Quote:   "We don't want to be sentimental anti-Semites who want to create a pogrom mood, rather we are inspired by the unrelenting determination to get to the root of the evil and eradicate it root and branch. In order to reach our goal, we must use any means, even if we have to associate with the devil."   Speech held on April 6th 1920  In a Letter to Konstantin Hierl, Hitler wrote on the 3rd of Juli 1920:    "As little as I can blame a tubercle bacterium for an activity that means destruction for people but means life for them, I am also compelled and entitled to fight tuberculosis for the sake of my personal existence by destroying its pathogen. The Jew, however, has become the racial tuberculosis of the people through thousands of years. To fight it means to remove it."  Granted nobody could read that letter but it's not like Hitler held anything of this back in his speeches as can be seen in the first quote. The NSDAP arguably grew bolder in their actions and words against the jewish population but something amounting to an ethnic cleansing was definitely foreseeable.  "Did the party have much support among voters who weren't antisemitic but overlooked the antisemitic rhetoric to prioritize other parts of their platform?"   It's hard to make a definite statement on how many percent of NSDAP-Voters or Supporters were Antisemites and how many were not since most people would've simply lied about having ever supported the NSDAP at a time where this question could've been asked and incorporated into a study. And even if they said to have voted for the NSDAP, they would've never admitted to being an Antisemite.    However...   I would say for absolutely sure that there were many people all too willing to overlook this blatant Antisemitism simply for their own goals. After all there were organizations made up of Jews who actually supported Hitler and the NSDAP.	1643026645.0	hu0dx1o	t3_sbczey	t1_hu04b06	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0dx1o/

e49gp06y	Yup. He was pressured multiple times by members of his family to start an apprenticeship. He was even offered one as a Screen Painter for Theaters by Alfred Roller but he refused because he understood himself as an Artist and didn't want to do "Bread-Work" since he felt it was beneath him. He lied to his own family about it multiple times in order to keep receiving the orphan's pension which otherwise would've gone towards his Sister Paula.   On that note I suggest "Hitler's Vienna" by Brigitte Hamann. Very good book about that time.	1643027207.0	hu0esmu	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0djej	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0esmu/

88vwr8h8	The Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916) was a treaty signed between France and Britain, in the midst of the First World War, to essentially agree on which nation would take control of what, *when* the Ottomans conceded defeat. The agreement resolved that Britain would be given control of the area which today includes Israel, Palestine, Jordan and southern Iraq. While France would control the area. which today includes Syria, Lebanon and northern Iraq.  I think you are conflating the Paris Peace Conference (1919-1920) with the Treaty of Versailles, which was only one of several treaties signed at the conference. The Treaty of Versailles was specifically the peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the German Empire. It was also at the Paris Peace Conference that the League of Nations was established, which was succeeded by the United Nations in 1946.  Also signed at the Paris Peace Conference was the Treaty of Sèvres (the terms of which were also discussed at the 1920 Conference of London), between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire. This treaty ceded Ottoman land in the Levant to the Allied Powers, but was never ratified.  The parts of the Treaty of Sévres dealing with the Levant were essentially incorporated into the later Treaty of Lausanne, agreed between The Allies and the Ottomans following the Turkish War of Independence. The Treaty of Lausanne was ratified in 1923, and came into force in 1924.  It was at the San Remo conference (1920) that a final partition of the previously Ottoman-controlled Levant was agreed by the Allies, broadly along the lines agreed between Britain and France in the Sykes-Picot Agreement.  This is an extremely dense and complicated topic, dealing with numerous national aspirations, and many international conferences, peace treaties and other agreements. My answer is therefore painted with fairly broad strokes.  But, one of the key distinctions to note is that the Sykes-Picot agreement was basically a ‘private’ arrangement between Britain and France, with some oversight by Italy and Russia. Whereas San Remo was a League of Nations conference, which passed a League of Nations resolution.  Just as two nations today could make an agreement with one-another behind closed doors, this is not the same as having the terms of this agreement passed as a resolution by the UN.	1643028669.0	hu0h7o6	t3_sa9mb7	t3_sa9mb7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa9mb7/what_did_the_treaty_of_versailles_do_to_the/hu0h7o6/

Suzdal, at the time more important than what would be Moscow, was also damaged, but maintained its relevance as the capital of a rump principality (Vladimir-Suzdal) after Kievan Rus fell apart. Vladimir-Suzdal, in turn, broke up to several pieces.  In general, what was left of important cities ended up becoming the capitals of principalities; like Smolensk, Chernigov, Polotsk, Halych-Volhynia (these ended up under Lithuania/Poland and so were not in a position to challenge Muscovy).  So not only did eastern centers get dealt worse hands during the Mongol Invasions, they were subjugated by Poles and Lithuanians.	1643029223.0	hu0i69n	t3_s8r5cx	t1_hty96x3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5cx/out_of_the_all_the_various_rus_princedoms_why_was/hu0i69n/

6460h940	I am not sure if I am allowed to jump in an ask another question. This is all very interesting. Are you able to tell me if this "preservation of life" is the basis of the (and I think I am right here) reason that Chief Rabbi of the UK made it clear that, for the duration of WW2, jewish people were allowed to eat pork products?  *^(All I know about this is from a bit of oral history from a local lady, who told me about her two little evacuees from London. She and her husband had a pig farm and the two sad, little waifs she had collected turned out to be jewish. She wrote to the nearest synagog to ask what rules they, a non jewish couple, should abide by for the sake of "their two boys" and was told that she should just raise them as they were her own for the duration of the war. They decided the children should read the old testament on Saturdays and then went to Methodist Sunday school whilst she and her husband went to chapel! One of the boys became a Rabbi in the US, so it can't have been too bad!)*	1643030107.0	hu0jr93	t3_sautz9	t1_htydr70	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/hu0jr93/

yfege	A topic I'm always delighted to write about! I've answered similar questions about American schools so I'll be pulling from those answers. To the second part of your question, public education in the 1910s was fairly chaotic in general, especially in the American south. The first few decades of the 20th century saw the convergence of a number of policy and funding shifts that would eventually lead to the modern structure of tax-payer funded school districts and the expectation that children would spend their day in the company of other children, under the supervision of adults they weren't related to. These shifts included the passage of anti-child labor laws as compulsory school attendance laws moved from being laws in theory to laws in practice, the merger of schoolhouses into school districts with attendance boundaries, and the creation of funding structures that linked a school's budget to the count of children attending the school. It's possible some schools elected to hold children back a grade but generally speaking, grade retention was fairly uncommon and students moved through all 8 years (kindergarten was only just beginning to take shape and a high school diploma wasn't yet an essential criteria for adulthood) fairly unencumbered.   These shifts, plus the solidification of the modern liberal arts curriculum, happened across the country at difference rates and meant that what happened at school (or college) during the Spanish Flu was highly, highly dependent on local context.  First, to colleges. From an older response:   > One thing to establish is that in 1918, attending college was a fairly uncommon event in a young person's life. According to the [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf), there were 1,041 designated institutions of higher education in 1918. By 1992, there were 3600. Also according to NCES, 3.4% of 18 to 24-year-olds were enrolled in college in 1917-1918, 4.7% in 1918-1919. By 1991, the percentage was up to 51% (but also, in 1990, 44% of enrolled students were over the age of 24.) In contrast, there were hundreds, if not thousands of schools in some cities and states as districts were only just beginning to merge. >  > In addition, Fall semester of American colleges doesn't nearly track onto the Fall months. Many colleges of the era started in mid to late-August and ended after Thanksgiving or in mid-December, meaning young people arrived during a lull in the pandemic while others were attending college near where they lived. It's safe to say everything that happened at universities during the pandemic was fairly idiosyncratic. However, we can see a few patterns and it looks like most colleges made the call to quarantine sick students, require masks, and teach outdoors when possible. >  > Genevive Carlton did a nice round-up [here](https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/higher-education-and-pandemics/) of different moves at different colleges. Her findings are interesting and speak to what was happening around the country: >  > [Stanford was hit hard](https://news.stanford.edu/thedish/2018/03/15/100-years-ago-the-spanish-flu-hit-the-stanford-campus/) by World War I, which impacted how the college operated > University of Montana held classes in the open > [University of North Carolina](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/03/spanish-flu-1918-0317) went into lockdown and quarantined as many students as possible, with limited success > "[At Elon College](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2020/03/24/weve-been-here-before-elon-the-spanish-flu-of-1918/), the influenza epidemic struck in mere days, spreading to 75% of the students. With no time to close campus, the college transformed its gym into a makeshift infirmary, with healthy students nursing those who fell ill." > One thing that I think can't be separated from the pandemic is the impact of World War I on student populations. It looks like there was a policy for closing schools due to Student Army Training Corp activities, concurrent to the flu so it's possible there were schools that closed for the activities, which helped reduce the spread. >  > From the *K-State Collegian* on Oct. 18, 1918: >  > > The Aggie football schedule has been interrupted to quite an extent due to the epidemic of the Spanish influenza. The Aggies have been unable to carry out their schedule this season, because of the orders of military authorities, which forbade teams in a valley school where there is an [Student Army Training Corp training] to leave their school for more than a day. The closing of the schools throughout the valley has likewise made it impossible to schedule games with teams within one day‘s traveling distances. > >  > > It had been planned by Coach Clevenger to have Kansas University here this Saturday for a game, but the closing of the school made it necessary to cancel this game. It is currently being planned to schedule a game for a week from Saturday here with either Kansas University, the Haskell Indians or Washburn. A page from the 1918-1919 Royal Purple Yearbook about the "Big Five" - the players expected to lead the team for the season limited by the formation of the Student Army Training Corp and eventually, the Spanish flu epidemic. >  > Only one Aggie starter has been in the hospital, and it was reported this afternoon that is was fullback Azel Husted. Husted has been quite ill during the past week, but is now starting to improve and is expected to be out of the hospital within the next few days.  With regards to K-12 schools, a lot came down to teachers' health but again, each school/district/city handled it a little bit differently. Boston stayed open, NYC closed. Meanwhile, I found multiple instances of short notices in local papers announcing that school would reopen or had reopened following the Christmas holiday because the teacher no longer had the flu. One listing read simply:  > Centennial school in Hamilton township opened on Monday. The teacher, Miss Minnie Coble, has recovered from the flu.  Most of the re-opening notices that I found appeared to be clustered around January, 1919 but there were multiple instances where a school announced re-opening in the Fall of 1918 after a short closing and a second re-opening announcement appeared in December 1918 or early 1919.  Some schools did try to stay open during the pandemic but faced resistance from teachers. In November 1918 while the Anne Arundel County (Annapolis, Maryland) County Health Advisor was announcing that schools were going to open, a group of teachers in Pennsylvania refused to go to work as some of their colleagues had gone to a conference and contracted the flu. By August and September 1919, Spanish Flu had pretty much burned itself out and schools opened normally.  [In this longer answer,](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fcxn1q/how_did_american_schools_handle_outbreaks_of_the/fjgxcfn/) I get into more about cleaning routines and procedures but one thing that's worth stressing is that part of the responding to the Spanish Flu was responding to the deaths of hundreds of children. From the piece:  > To us in the modern era, it can be overwhelming to look at the statistics around the Spanish Flu (195,000 American deaths in just October 1918) and have difficulty connecting to the human impact. While looking for articles about schools' responses to the Spanish Flu, I came across dozens of funeral notices in local papers for children who died, even some from families that lost multiple children in one week or day. School can sometimes feel like an impersonal space but those notices serve as a reminder that the adults working in them have long tried to do what they feel is best for the children they're responsible for, making the best decisions they can with the information they have.  Although there's limited evidence of specific day to day practices in schools of the era, we do know that teachers had to deal with the losses and help their students through that loss.	1643030713.0	hu0kw7h	t3_sbauq0	t3_sbauq0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbauq0/how_was_education_k12_or_college_impacted_during/hu0kw7h/
pbs83	> Were families of WWII soldiers who were designated MIA or POW paid their salary?  Yes. Public Law 77-490, popularly known as the "Missing Persons Act," was passed by Congress on 7 March 1942. Sections 2 and 3 provided that any service member listed as missing in service, missing in action (combat), interned in a neutral country, or held as a prisoner of war, would have base pay, allowances, and allotments of pay to dependents continued from the point of their absence. Proper authorities were permitted "for the well-being and protection of dependents of persons in active service" to unilaterally adjust allotments of pay to dependents, "subject in all cases" to termination only by request of the absent person.

9x5qn2xl	Christianity very much did spread to Britain. The council of Arles in 314, was attended by three British bishops, representing British communities. We are not certain if there was British bishops in the council of Nicaea called by Constantine, but we know there were British bishops in the Council of Serdica in 345 and Council of Arminium in 359. Britain even managed to produce its own unique Christian heresy called Pelagianism that was very popular within Britain and led Saint Augustine to spend some of his time refuting, so it can be assumed that Christianity was well-established in Britain.   However, Britain was unique in one regard. It was invaded by barbarians that didn’t immediately convert to Christianity. Goths, Franks, Vandals, Burgundians, Suebi, lombards etc converted to Christianity almost immediately upon entering the Roman Empire or even before they entered Roman Empire although many largely converted to the Arian variety Christianity. Either way, the Roman Christian writers never referred to the Goths as being ‘pagans’. Instead Goths were always branded as heretics by Christian Roman writers. For instance, the Roman Christian writer Orosius writes with extreme hostility in the early 5th century that:  >“The Goths had petitioned through ambassadors that bishops be sent to them from whom they might learn the rule of the Christian faith. In fatal perverseness the emperor Valens sent teachers of the Arian doctrine, and the Goths continued to believe what they first learned concerning the basic principles of the faith. Therefore, by the just judgment of God Himself, Valens was burned alive by the very men who, through his action, will burn hereafter for their heresy.”      On the other hand, the sources we have that come from Romano-British writers refers to the Anglo-Saxon invaders as being unquestionably ‘pagan’ of course. This is strongly emphasised by the British priest Gildas, so when he extorts the western British lords to drive back the Anglo-Saxon invaders, he does so by referring to the invaders as being pagan. This is clearly an appeal made to what is presumed to be a largely Christian audience (the lords of western Britain), so we can assume upper echelons would have been Christianised by the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions.    But why didn’t Anglo-Saxons immediately convert to Christianity like other Barbarians? It can’t be said with any certainty, but it might simply because no one had bothered to convert them until Pope Gregory sent missionaries. The Goths were likely converted by a combination of the Arian missionary Ulfilas and Emperor Valens. The other Germanic tribes were converted by the Goths. The Goths showed a markedly greater missionary fervour in the 5th century than the Roman Catholics  and successfully sent missionaries to a number of pagan Germanic tribes to convert to Arian Christianity. For instance in the 5th century, the Visigothic king, Theodoric II, successfully sent the missionary Ajax to convert the Suevi to Arianism.   On the other hand, Roman Catholics were rarely interested in converting non-Roman citizens to their Christianity, especially those living outside of the empire. Although the Goths heretical tendencies were regarded with some hostility, it was also regarded with some relief by the Romans as it differentiated them religiously from the Barbarians and helped to draw a divide. The exception being Franks who converted to Catholic Christianity to gain vital support from the Gauls against the Arian Goths after the western Roman Empire had already fallen.   So Roman Catholics for most of the 4th and 5th century were largely uninterested in converting non-Romans. It was only in the 6th century that Catholic missionary activity picked up, which is why you have St. Gregory sending missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons. The 8th century Anglo-Saxon writer Bede records that the ‘Britons’ (that is the Welsh) always remained Christian, but speaks contemptuously of them because of their past refusal to convert Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.  Bede writes:   >“Among the other unspeakable crimes, recorded with sorrow by their own historian Gildas, they added this – that they never preached the Faith to the Saxons or Angles who dwelt with them in Britain. But God in his goodness did not utterly abandon the people whom he had chosen; for he remembered them, and sent this nation more worthy preachers of truth to bring them to the Faith.”  Welsh bishops were even asked by one of St. Gregory’s missionary named Augustine to help them convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity, but they refused.   Therefore, Christianity was certain widespread in Britain by the 4th and 5th century and the Britons remained Christian (the unconquered western parts that is now known as well Wales at least) throughout Anglo-Saxon domination of Britain. The Anglo-Saxons likely remained pagan for almost two centuries due to a lack of Catholic missionary zeal and the fact that Christian welsh (the Christians closest to them) were extremely hostile to Anglo-Saxons and had no desire to convert them to Christianity as pointed out by Bede.

yfege	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643033146.0	hu0pr9y	t3_sblxe2	t3_sblxe2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sblxe2/what_are_some_recent/hu0pr9y/
yfege	Hi there - we're happy to approve your question related to your creative project, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists and the like, based on past experience: some people working on creative projects have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what's needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it's not always what you want to hear.     Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you're asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don't know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way. However, if you wish for a flair here to do this work for you, you will need to organize this with them yourselves.

wnefu	Interestingly while this general dispensation is part of my Jewish wife’s oral history, all the searches I’ve done for it are to secondary sources which simply accept it as true. This source: http://www.jewishmag.com/136mag/uk_rationing/uk_rationing.htm#FOOTNOTE%2011 seems to indicate that a general dispensation from The Chief Rabbi never happened. My wife’s grandmother once told me that their family rabbi had told her that while they were evacuated, they should eat whatever was given to them and I imagine that many other such conversations must have happened.	1643035713.0	hu0veoq	t3_sautz9	t1_hu0rb9t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/hu0veoq/
2fnid1f1	Whilie I can't answer the second part of your question, I can shed some light on the first.   To understand Hitler's own individual antisemitism and the antisemitism the Nazi's espoused, you have to take a look at the broader German/Austrian, and European context. Western Europe, at this time, was a pretty antisemitic place, and it had been in various forms for centuries. While the earlier antisemitism (during the pre-modern times) was mainly religious and xenophobic in nature, the 19th century saw the rise of so-called "scientific antisemitism", which sought to explain and proof these firmly rooted beliefs with a combination of history, biology and other (social) siences. While these beliefs were by no means exclusive to Austria, by the turn of the century, and certainly after the First World War, Vienna and other cities in the South-German space became a true hotbed for this new antisemitism, were at became an almost legitimate, albeit fringe, political stance, with a lot of parties, clubs, and various political movements dedicated in some way, shape or form to it. They often combined anti-semitic tought with radical nationalism, and what was know as the 'völkischer' tought, which focused on the 'Volk', the People, the ethnic tribe if you will. This is the context in which rise of  the NSDAP as a party and Hitler needs to be seen.  Being anti-jew was a main propaganda point for both the party and Hitler, but I wouldn't say they latched on to a thing growing in popularity. They were a biproduct of something that already was very, very popular.   Given this context, it is very possible Hitler did actually believe that the jewish people were a scroun in Europe, and while he maybe did not believe the old myths about jewish people (cannibalism, disecrating holy objects, poisining wells,...) he almost certainly believed that Jews were, as a people, less to the Germans/Europeans. This was ofcourse combined with the more modern  theories about the larger Jewish conspiracy in the banks, media world, literature and culture, which ties in to the whole back stab theory about the First World War. There is (some) biographical proof about the development of Hitlers toughts and his slow radicalisation from a standard right-wing nationalist into something much more extreme, but the difficulty with this is that most of it is based on statements made after the war by personal friends and accquintances, who are always serving some sort of agenda. It is fair to assume he was, and had been, an antisemite long before he saw the political oppurtunity of it, because lots of accounts, including his own, talk about this. Also, as stated before, this wouldnt've been a weird or unseen stance in Bavaria at the time.   Lastly, I personally think it's rather dangerous to place the source on something "happening" to Hitler, thus causing his beliefs. There is, ofcourse, no compelling evidence that he ever would have had such a horrible experience with a presumed Jewish person that it would cause him to hate them all. This places the burden of what has happened solely on him, while the horrible events of the Holocaust and the Second World War are a result of a lot of political and historic factors. It's far to easy to just blame it on the mad-man Adolf.   Evidence about the source of Hitler's own beliefs is very hard to find, but in Ian Kershaw's biography about Hitler there is a fair bit dedicated to it. I'd recommend it if you really want to dive deeper into this subject.	1643035739.0	hu0vgth	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0qcsj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0vgth/

for0hho1	I have read that Nixon wanted his running mate to be able to function as an attack dog during the campaign, which Eisenhower had forbidden Nixon to do and which Lodge had been fundamentally unsuited to do. Do you think that is accurate and do you think Agnew was among the best possible nominees to be Nixon's attack dog in 1968?	1643037798.0	hu10cvf	t3_sb8hmj	t1_htz65eh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8hmj/why_did_nixon_choose_agnew_in_1968/hu10cvf/

7xgnjo	Once again the flakeyness of the comment editor means I lose a fair bit of response for reasons I can't quite fathom. If there's something weird going on in the post it's because am trying to copy/paste into it and I don't know what it's doing.  In short, the ability to sneak around with cavalry was rather limited, especially in the context of jumping on artillery. Cannon were not deployed behind your battle lines, but actually more likely in front of them.The majority of artillery tended to be deployed front and centre for the simple reason that your troops will be rather unwilling to be the first to be hit by a cannonball ploughing through their backs on their path toward the enemy. Cannon can't shoot over your own troops unless they are physically placed above them. Or so far back that the cannon will be severely limited in range and there will still be friendly fire incidents. Cannon ranges are fairly modest as things go. We are deep into the 1800s before we get effective howitzers and they only really come into their own in the 1900s which solves the range and direct fire problem of artillery. Effectively all modern artillery are howitzers and not cannon. The solution to this dilemma of course is to park cannons on a hill or other elevated position, but there is no guarantee you will be able to pick your battlefield. The other issue is that artillery for most of the period wasn't easily moved so if there is too much moving around you might no longer have placed the cannon in a position they could be effectively used. This means there is a lot of jockeying about where a battle will take place and often if you found too good a spot the enemy simply chose to not engage you. Furthermore, as your cannon require good line of sight to fire, their placement tends to be in spots that aren't easily approached without being seen in return. The other side of the coins is that cannons can't easily be moved. So there are battles where cannon change hands several times, even being used by both sides, durign the course of the battle.Another aspect is that until the 1800s battlefields are fairly limited in scope, communications and armysizes simply didn't allow too much spreading around or you risk losing control of your forces. With few accurate maps and no GPS it's not easy to actually sneak around. Coordination wasn't easy in the best of times and successful cavalry actions has several times turned victory into defeat when cavalrytroops follow the enemy off the field or end up looting the baggage train. Basically letting your cavalry off the leash too much risks them not being where they are needed. You normally do not want your cavalry to be "behind enemy lines" because that's not where the enemy cavarly is and the end result may be that you are losing the battle due to not having cavarly of your own, especailly in the 1600-1700s where the side whose cavalry prevailed in the (usual) cavalry battle on the wings of the battleline could then destroy the enemy infantry centre at leisure.Sometimes it worked though, in the battle of Wittstock 1636 Swedish commander Banér had his left wing cavalry perform a long circuitous movement while the centre and right attacked with right hook movement that forced the Imperial army to redeploy. This let the Swedish left effectively sneak up on the Imperial  army and flank them. Amongst other things according to Montecuccoli capturing the Saxon artillery without it having fired a shot. However, they had had more trouble finding their way and only arrived in the nick of time when the right was about to break and the Swedish force suffered considerable causalities and could well have lost the battle had the flankers been delayed even an hour more or even less. Note that the Imperial artillery at this battle had originally been deployed centrally but ended up exposed as the battleline had to shift.As to the question of artillery guards, yes they existed, among the first troops to be issued non-matchlock muskets were the guards of the artillery train (due to the firehazards). But these troops aren't exactly numerous enough to stop a determined cavarly charge, their job was security from sabotage and during marches and camps. Being too close to artillery was dangerous, cannons could blow themselves up and there was a lot of gunpowder that could explode so you don't want too many troops too close to the artillery. The cannon themselves are more likely to stop cavalry using canister and grapeshot provided they can be handled in time. As you would deploy cannon fairly centrally to some degree the entire rest of your army was effectively the guards of the artillery. More so the further we go in history, few battles in the 1600s were decided majorly by cannon, but by the time of Napoleon they are becoming battle deciders, AFAIK. The amount of cannon used by armies increased substantially over time. At Breitenfel 1631 the Imperials had about a dozen guns of various caliber, at Nördlingen 1634 34 heavy guns and 116 light pieces.Finally, do note that the crew of the cannon could fairly easily escape. Cavalry might not be able to take their time to properly spike the cannon (and that means literally driving spikes into the fireinghole to render them useless for the battle) and of course you might not want to if you are expecting to win the battle and capture the cannon for yourself. There are many examples where the crew can re-man their cannon if only limitedly spiked, or indeed the enemy can use the captured cannon against their former owners like at Lützen in 1632.Rather than sneaking around the battlefield capturing cannon, the more likely actions was what the Light Brigade were famously tasked with in 1854 at Balaclava. To prevent the enemy from using a captured artillery emplacement. What they instead did was to frontally charge a well emplaced and protected different artillery battery with tragic consequences for the troops. Even so the light brigade did reach the cannon and scared the artillery men away. Temporarily. In other words it's quite possible to charge, successfully (or not), enemy cannon without sneaking at all.	1643038329.0	hu11olb	t3_sb8okf	t3_sb8okf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8okf/was_cavalry_often_used_to_sneak_back_behind_enemy/hu11olb/

n4bht	I'm not sure if "attack dog" is the best metaphor, but what you are talking about is essentially what I discussed in my paragraph about he Silent Majority. A [fairly good example is Agnew's famous speech on television](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/spiroagnewtvnewscoverage.htm) after a Nixon speech on Vietnam.  >The audience of 70 million Americans gathered to hear the President of the United States was inherited by a small band of network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed in one way or another their hostility to what he had to say.  This message was more effectively delivered from an outside source; if Nixon had complained in the same way about the response to his own speech it would come off as weaker.	1643038431.0	hu11xo3	t3_sb8hmj	t1_hu10cvf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8hmj/why_did_nixon_choose_agnew_in_1968/hu11xo3/

nxyvc	History is often relevant as a mirror for the present, but we are at pains to keep discussion of modern politics off our sub. When a question requires direct comparison with the present, the thread will inevitably be derailed by discussions of what things are like today and how it affects people, rather than focusing on the historical information that our experts can provide. It is more productive to ask about this in a more historical way, and draw your own conclusions about what that might mean for the present.  You're welcome to ask about the role of the media in the escalation of a particular historical conflict, or about the views of mass media *about* the start of wars in the 20th century, for example.	1643038850.0	hu12zhr	t3_sblk3w	t1_hu0k5op	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sblk3w/is_there_a_pattern_in_news_outlets_leading_up_to/hu12zhr/

5fhew	> That's where he got caught by the german police because he dodged Austrian military Service. So in the end he was pulled in anyway.  It was my understanding that he was eager to enlist in the German army for ideological reasons (he viewed himself as a German and detested the "multiculturalism" of Austria-Hungary). You seem to be implying that he resisted military service altogether.

pncvt	So, to be rather pedantic, there are photos of one emperor who reigned in the 19th century, albeit taken in the 20th: a French photographer for the periodical *L'Illustration* snapped the Guangxu Emperor disembarking from a sedan chair in 1908, the year before the emperor's death – you can see this photo on [page 21 of this PDF scan of the relevant publication](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/L%27illustration_19081121_a.pdf). Now, this photo was taken somewhat illicitly by what seems to have been a prototype paparazzo, so obviously wasn't a commissioned photographic portrait. Yet as you may be aware, a substantial number of Qing nobles and officials were photographed – [Zuo Zongtang](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Zuo_Zongtang_1875.jpg), [Prince Gong](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/%E6%81%AD%E4%BA%B2%E7%8E%8B%E5%A5%95%E8%A8%A2_Prince_Gong_Yi_Xin_%28AI_repair%29.jpg/1920px-%E6%81%AD%E4%BA%B2%E7%8E%8B%E5%A5%95%E8%A8%A2_Prince_Gong_Yi_Xin_%28AI_repair%29.jpg), and [Dowager Empress Cixi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/The_Ci-Xi_Imperial_Dowager_Empress_%285%29.JPG), to name a few; even the Guangxu Emperor's consorts, [Zhen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/%E5%85%89%E7%BB%AA%E7%8F%8D%E5%A6%83.jpg) and [Jin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/The_Imperial_Consort_Jin_in_her_old_days.jpg), were photographed. So why not the emperor himself?  This is something with no firm explanation: simply put, people tend to give more reasons for the few things they do, than the many things they don't. However, if we look at the history of Qing imperial portraiture, that of Qing court photography, and that of Qing coup attempts, we do get a few ideas as to why the Guangxu Emperor in particular seems to have gone unphotographed.  Imperial portraiture was always slightly symbolic, and never intended to depict the exact, actual appearance of the emperor at a given time. The face was generally left unchanged, but otherwise emperors were generally shown in peak bodily health and sometimes in exaggerated stature relative to their surroundings. Moreover, these portraits were primarily for use within the imperial clan, and especially the emperor himself; the image of the monarch was not really something for mass distribution in a way comparable to European monarchies. Photographs, then, didn't necessarily fulfil the functions that painted portraits did, at least not any better: they couldn't (yet) be 'brushed up' to emphasise the idealised self-image of the emperor, and their arguably greater reproducibility wasn't a particular draw either.  More importantly, perhaps, is the simple fact that photographs of imperial family members were generally taken at those people's behest. With the exception of Felix Beato's 1860 photograph of Prince Gong (which took place during the negotiations for the Convention of Peking that ended the Second Opium War), the photographs we have of the Xianfeng Emperor's brothers, Princes Gong and Chun, were taken without significant duress – indeed, Prince Chun, the Guangxu Emperor's father, was particularly photogenic and made a point to pose in casual dress for several photographic portraits, taken principally by Liang Shitai (also known as Seetay). The Dowager Empress Cixi's photographic portraits, taken between 1903 and 1904 by a Manchu photographer named Xunling, were themselves of a particular context, as the Qing re-established relations with the foreign powers after the 1900 Boxer Uprising. This period saw Cixi apparently seeking to reap the benefits of adopting Western-style depictions, leading to oil portraits by [Katharine Karl](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/The_Empress_Dowager%2C_Tze_Hsi%2C_of_China%2C_by_Katharine_Carl%2C_1904..jpg) in 1904 and [Hubert Vos](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Hubert_Vos%27s_painting_of_the_Dowager_Empress_Cixi_%28Tzu_Hsi%29.jpg) in 1905, as well as the photographs taken by Xunling. Princess Zhen seems, herself, to have had an interest in photography that led to her being photographed at some point in the late 1890s.  By the time that Xunling was photographing Cixi, though, the Guangxu Emperor was not exactly in a position of substantial power. Indeed, he had been effectively deposed in a coup in 1898 and placed under house arrest, with his contact with the outside world kept to a minimum. It is unlikely that Cixi, who deposed him, would have been interested in sending over her court photographer to take a few shots, nor would she have been particularly keen on permitting the arrival of a foreign photographer either. Of course, the Guangxu Emperor did hold power before the coup, having reached a reasonable age of majority in 1889 (when he turned 18), but at this stage his father's photographer, Seetay, seems to have ceased activity, so unless he was particularly interested in getting his photograph taken – which, as noted above, was far from a guarantee – there wasn't anyone around able to take one whenever.  In short, portrait photographs are the sort of thing you want to get taken, and during the nine years he was actually ruling, the Guangxu Emperor just didn't really bother getting a photograph done. And by the time there was a decently active court photographer, he was living under house arrest so it didn't really matter what he wanted.  ### Sources and Further Reading  * Ying-Chen Peng, 'Lingering Between Tradition and Innovation: Photographic Portraits of Empress Dowager Cixi.' *Ars Orientalis* 43 (2013)  * Claire Roberts, 'The Empress Dowager's Birthday: The Photographs of Cixi's Long Life Without End.' *Ars Orientalis* 43 (2013)  * Yi Gu, 'Prince Chun Through the Lens: Negotiating the Photographic Medium in Royal Images.' *Ars Orientalis* 43 (2013)	1643040481.0	hu176m3	t3_sbjd7t	t3_sbjd7t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbjd7t/why_are_there_no_photographs_of_19th_century/hu176m3/

1n19jp1g	The difference between these questions is that the older one is, from a certain angle, more about the geopolitical situation around Hawaii in the late nineteenth century. Yours, on the other hand, is more speculative as you're talking about pretty big factors in Louis's execution. I think you could try asking whether there was much political will for Louis's execution before the Flight to Varennes instead.	1643040745.0	hu17vcm	t3_sbnu3k	t1_hu0xy67	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbnu3k/had_king_louis_xvi_not_attempted_to_escape_and/hu17vcm/

kq9b0	Thanks Snowblizz, that was a really interesting answer.  I was partly curious about this as I I play the Age of Empires 3 strategy game where cannons are a major part of the game dynamics especially in late game, and cavalry can be used as quite an efficient anti-artillery force that however has to manouver its way to the cannons to destroy them (there are also anti-artillery cannons, "culverins"), and so there's always an intensive competition to take down the other player's cannons first.  Also, now that I mentioned the culverin, were there actually any "anti-artillery" cannons?I.e. accurately aiming cannons that could (maybe) outrange the enemy's anti-infantry artillery to take it out?

6xfkem5f	Hi! I am an undergraduate history student from India. The school syllabus here primary covers Indian history. World history is also covered but not in as in-depth a manner as Indian history. The world history portion of my syllabus included the Mesopotamian civilisation, ancient Rome, feudal Europe, the Renaissance, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and the history of modern Japan and China.  In my college syllabus, we have two courses of Indian history and one paper of world history in each semester. The courses are ordered chronogically, beginning with the prehistoric world in the first semester and ending with modern history in the final one. Apart from this, there are also elective courses which are region-specific, such as History of the USSR, History of USA, History of Africa, History of China and so on.	1643041844.0	hu1apmy	t3_s7qqa4	t1_hu08z44	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu1apmy/

mdu63	While much more can always more to be said, I hope my previous answers below might be useful to consider OP's question:    * [Was Slavery A Part Of The Hanseatic Trade?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/al76kx/was_slavery_a_part_of_the_hanseatic_trade/) * [How did the Christianization of the Norse affect their relationship with slavery?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kzg4li/how_did_the_christianization_of_the_norse_affect/)    +++    A) Very brief answer to your individual assumptions, with possible links to the relevant post by other users and by me in this subreddit.    Generally speaking, all of OP assumptions listed below are more or less correct.    >* Assumption #05: Around the same time the slave trade in Europe declined dramatically.  Late 11th century also saw the decline of the slavery in Northern Europe, especially around the Irish sea areas, though to what extent it might have been able to be ascribed to the single historical event like the Norman Conquest, it is still room to debate.   * [How extensive was the slave trade in pre norman Ireland](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pn7u6/how_extensive_was_the_slave_trade_in_pre_norman/) by /u/textandtrowel * [Who were the slaves in medieval England?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7zn37/who_were_the_slaves_in_medieval_england/) by /u/Steelcan909 * [Did the Norman Conquest result in enslavement of the natives and how was the plunder-land divided up or was it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lgl9h1/did_the_norman_conquest_result_in_enslavement_of/) by /u/BRIStoneman * [Did William the Conqueror abolish slavery in England?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/23s9eo/did_william_the_conqueror_abolish_slavery_in/) by /u/Mediaevumed  +++  >b. if they do, how come the norse slave trade died out?   Possible answers are mainly twofold.   The first one is, as I explained before in these two posts linked above, the structural change of society within post-Viking Age Scandinavia that would lead to be that of less dependent on the unfree labors.    The second possible hypothesis, although intricately intertwined with the first one, is the change of Norse (or Scandinavian) direct access to the possible market of slave on demand side, preferably with enough wealth for slaves.    Several recent studies focus on the inflow of Islamic silver into north-western Europe, especially in form of the hoard from Viking Age Scandinavia. The majority of them dates back to the 9th and early 10th centuries, that is to say, the early Viking Age, and the scientific analysis (metal like bismuth) suggests that some of silver in these coins actually come far from central Asia like now Afghanistan. Rus' merchants exchanged slaves from NW Europe/ Eurasia with these eastern silvers, and Russian waterways up to Caspian Sea was, so to speak, crossroads of these silver and slaves, as I also introduced before in: [Where did the Piast dynasty originate from?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j4dhqb/where_did_the_piast_dynasty_originate_from/). The imbalance of the price of slaves between Western and Middle-Central Eurasia in the 8th and 9th century, possibly due either to the slavery-based social social structure or/and the regional variance of the demography impact of successive waves of the First Pandemic of Y. Pestis, is also pointed out (in *the Origin of European Economy* by M. McCormick). Coupled the high demand/price of slaves with the abundant supply of silvers, the slave trade from the West to the East in early Middle Ages was probably really lucrative business.   One possible important point is, however, that this inflow of Islamic silver in Scandinavia by way of Russian waterways stopped in the middle to late 10th century - probably due to the decline of silver production in mines in central Asia (especially under the Samanid Emirates). In short, Norse slave traders lost, or at least was cut from their traditional very profitable slave market by the end of the 1st millennium.    Thus, while some Russians kept on raiding (whose motive was to get slaves as loot, at least partly), the Norse couldn't exploit the raiding/ slave trading as a source of wealth anymore after the 11th century that would eventually lead to the declining trend of slavery in their homeland, though some people still had domestic thralls even in the end of the 12th century.

lpht4c8	>What held Grant back, and what held both the Confederacy and the Union back throughout the war, was the state of professionalism in the wartime armies. Many of the Generals who fought in the American Civil War, on both sides, really werent generals at all. Lee was a Colonel before the war, Grant was a washed up Captain, Winfield Scott Hancock was a quartermaster, Sherman was a Colonel at First Bull Run, etc. Nobody really had the command experience required to maneuver large forces either strategically, or tactically. Unlike in Europe, where generals learnt how to be generals for decades before a war put their training to the test, in America, these men had to learn on the job. What that meant was that those with natural talent, like Lee, Grant, and Sherman, floated to the top, while everyone else made a mockery of warfighting. And when a commander would be wounded, or worse promoted, their subordinates would have to come up to fill the gap, regardless of skill or training. The Armies needed officers, and it was too late to shove a new batch through West-Point to make a general staff.  This is a great point that I'd never thought of, though it reminds of Joshua Chamberlain, a professor of rhetoric, who was offered a position as a full colonel when he enlisted simply because he was educated and could read/write (he declined, asking for a lower rank where he could learn the ropes - they gave him the rank of lieutenant colonel).	1643043520.0	hu1f6x0	t3_sb6is0	t1_hty0br7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb6is0/did_the_confederates_really_had_better_generals/hu1f6x0/
177u1k	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643043638.0	hu1fiie	t3_sbpztw	t3_sbpztw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbpztw/what_are_many_ways_classical_greek_civilization/hu1fiie/

177u1k	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

amsnx9lh	That's a very black and white question. Procopius' work in general was a huge game changer when it comes to perception of Justinian's reign, as he is the only major dissident whose works remained to this day. You must take into account that Procopius was a part of senatorial oligarchy and was opposed to men of low standing like Justin and Justinian, on top of genuine disagreements about policy, such as border defense, loss of autonomy in cities, higher taxes in them (and less money for local projects) and treatment of heretics. Some aspects of his criticism, such as the massacre of Nika rioters and the suppression of dissidents, are well attested in other sources, and Procopius is not only well-educated but, as a legal advisor of Belisarius during his campaigns, often well-informed about intricacies of the system and an eyewitness of many major events (like Justinian's plague in Constantinople,  where he brings us a first hand account (although his tendency to blame Justinian for it is very questionable)). But when it comes to more personal matters, a large chunk of Procopius' Secret History does follow rhetorical conventions for slander (or invective), and as such the work as a whole has to be taken with a massive grain of salt. It's also important to note that Procopius' other major work, History of the Wars, is likewise full of hidden criticism, which is expressed in typical classical fashion: through omissions and analogies with the classical past.  If you're familiar with various invective texts from the classical period, you will run into a fair share of recurring tropes, clichés and so on that appear in Procopius' work as well. An obvious example -- there's one very cursed part about Theodora using all of her holes (to emphasize her promiscuity and thus emasculate her husband, common invective) and cursing god for not giving her a few more -- what's interesting about this is that there are multiple iterations of this exact invective. One is from "On Types of Style" by Hermogenes, which reports a version of the Demosthenic speech "Against Neaera" by Apollodoros of Acharnae where it is said that she "plied her trade through three orifices". But according to Tzetzes, this is an amplification of accusations made by Lysias against Antiope, which was later amplified even further by Procopius. The history of this obvious invective shows that there's little to no truth to it, it's a rhetorical device made to humiliate Theodora, and by extension Justinian. There's also a fair share of references and allusions to earlier sexually themed slander (like Juvenal) as well as some literary tropes from the likes of Aristophanes. Another obvious example would be the narrative about Belisarius. The story goes that Belisarius and Antonina adopted a stepson who essentially cuckolded Belisarius. Belisarius tried to capture and kill him after being in denial for god knows how long despite practically having caught them in the act, but then he was falsely accused of treason and his wife and Theodora plotted and convinced him that Antonina is the reason why he didn't get a death sentence. The chapter itself is called Gynocracy and goes to show Belisarius as an emasculated slave to his wife. This is, by the way, a very common type of slander. Think of Tacitus', Suetonius' and Juvenal's description of Claudius and Messalina. It left such a mark that Messalina became synonymous with an insatiable nympho. For example, slanderers of Catherine the Great called her Messalina of the Neva. These slanderous pieces are often inserted to amplify the effect of verifiable, actual policies of Justinian. For example, the BDSM-ish part about Belisarius licking Antonina's feet (also a common element, from Suetonius off the top of my head) is very cleverly placed, as immediately afterwards Procopius goes on with how Justinian introduced proskynesis, something generally associated with Eastern despots (thus, negative connotations in a Roman society). He also makes comparisons and analogies with classical historians writing about, let's say, Cambyses II, as well as comparisons with Khosrow with whom they were warring at the time, and other Easterners. Also comparisons with Domitian, one of the least favorite (if not THE least favorite) Roman Emperors. It was in general pretty common for Roman historians to use past rulers as surrogates for criticism of current ones (Tacitus using Tiberius to criticize Hadrian, Ammianus using Julian for Theodosius I and so on). In his History of the Wars, his criticisms of the ruthless crushing of the Nika riot are expressed merely through parallels with Diodorus Siculus and tyrants of Syracuse.   But in defense of Procopius, it's a historically attested fact that Theodora was an actress, and back then actresses were a profession strongly associated with prostitution, often for a good reason. Most surviving sources ascribe this background to her. Even among monophysite sources, which are favorable of the empress, some like John of Ephesus bring up her problematic past. Whether she actually engaged in prostitution or not is an open question, but it is very likely that she did, and even if she didn't, as a former actress, her social standing before she rose to power was only a notch above prostitutes anyway. Additionally, performing indecent acts on stage, like the ones described by Procopius, would be by no means unusual. Another interesting addition to these claims is that right before he got married to Theodora, Justinian made it legal for the senatorial class to marry prostitutes.   To sum it up, Procopius' Secret History \*is\* a biased account. Nonetheless, it certainly also contains a nucleus of truth, but it's very far from something that can be taken for granted.	1643043966.0	hu1ge6g	t3_sbjkf6	t3_sbjkf6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbjkf6/roman_historians_is_procopius_secret_history_a/hu1ge6g/

g43fx4pr	Not sure about that, but Lenin did supposedly say the following to Anatoliy Lunacharsk:  > You’re famous as a patron of the arts, then you must firmly remember, that film for us is the most important of the arts.  Both Lenin and Stalin also understood how movies could be used to push their ideologies to their people and foreigners. [You should check out this Russia Beyond article.](https://www.rbth.com/arts/330983-soviet-comedy-films) Here's a quote from it:  > It was Lenin who first identified cinema as the most important of the arts, yet in practice the Soviet movie industry was launched by his successor, Joseph Stalin. Uncle Joe simply adored cinema, and often invited the party elite to private screenings. He wanted Soviet cinema to keep pace with the development of Soviet industry as a whole.  > “Stalin assumed the role of super-producer,” writes Solomon Volkov in his book Modern Moscow, published by Elena Shubina publications, AST. The dictator himself appointed and dismissed cinematic bosses, personally overseeing the creation of “important” films, reading scripts, and watching all pictures. What’s more, the world’s first film school was set up in the USSR!	1643045132.0	hu1jju5	t3_sbfkiv	t3_sbfkiv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbfkiv/did_stalin_ever_say_if_i_had_hollywood_i_wouldnt/hu1jju5/

iovlhi6b	Periodization (the "start" and "end" dates assigned to what is seen in retrospect as a historical era) are always subject to debate.  The first answer that comes to mind for me, for this particular question, is 1890.  That was the date that the US Census office declared the "frontier" to be "closed," since the Census Bureau felt that the population across the West was sufficiently dense that they did not consider it to qualify as a "frontier."  But my expertise lies in European, not American history, so Western historians might define it differently.	1643049023.0	hu1u5hl	t3_savz63	t1_hu040mw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu1u5hl/

For me, "fanbase" refers to the audience for a particular work: the people who are committed enough to a series/team/author, that they are going to read it or watch it.  "Fandom" is usually used in ways that imply a sense of community or organization (or at least communication) among the fans.	1643049159.0	hu1uipd	t3_savz63	t1_hty4z9d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu1uipd/

b7cbr4dh	Just to add a small tidbit that u/triscuitsrule didn’t address because they stated a desire not to address Lost Cause mythology: the economic argument of taking better care of property than hired labor was both a core piece of Deep South/confederate/KKK propaganda and remains so to this day. As a moral argument it has force because of the horrific treatment of wage-labor but is/has been constantly used opportunistically to valorize the actions and statements of what we now call white-nationalists. This includes the allusions to other slave societies, especially the noble and venerable example of Ancient Rome which Europeans (western euro whites especially) LOVE to make reference to for anything. It is no accident that this argument came to your head and that you were unaware of the facts of the population boom, how it happened and its connection to the ban on the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. You can thank the Daughters of the Confederacy and their extremely successful campaigns ~~against national public education standards~~ to have fair and balanced representation in regards to civil war history. I am from the south and have been listening to more and less eloquent versions of this argument all my life. This is true background of the Critical Race Theory “debate” and is another aspect of the South losing the war but winning the peace. That is to say, we should all try to minimize amplifying white nationalist talking points.	1643049339.0	hu1uzv6	t3_ri7v2u	t1_ht3d4at	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ri7v2u/were_black_african_slaves_in_the_united_states/hu1uzv6/
7xgnjo	>Also, now that I mentioned the culverin, were there actually any "anti-artillery" cannons?I.e. accurately aiming cannons that could (maybe) outrange the enemy's anti-infantry artillery to take it out?  Well first, "culverin" is really just a name for a long barrelled cannon. By and large names of cannon shouldn't be taken to mean too much over the years. There are loads of names, they aren't really standardized and sometimes one country adopts a name from another for a fairly different weapon and sometimes names don't meaningfully map to any specific meaning. A saker, culverin and falconet can be exactly the same thing really, or even more confusingly be of different caliber and weight of shot compared to another gun named the same. So e.g. Charles V Holy Roman Emperor "standardized" his guns to only 7(!) calibers. In 1609 the Spanish reduced it even further to only four: 48-, 24-, 12- and 6-pounders, noted by Uffano in his 1613 manual as a remarkable feat. The 48 pounder being referred to as  a "full cannon" and the other usually as fractions thereof. The 48 and 24 pounders was mostly for sieges. This reduction of calibers was continued and e.g. the Swedish army made do with only 24-, 12- and 3-pounders. The last a regimental gun cast from bronze and light enough to actually be literally man handled and advance with the infantry.  So we see here that artillery as we go on tend to become less specialised and more general purpose to simplify logistics. Basically, it doesn't quite make sense to make special anti-artillery artillery. At the battle of Rain in 1632, where the Swedish army forced a crossing of the river Lech, one of few battles in the period where artillery alone was decisive, there is contemporary illustrations showing that they had successfully performed counterbattery work. As mentioned above the Swedish had very heavily reduced the number of calibers so we must conclude they could do this without special purpose-built guns.  Now likewise we don't exactly have "anti-infantry" guns either (at least not in field battles, naval ships and fortresses could have things like swivel guns that are mostly concerned with anti-infantry work). Though the category of "regimental guns" (which really only means they are operated as part of regiment, but it does imply a lighter gun) is mostly against enemy troops, this does include being used against cavalry, hence they aren't solely anti-\*infantry\* weapons strictly speaking. In fact providing extra firepower against cavalry was a large part of the attraction of the regimental gun. Even a 3-pounder will deliver shot or better yet grapeshot, of sufficient force that armour is rendered basically meaningless. In so far as depending on how you want to see it, we could say that yes you have artillery outreaching anti-infantry artillery. But there's a lot of caveats to make it so. During the 1600s at least, where am most knowledgeable, cannon generally was somewhat inaccurate. Although ins killed hands it could be occasionally devastating. The Swedish commander, later fieldmarshal, Lennart Torstensson was fairly celebrated for his use of artillery unsurprising for a man who was colonel of (all) the artillery and later general of artillery. How inaccurate it could be however is demonstrated by the unfortunate artilleryman who during the siege of Regensburg in 1634 managed to miss a tower 24 successive times and was hanged for his incompetence.	1643049348.0	hu1v0ob	t3_sb8okf	t1_hu199wk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8okf/was_cavalry_often_used_to_sneak_back_behind_enemy/hu1v0ob/

iovlhi6b	The Western reenactors have been active in Germany for over a century, which is longer than LARP fans have existed (as far as I know), so I'm not sure if there's much of a history of cross-pollination.  I never saw the term LARP used within the reenactors' discussions and publications.  But in practice, they did often host competitive combats and performances of different types  (e.g., knife throwing competitions).	1643049641.0	hu1vt1a	t3_savz63	t1_htx2o2v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu1vt1a/

2m8yl53s	That's a fair point - I was being a bit facetious, which sometimes doesn't come across very well here. What I mean is sometimes there are statements about miraculous or supernatural events in the historical record, and as historians we can confirm that that's what the record said, but there's no way for us to confirm that the event literally happened or not.  In this case it comes from a Russian source attributed to an author named "Nestor-Iskander":  >"On the twenty-first day of May there was, for our sins, a frightful sign in the city. As a consequence, on the eve of Friday, the entire city was illuminated. The sentinels, who saw the light, ran to see what had happened, for they were under the impression that the Turks were burning the city. They cried with a great voice. Many people gathered and saw on the Church of the Wisdom \[=Hagia Sophia\], at the top of the window, a large flame of fire issuing forth. It encircled the entire neck of the church for a long time. The flame gathered in tone; its flame altered, and there was an indescribable light. At once it took to the sky. Those who had seen it were benumbed. They began to wail and cried out in Greek: "Lord have mercy!" The light itself has gone up to heaven; the gates of heaven were opened; the light was received; and again they were closed." (translated in Philippides and Hanak, pg. 222)  This event is part of other apocalyptic signs recorded by the Russian author - for him this was clearly the end times, the end of the empire if not the entire world. It was almost the year 7000 on the Byzantine calendar and that had apocalyptic significance as well.  "Nestor-Iskander" used to be considered an Ottoman source since whoever wrote it seems to have been in the Ottoman camp (and that's where the name Iskander comes from, a Turkish or Arabic form of Alexander), but the author knows a lot about what was happening inside Constantinople as well, so maybe they defected during the siege? In any case the author's Russian literary style and knowledge of Christian apocalyptic literature probably means they were a monk or a priest, and "Nestor-Iskander" might be a pseudonym or invented character.  Other sources mention unusual weather or darkness. A Greek source, Michael Kritovoulos, says there was an unexpected hailstorm, and  >"...at daybreak a deep cloud covered the entire city from very early in the morning until evening. This sign declared everywhere that the deity had departed from the city. She was left totally by herself as the deity irrevocably turned away from her. When the deity comes or goes away, it does so within a cloud. And so it happened. Let none doubt it. There are so many witnesses, both residents and foreigners." (translated in Philippides and Hanak, pg. 224)  This all happened after an icon of the Virgin Mary was accidentally dropped while it was being carried around the walls of the city. That was definitely a bad omen in the eyes of the Greeks.  There are other Greek, Italian, and Turkish sources but only the Russian account mentions the light on the dome specifically. So is it a good source? It was written by someone inside Constantinople and who also had knowledge of the Ottoman camp. It wasn't published immediately, but we don't really have sources like a daily newspaper from the 15th century, so this is pretty reliable for the time. Is Kritovoulous a good source? He wasn't actually in the city at the time but he interviewed people who were. He was actually working for the Ottomans, writing a biography of Sultan Mehmed in the years after the conquest, so he had access to Ottoman eyewitnesses too.  The question still remains, did the light really appear on Hagia Sophia? Was there really bad weather and other bad omens? Can they be explained objectively? As I mentioned in the other answer there are some suggestions for what the light could have been, if it really happened:  “This fire may well have been what is today identified as St. Elmo's fire, caused by unusual atmospheric conditions, perhaps an accumulation of debris particles, smoke from the cannons, and weather phenomena, and giving off discharges of atmospheric electricity.” (Philippides and Hanak, p. 223, note 93)  But whether the light was really there or not, maybe the more important thing is to remember that Kritovoulos and "Nestor-Iskander" were writing in the context of something that was disastrous for Orthodox Christians, and something they could only describe in apocalyptic, prophetic terms.  My main source for this is:  Marios Philippides and Walter K. Hanak, *The Siege and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453: Historiography, Topography, and Military Studies* (Ashgate, 2011)	1643050243.0	hu1xfna	t3_sayrbi	t1_hu0zemf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sayrbi/just_before_the_fall_of_constantinople_in_1453/hu1xfna/
8brve	It's worth noting that it was a subset of the militarists in Japan who felt this way — not all of them. Some of them were more "rational" in their desire to hold out: they believed that the US population and politicians would tire of the bloodletting, and that this would drive the US to the negotiating table (for something other than "unconditional surrender," which they felt they could not accept). The "rational" view is still pretty awful, but at least it is fairly easy to understand.  Those who believed in a more "irrational" approach — e.g., holding out with the desperate hope of reversal (however improbable), or basically going down with the ship — did so because of a mixture of what we might call cultural factors. I would describe these less as "religious fanaticism regarding the sanctity of the imperial family" (and probably not "personal pride"), and more of a deep sense of military and civic honor. They believed that to accept surrender would be doing a deep disservice to the honor of Japan, and sure, that is tied up with all sorts of complicated ideas about it means to be "Japanese" and "Japan," which are wrapped up in questions about the Imperial House, divinity, and all of that. But it's ultimately a less alien and more relatable concept of national honor that seems to have been at stake.  And when I say, "less alien and more relatable," I don't mean "to every person" (certainly not to me!). What I mean is, we can see this kind of "meme" in the heads of many people across history, and even today. How many movies valorize the person who goes into a suicidal situation, rather than be subjugated to some foreign evil-doer? How many times have we seen scenes where the brave soldier stays behind with the grenade in order to take a few of the enemy out with him? How many times in Western culture do people kill over ideas about honor, whether it be about disrespect of their person, their family, their loved ones, what have you? These are not uncommon ideas, however un-relatable they may be to me or you personally.   What is uncommon, rather is, that these became national policy in Japan, and that is because a group of honor-fanatics essentially took over Japan in the 1930s. They were, again, not representative of all Japanese high-command thought. But they were in positions of great influence, and nearly led Japan over a cliff. Such things do occasionally happen, but they seem to have happened to much greater effect in the 20th-century than previously (I am fond of Eric Hobsbawm's term for the "short 20th century" spanning World War I through the Cold War: "The Age of Extremes").   I would just add that I think it is important to be cautious about the claims of suicidal Japanese. Yes, some were, including the civilians who believed — wrongly — that if they did not kill themselves while defending their homeland, there would be even worse fates in store. (Again, how many Western movies valorize civilians who fight against invaders and oppressors, to the point of death? It is not an alien idea at all.) Many did not but had no opportunity to voice disagreement; the military junta that ran Japan had, for over a decade at that point, worked to suppress dissidence and disagreements of any sort.  The reason I point all of this out, and work to make it a little more "relatable," is because the alleged savageness of the Japanese was used then and now as a justification for the whole-scale targeting of Japanese civilians. And I think we should be wary of this, and resist adopting that terminology (and justification) ourselves.	1643050341.0	hu1xpes	t3_sb1ijs	t3_sb1ijs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb1ijs/ww2_why_were_the_japanese_generals_so_stubbornly/hu1xpes/

10r6sn	On your initial, more etymological question, he was either using "Tweens" as a shortened term for "tweenage" a word that is a combination of "between" and "teenage" typically used to refer to the early teens (websters dictionary says between 8-12, others say 10-15). It's never been a particularly "popular" word but it is in dictionaries. There are conflicting accounts though on when the word was coined, with some saying in the 40's, some saying the 80's, and still others saying that Tolkien himself was the first to use it in the 50's. The other option is that he was referring to his "Between years" ie: between childhood and adulthood.   On the question of when the modern idea of a "teenager" came to be, I would point you to the book "Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture 1874–1945" by Jon Savage. In it, he proposes that the modern idea of a teenager was created in the mid 40's in the United States as a marketing term for companies trying to target products towards that age group. Tolkien wrote "The Lord of the Rings" throughout the late 30's and into the late 40's, so it is certainly possible, though unconfirmed, if he was aware of the term and the growing modern idea of a "teenager"	1643051272.0	hu2074t	t3_sbmmxn	t3_sbmmxn	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmmxn/was_tolkien_referencing_teens_with_tweens/hu2074t/

zrtbk	The Jacobites were named after James VII of Scotland & II of England, whose first name in Latin is *Jacobus*.

10rsx7	**Who was the first known person to posit that torture is an ineffective means of interrogation?**       It doesn't take much to see that torture is cruel and inhumane, as that's kind of part of the whole point. But it's been proven by today to also be highly ineffective, being more likely to yield an insane subject or the answers you want to hear rather than any truth. Now, there are people who still don't understand this today, and I know in the ancient and medieval eras torture was considered fairly standard and reliable, even necessary a procedure in cases. However, even if the science disproving its effectiveness is relatively recent in the grand scale, I'm sure there must have been earlier philosophers or thinkers who would have realised that torture can't really be that reliable.

d9khg	The meeting between King Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud and President Roosevelt on board the *USS Quincy* was memorialized in an official memorandum which both the King and the President signed off on. The State Department has a copy of it [here](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945v08/d2). At the very least, this document demonstrates what the participants were contemporaneously comfortable stating what occurred at the meeting.  There is no mention of Bavaria. Instead, we have this exchange:  >The President asked His Majesty for his advice regarding the problem of Jewish refugees driven from their homes in Europe. His Majesty replied that in his opinion the Jews should return to live in the lands from which they were driven. The Jews whose homes were completely destroyed and who have no chance of livelihood in their homelands should be given living space in the Axis countries which oppressed them. The President remarked that Poland might be considered a case in point. The Germans appear to have killed three million Polish Jews, by which count there should be space in Poland for the resettlement of many homeless Jews.  So where does Riedel's mention of Bavaria originate from? In Riedel's book *Kings and Presidents*, he describes the meeting at more length than in his article. Riedel quotes the King as stating: "It is the Christian Germans who stole their homes and lives. Let the Germans pay. ... Give them [the Jewish survivors] and their descendants the choicest lands and homes of the Germans who oppressed them."  Given that Riedel does not mention the King suggesting that a Jewish homeland be set up in Bavaria in his more comprehensive account of the meeting, the use of "Bavaria" appears to be synecdoche for choice land in Germany and the Axis countries.	1643053487.0	hu261xb	t3_sboeq2	t3_sboeq2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sboeq2/in_a_meeting_with_fdr_ibn_saud_reportedly/hu261xb/

35tw5l1o	The notion that the Germans were "destroying" the Soviets before the battle of Stalingrad is simply not true. Although the sixth Army did inflict more casualties on the Soviets than vice-versa, it itself was also severely weakened by the continuous fighting since the start of the German summer offensive. By the time they reached the city and even moreso when Uranus kicked off, it was nothing more than a ragtag force with shortages of everything, including reinforcements. I should note here that there was action along the entire front, not just in the southern sector which is why Paulus didn't receive more support. The German army was engaged with the enemy from Leningrad in the north to Rzhev in the centre down to the oil fields of Georgia and Azerbaijan while Rommel in North Africa faced of with British and commonwealth forces. The territory Germany controlled/fought in was growing too large for them to handle and increased partisan activity didn't help either. Another aspect that arguably contributed to the precarious supply situation  was the split of Army Group South in AG A advancing into the caucasus and AG B advancing onto Stalingrad.  Overconfidence defintely did play a role in the minds of the upper echelons of the German command because they a) thought of slavs as subhumans and b) the Red Army had been defeated so badly in 1941 and thus nobody expected them to basically rebuild the entire army that quickly. This lead them to believe that the Soviets could not possibly mount any more counterattacks in late 1942. However, front commanders were obviously much better at assessing the circumstances than some guys sitting 2000 km away in Berlin. Paulus' staff actually registered a build up of Soviet forces, but high command did not believe them or rather did not considerit a real threat. Anyhow, the sixth army was lacking the resources at that time to adequately prepare and maintain an effective defense against the Soviet armies.  Overconfidence on the part of the OKH certainly didn't improve sixth army's sitution, but it is greatly disputed whether an immediate breakout or a breakout in December when Manstein tried to relieve it would have been successful at all. Some even go so far as to argue that the Stalingrad pocket having been held for so long tied down many Soviet troops which would have otherwise inflicted a devastating defeat on the retreating AG A which might have snowballed into an even bigger defeat. Funnily enough, the regime tried to justify the whole thing in this exact way.	1643054448.0	hu28ko9	t3_sb9qhd	t3_sb9qhd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb9qhd/was_nazi_germanys_overconfidence_the_main_reason/hu28ko9/

zrtbk	Further to r/Neptunianbayofpigs's examples, it is notoriously difficult to accurately trace the lives and experiences of former (Scottish) Jacobites in the New World once they left the shores of Britain. Whether that movement across the Atlantic was voluntary or served as punishment via indenture in the wake of the Forty-five, the paper trails of these emigrants is a real challenge for historians to put together. As a result, there has not yet been any study of significant value done on accurately tracing Jacobite sentiment in the decades after the last rising, mostly because it was pretty clear after 1746 that the Stuarts were not going to be able to reclaim the British thrones. Following the lines of genealogy does not necessarily reflect political position in new contexts, so it is important to consider how concepts of loyalty and ideological or sentimental attachment evolved as an individual's fortunes also did – and how much of it was reported or otherwise preserved in writing.  Other than the examples of famous personalities like the ones that Nep offered, you might also like to take a look at [Simon Fraser, Master of Lovat](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Fraser,_Simon_(1726-1782)), a former marginal Jacobite who lost his father to execution in 1747 and later rose to the rank of major-general in the British army and fought in the American Revolution. On the other side was [Hugh Mercer](https://archive.org/details/pottersamericanm03lossuoft/page/482/mode/2up?view=theater), a prominent Jacobite who joined the British army in the Seven Years' War but who went on to fight against it once again during the Revolution.  Beyond these, the following sources might offer some interest:  • Calum Cunningham, ['Rebels Without a Cause': The External Jacobite Diasporas, 1688-1788](https://www.stir.ac.uk/research/hub/publication/1696275)  • Duane Meyer, *The Highland Scots of North Carolina 1732-1776* (UNC Press, 1961)  • A. Roger Ekirch, *Bound For America: The Transportation of British Convicts to the Colonies, 1718-1775* (Clarendon Press, 1987)  • David Parrish, *Jacobitism and Anti-Jacobitism in the British Atlantic World, 1688-1727* (Boydell & Brewer, 2017)  A similar question was [brought up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2orkb5/jacobites_and_influence_on_the_american_revolution/) some years ago, too, and might be worth a look.

ddzw2	I think that it is fairer to say that traders in the East (which I interpret as meaning East Asia) probably didn’t think of England at all.      While obviously impossible to prove this negative, we can get an impression of the kinds of information that was circulating from the writings of a Chinese inspector of foreign trade named Chua Ju-kua \[Zhao Rukuo\] (1170-1228), who worked in Fukien during the Sung Dynasty and collected information about foreign countries and their trade products in a book entitled Chu-fan-chi \[Records of Foreign Nations\].  Chua was a civil servant rather than a traveling merchant, so his book necessarily recorded the information he gleaned from foreign traders in the port city of Fukien.  Compiling these second-hand reports, Chua assembled extensive descriptions of Southeast Asian counties which were regular destinations for Chinese traders.  His description of central Java – then the center of the Majapahit Empire – details Javanese clothing, rituals, and local medicines in addition to an extensive list of available trade products.      While his entries describing the locations closest to him were quite detailed, his knowledge of more distant countries was fragmentary as accounts of these distant lands were gathered from second-hand stories and travelers’ tales.  Drawing on the testimony of Arab traders, he included a brief entry on Ssi-kia-li-ye \[Sicily\] describing Mt. Etna,  as well a lengthy description of southern, Arab-controlled Spain.  As he described it, Spain was a fantastic world:       "The products of this country are extraordinary; the grains of wheat are three inches long, the melons six feet round, enough for a meal for twenty or thirty men.  The pomegranates weigh five catties \[1 catty = approx. 500g\], the peaches two catties, citrons over twenty catties, salads weigh over ten catties and have leaves three or four feet long.  Rice and wheat are kept in silos for tens of years without spoiling.  Among the native products are foreign sheep, which are several feet high and have tails as big as a fan.  In spring-time they slit open their bellies and take out some tens of catties of fat, after which they sew them up again, and the sheep live on; if the fat were not removed, (the animal) would swell up and die."        This entry contains obvious exaggerations about the scale of European produce interspersed with specific facts such as the use of silos to store grains.  Significantly, certain mundane practices were entirely misunderstood and wildly distorted as Chua attempted to make sense of what he was being told.  For example, the description of the springtime extraction of fat from sheep is most easily understood as his misinterpretation of an image of the spring shearing.  One can imagine how the scene of a medieval Spanish shepherd holding shears and removing a white mass of wool from the sheep’s belly could lead to the curious description that he provides.        This was the extent of his descriptions of Europe, however and was limited to the ports that Arab traders went to on the Mediterranean coast.  England was very far removed from traders and trade routes along the Silk Road as a later inscription explains.        Two centuries later, in the 1490s, when the prospect of long distance trade was being revived, Martin Behaim made an illustrated globe that most complete information that he could find as he constructed his globe.  The details of geography were apparently gleaned from secret Portuguese navigational reports, while the descriptions of the flora and fauna include quotes and citations from the Marco Polo’s Travels.  Next to the Indonesian spice islands, Behaim included a long inscription that gives an idea of what the trade route from Asia to England was like.  It reads:       Item, be it known that spices pass through several hands in the islands of Oriental India before they reach our country.    First, the inhabitants of an island called Java Major buy them in the other islands where they are collected by their neighbors, and sell them in their own island.    Secondly, those from the island Seilan \[Ceylon/Sri Lanka\], where St. Thomas is buried, buy the spices in Java and bring them to their own island.    Thirdly, in the island of Ceylon or Seilan they are once more unloaded, charged with customs duty, and sold to the merchants of the island Aurea Chersonesus \[the Golden Peninsula, perhaps Malaysia, first mentioned by Herodotus\], where they are again unladen.    Fourthly, merchants of the island Taprobana buy the spices there, and pay customs duties, and take them to their island.    Fifthly, the Mohammedan heathen of Aden go there, buy the spices, pay customs, and take them to their own country.    Sixthly, those of Cairo buy them, and carry them over the sea, and further overland.    Seventhly, those of Venice and others buy them.    Eighthly, they are again sold in Venice to the Germans, and customs are paid.    Ninthly, at Frankfort, Bruges, and other places.    Tenthly, in England and France.        If East Asians were getting their information second hand from traders and travelers who were involved in the Silk Road, this inscription suggests that there were four layers of intermediaries between Cairo and England alone, making it unlikely that much information filtered back about England.      Does this mean that no one new anything about England in East Asia – no.  In his travels to the Mongol court, William of Rubruck, a european pilgrim who traveled to the Mongol court, described the range of people who attended an Easter dinner in Karakorum.  Curiously, the list included “Basil, an Englishman” so at least some English were living in Asia in the 13th century who could have described their country to the locals.

96gqp	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643057355.0	hu2g5mx	t3_sbw35y	t3_sbw35y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbw35y/reasons_for_the_irish_easter_rising/hu2g5mx/

4le7p4jb	The idea that "Byzantine" identity was a creation of Hieronymous Wolf is a long-standing historiographic tradition, but it's one that has only recently begun to be challenged. The best and most recent article on the subject is this one, by Anthony Kaldellis: ["From “Empire of the Greeks” to “Byzantium”: The Politics of a Modern Paradigm Shift’"](https://www.academia.edu/67605105/_From_Empire_of_the_Greeks_to_Byzantium_The_Politics_of_a_Modern_Paradigm_Shift_in_N_Aschenbrenner_and_J_Ransohoff_eds_The_Invention_of_Byzantium_in_Early_Modern_Europe_Washington_D_C_Dumbarton_Oaks_2021_349_367) \[academia.edu link\].  In the article, Kaldellis raises an important point that speaks to your example of Constantine Lascaris: namely, that we have to distinguish between the word "Byzantine" meaning "relating to the Byzantine Empire" (in other words, a near-synonym of *romaios*) and "Byzantine" meaning "relating to the city of Byzantium" (in other words, a near-synonym of "Constantinopolitan"). The latter was generally more common among Greek writers, and as Lascaris was a Constantinopolitan himself, we cannot assume he was using the term in its wider sense. It is this wider sense, specifically, that Wolf is credited with pioneering: the word *byzantaios* is present in Greek texts much older than Lascaris. A conservative approach to the question must therefore seek examples of usage that could not possibly apply to the narrower concept of Byzantium-as-city.  Beyond a few exceptional late-antique writers who titled their histories of the empire as "Byzantine," Kaldellis argues that the continuous tradition of "Byzantine" identity begins with the mid-fifteenth-century scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles, writing shortly after the fall of Constantinople. Part of Chalkokondyles's intellectual project was the rehabilitation of Hellenism as an aspect of Greek identity.\* He thus recast the Byzantine Empire as a Hellenic, rather than Roman, state: the Byzantines become "Greeks," their emperor the "king of the Greeks," and their empire the "Kingdom of Byzantion." The Byzantine element was, if anything, magnified in Conrad Clauser's influential 1556 Latin translation, where a *rex Byzantinus/Byzantii* ruled over the *regnum Byzantii*; Wolf's *Corpus historiae Byzantinae* was published a year later.  Chalkokondyles's Hellenic Byzantinism played into Western biases, which had long been inclined to discredit any notion of the empire's Roman-ness. Early modern scholars thus tended to use the adjective "Byzantine" purely to denote medieval Hellenism, rather than what was in reality a complex multinational society. (This in turn, perhaps, influenced Paparrigopoulos and other nineteenth-century Greek proponents of Hellenic-Byzantine continuity.) As a noun, however, the "Byzantine Empire" is much less common than you might expect in the centuries following Chalkokondyles and Clauser; most texts referred to the state as the "Empire of the Greeks" or some variation on that phrase.  Kaldellis argues that the expressions "Byzantium" and "Byzantine Empire" really only become common in the nineteenth century, when Greek irredentism and Russian expansionism threatened an Eastern Orthodox conquest of Constantinople. If Hellenic Byzantinism was useful to earlier Western Europeans as a way to preserve Roman-ness for the West, it now became something of a political liability. Political slavophobes like the Bavarian historian J. P. Fallmerayer thus argued for a *dis*continuity between the ancient Greeks and the medieval Byzantines—both racially and socially. For Fallmerayer, modern Greeks were an essentially Slavic people who had absorbed the remnants of actual Hellenic society in the early middle ages; thus, Byzantium could be neither Greek nor Roman, but a construct with its own unique identity. As Western slavophobia intensified around the Crimean War (in which Greece supported the Russians), even more moderate historians began adopting the name "Byzantium" as opposed to the older "Empire of the Greeks." By the early twentieth century, the latter had fallen completely out of favor.  "When the term was introduced," therefore, depends on your frame of reference. In terms of sheer priority, one might point to one of the Late Antique historians I mentioned above; in terms of continuity of use, Chalkokondyles beats out Wolf; and in terms of continuity of *meaning*, both Chalkokondyles *and* Wolf probably wouldn't make the cut (and we should instead credit Fallmerayer or one of his contemporaries with the term). But in any case, Hieronymous Wolf certainly wasn't the man responsible.  \* Though, as I have addressed elsewhere, Byzantine Greeks did not entirely repudiate their Hellenic ancestors \[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jb5092/did_greekspeaking_citizens_of_the_byzantine/g8u72j1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fglubf/was_the_byzantine_empire_roman_or_greek/fk8bun1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qos2kq/importance_of_ancient_greek_mythology_and_culture/hjr088f/?context=3)\].	1643057382.0	hu2g89l	t3_sbec1f	t3_sbec1f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbec1f/when_the_term_byzantine_empire_was_introduced/hu2g89l/

It looks like they're little removable daggers like 6 inches long, and only on the last 2 fingers.  In the Katherine Karl picture, they're only on the left hand for some reason, but the other pictures have them on both.	1643058840.0	hu2k3pa	t3_sbjd7t	t1_hu176m3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbjd7t/why_are_there_no_photographs_of_19th_century/hu2k3pa/
96gqp	I've been talking with some other folks on the mod-team about this, and we're planning a Monday Methods post coming up soon about changes in history education in K12 schools -- it might be a good place for a follow up like this one. The thing that is really slippery about this as a "historiography" question is that it's really not one -- it's not asking how the understanding of the Trail of Tears changed over time, it's more asking about what was a pretty bad writing prompt.	1643058919.0	hu2kbgz	t3_sbuyi6	t1_hu2hvyi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbuyi6/what_was_understood_about_jacksons_enforcement_of/hu2kbgz/
7xgnjo	If you mean Henry VIII as you did when asking in the main sub the answer is "Tudor era" which encompasses his father's Henry VII, his son Edward VI's and his daughters' Mary and Elisabeth reigns too. Usually the reign of Elizabeth I is the most interesting/talked about part and is thus specifically referred to as Elizabethan (since there will be no confusion as to which period you mean).  You couldn't talk about Henrician (or something like that) era because there are 9 kings named Henry (yes I count Henry the Young King) with centuries to separate them so we wouldn't known if you mean early medieaval or the Renaissance ones. And this kinda gets at the problem with naming eras.  The Georgian era e.g. did cover 4 George's (and a short William IV reign), which is why it's so called, but it also interestingly includes the Regency era which is a particular period usually picked out due to it's special circumstances, this occurs in the middle of the Georgian period. More importantly these were 4 George's all following each other in turn and they were the first ones so named and represented a distinct period of the rule of the Hanoverian house (to which Victoria belongs, but she gets her own period).  It is all really a matter of convention to make it easier to roughly place something because periods often have general trends in fashion, architectural style, paintings and often society changes in various ways. It is *not specifically* customary to name the eras solely after every ruler as you seem to imply in your question, for the simple reason that names are often reused. Edwardian refers to the rule of Edward VII in most cases, because Edward VII loomed large in the era. Not in the least because his rule is bookended by his mother  Queen Victoria at one end, the epitome of the old order, and by World War 1 at the other end basically the start of the modern era in many ways.   Basically not all kings and queens get an era named for them, and ultimately it's somewhat arbitrary which naming is picked. It has a lot to do with how people subsequently view the supposed eras. You will find early periods that are less well covered aren't as rigorously subdivided as later ones. Much of it has to do with how distinct a period is from the previous one, artistically, socially, politically and so on, or all of them together.	1643059132.0	hu2kvwa	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htxpvdi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2kvwa/
7ltu0qrk	The reason my wording might be a bit confusing is because I was trying to avoid asking what the oldest piece of writing that references a name is. It seems like this is an important distinction because of the Palermo Stone, which was created in the 25th century B.C.E., but contains the names of rulers from pre-dynastic Egypt. According to the Wikipedia article I linked in my original post, there are a few rulers that seemed to have reigned even before the 3200 B.C.E. The article implies that […]pu is the oldest of these, and also appears to be older than Iry-Hor by a significant margin. Even though we will never know his full name, would he be the most likely candidate for the answer to my question.  Also, since I’m sourcing all of this from Wikipedia and the inscriptions on the Palermo Stone, feel free to correct the validity in any of my claims.	1643059141.0	hu2kwrv	t3_s7qqa4	t1_hu06xiu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2kwrv/
pmgxogo	Sure you can PM me, or you can ask questions here on AH. Others may have more familiarity with clothing in particular.   As for labneh, it's harder to say anything about about styles of yogurt (or many other types of food). There's an Akkadian word for the liquid that separates from yogurt, so it stands to reason that people were interacting with strained yogurt in some way, even if only to mix it back together. Whether they were straining and thickening it to the same degree as some modern yogurt dishes is less clear.  Only a few ancient recipes have survived, and they're all relatively complex. Daily staples probably weren't written down.  See source above.	1643059296.0	hu2lbj2	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htn8smv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2lbj2/

13ch64	I just want to add to this, since the interwar period hasn’t been covered well here. This hatred definitely starts up prior to WW2 and can be seen shortly after the 1918 foundation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. In a nutshell, many ethnic/religious groups were for the creation of a united Slavic country, but when the Serbian Karađorđević family was installed as the ruling power, non-Serbian Slavs feared their interests/power/rights wouldn’t be protected- they were right. Serbs essentially had a monopoly on power in the Yugoslav government, and over the next two decades restricted the financial, political, religious, and social rights of non-Serbs.  Here's where claims of interwar genocide come in and get sketchy, and the only thing that I think Malaquisto missed- The Serbian-led government didn’t publicly enact pogroms or formal military campaigns against non-Serbs. Instead, individual politicians and political parties financed private paramilitary groups to roam Yugoslavia, harass non-Serbs, disrupt elections, and impose Serbian hegemony. In my research I’ve found 22 Serbian funded paramilitary groups that operated between 1918-1941. This was not genocide, but it was organized oppression and violence (primarily, but not exclusively) towards Bosniak and Croat peasants. During this time there were also formal political executions and informal ones as well (Croat politician Stjepan Radić was murdered during a parliamentary session by Serbian politician Puniša Račić, who was punished by being put under house arrest in a lavish villa). This interwar violence is well-documented by historians like Sabrina Ramet & Mark Biondich, and can be seen in Vladko Maček & Dragiša Ristić’s memoirs/papers).  Now it should be acknowledged that Croatian resistance groups did exist and did fight back against the government, but they were relatively minor/ineffective. The most extreme/violent group, Ustaše, operated out of Italy, and were generally unsupported by the Croatian population until the German takeover of Yugoslavia (in 1937 they had less than 500 members). What I think did factor into the growing rift between Serbians and Croatians was the Croatian Peasant Party’s mobilization/modernization of the Croat peasantry. In the late 1930s Croat politician Vladko Maček organized an effort that taught literacy to 200,000+ peasants and encouraged them to participate in politics. Many Serbians saw this as a growing threat to Serbian dominance and preached to their followers that Croatians intended to take over Yugoslavia and oppress the Serbs (this did happen but it was a weird, unpredictable sequence of events that put it in place).  Maček was actually able to negotiate with moderate Serbs in power and establish an autonomous Croatian state within Yugoslavia… then the Nazis showed up. They asked Maček to lead a Nazi-backed government, but he declined (and was imprisoned), so the Naziz went to Pavelic/ Ustaše who massacred a horrifying number of Serbs and Jews. Had Maček agreed, this could have been avoided but Maček acknowledged that Yugoslav politicians knew that Jews were disappearing under the Nazis and he wanted no part of it.  So the interwar period was absolutely a time of strife and violence imposed by Serbian loyalists and agitated by Croatian extremists, which set the stage for Ustaše’s brutal oppression of the Serbs. Side note: a handful of Serbian-backed paramilitary groups associated with war crimes/genocide that operated in the 1990s used the names and even the logos of the Serbian paramilitary groups from the interwar period. The interwar period was often referenced by all parties in the 90s as being a source of their respective victim identities, and quite honestly there was violence by all sides in that period, although the Serbs were the biggest culprits in that era. But to echo Malaquisto again, the interwar era was not a period of genocide.  Again, Biondich and Ramet have done a lot of great work digging into the rampant violence in the interwar era and are worth looking into.	1643061402.0	hu2qx72	t3_rq9iqu	t3_rq9iqu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rq9iqu/what_is_the_history_of_the_ethnic_hatreds_in_the/hu2qx72/

e49gp06y	He was a very genuine Antisemite. He started getting into contact with that... "idea" first in his time in Vienna which is fairly well documented and even mentioned in Mein Kampf. He didn't show any specifically antisemitic tendencies before that. He even worked with a lot of Jews who sold some copied paintings he made for a living for a while. More then that however he saved the Doctor of his Aunt Eduard Bloch who was also jewish when he wrote to Hitler and asked him for protection from the Gestapo, leaving him an his family able to sell everything they had at normal market value and flee the country. Many of his own views for example are very similar to those of, for example, Guido von List which is evident in the both of them often writing about the "fate" of the Germans and subsequently the Arians as a race. There is a big list of other antisemitic or racist literature that he could've read and used as a base to form his own belief of it because most of the ideas the Nazis stood for had already been around for a good while at this point. Especially considering that the general Eugenicism was highly revered. Even to a point where, in the USA for example, it became taught in many schools. On that I specifically suggest "Hitler's Vienna" by Brigitte Hamann.  His radicalization just simply came from the contacts he made and held As RudolfTheRendeer already said Europe at that time (not just Western Europe) was ripe with the worst kind of antisemitism. Hitler just had the "misfortune" to meet the extremely wrong people. That only continued when he got to Munich and then after the war when he was still in the Army (Reichswehr) where he was actively pushed more towards forming his views through, for example, taking place in Seminars to which the Reichswehr send him about "Bolshevik Propaganda" and, as you can probably guess, most about these were very much so about the Bolsheviks being Jews. It wasn't long after the war that he joined the NSDAP (back the just DAP) and started to hold speeches so to answer your question in summary:   Hitlers Antisemitism was certainly formed in his time in Vienna but was only cemented by his time in the military and in Munich especially with the loss of Germany in the war and his beliefe in the Dolchstoßlegende.	1643062290.0	hu2t8h2	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0qcsj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu2t8h2/
2gu4x0fh	Ottoman Empire definitely did have book shops.  It is pretty hard to find shop records about the early empire. However we do have other evidence. Molla Fenari, a cleric from Sultan Bayezid I’s reign is recorded to extend weekend from 2 to 3 days. This extra day was granted so the students could work and pay the “outrageous bookseller prices”.  The earliest records about specific booksellers in Ottoman Empire are from 1520.  Out of 140 shops in the Grand Bazaar, 4 of the shops  belonged to book merchants (called “sahaf”). There are also records of book merchants in Fatih district and other major marketplaces.  European diplomat’s one of the important missions in Constantinople was to shop for valuable books. In a letter to Venice, Venetian diplomat Piedro dela Valle writes that he has been looking for Arabic grammar books in Bezistan market in Constantinople in 1615.  Likewise a Dutch merchant in Izmir Michiel de Mortier wrote to the Dutch Levant trade director to complain about the diplomats in Constantinople. He complained that the diplomats spent thousands of golden liras in book merchants which could have been used to solve trade matters.   Overall it is clear that Ottomans had book shops in the classical period. We can also presume that there were places selling books and book supplies to students in early 1400s and 1300s, even though there are no surviving reports.   About the author and statement you mentioned, I have not heard of a book ban in Ottoman Empire. It also does not sound plausible for an Empire that needs schools and libraries to ban books. However Bayezid II banned the printing press, as a result of lobbying from scribes who did not want to lose their profitable jobs to a machine. This ban was only lifted in 1700s during the reign of Ahmed III.

cgxrfdt	Let me ask this in response to you and Reendeer.  Where was all the antisemitism in Europe coming from? I had no idea it was already such a ripe mindset in general.   I know the Jewish people through history have always been targeted or however you want to say it, but why was there such a ramp up in Europe and especially Western Europe in that time?  Sadly my history is Terribad but I find this stuff interesting.	1643062688.0	hu2u9j2	t3_sbczey	t1_hu2t8h2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu2u9j2/

e49gp06y	Oh, yeah. There was the "Verband nationaldeutscher Juden" or "Association of German National Jews" for example founded by Max Naumann. They strongly supported the DNVP which was in a coalition in the NSDAP and subsequently proclaimed their loyalty to the Nazis after 1933. They were prohibited and dissolved in 1935.   They for example wrote in their own paper "The german national Jew"   "The Association of National German Jews aims to bring together all those Germans of Jewish origin who, while openly professing their descent, feel that they are so inseparably attached to German nature and culture that they cannot feel and think in any other way than German. It combats all expressions and activities of an un-German spirit, whether they come from Jews or non-Jews, which impair the resurgence of German national power, German legality and German self-esteem and thus endanger Germany's rise to a respected position in the world."  And on the election of the NSDAP they wrote:   "We have always held the well-being of the German people and the fatherland, to which we feel inextricably linked, above our own well-being. Thus we greeted the results of January 1933, even though it has brought hardship for us personally."  There is a source in "Die Etablierung der Außenseiter: Der Verband der Nationaldeutschen Juden 1921-1935" by Matthias Hambrock about them specifically but I don't know if there's an english translation of that is available.

hhelidpe	Was Malcom X murdered by the US government? - it was claimed somewhere in a sub, I'm ignorant on the issue but most regular sources list other members of Nation of Islam and I saw that recently, after old documents were released, it was decided that 2 of the people imprisoned shouldn't have been. But did the US take any more of an active role in his murder?	1643063317.0	hu2vvxq	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2vvxq/

e49gp06y	I'm fairly certain that somebody asked about the origin of Antisemitism in this sub a while ago. The Answers there were very detailed and well written so you should definitely look for that and if you can't find it just ask again yourself because it is something absolutely worth diving into.  The simply answer is what you already said: It was already there. Antijudaism was deeply entrenched in a variety of societies and historical chapters in Europe as early as medieval and feudal societies at their very beginning. Antisemitism was simply the "Evolution" of Antijudaism with the aspect of Racism which heavily developed during the Atlantic Slavetrade.    And in the 19th century the biggest part in forming Antisemitism towards what it is today was played by the huge popularity of Eugenicism. It cannot possibly be stressed enough how influential and important Eugenicism became. Not just in Europe but also in the USA. The theories about "race" which the Nazis held can all be traced back to that thing and, naturally, it didn't take long until the Jews were put into this model of "Race" as well which very much so marks the transition from Antijudaism to Antisemitism as the former was mostly a discrimination based on Religion whereas the latter became a discrimination based on the construct of race.    A very big starting point of this new, European Antisemitism is often considered to be the anti-Jewish Pogroms in Russia. They were already ongoing in the 19th century especially at its end but found a very bloody and tragic peak in the beginning of the 20th century. Now this is where a certain book comes in and you might have already heard of it. But "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" was pretty important to all of these events. It's, very simply put, not sure who wrote it or what the original intend was. There is Spekulation that it was published by the Russian Government itself in oder to combat the rising influence of Socialists in Russia, accusing them all of being Jews and in that trying to get the masses to turn against them using the already ongoing antisemitism and pogroms for that matter. But, again, it's simply never been proven. It does however make sense considering that one of the biggest narratives in antisemitic rhetoric always has been that Socialists were all Jews. And then much later of course that very argument used against the Bolsheviks of being Jews who wanted to conrol the world.    Whoever wrote that "work" didn't really matter though because it became one of the most influential books of it's time and I'd even say in the entire 20th century of how it further coined and fueled Antisemitic rhetoric and prejudices.   If you want to know more about the History of Antisemitism I would always suggest the Frankfurt school and critical Theory. Especially Adorno and, for example, the "Elements of Anti-Semitism" by Adorno and Horkheimer. Adorno is THE institution when trying to understand the roots and works of Antisemitism.	1643064455.0	hu2ysbm	t3_sbczey	t1_hu2u9j2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu2ysbm/

um4xp	So this is a question that is very broad and so I am forced to give a relatively broad answer; what follows is mostly based on evidence from the Classical period, but it’s general enough to apply broadly to the entire ancient Greek period from let’s say the middle of the sixth century BC onwards. As far as our knowledge about festivals are concerned, the surviving evidence ensures that we are much better informed about Athenian festivals than those organized elsewhere, with the exception of the great Panhellenic festivals (i.e. the Panhellenic Games organized in Olympia, Delphi, Isthmia, and Nemea), which I assume you will know at least something about.   All festivals were organized to celebrate one or more deities, and for some deities (like Zeus) they did organize multiple festivals in their honour within the same year. Festivals could be big or small, organized on a Panhellenic level, on the level of a city-state or part of it, or even confined to a small village. Important festivals, like the Panhellenic Games, could attract visitors (pilgrims) from all over the Greek world, others were more regional affairs or limited just to the local populace. Some festivals were very specific to a certain place, like the Panathenaic celebrations in Athens (in honour of Athena, the city’s patron deity), whereas other festivals were celebrated in different places in the Greek world, like the Thesmophoria (in honour of Demeter).   Festivals were celebrated in different ways, but they usually included some form of a procession to a sanctuary (where a cult image of the celebrated deity or deities were kept), as well as various performances (singing hymns, dancing, engaging in athletic competitions, music and drama contests, and so on). It’s always good to remember that ancient Greek plays were created for festivals, and specifically that playwrights engaged in competition. Naturally, an integral part of festivals was the sacrifice of one or more animals on the altar within the sanctuary of the deity or deities in question. Male animals were, as a rule, sacrificed in honour of male deities, female animals for female deities. Parts of the sacrificial animals were burnt for the gods, while most of the edible parts were prepared for consumption by the community: such meals were often the only occasion for many people to consume meat.  Not everyone celebrated the same festivals. Women, for example, were excluded from attending the Olympic Games (though that did not preclude them from sponsoring athletes!). Some festivals practiced the reverse, and excluded men: the aforementioned Thesmophoria, for example, were intended specifically for married women. Some of these festivals lasted only a day, others several days and even more than a week; the Thesmophoria lasted three days. The ancient Greeks, by the way, didn’t have a “week” like ours, and thus no weekend, and festivals may have been a convenient time to take a break, even though a lot of business would have continued as usual.   I think this will do for now. Some suggested reading:  *  J.N. Bremmer, *Greek Religion* (1994).   * M. Dillon, *Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion* (2002).   * J. Ferguson, *Among the Gods.

e49gp06y	"Hitler's Vienna" by Barbara Hamann which I mentioned here a couple of times already as well as "Hitler" by Joachim Fest (who specifically writes about Hitler trying to flee from Military Service). He actively tried to erase that part of his past by having his Austrian military records confiscated after the Anschluss. Which wasn't by far the first time he tried to erase parts of his own past.    Him being arrested in Munich and forced into Service by being dragged to the Austrian Konsulat is also talked about by Ian Kershaw in "Hitler, 1889-1936" as well as in "Hitlers München. Aufstieg und Fall der Hauptstadt der Bewegung" by David Clay Large. Pretty sure there is an english translation for the latter but I only got it in German and I couldn't find the title of it.   That should fulfill all your needs I guess. And just as a general rule of thumb in terms of Hitler? Take ANY stories about great heroic things with him with a very large grain of salt. Always consider that the man had more then enough time to make his life look a lot better then it was to stylize his own cult of personality.	1643065328.0	hu30yu0	t3_sbczey	t1_hu11uoi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu30yu0/
e49gp06y	There is a point to be made that he didn't want to be in the Austrian Service because he already understood himself as "German". And the fact that he requested to be transferred from a Austrian to a Bavarian regiment during the war every much underlined that. But, no. I'm not implying that. I'm merely stating that he actively dodged Austrian Military Service. Which is factually true.	1643065566.0	hu31k4i	t3_sbczey	t1_hu15i61	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu31k4i/

defs1	Great answer!  In regards to the notion of anachronism arising in the Renaissance: I've often noticed that European representations of the past during that period tend to (quite literally) dress it up in their current fashions. For example, representations of scenes from the Old and New Testaments, or episodes of Greco-Roman history, tend to be dressed up in the fashions and styles current to the time and place of the author.  Was this a conscious decision ('let's dress St Catherine of Alexandria as a Florentine noblewoman to make this scene more relatable'), or did it come from, as you said, not having an as-yet fully-formed notion of the historical past? I recognise that the latter case would always imply a reconstruction with contemporary flavour thrown in, but I'd be very interested on your thoughts!	1643106456.0	hu4y8c8	t3_sc0ucr	t1_hu3y1m2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc0ucr/i_often_see_statements_that_ancient_people_did/hu4y8c8/

ca6cw	Well, thank you so much for the informative answer! You certainly touched a few points that were what I was looking for. I barely knew any information about the festivals other than being celebrations dedicated to deities and that plays were created purposefully for a contest within festivals.  Follow up questions:  - Were the Panhellenic Games only a sports event or were they paired with a festival of a certain deity. In other words, were festivals (and thus sacrifice) held at the same time as the games, or were the games an independent occurrence?  - I'm really interested in more information about plays and contests. Did the content of the plays to a certain festival have to be related to the deity of that festival? Roughly how many different people wrote plays (and thus were a contestant) for a given festival? Was there a specific prize for the winner writer or only the glory?	1643106987.0	hu4yvte	t3_sbpjil	t1_hu2zfuf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbpjil/generally_speaking_how_long_were_the_classic/hu4yvte/

6jfqa	Historically speaking and even in the present day, Levantine communities are not big on butter on bread or toasted bread. Traditional forms of *khubz* include large flatbreads like *taboun* (named for the oven it is baked in), and since white flour was not really a thing in Palestinian communities until the 1960s or later, bread in Palestine in the 18th century would have been baked with locally grown and locally milled "whole wheat" flour. Palestine is a historically important wheat growing area, particularly in Marj ibn Amer (the Jezreel Valley). So first, there would be a difference in taste due to the flour difference. Palestine also was home to many varieties of heirloom wheat that are not commonly cultivated today or are almost extinct entirely. Different varieties of wheat have different bran-germ and protein ratios, lending themselves to different tastes. Second, flatbreads have a different texture even without "toasting." Rural households would generally bake their own bread daily; urban households might have their own *tanour* if they had the means, or they would go to a local bakery to buy daily. This is still the practice today, because flatbreads go stale much faster than loaf breads with a thick crust. So while households might "rewarm" the bread over a fire or stove, you still aren't going to get the same texture as true toasting. Finally, butter on bread wasn't and isn't a common thing in Palestine. Bread is usually eaten with olive oil. Butter from both cow and goat milk was part of Palestinian cuisine, but more for cooking and baking rather than eating straight on a piece of bread. Fresh butter that was more lumpy and almost yogurt-like in consistency (but without fermentation) might be eaten sweetened for breakfast.   Overall, I would say "buttered toast" would look and taste very different in 18th century Palestine than it would in the US today.	1643108432.0	hu50omx	t3_sbu1np	t3_sbu1np	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbu1np/hey_food_historians_has_buttered_toast_more_or/hu50omx/

9i89m	The process of technological advancement has of course been made possible by the utilization of  energy resources like wind, water power, fossil fuels, and nuclear. But  energy efficiency has always been just one consideration in how those sources could be used, there have usually been others.  Consider the Newcomen steam engine. A classic reciprocating steam engine could only get 18% energy efficiency. A human being is better, at 25%. The Newcomen steam engine, the first effective one, limped along at only about 1%. Why was it built to drain a coal mine? Looking only at efficiency, it seems obvious that a bucket-brigade of humans would be better. But at the time in the early 1700’s coal was shipped in baskets and crates. The process of mining left piles of coal dust and bits, or “fines” , piled up around the pithead, because those could not be transported. The Newcomen engine could burn that. Not efficiently: but it was available.   Likewise, consider the [tub wheel](https://www.alamy.com/a-water-wheel-and-flume-at-a-tub-mill-along-the-roaring-fork-stream-image7561956.html). A very simple sort of hydraulic turbine, its efficiency is quite low compared to something like an overshot water wheel. However, a grist mill with a tub wheel had very few moving parts. If someone back in the hills of Appalachia wanted to put a small stream to work grinding their corn,  building a mill with a tub wheel was far cheaper and easier than with an overshot wheel . And the stream's energy was available: it was going to go downhill whether a human put a mill in it or not.  For the overshot wheel, there were also considerations. More efficient than the tub wheel or the undershot wheel, the overshot wheel would have problems during floods- the turning wheel would tend to pile up water behind it.  On rivers where flooding was a problem, in the later 18th c. the breast wheel was invented. It was more complicated to build than an overshot wheel, but it could run on more days of the year: and for anything like a stream or river, that’s rather critical, because summer droughts and winter freezes could keep a water mill from running anyway.  Then there’s the question of scale. Some things are too hard to do with just humans.  The mine serviced by a Newcomen engine might in theory have been drained by a bucket brigade, but they would have had to fed and housed, whether they were working or not. There would have had to be a lot of architecture ( stairs? ladders? elevators?) constructed within the mine for them to work. Likewise, imagine a few hundred blacksmiths trying to forge a single heavy I-beam for a highway bridge. A fossil fuel powered steam hammer might have been less energy efficient than the blacksmiths, but it could do the job. And of course the arch of the steam hammer could not have been cast by hundreds of small foundries, or the steel itself made in thousands of small crucibles.  None of this is to say that energy efficiency has not been a consideration. The steam engine went through a process of constant re-design for almost two hundred years, and the modern steam turbines have a much greater efficiency- between 65% and 90%.  That’s better than the Newcomen’s 1%. So, the short answer to your question would have to be, yes, over time we have been using more and more energy-efficient machines, sources of power. But, while we’re talking about efficiency of machines and humans, using fossil fuels to generate the electricity needed to power this computer I am using to type this answer might be considered less efficient, more wasteful,  than pumping out a mine to keep coal miners from drowning. How wasteful we have been in our choices of using  energy is a more difficult question.	1643112170.0	hu55vms	t3_sbo5hz	t3_sbo5hz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbo5hz/how_did_technological_progress_lead_to_more/hu55vms/

amsnx9lh	Procopius' Wars are the single most relevant work when it comes to this period, but there are of course some other sources which are worth reading. That being said, there are no unbiased sources here -- they all offer certain narratives, perspectives and biases, and many are limited in terms of scope, but together they can paint a decently complete picture. First one would be Agathias, who continues Procopius' work (both chronologically and in terms of style, adopting the classicizing format) up to 558., and whose work is then continued by Menander whose work was preserved only in fragments. Book 8 of John Malalas' Chronicle (General History) and Chronicle (Latin speaking Illyrian who lived and worked as a cancellarius in Constantinople) of Marcellinus Comes describe Justinian's reign from a pro-government point of view, and John of Ephesus offers a miaphysite perspective. Later additions that are worth mentioning are also 7th century Paschal Chronicle and Theophanes (early 9th century), whose Chronicle, aside from Procopius and Malalas, uses some sources that are now lost. Iordanes' Getica offers a pro-Gothic perspective which is quite interesting, even more so because he's occasionally willing to give Justinian some praise where it's due. And a few other (kinda neglected) sources which I'm not familiar with enough to talk about, like Ioannes Lydos and Corippus. And finally, for ecclesiastical matters, there's Evagrius.  Out of these, the strongest contender in historiography so far would probably be Malalas' Chronicle, but recent research has definitively shown it to be anything but reliable (although even Krumbacher and J. B. Bury pointed out it's amateurish like a century ago). Some examples would be plagiarized material for the period before the 5th century, huge chronological errors (eg. when it comes to overlapping reigns of tetrarchs), very likely made up sources, and uncritical attitude towards imperial propaganda. Personally, I think Marcellinus supplements Procopius' work a lot more competently, as it offers a pro-Justinianic viewpoint (evident in his writings on Justinian's consulships, his support for the imperial policy of 'law and order', the suppression of the Nika revolt (532) and the imperial defeat of the Bulgars and Persians, as well as the Vandals). His accounts are particularly valuable when it comes to events in Illyricum and Constantinople itself. As for Malalas:  >For one thing, almost all Malalas's citations that can be checked against existing texts are inexact, and most of them are at least partly wrong. Their vagueness and inaccuracy are Jeffreys's grounds for assuming that nearly all of them are indirect references. Yet a careful writer who cites another careful writer should be able to make most of his references specific and accurate, even if he knows them only second-hand. Practically all earlier Greek historians known to us were far more accurate than Malalas, and most of the errors in his history seem to be cases not of misremembering but of misunderstanding; despite all his mistakes, Malalas usually stays closer to recognizable facts than he could have done if he had tried to write such a long and detailed work from memory. Though in theory all his faulty references could be blamed on his lost sources, that would force us to postulate many bad historians instead of one, and would still imply that Malalas preferred bad sources to Eustathius, whose competence is affirmed by the competent historian Evagrius.   >   >In fact, in reassessing Malalas's sources, Jeffreys concludes that some of Malalas's references to 'Clement' are ' "inventions" by Malalas'. She also observes that the name of the alleged historian Bottius 'is suspiciously close to the cult name Zeus Bottios'. Among other unknown historians cited by Malalas, she suggests that 'Malalas himself inserted' his 'extremely dubious' reference to 'Eutychianus'; that 'Membronius of Babylon' is 'a garbled and fictitious name'; and that Philostratus 'may be another fictitious author, perhaps fabricated by Malalas to lend authenticity to his narrative'.1 She therefore implies that Malalas falsified at least five of the sources he cites.

But no, he wasn’t, nor is there a shred of credible evidence to suggest that his mother, Margaret Beaufort, was involved either.  Henry was in exile in France at the time, and had been since he was a teenager. Also, he would have gained absolutely nothing from them disappearing. Killing the Princes was in no way an existential threat to Yorkist supremacy. There were other Yorkists ready to take the throne. The line merely passed to Richard. If you examine the way Richard seized power from the Princes’ legal guardians once he made his way to London after his brother Edward V died, and the circumstances surrounding their disappearance, it’s fairly obvious that he played an active role in first removing them from public life and then, well, god knows what happened to them, but I’m sure it wasn’t pretty.	1643112830.0	hu56w8c	t3_scai1f	t3_scai1f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scai1f/was_henry_vii_not_richard_iii_the_real_culprit/hu56w8c/

kfhe9	> Anyhow, did no-one check what he was doing with his income from Tintin? Wasn't he donating it to support poor Belgians disenfranchised by the occupation?  It's unlikely: Hergé was repeatedly questioned by journalists about his wartime activities and always felt the need to explain himself (not very convincingly). He would certainly had told people that he had given money to charity if it had happened. One thing he did with the extra income was to hire assistants (Alice Devos, E.P. Jacobs) to help him with the increasing workload, particularly the colouring and reformatting of his earlier work into book format.  > And wasn't he being continually harassed by the secret police?  Escapist entertainment was a propaganda strategy at the time, and Hergé provided that in droves. Neither he or his books were ever considered suspect by Occupation authorities. He was even able to turn down a German firm's offer to publish *Tintin in the Land of the Soviets*. *Tintin in America* received clearance to be printed, but Hergé had done a preemptive bit of self-censorship by removing an American flag from a plate. Casterman (but not Hergé) was reprimanded for *The Black Island* being "too British" and the publisher got a slap on the wrist. But even then both books remained available during the war. Hergé's main defence after the war was that he had been a simple working man who "did not feel at all concerned with the war" and just did innocent drawings.	1643114776.0	hu5a4ml	t3_sahiz1	t1_hu51olc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sahiz1/hergé_continued_to_write_tintinstories_during_the/hu5a4ml/

6fyol4b8	I’m going to focus this answer on *Branwen*, though hopefully aspects of this answer should apply to other texts as well.          *Branwen daughter of Llŷr*, as you’ll have found in your reading, is the second of the *Pedair Kainc y Mabinogi*, the *Four Branches of the Mabinogi* (the others are *Pwyll Prince of Dyfed*; *Manawyddan son of Llŷr*; and *Math son of Mathonwy*). One of the major difficulties of working with these texts is that no one is quite sure when they were composed; or rather, many people are very sure about a number of very different dates. The *Four Branches* appear in two Welsh manuscripts, *Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch* (*The White Book of Rhydderch*, completed c. 1300-1325) and *Llyfr Coch Hergest* (*The Red Book of Hergest*, completed c. 1375-1425). By this period, Ireland was nominally under the lordship of the King of England, though effective English control declined steadily through the 13th and 14th centuries.          However, there are also fragments of both *Branwen* and *Manawyddan* in a collection of manuscript bits called Peniarth 6, which dates from the mid 13th century; and these don’t differ substantially from the versions that we get later. So we know that the stories are older than their surviving manuscripts. Scholars have asserted dates ranging from 1050 to 1190, based partly on the language of the stories, partly on the material culture they depict, and partly on what they deem to be allusions to contemporary events. Two of these are directly relevant to your question: King Matholwch’s arrival in Wales from the south of Ireland (*o deheu Iwerdon*), and his later construction of a massive house to welcome Bendigeidfran, King of Britain (well, actually to betray him and massacre his army, but…) For the Welsh critic Saunders Lewis (1893-1985), the first was a clear allusion to the King of Leinster, Diarmait mac Murchada’s arrival in Bristol in 1166, seeking Henry II of England’s aid in recovering his kingdom; the second to the eventual outcome of this mission, when the sub-kings of Ireland built a palace outside Dublin for Henry in 1171-72, indicating their submission to his rule. But other scholars have questioned whether the plot of *Branwen* has more than superficial resemblances to these events. The connections are not widely accepted today.          In any case, it’s entirely possible that at whatever date *Branwen* was composed, there was indeed someone calling himself the King of Ireland. While their actual power was both limited and frequently violently contested, men styled “High King of Ireland” (*Ard-Rí na hÉireann*) existed throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries, based nominally at Tara (*Teamhair*). Following the Anglo-Norman conquests, the Kings of England were Ireland’s overlords, if not (before Henry VIII) specifically its kings. But various challengers to English sovereignty did claim the title of High King, most notably Brian Ó Néill (1258-60) and Edward Bruce, Robert the Bruce of Scotland’s younger brother (1315-18).          But my instinct is that associating these figures with Matholwch in *Branwen* might be barking up the wrong tree. To quote at length from Patrick Sims-Williams, in his *Irish Influence on Medieval Welsh Literature* (2010):         “In the first place it may be doubted that the author of *Branwen* was well informed about contemporary Irish affairs. It is true that his story ends with an explanation of the origin of the five provinces of Ireland, but that division seems to have been well known in Wales… Despite some anachronistic details (as in all medieval historical fiction), the author makes it clear that he is describing a remote period in the pre‐Christian past of Britain and Ireland, earlier than the reign in Britain of Julius Caesar's opponent Caswallawn (Cassivellaunus) and earlier than the establishment of the five provinces in Ireland. At this legendary period, both Britain and Ireland were supposed to be ruled by monarchs, not by provincial kings competing for the high‐kingship. In these circumstances the author of *Branwen* would have been under no obligation, if writing after 1116, to make Matholwch sail from the north rather than the south simply in order to be up to date. In fact it might be argued that if he really was well informed about post‐1116 Irish affairs, he might deliberately have chosen a southerly location for the king of Ireland so as to lend a more archaic colour to his story… Probably we should read the opening of *Branwen* as literary critics rather than historians.” (190-191)         To expand a bit on Sims-Williams’s observations: it’s not only Ireland that the composer of *Branwen* depicts anachronistically under the uncontested rule of a single monarch. Bendigeidfran is *brenhin coronawc ar yr ynys hon*, “crowned king over this island”--specifically *Ynys y Kedeirn*, “Island of the Mighty,” a term which encompasses all of Britain including Scotland. Outside of Edward I’s attempts to claim suzerainty over Scotland in the late 13th century, no medieval monarch could claim anything like such a title.          A recurrent theme of *Branwen* is that of originary unity wrenched violently apart. Even Britain and Ireland, the text tells us, were not as distant in that ancient time as they are now: ““Bendigeidfran, and the host of which we spoke, set out towards Ireland, and the deep sea was not wide then; he came by wading. There was nothing but two rivers: Lli and Archan, they were called. And after that, the deep sea expanded, when the deep sea conquered kingdoms.” The tale is full of attempts at connection across kingdoms, species, and time. But these are continually undermined by human weakness and cruelty. Though Bendigeidfran famously asserts “*A uo penn bit pont*” (“Whoever would be the head/leader, should be a bridge,”) his own massive body is doomed to be disassembled, reduced to a talismanic head on xenophobic guard against foreign invasion of his former kingdom. Ireland specifically, we are told, is partitioned into five provinces as a result of the terrible battles described in the text, which leave only five pregnant women alive in the whole island.          So in *Branwen*, while the singular king of Ireland may reflect some form of contemporary political reality, it’s probably more productive to read this as a literary device in conversation with the text’s thematic interests. As for other Kings of Ireland in medieval romance, like Anguish/Anguishance in the Arthurian mythos, I can’t provide as thorough an answer, though I imagine similar dynamics may be in play. The idea of primordial wholeness giving way to strife and factionalism was very attractive to medieval European writers, drawing from the Biblical type of the Tower of Babel. If they were familiar with the political situation in Ireland, they may have intentionally depicted a more centralized past. But Arthurian romances happily assign kings to countries that never had them, like Iceland; so the conventions of historical fantasy may also play an important role here.	1643132227.0	hu6fo86	t3_sbmqt2	t3_sbmqt2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmqt2/why_do_many_welsh_myths_and_arthurian_legends/hu6fo86/

Also, is there any idea what, exactly that chemical was that made the stale beer fizz?

(At that time there was a lager craze in NY and German breweries dominated the scene.)  These empty kegs, left outside for collection, are where the stale beer came from. Kegs had “bungholes”, yes the proper term, closed off with stoppers, where beer could be poured in or out. So the runoff was relatively easy to access. Lucy Sante implies there was an informal business around this collection, but it sounds like it was a toss up whether the stale beer was usually bought, begged for, or just stolen.  As far as the chemicals, I had the exact same question. It’d be great if we could get a food and alcohol expert to weigh in on both these questions. The best I could determine reading the first person accounts and newspaper reports was that “stale beer” was regularly mixed and served with a whole host of non-beer liquids and intoxicants, many like you say probably dangerous. In The NY Times report I linked, note that many of the arrested vagrants skipped the police station and went right to the hospital.	1643134979.0	hu6n7f9	t3_s8uieq	t1_hu6i689	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8uieq/in_jacob_riis_how_the_other_half_lives_he/hu6n7f9/

8uf2h	Thanks! It's always interesting to me how closely-related fandoms can coexist for decades (maybe not since the start of reenacting, but for the several decades since LARP became popular in Germany) and end up mixing very little.  This question was prompted by some recent discussion on /r/larp on the history of larp, which does have important early roots in Germany. So, if you do ever come across any interesting bits of LARP history there's an interested audience over there!	1643135504.0	hu6omi3	t3_savz63	t1_hu1vt1a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu6omi3/

34ekm	It would be technically and legally impossible for any of the former Confederate states to have a government entity within their borders that today wouldn’t be considered part of the Union.   This is due to the manner in which states rejoined the union in Reconstruction. The states took the necessary action (ratifying or adopting constitutional amendments, promulgating new constitutions, etc.) to rejoin the union. This means all their political subdivisions essentially were swooped in with them. A state’s political subdivisions (counties, cities, organized towns, etc.) had fealty to the state, are created and authorized by state law or constitution, etc. While an individual jurisdiction could have opposed rejoining the union, or even voted against ratification of a constitution to facilitate joining the union, it still doesn’t sever them from the state itself.   Now, there were instances like Newton Knight and Jones County, Mississippi where there were rebellions against the Confederacy in the late American Civil War.   And, during the secession period, there are isolated instances of some jurisdictions declaring themselves as the opposite of what their state did. For example, Van Zandt County, Texas, has a lore that at one time it was established as the “Free State of Van Zandt,” because it didn’t vote with Texas to secede from the Union. However, it really didn’t happen like that, and there are in fact multiple possibilities for how the county came to be known as the “Free State of Van Zandt.”  Sources: Manning, Wentworth.

4teci	Yes, absolutely my mistake, 1995 is too early. Well maybe it was out there straight from Little himself to film scouts, as it would be today, but I cannot find any proof of that.  Late 1996 then. The film scout Koukla Maclehose reports having it in galley form from Little, and evangelising it across London, where various unnamed film companies refuse to have anything to do with it.

rmdal0m	The OP is citing this Pew Research Report on Islam and Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa: [https://www.pewforum.org/2010/04/15/executive-summary-islam-and-christianity-in-sub-saharan-africa/](https://www.pewforum.org/2010/04/15/executive-summary-islam-and-christianity-in-sub-saharan-africa/) but this is a subject that Pew generally takes a significant interest in--and it is a major question for scholars of African religious history and indeed the modern history of sub-Saharan Africa overall.  A good starting place might be a remark in the executive summary of that Pew report: "The survey findings suggest that many Africans are deeply committed to Islam or Christianity and yet continue to practice elements of traditional African religions". Scholars who study religion have a general name for the process by which religions combine and mix together: "syncretism". Sub-Saharan Africa is perhaps the most intense showcase of what syncretism looks like in its specifics: both Islam and Christianity have been changed by their encounter with a huge variety of traditional African religious ideas, practices and institutions, and the process of syncretic formation is still ongoing. So when you see "Christianity" and "Islam" in sub-Saharan Africa, both historically and in the present day, you need to understand right away that you might *also* be seeing "African traditional religion" in some form as a substantial element of practice within those two named world religions.   In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, you might find a person who is a member of a mainstream Christian congregation also laying gifts at a shrine intended to placate a dangerous water spirit and attending a worship meeting that combines elements of pentecostal Christianity with traditional forms of spirit possession. Many people are not merely syncretic in their practices but pluralistic, e.g., they do not see multiple modalities or institutional forms of religion and spiritual belief as contradictory or incommensurable. You may have heard of Pascal's Wager, namely, that if you believe in God and He is not real, no harm done; if you do not believe in God and He is real, you're damned, so believe in God. The sub-Saharan African version might be "do all the spiritual things available to you, why not?" The one exception here might be being both Christian and Islam, because those two religions have frequently argued that they are formally incommensurable and demanded that their adherents stick to that principle. Neither religion invites syncretism with African traditional religions either, mind you, but a formal religion with organized worship is easier to mix with or run parallel to informal mixtures of rituals and deeply-seated forms of everyday spiritual reasoning.   Another element to consider is that Christianity in particular, but also sometimes Islam, have been associated with conquest, imperialism, and ruling authority. For much of the first half of the 20th Century in territories ruled by the French, British, Belgians or Portuguese, declaring oneself a Christian often opened up opportunities: access to land, access to education (particularly in the privileged European language of your colonizer), and access to professional opportunities. None of the European colonial powers invested in state-supported schooling for African children until the very end of the colonial era; almost all formal education was provided either by Christian missionaries or in parts of West and Northeast Africa by Muslim teachers, and formal education in turn was a requirement for a good deal of formal employment. Christian missions were often granted land for their mission stations by colonial administrators, and the precondition of continued residence on that land for existing communities was often at least notional or provisional conversion to Christianity. Identifying as Christian--or in some regions, as Muslim--was and remains a pragmatic or safe thing to do. Colonial officials and missionaries often treated African traditional religion with enormous suspicion and hostility, and successive waves of Muslim reformers and fundamentalists from the mid-19th Century onward could be equally strident. Meaning, inasmuch as people strongly identified as traditional religionists who strongly rejected both Christianity and Islam, they have tended to keep that identification a secret, to the point of coming to see their religious observance as *characterized* by secrecy. You might think this contradicts the earlier points about syncretism and pluralism, but in certain ways it actually reinforces them. You don't tell the nice interviewer from Pew or the white American anthropologist about the spirit medium you're going to see next week, just about the Methodist church you go to.  Just to try to make this more concrete using some of the examples I know best:  In southern and eastern Africa, some Africans converting to Christianity joined mainstream congregations, often headed by a European missionary. But even in those cases, elements of mainstream Protestant and Catholic worship often shifted subtly (or not so subtly) towards ideas and rituals that were compatible with or evocative of local traditional spirituality. An especially dramatic example might be the Zambian Catholic archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, who first made a splash in the 1970s by performing exorcisms and mass faith healing ceremonies. In 1983, John Paul II recalled him to Rome and removed him from his post in Zambia. (At one point he had a popular radio show in Italy, I think.) In the 1990s he became known as a Catholic dissident who was harshly critical of the existing hierarchy and an advocate of priestly marriage. He took an extra step beyond priestly marriage and actually got married (by the Reverend Sun-Myung Moon), at which point John Paul II and Ratzinger forced him into monastic seclusion for a while. He quietly left around 2004 and then in 2006 ordinated priests and bishops on his own, which was the last straw and he was excommunicated. So he's a bit of an extreme example, but a lot of formal mainstream Protestant and Catholic congregations have been pulled towards traditional ideas over the years.   Inasmuch as they refuse to be pulled (or are disciplined by their co-religionists in the same congregations elsewhere), they are also being eclipsed by more fluid syncretic forms of Christianity that sometimes don't seem very much like Christianity. Pentecostal evangelical churches, for example, are growing by leaps and bounds in much of West Africa and elsewhere. All over southern Africa, you see various groups of worshippers in public who have adopted aspects of Christian ritual like baptism but whose doctrines are often shaped far more by traditional spiritual practice--the "Apostolics" of Zimbabwe and Zambia, the "Zionists" of South Africa. Typical elements of these religious communities include avoiding pork, alcohol, caffeine or tobacco; avoiding Western medicines and medical treatment and practicing faith healing; worship ceremonies exclusively outside (you will see Zionists on the weekend in vacant lots and open spaces around major South African cities); and baptisms not just as a conversation experience but as regular purification. Adherents usually wear a white robe and they often walk together from their homes to their worship ceremonies--or sometimes gather in huge numbers together for mass worship. Many of them believe in a prophetic founding figure who is sometimes said to have been a reborn Jesus or to be directly anointed from God. Many also believe that ancestral spirits are real but essentially malign and must be rejected. Many of those congregations show up as "Christian" in the kind of surveys that Pew does but it is debatable whether that's the right label for them. (Some of the scholarship refers to them generally as "African-Initiated Churches".)   Beyond that kind of formal religious belonging, syncretic or otherwise, there are some general folk spiritual beliefs you find people following regardless of what they say their formal religious identity might be. Often these are associated with healing--many people will consult both a standard biomedical doctor or expert if they are available and some kind of indigenous healer. Many people accept that there are dangerous spiritual forces and powers in the natural world and at the command of people with malign intentions and that you have to protect yourself and understand where and when you might need to take countering steps--all without calling themselves "traditional religionists". There's a huge scholarly literature on what is sometimes called "witchcraft discourse": I particularly recommend Peter Geschiere's *The Modernity of Witchcraft* and Adam Ashforth's *Witchcraft, Violence and Democracy in South Africa*.   None of this takes away from the fact that the conversion of many sub-Saharan Africans to Christianity (of some form) and Islam over the 20th Century and into the 21st is a major change. It is. But it may be that that story is not incompatible with "traditional spirituality is alive and well in sub-Saharan Africa" (and is changing with some of the same dynamism).	1643139060.0	hu6y10w	t3_scd446	t3_scd446	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scd446/as_per_pew_research_center_report_the_share_of/hu6y10w/
mdu63	~~Japanese Wikipedia entry of Palmyra Atoll (パルミラ環礁) is just a meh (It is apparently based on the translation of old version of English wikipedia, without almost any mention of possible Japanese visits).~~   "Islands studies" (translated as "島嶼学"), dealing with the Japanese interaction and integration of the Pacific Islands, has been a really new field of research in Japan, mainly since the last decade of the 20th century.    Shun Ishihara's two socio-historical monographs are now seminal works of this field, but even his scope of research is largely limited to Ogasawara/ Bonin Islands and volcano islands (Iwo Jima Islands), and his fruit of research has apparently been little known out of Japan/ in English.    Anyway, the following are the links to his books (in Japanese) in National Library [of Australia......]:    * https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/6488918 * https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4366631  On the other hand, David Chapman writes [*The Bonin Islanders, 1830 to the Present: Narrating Japanese Nationality*, n. p.: Lexinton Books, 2016](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498516648/The-Bonin-Islanders-1830-to-the-Present-Narrating-Japanese-Nationality) in English, so you might be able to something interesting by checking this book.   The following online articles in English are introduction of the history of Ogasawara/ Bonin Islands respectively by Chapman and by Ishihara, but neither of them allude to Pacific Islands beyond the volcano Islands:    * [Chapman, David. "Inventing Subjects and Sovereignty: Early History of the First Settlers of the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands." *The Asia-Pacific Journal* 7-1 (2009).](https://apjjf.org/-David-Chapman/3169/article.html)  * [Ishihara, Shun.

wnig7	Ok, so I’m going to be completely honest for a second and say that I genuinely have no idea what he means when he says the Romans “Permitted Rome to be sacked” or “of course they could have kept the barbarians out of the city”. I mean, is he being literal? Is he speaking metaphorically? Is the city in this case the Empire itself, and the Romans keeping the barbarians out means they could have tried harder to defend their borders (I tried watching more of the video but didn’t get far past the whole “borders” stuff as it is not the kind of thing I am familiar with). Honestly, whether he’s being literal or metaphorical, I think his…claims lack historical context. It seems more like he read a couple of articles all about how the “savage” barbarians invaded the Roman Empire and brought on massive societal collapse, a historical take that, even if it were accurate, completely removes itself from the larger context of late antiquity. In addition the way that it’s worded makes it sound like the Romans literally just invited the Goths (I assume that’s who he means) into the city for a stroll and dinner. The Romans absolutely put up a fight, quite successfully for basically an entire century, they didn’t just roll over and acquiesce to their own “doom”. This idea also ignores the fact that Rome was no longer the capital, Ravenna was by this point, and was mostly only important for symbolic reasons really.  Not to mention the fact that the Romans were plagued by civil wars and usurpers throughout this period.              In addition, and I want to take a quick a moment to stress that I am absolutely not accusing anyone of anything here, the only articles I can find online about “civilizational self confidence” all revolve around “radical islam”, Muslims trying to institute sharia law in western countries, and a lot of other anti-immigration views. Views that, quite unfortunately, are very often tied into the migrations of non-Roman peoples during late antiquity. Specifically these comparison’s usually make the argument that the “barbarians” who “invaded” (I’ll explain the quotation marks a bit later)  the Roman Empire undermined Roman society, the Roman military, Roman values, etc. etc. etc. This really isn’t a very accurate view, and is kind of outdated since we don’t really study individual aspects of late antiquity in a vacuum anymore. Instead we look at multiple aspects of the time period, religion, military, politics, and the movement of peoples to name a few (that's not to say that historians don’t choose to focus on one of these individually, just that we don’t approach any of them as if they occurred in a vacuum). Unfortunately, however, when it comes to pop history and whatnot people tend to focus on just one aspect too much. Like the people who blame Christianity for the collapse of the Roman Empire for example.             Anyway, I don’t know if the person in this video was trying to connect modern immigration with the migration age or if he was just using it as an example of something else, but I do understand wanting to connect our present with past events. After all, it’s something that we do all the time for all kinds of things. That being said, we need to be careful about how we connect modern events to the past, because it’s extremely easy to compare two things that occurred hundreds of years apart and say “see, this is exactly like what happened to the Romans”. What’s harder to do is to compare those two events and make sure that we do so accurately. Instead of just saying “this thing is just like this other thing” we should take the time to explain why they’re similar (and maybe even how they’re different), even if that means putting in a little extra work before making any claims. This is especially true when the person doing the talking is someone well known, or on a platform where their words can easily be heard by tens of thousands of people (if not more). Now, I know that was a lot of talking and not a lot of history, but I truly believe it is important to be careful with these kinds of comparisons and it does worry me how common this particular claim seems to be. So I apologize for spending far too much time on my soapbox, and I truly hope this sounded as apolitical as I think it does, and now I am actually going to be discussing history from this point forward (I promise). I’m also going to try to divide this question into separate sections since I plan on covering a kind of broad time period and things might get confusing if I don’t make at least some kind of an attempt to separate them.            Migration or Invasion?        Ok, so it’s obviously only fair for me to explain why I think that the claim I think is being made in this video is incorrect. What I would like to talk about now is the migration age, the idea of “barbarian invasions”, as well as Roman culture/society. The migration age was roughly the period 375-568, though some historians date it from 300-800. For this answer I’m mostly going to focus on 375-476, give or take a couple of decades, because that’s the final century of the Roman Empire in western Europe. So what was the migration period? Well, as I’m sure most people can surmise, it’s quite literally what it is called. It was a period of mass migrations of various people groups into the Roman Empire. Many of these people are commonly referred to as “Germanic” . People like the Goths, the Franks, the Alemanni, and the Suebi are probably the most relevant members of this group. But, there were also non-Germanic groups, the Alans were an Iranian people, the Huns came from somewhere in Central Asia, and later the proto-Slavs and the Avars (but I won’t really be mentioning them again as they came towards the end of this period). The reason I put Germanic in quotes earlier (which I won’t be doing from here on out for simplicity’s sake), is because the Romans had a habit of lumping peoples together just because they had some traits in common. Now, many of these people did speak languages that were related to one another, but they didn’t really have a unified culture, these were distinct groups of people who often identified themselves by tribal associations, not some overarching “German” ethnic identity.              I’m going to focus on groups like the Goths, Franks, Vandals and Huns, though the Goths will likely be the highlight as the Goths are the ones who normally get all the blame for “destroying” the Roman Empire in popular imagination. I will say that I find this a little strange honestly as Attila is a rather well known figure, and the Huns were certainly a bigger threat to the Roman Empire than the Goths were even if the former never directly invaded Italy. Now it’s time for me to explain why I keep writing “invasion” in quotation marks. The reason is that I agree with historians like Guy Halsall and Michael Kulikowski when it comes to this period, namely that these were mostly mass migrations and not invasions, perhaps with a few exceptions. There are of course historians like Peter Heather who view things differently (and Heather is still an excellent historian whose work I used extensively for my own MA thesis). That being said, the general public obviously doesn’t keep up with the academic discourse and historiography of late Roman history, no I think the main reason so many people readily accept that these migrations were actually invasions is because they lack the greater context.	1643139956.0	hu70fdm	t3_rrfiaz	t3_rrfiaz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu70fdm/

wnig7	 When it comes to the Goths, well specifically the Goths during this period, I think it’s best to actually start in the 360s. This is because from 367-369 Emperor Valens fought a war against the king of the Tervingi Goths (there was more than one Gothic tribe), Athanaric. 367 and 368 were both uneventful as the Romans weren’t able to force the Goths into a battle, but in 369 Valens managed to defeat Ermanaric at Noviodunum on the other side of the Danube. This victory, and the disruption to trade brought on by three years of hostilities, forced the Goths to sue for peace and enabled Valens to negotiate said peace on his own terms (which were undoubtedly favorable for Rome), as told to us Ammianus Marcellinus: “the events for these three campaigns created a favourable climate for ending hostilities. The enemy were alarmed by the emperor’s long stay in their neighbourhood, and the interruption of trade had reduced the barbarians to such want that they sent a number of delegations to beg for pardon and peace.” (Ammianus Marcellinus, Later Roman Empire, 5.27) As is always the case with ancient sources we need to be careful at just taking Ammianus’s words at face value, and he very well might have exaggerated a little bit about how desperate the Goths were for peace, but I think given everything that came after he was at least be mostly truthful here. It’s certainly easy to believe that the presence of a Roman army on your metaphorical doorstep for three years would be quite worrying, especially after losing a battle to said army, and any disruption to trade for a people who were probably reliant on trade with the Romans and other nearby peoples would have been costly.             Nonetheless, a “favorable climate for peace” is not the only climate that was created by Valens’ campaigns across the Danube. They likely also helped to create the conditions that led to infighting among the Goths, and established a Roman presence close to Gothic territory that allowed the Romans to easily intervene in said conflict. The aforementioned disruption of the Gothic economy likely also led to less than favorable conditions for the Gothic people (though I’ve never come across any book or article that really discusses this in any detail). At some point between 369 and 375/6, we aren’t entirely sure on the specific details, a civil war broke out between Athanaric and a rival Tervingi leader, Fritigern. There aren’t many details about the war itself, Ammianus doesn’t even mention it at all for some reason, so it’s hard to know exactly why it started or exactly what happened. But it would seem that tensions arose between Athanaric and Fritigern as Athanaric began a persecution of Gothic Christians because he feared they may have been pro-Roman (another example of the fallout from Valens’ earlier campaigns), and Fritigern led the Christain faction. To be completely honest, we don’t really know if Fritigern and Athanaric came to blows because of this persecution, or if that just served as the backdrop and allowed Fritigern to rally support for his own cause. We don’t even know when Fritigern himself actually converted to Christianity, it might have been before the war began (which would imply Fritigern was already a leader of the Christian Goths), or he might have converted during the war, possibly to gain favor with Valens.            I tend to go with the latter option as that’s how Socrates Scholasticus tells it, and his account is the one that I most often see cited by other historians, “When \[Athanaric\] had obtained an evident advantage over his rival, Fritigernes had recourse to the Romans, and implored their assistance against his adversary. This was reported to Emperor Valens, and he ordered the troops…in Thrace to assist those barbarians who had appealed to him against their more powerful countrymen; and by means of this subsidy they won a complete victory over Athanaric beyond the Danube, totally routing the enemy. This became the occasion for the conversion of many of the barbarians to the Christian religion: for Fritigernes, to express his sense of the obligation the emperor had conferred upon him, embraced the religion of his benefactor, and urged those who were under his authority to do the same. (Socrates Scholasticus, Ecclesiasctical History, 4.33) This, of course, implies that most of the Goths that had sided with Fritigerns had not yet converted to Christianity, including Fritigern himself. It is certainly possible that Fritigern converted as sort of thanks to the man who helped him achieve victory, and that he had the authority to order his followers to do the same. But one interesting detail about Socrates’ account is that he makes specific mention of the fact that they converted to Arianism: “Therefore it is that so many of the Goths ar even to the present time infected with the errors of Arianism, they having on the occasion preferring to become adherents to that heresy on the emperor’s account.” To be fair, it’s entirely possible, perhaps even likely, that this doesn’t really mean anything and is just Socrates lamenting the fact that the Goths even in his day still follow a “heresy”, but it could also mean that some of them were already Christians and after Valens supported Fritigern chose to convert to the emperor’s specific creed to gain even further imperial favor. I’ve never actually seen anyone else make that claim, and in the big picture it’s probably not that relevant, just something I find to be interesting.             Anyway, even Socrates’ account of this civil war is quite short, maybe three pages total and roughly half of that is just him ragging on Arianism and saying that the Goths were “simpleminded”. In fact, despite Valens’ support allowing Fritigern to win a decisive victory against Athanaric we pretty much have no idea what actually happened next. The only thing we do know is that Athanaric seems to have won the war overall because he’s still king by the time the Huns arrive a few years later and led the Goths in battle against them (and lost of course). Nonetheless, this civil war is another example of just how destabilized things had become across the Danube, and no matter who actually won the war there were most likely still tensions between both sides, especially since it’s clear that neither side was able to gain any kind of significant advantage after Valens’ interference.             This, finally, brings us to 376 and the Tervingi Goths’ entrance into the Roman Empire. So, as I’ve previously stated, people often like to paint these movements of people as “invasions”, and I think a big part of the reason this is done to the Goths is because of Alaric’s conflicts with Romans in late 3rd and early 4th centuries. But in 376 the Goths did not invade, they asked Emperor Valens for permission to cross the Danube and settle inside the Roman Empire. In fact, Valens was fighting a war against the Sassanids at this point, so he was off in the east which meant communication between him and the Danube took even longer than it would have if he had been in Constantinople. Despite this, the Goths still waited until they had received his permission. To be fair though, crossing the Danube without Roman help, especially since the river was well defended at this time, would have been difficult, but they were still invited to settle inside the Empire. And this was far from the first time non-Romans had been allowed to settle within the Roman Empire, in fact a group of Franks was forced to settle on the Roman side of the Rhine after they were defeated in battle. So the Romans have a long history of allowing conquered peoples and allies to settle within the Empire. The Goths also agreed to supply men for the military in exchange for land, and we know there were already a decent number of Goths in the Roman military before this because there were Goths in the Roman ranks at Adrianople in 378. Some historians, such as Peter Heather, have argued that Valens only allowed the Tervingi into the Empire because he had little choice, but Halsall finds this to be an unconvincing argument (a position that I agree with). He argues that even though Valens was away in the east with his best troops, the Danube was still heavily defended and that the Romans would have been well aware of the easiest crossing points. There is very little chance the Goths could have successfully forced their way across the river even if they had wanted to. (Guy Halsall, Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, 176.)	1643139966.0	hu70gbz	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu70fdm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu70gbz/
wnig7	I know that in addition to Alaric people also point to the Battle of Adrianople as evidence that the Goths were, at least partially, responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire, but I think it takes a lot of wishful thinking for that to actually make sense. I will say, though, that even contemporaries like Ammianus Marcellinus were not all that pleased with Valens’ decision to allow the Goths to settle within the empire, he went so far as to refer to them as “those destined to overthrow the Roman Empire”. (Ammianus Marcellinus, Later Roman Empire, 31.4) Of course the Goths didn’t overthrow the Roman Empire, nor did they wish to, and Ammianus himself wrote this history well before the actual event, but that’s getting ahead of the narrative. The Goths sometimes receive most of the blame for the Battle of Adrianople, but the reality is that most, if not all, of the blame actually lies with the Romans. The men in charge of the Goths receptio didn’t really handle the situation all that well, and there was also a food shortage that led to a lot of anger and outrage among the Goths. Specifically, there was a food shortage in the Balkans, Halsall makes the argument that this is most likely because the imperial army in Thrace was already stretching the resources of the region to their limits, so adding another 30-40,000 hungry mouths on top of the 20 or 30,000 soldiers would have immediately drained any resources still available. Ammianus himself even blames the Roman generals in charge of the Goth’s receptio, and as we’ve already seen that he was far from a fan of the Goths. His description of these events is rather morbid, despite its brevity, “The barbarians after crossing the river were distressed by want of food, and these loathsome generals \[Lupicinus and Maximus\] devised an abominable form of barter. They collected all the dogs their insatiable greed could find and exchanged each of them for a slave, and among these slaves were the sons of leading men.” (Ammianus Marcellinus, Later Roman Empire, 31.4) I will say that I think these specific details are probably embellished, though they are still believable, but if true it’s easy to see why the Goths quickly became upset with the Romans. Because of all this Lupicinus decided to move the Gothic refugees closer to the city of Marcianople, and things quickly got even more out of hand.            So, after the Tervingi were moved to Marcianople, something that required the troops stationed in Thrace, the Greuthungi Goths crossed the Danube. The Greuthungi had also asked permission to cross the river as they were fleeing the Huns, but Valens denied them. Now, this could be more easily construed as an “invasion” in my mind since the Greuthungi didn’t have permission to cross into the Empire but did so anyway, but again context is important here. In this case, the context is that the Greuthungi had been defeated by the Huns and fled to Tervingi territory, shortly after this Athanaric was defeated by the Huns as well and the Greuthungi fled towards the Danube sometime after Frittigern’s faction had done so. This hardly sounds like any invasion I’ve heard of. The Greuthungi didn’t cross the Danube to wage, or overthrow the Roman Empire (which, frankly, is an absurd idea anyway), or whatever else. They were quite literally refugees.             Anyway, back to Marcianople and the Tervingi for a moment. Not too long after arriving at Marcianople the Tervingi openly rebelled against the Romans and defeated them in battle. There aren’t many details of this battle other than the fact that the Goths won, and the Romans suffered heavy losses. Afterwards Fritigern’s Goths joined up with the Greuthungi (led by two men named Saphrax and Alatheus). I’m not really going to put too much emphasis on the Battle of Adrianople since the details of the battle itself aren’t really relevant to the topic at hand, in my opinion. So I’ll just say, briefly, that the combined Gothic force won, Valens’ best field army was devastated, and Valens himself was killed in the battle. After another 4 years, Valens’ successor Theodosius I was able to reach a peace agreement with the Goths that allowed them to settle in Thrace more or less under the same terms Valens had given them, namely that they had to provide men for the military.             So, I’ve seen quite a few people argue that Adrianople marked the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire because, mostly because they believe that it’s proof that the Roman military was no longer capable of defending the Empire against non-Romans. The first, and most obvious issue with this claim is that the battle took place in the eastern half of the Roman Empire, you know the half that was still around like an entire millennium later, and not the western half. The battle was fought by eastern field armies and not western ones, in fact, the western Romans defeated the Marcomanni in several battles just before the Battle of Adrianople (they were actually supposed to reinforce Valens but had to divert their attention after the Lentienses crossed the Rhine). So how could the Battle of Adrianople be any indication on the state of the western Roman military? Also, the Romans suffered several disastrous defeats throughout history, Cannae, Teutoburg Wald, Carhae, and several others, granted none of these battles occurred within 100 years of the so-called collapse of the Roman Empire, but they were all disasters that the Romans were able to recover from. In fact, Cannae, at least from the numbers alone, was a far bigger deal as the Romans lost almost 70,000 men and this was shortly after losing tens of thousands of men at Trebia and Lake Trasimene as well. Again, I know this isn’t the most fair comparison because the Roman Empire was in dire straits by the late 4th century, I just wanted to point out that putting this level of blame on one single battle seems…unfair (for lack of a better term). This is especially true when considering the continued success of the Roman military, both in the east and the west, for the next 80 or so years. The real issue isn’t that the Romans started to lose more often, its that in the 5th century they were less capable of recovering from some of these losses because of several factors.	1643139988.0	hu70if2	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu70gbz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu70if2/
wnig7	Alaric         I know most of what I’ve said so far hasn’t really addressed the specific question of “could the sack of Rome have been avoided”, but we’re getting there, like I said, context matters. I’m going to skip ahead a few years, well more like two decades I guess, to one of the other prominent examples people use as evidence that the Goths and other barbarians are to blame for the fall of the Roman Empire. Specifically, Alaric and his on again/off again, love/hate, will they/won’t they relationship with the Romans, and of course Alaric did sack Rome. In fact, Alaric seems to be the primary example that I’ve come across anytime someone brings up the end of the Roman Empire. I’ve seen questions up here, and elsewhere, articles online, and even just general comments online that imply Alaric and the Goths were the main cause for the fall of the Roman Empire…for reasons that never seem to be very well explained. Now it is definitely possible to argue, with historical evidence, that Alaric and the Goths played some role in the collapse of the Roman Empire (if that's a theory you subscribe to), so I don’t want to imply that absolutely everyone who does it is doing so in bad faith or doesn’t have actual evidence to backup their claims, but basically no historian today would ever claim the Goths were the only reason because history does not occur in a vacuum. That being said, most of the time when I see it it does seem to be people who either have an agenda or are just repeating something they read on a random history website or something. I’ll leave it at that though since I already went into a bit more detail on this earlier on, and I’m already slightly worried I’ve injected too much non-history into this response (do forgive me if I have, this is a topic I’ve studied a lot and I try to treat it as fairly as I can). The last thing I want to say before diving back into the history is that, yes the sack of Rome probably could have been avoided because there’s always a different decision that could have been made, a different way events could have played out, etc. but that in no way means that the Romans just gave up and let it happen.             I don’t think we really need to spend very much time focused on who Alaric was, so much as what he did since the question at hand isn’t so much about him as it is the events in which he took part. As such, I’m going to give a, hopefully, brief little summary of Alaric up to 400 or so. So basically, we don’t know very much about Alaric’s early life, we know he commanded the Gothic troops under Theodosius at the Battle of the Frigidus (a battle fought against the usurper Eugenius) in 394. After Theodosius I died in 395 the Goths rebelled with Alaric at their head, though  it’s not entirely clear if he was already their chieftain by this point or if he rose to prominence during the rebellion. Some historians argue that Alaric was “King of the Goths” from this point, but I disagree because it doesn’t really make sense as it doesn’t seem like he was ever really trying to break away from the Roman Empire and at this point the Romans certainly wouldn’t have been happy with one of their subjects claiming to be a “king”. For the next two years Alaric might have been in open conflict with the Empire as a whole or he might have been under the employ of the Eastern court to harass Stilicho and the western army (there was a lot of conflict between both imperial courts at this point), but either way there weren’t any battles fought between him and any Roman army. In 397 he was appointed magister militum per Illyricum and thus was officially back in Roman empoy (which seems to be exactly what he wanted in the first place). And that takes us to where I would like to pick up the narrative for my response to this question.             But first we need to briefly revisit the Frigidus River because I think it provides a very important piece of context to explain Alaric’s initial rebellion. Even though the forces under Theodosius won the battle they still suffered heavy casualties, possibly because Theodosius ordered a head on assault that was extremely unwise. Theodosius had between 20-30,000 soldiers in this battle but Eugenius had between 35-50,000 and therefore had a pretty big advantage. The only primary source I’ve come across that mentions the Frigidus is Rufinus and he wrote: “the emperor set out, and, while drawing up his forces, shot down many of his opponents, but lost many of his barbarian allies”. Everything else I’ve read argues that Theodosius’ army was mostly Gothic allies rather than Roman citizens, which means that the heavy casualties mostly fell on the Goths. The highest number I’ve seen for Gothic casualties was 10,000, which is obviously massive. It’s possible, perhaps even likely, that Alaric expected a promotion to magister militum for his role in the battle, particularly after the heavy casualties suffered by his men, and after not receiving said promotion decided to rebel against Theodosius’ young son Arcadius (who was 18 when his father died).             Sorry, back to 397 we go. So now Alaric has the very thing that he has probably wanted for at least the last couple of years, but likely longer since we don’t actually know what he was up to before 395. The question we have to ask now, one that is very important because it offers a very good explanation for Alaric’s later choices, is why was it so important for Alaric to become magister militum? The first, and perhaps most obvious, answer is that we really cannot ever know for certain why it was important to Alaric personally, we can only speculate based on what being magister militum allowed him to do. I think Michael Kulikowski, an excellent historian of late antiquity (like seriously excellent), put it best “The sources do not make it clear whether Alaric's "desire for a generalship" was a means to legitimize himself "further within a Gothic following," or whether he was simply an ambitious man, who was at heart, "essentially a Roman soldier." Kulikowski adds that trying to determine either "depends upon our own previous assumptions, not upon the evidence." (Kulikowski, Michael (2002). "Nation versus Army: A Necessary Contrast?". In Andrew Gillett (ed.). On Barbarian Identity: Critical Approaches to Ethnicity in the Early Middle Ages. Turnhout: Brepols Publishers.69-84) And I find that he is pretty much exactly correct, our previously arrived to conclusions about Alaric and the Roman Empire influence our interpretation of his desire to become magister militum, and this certainly applies to me as well. Personally, I think Alaric wanted to become a Roman general partially because it gave him the ability to feed and clothe his people and allowed him to negotiate with the Romans for a permanent Gothic settlement, but also out of a sense of personal ambition. I think being able to feed and take care of his followers was the main factor that influenced his later rebellions against the Empire as they always came when his position was threatened or had been revoked and he settled with being brought back into Roman service.             This takes us to 399, the year Eutropius fell from power in the Eastern court. Eutropius was basically the one and only reason Alaric was magister militum in the first place, and without him Alaric’s position was threatened. The details of Eutropius’ fall aren’t all that important so I’ll be brief; in 399 a rebellion broke out in Asia Minor and the Gothic general sent to put it down joined them instead, they defeated a second Roman force and then joined forces with another Gothic general (Gainas), who then forced Arcadius to dismiss Eutropius from the consulship. This made Gainas the most powerful man in the Eastern Roman Empire, but this did not last very long. In the summer of 400 the citizens of Constantinople slaughtered the Goths stationed in the city, a large portion of Gainas’ army, and then Arcadius charged yet another Goth, Fravitta, with the campaign against Gainas. Fravitta was successful and then made consul (only to be executed  a few years later).             So now the Eastern court has dealt with two rebellious Gothic generals and begun to adopt an increasingly anti-Gothic stance, evidenced by the fact that Fravitta was executed for something he probably was not guilty of. So where does this leave our friend Alaric, the magister militum per Ilyricum, and therefore one of the highest ranking Goths left in the east? Well probably not in a very good place. His patron, so to speak, had been exiled and later executed, two prominent Goths had rebelled and the Imperial court was becoming wary of Goths, and Alaric might have already lost his position as magister militum after Eutropius’ fall from power (though we don’t know for certain). When you take all of this into account, it’s kinda easy to see why Alaric might have wanted to rebel against the Romans, his position was either threatened or had already been lost, threatening his ability to feed his followers, and anti-Gothic sentiment was on the rise in the east. I think when you really consider everything leading up to his invasion of Italy it helps contextualize it as a rebellion with the intention of regaining some kind of official position within the Roman military, rather than one with the intention of destroying (which again seems kind of ridiculous to me).	1643140009.0	hu70kfl	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu70if2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu70kfl/
wnig7	Alaric and the Sack of Rome        And now we have finally arrived at the main event, so to speak. The real reason why we’re all here. The sack of Rome and whether or not it could have been avoided (I’m kind of avoiding the idea of a “self-confident muscular policy because I’m not really sure what that would mean). So, just to reiterate quickly, this is something I’ve seen paraded around as an example of how Rome’s military was too weak to handle the various barbarian peoples of this period, and how said peoples are at fault for the collapse of the Roman Empire. When you really examine the historical record, however, this very clearly just is not the case. When it comes to Alaric, he was repulsed by Stilicho during his first invasion. Admittedly, the Roman military post-394 was definitely not as good as it was beforehand, but it is unfair to claim that it was no longer capable of defending the Empire when it still continued to do so with multiple successes. A good example of this is the 406 invasion of Italy by Radagisus (a Gothic king), whom Stilicho defeated with ease.             Anyway, back to Alaric, in 401 he invaded Italy more or less unopposed because Stilicho was busy dealing with issues in Raetia. But in 402 Stilicho was back in Italy and he fought two battles against Alaric. Now, neither of these battles really had a clear winner, but based on the available evidence it was Stilicho who managed to come out on top (even if both battles were a draw instead of an actual Roman victory). The main reason I say this is because for the next three years we have absolutely no idea what Alaric was up to, beyond the fact that Stilicho had allowed the Goths to withdraw into Pannonia. Guy Halsall argues that while the evidence itself is unclear, this withdrawal (and specifically Stilicho’s decision to let them withdraw) makes the most sense if we view it as an agreement between the two with Alaric reentering Roman service under Stilicho. Especially because it is hard to believe that either imperial court would be content to let Alaric bounce around Pannonia for three entire years without at least trying to deal with him, and that even with a sparse historical record of those years we would have at least some evidence of a conflict between the Romans and the Goths. (Barbarian Migrations, 202). This also seems plausible, likely even, when taking into account the fact that serving under Stilicho would have given Alaric the official position he had lost in the east (or felt he had to abandon for his own safety), thus giving him access to supplies for his people.             This takes us forward quite a few years to 408. In 408 things kind of fell apart a bit, Constantine III invaded Gaul from Britain and was quite successful for a while, Stilicho’s efforts to defeat him (he gave command of this campaign to a Goth named Sarus) failed, and Alaric positioned himself in Noricum, possibly so he could either join Constantine or keep him from entering Italy depending on how things worked out. Alaric then demanded 4,000 pounds of gold. Stilicho decided to take this opportunity to deal with internal issues and reassert himself as the protector of Theodosius’ line, and thus struck a deal with Alaric. He likely did this because he knew that the real threat to Roman rule was internal political and military strife rather than external barbarian threats. Nevertheless, Stiliho fell out of favor, was accused of plotting to put his own son on the throne, and subsequently executed. To make matters worse the families of Stilicho’s Gothic soldiers (most likely men recruited or pressed into Roman service from Radagaisus’ army) were slaughtered by Roman citizens, and those men promptly abandoned the Romans to join up with Alaric. This also left Alaric, once again, in a precarious position. The person who had brought him into Roman service was now dead and disgraced and anti-Gothic (and somewhat anti-barbarian in general) sentiments were rising to the surface in the west, just like what had happened in the east.             This means, at least based on the previous assumptions about his true motivations, Alaric was really left with no choice but to invade Italy yet again, and attempt to force the Romans to give him an official military command to reestablish his legitimacy. So, that’s exactly what he did. Even though Alaric ended up placing the city of Rome under siege multiple times during this occasion, I think it’s still important to note that Alaric did not set out to destroy the Roman Empire or even to take it over himself (he did raise up his own emperor but this was extremely commonplace by the 5th century). One of the main reasons I find it so hard to believe that Alaric wanted to topple the Roman Empire (or just put himself in charge), is that even he knew he could not actually take the city of Ravenna, where the emperor was currently located when he invaded Italy. Ravenna was simply too well defended and in a very good defensive location, the Goths had absolutely no chance of taking the city without inside help. That’s probably the main reason why Alaric chose Rome instead, it was still symbolically important, but taking the city did not necessarily mean much politically or militarily, not so long as Honorius remained safe and sound in Ravenna. That being said, there was one other key aspect that made Rome a good target, the senate was still there and Alaric could, and did, demand tribute from them and they could negotiate with Honorius. Now, I don’t want it to sound like I’m saying Rome wasn’t still an important city, because it absolutely was, it’s just that by 410 it was important more for symbolic and religious purposes (which can of course be important in any war), and I feel like a lot of people today who don’t study Roman history don’t know that the capital hadn’t been at Rome since 286 really. Even before Diocletian moved his capital there were many emperors in the 3rd century who ruled outside of Rome because their presence was constantly needed elsewhere.             With that out of the way’ let’s explore the final years of Alaric’s life and, most importantly, his sacking of the Eternal City. So like I said earlier, Alaric’s forces were now swelled by the Goths who joined him following Stilicho’s execution and the bloodshed that came with it. It's hard to say just how many men he had exactly by this point but it might have been close to 30,000 or so. But even with such a large force, and this was a large force for late antiquity, Alaric still had no chance of taking Ravenna, and it was nigh on impossible to besiege the city because it backed up onto the sea and had its own port and was could easily be resupplied from the east. So, with little other choice, Alaric bypassed the city and set his sights on Rome. Rome presented a much easier target than Ravenna and Alaric took the city’s port with ease in September of 408. According to Zosimus, the senate bought Alaric off with 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, 4,000 silk tunics, 3,000 scarlett covered skins, and 3,000 pounds of pepper. Zosimus might have embellished these numbers, I find that his work isn’t always the best, but nonetheless the Romans paid a hefty price to get Alaric to abandon his siege (though it’s possible that in the grand scheme of things this wasn’t actually that much money for the senatorial families).	1643140124.0	hu70vt7	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu70kfl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu70vt7/
wnig7	Nonetheless, gold and silver isn’t all that Alaric wanted, and he was still lacking the one big thing he needed, Roman recognition, and that could only come from the emperor. And this is where the Romans probably made their biggest mistake, they refused him, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First we need to make a quick detour to the imperial court itself, because around this same time there was a coup in Ravenna and Honorius’ chief advisor was replaced by a man named Jovius, who had been Alaric’s comrade in Ilryicum. Zosimus tells us that Jovius used his friendship with Alaric to convince the latter to march his men to Ravenna so that they could negotiate some kind of treaty and become Alaric. This is exactly what Alaric wanted and so he took his men to Arminum (a town not far from Ravenna), where he was met by Jovius. This is where things get…interesting, because Zosimus’ account of this meeting is quite telling:              “The demands of Alaric were ; a certain quantity of gold each year, and a quantity of corn ; and that himself and the Barbarians who were with him should inhabit both the Venetias, Noricum, and Dalmatia. Jovius, having written these demands in presence of Alaric, sent them to the emperor, with other letters which he privately conveyed to him, to advise him to appoint Alaric commander of both his armies, by which means he might be induced to relax the severity of his conditions, and make a peace on tolerably moderate terms. When the emperor received this letter, he condemned Jovius for his forward temerity, and wrote to him, telling him, that it was proper for him, as prefect of the court, and understanding what the public revenues were capable of, to assign the quantity of corn and gold, but that no dignity or command should ever be conferred on Alaric, or any of his family. When Jovius received this letter, he opened and read it in the hearing of Alaric ; who though he bore all the rest with patience, yet on finding the command denied to himself and all his family, was so enraged, that he immediately commanded his Barbarians to march to Rome with the greatest expedition, and there revenge the affront offered to him and all his family. Jovius being disappointed on seeing the emperor's unexpected letter, returned to Ravenna. Being desirous to acquit himself of all blame, he bound Honorius under several oaths never to make peace with Alaric, but to wage against him a continual war ; which be himself likewise swore by touching the head of the emperor, and caused all others who were in office to do the same.”         As is often the case with these things, it’s hard to know exactly what any of these letters said, but if nothing else Alaric’s demands seem plausible, even if they were ones that the Romans would never have accepted. Guy Halsall is of the thought that Alaric made his initial demands outrageous as an opening bargaining chip. I’m inclined to agree with this, partly because these demands were indeed outrageous, and Alaric had to know they would never be accepted, and because allowing Jovius or Honorius to talk him down to more agreeable terms would put Alaric in the position of A) getting exactly what he actually wanted and B) coming off as a man who could be reasoned with. Exactly why his original demands were ridiculous don’t really concern us so I’ll just briefly explain; in short, if the Romans gave Alaric and his allies the provinces he asked for then he would control the Alpine passes into Italy, meaning he would be in charge of defending Rome from invasion. It’s easy to see why Honorius wouldn’t want to acquiesce to those specific demands. The real problem is that Jovius included something Alaric hadn’t yet asked for, and if he was actually trying to bargain probably wouldn’t have asked for it until after he was “talked down”, being given a military command. More specifically Jovius wanted Honorius to give Alaric the title of magister utriusque militiae, the problem is that this was Stilicho’s old title and it would have made Alaric the most powerful man in the west. Even for a man like Alaric, asking to be named to such a loft position would have been a ridiculous demand, particularly considering the threat he posed to Italy and Stilicho’s very ungraceful fall from power. For this reason I think Alaric would have more likely asked to just be a magister militum in one of the provinces, a position he had already held on two different occasions. Nonetheless, Honorius, whatever his actual response, clearly was not willing to negotiate with Alaric and left Alaric with little choice but to besiege Rome for a second time.             So I think we’re really starting to see that while Alaric did pose some threat to the Roman Empire, it wasn’t quite the threat that some people would have us believe, and he was far more interested in reentering Roman service than he was in overthrowing his best hope of providing for his people. Things like this are why history can be so complicated at times, because if we only look at the surface it’s easy to believe that Alaric was an enemy of the Roman state set upon its destruction, but once we dive deeper we start to see the complexities and come to understand that whatever Alaric’s feelings towards Rome may have been, things just aren’t black and white. Anyway, with Honorius’ refusal Alaric marches back to Rome. Once again he takes the city with ease, and this time the senate agrees to work with him and together than name Priscus Attalus as Roman Emperor (by this point Alaric believed Honorius would never give him what he wanted so he created his own emperor). Priscus did indeed give Alaric everything he wanted, including military command, but a puppet emperor isn’t much use when the real emperor still holds the capital and you have no hopes of ousting him. By this point Ravenna had been reinforced by 4,000 men from the east, making an impossible siege even more impossible, North Africa was held by a man loyal to Honorius who was withholding grain shipments from Rome, a Goth named Sarus was harassing Alaric’s men (though this was more a minor nuisance than it was a real threat), and Constantine III, possibly to support Honorius, invaded Italy. In the end though the only of these factors that actually mattered was North Africa as Priscus Attalus’ forces were unable to take control of the province, and Constantine withdrew from Italy shortly after he invaded.             This all left Alaric in a precarious position, sure he had the recognition and command he wanted, but it was an empty title given to him by a man with no real power, and Rome was starving. So Alaric, ever the pragmatist, did what he felt was necessary and deposed Attalus, hoping this would please Honorius enough to bring the latter back to table. But Honorius still refused, and by this point it might be fair to say that Honorius was letting his own pride get in the way of even trying to find a basic solution to appease Alaric. This time Alaric finally decided to just take the city of Rome outright. Now I know I said earlier on in this answer that the Romans didn’t just “let them in”, and that’s still true in the technical sense, but they did open the gates for Alaric. But we have to consider that after 2 sieges that already depleted the city’s food supply in a very short timespan, and the fact that grain shipments from North Africa were being withheld, as well as the slim chance they had at actually fighting off the Goths, letting Alaric into the city was really the only choice they had, and it quickly proved to be the right one. Alaric gave orders to his men that anyone sheltering in a church was to be spared and met with no harm, now the idea of not shedding blood in holy places isn’t an old one but restraint isn’t always found among men sacking a city. So the looting itself was rather…peaceful (as far as looting goes I suppose), and despite Rome’s relative lack of political importance the city’s fall still sent a shock across the empire.            But like I said, Rome basically had no political importance at this point and taking the city did nothing to give Alaric an advantage with Honorius. The emperor still controlled Ravenna, still had no need to even think he could lose the city (and he definitely could not have), and controlled the grain supply. The rest of Alaric’s life, which ends rather soon, isn’t all that relevant here so let me just say that he decided he needed to take North Africa for himself. As such, he marched towards Sicily where he planned to cross into North Africa, but caught a fever near Brutium and died shortly thereafter. Alaric’s brother-in-law Athaulf took his place (and was likely the first actually Visigothic King), and around 412 brought the Goths back into Roman service.	1643140179.0	hu7117f	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu70vt7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu7117f/
wnig7	So really the sack of Rome in 410 just wasn’t a disaster to the scale it's presented as in the video. It wasn’t good, sure, and yes it was a shocking event throughout the Empire, but it really didn’t mean all that much in practical terms. Ravenna was still in Roman hands, wasn’t even remotely under threat or at risk of being taken, Honorius was still firmly in control of the Empire outside of the small amount of territory Alaric took (and probably never would have been able to hold), the Romans still controlled North Africa and the grain shipments. I’m still not sure what “civilizational self-confidence” is, nationalism and/or patriotism are really the only things that come to mind, and these ideas didn’t really exist as we understand them until much later. I will say that “patriotism” of a sort can be found throughout Roman history, after all dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, but I would still hesitate to use the word patriotism outright. As we’ve seen throughout this answer, the Goths weren’t really enemies of the Romans in the sense that they wanted to overthrow the Empire, this just doesn’t really make sense. We’re talking about a group of people who asked for, and received, permission to settle within the Empire, something they wanted largely for their own protection. And in the case of Alaric he continually wanted an official Roman military command, not the overthrow of the state, or even the emperor. Even his raising of Priscus Attalus to the purple was a desperate ploy to get what he wanted, a ploy he quickly abandoned when he realized it wouldn’t work. Every single time Alaric felt like he might have done something that would make Honorius negotiate with him he approached the emperor with his demands. The Goths at Adrianople rebelled largely because of how poorly they were treated by the Romans in charge of their receptio. These weren’t invaders, these weren’t people trying to replace Roman customs with their own (and the Romans already had an extremely long history of adaptability as far as culture is concerned). They served in Roman armies with Roman soldiers, they commanded Roman armies, and defended the empire from threats both internal and external. They might not have been citizens of the Roman Empire in any legal sense, but they still lived within the empire’s borders and were no more rebellious than plenty of other Roman armies commanded by Roman citizens.             Barbarians and Romans in the West        Now I know that last paragraph sounded rather…final in its tone, and I realize that this answer is already extremely long (I believe this makes 14 pages) but I have far too much free time so why not continue frankly. In addition, it wouldn’t really be fair of me to discuss only one group of peoples who moved into the Roman Empire during this period, especially as that might give off the perception that I’m leaving out other groups to make myself sound more correct (if that makes sense). Therefore, I would also like to discuss a few other tribal groups who migrated into the Roman Empire, with particular focus on the Franks, Vandals, Sueves, and Alans. I think the Vandals, Sueves, and Alans are particularly important for this question because their entrance into the empire was much closer to what I would describe as an “invasion”, so it helps to provide an opposite example, so to speak.             I’m going to start with the Franks because they’ll be the easiest/simplest group to go over. So the Franks weren’t actually one group of people, they were a confederation of multiple tribes that lived near the mouth of the Rhine and along the river as far south as Worms. The Frankish confederation probably consisted of several tribes who were well known to the Romans before the third century (the Franks are first mentioned in the third century). The Chamavi, Chattori, Ssicambri, Bructuari, and the Chatti. There were also other confederations like the Alamanni, as the Romans had a habit of treating these groups as if they were one big group rather than several tribes united in one confederation, anyway like I said we’re going to focus on the Franks here.               The Frankish settlement within the Roman Empire was noticeably different from that of the Goths in a few ways, some of which is perhaps even a little ironic. To start, the Franks had been in conflict with the Romans since at least 260 (presumably even earlier than this but the first mention of them we have is dated to this period). In 260 a group of Franks made it as far as Tarragona in Spain, and were able to remain there for a decade before the Romans were able to expel them. Anyway, the earliest Franks in the Roman Empire were classified as laeti or dediticii, two different social classes applying to non-Romans living within the Roman Empire. The laeti were “allies” of a sort, they were peoples who were required to supply troops for the military in exchange for land to settle on, presumably in higher numbers than other groups subject to Roman conscription. It’s not clear where the term laeti actually comes from, some historians have argued that it was simply a term to describe groups of conquered peoples that were settled in Roman provinces, while others, such as Patricia Southern, are of the belief that the word actually has a Germanic root and refers to people who are “half-free”. The fact that most laeti in the military seem to have served under Roman commanders in non-ethnic units reinforces the latter origin in my mind, as foederati often had their own units and commanders but the laeti also had some level of freedom.             Dediticii, on the other hand, were a conquered people who still retained individual freedoms (so they were not slaves) but effectively no longer existed as a political unit and were excluded from the universal citizenship provided by the Constitutio Antoniniana. These were people that were conquered by the Romans as a result of a deditio, an unconditional surrender, which explains why they had less rights than laeti or foederati. I also want to note that I believe deditio didn’t necessarily have to be conquered militarily, I think they could also be people who surrendered unconditionally to avoid coming into conflict with the Romans, though I could be mistaken about that as it isn’t something I’ve studied specifically. Anyway, some of the Franks in the Roman Empire during the late third century fell into this class as well, though I’ve never seen anyone try to put forth any kind of estimation as to how many were laeti vs dediticii, and it’s probably not even possible to answer that question in the first place.	1643140202.0	hu713kb	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu7117f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu713kb/
wnig7	So this is the first striking difference between how the Franks were brought into the Roman Empire compared to the Goths. Around 287/8 Maximian forced a group of Franks to surrender without a fight (likely making them dediticii), in 288 he also defeated some Salian Franks, Chamavi, and Frisii and forcibly settled them in Germania Inferior to provide soldiers for the military and to prevent other tribes from settling along the Rhine. Constantius I, father of Constantine, defeated another group of Franks in 292 and settled them in Toxandria (northern Belgium/southern Netherlands). The Romans continued to settle groups of Franks along the Rhine border partly because Franks on the other side of the Rhine were frequently launching raids into the empire. The Goths, on the other hand, were probably admitted as foederati by Valens, and based on the fact that they often had their own military units commanded by fellow Goths (like Alaric) after the Gothic War (376-382), it seems probable that Theodosius allowed them to keep their status as foederati, if nothing else they definitely were not treated as a conquered people.             This is where the irony kicks in, if you want to view it that way, because as we’ve already seen, the Gothic receptio was mismanaged in pretty much the worst way possible, anything that could have gone wrong did go wrong. This, of course, led to the Goths rebelling against Roman rule and a six year war. The Frankish transition from free peoples to Roman subjects was far smoother. Granted, this is probably to be expected as most of the Franks were forcibly settled after the Romans defeated them in battle, whereas the Goths were given a treaty to settle within the empire. The Franks quickly took to their role of defending the Rhine against barbarian incursions, even if they weren’t always successful (which we’ll get to).             Anyway, this brings me back to my larger point of “invasion vs migration”, now obviously in the case of the Franks their settlement was really a migration so much as they were forced to leave their homes, and groups of Franks did launch numerous raids into Roman territory, but again none of these groups were set upon the destruction of the Roman Empire and the Franks who were settled along the Rhine were staunch defenders of the Roman Empire. In fact, in the case of the Franks, many of them were content with their status within  Roman society. For example, one Frankish soldier serving in the Roman military left behind an inscription that reads Francus ego cives, Romanus miles in armis, which translates to “I am a Frankish citizen, but a Roman soldier under arms”. So while this man, and presumably many men like him, retained his sense of a Frankish ethnic identity, he also self-identified as a Roman soldier. These were people who successfully juggled two separate identities without letting either one come into conflict with the other, they were both Franks and Romans.            There’s also evidence that some Franks, and other non-Romans, actually considered themselves to be more Roman than Frankish. In 355 the magister peditum Silvanus was tasked with driving some Alamanni out of Gaul and back across the Rhine. Not only was Silvanus a general in his own right, but his father, Bonitus, was the first ever Frank promoted to the rank of magister militum and had served under Constantine I, so was part of an established Frankish-Roman military family. Anyway, sometime after he was sent to Gaul some of his friends, who were also officials within the imperial court, presented Constantius II with fake letters that made it look like Silvanus was contemplating taking the throne for himself, or so Ammianus tells us. Silvanus contemplated crossing into Frankish territory to ask them for protection and instead chose to proclaim himself as emperor. “\[Silvanus\] Knowing the sensitive disposition of the fickle emperor…thought of throwing himself upon the mercy of the barbarians. He was prevented from doing so by Laniogaisus…Laniogaisus warned Silvanus that his fellow countrymen the Franks would either kill him or take a bribe to betray him.. So Silvanus…seized as a makeshift the purple which adorned the banners and standards of the troops, and assumed the imperial power.” (Ammianus MArcellinus, The Later Roman Empire, 15.5)  Based on Ammianus’ account it would seem that even though Silvanus himself was a Frank, those Franks still living east of the Rhine might not have viewed him as a fellow Frank but instead as a Roman, or at least his ethnic identity would not have mattered enough to them for them to not kill him if they had enough incentive to do so. So instead of choosing his fellow “countrymen”, Silvanus chose the Romans, and chose to name himself as emperor.             Ammianus was also a firsthand witness to Silvanus’ death as he was one of the officers that accompanied the general who was sent to deal with Silvanus (who was butchered by his own men on his way to a church service), and so he most likely met Silvanus in person before the latter’s murder. This is important because it adds credence to Ammianus' story, and also because the story itself has an interesting characteristic, or should I say it lacks something. Despite Silvanus being a barbarian and a usurper, and despite the fact that Ammianus played a direct role in his death, he is depicted sympathetically. Ammianus paints the picture of a Roman soldier, emphasis on Roman here, who was nothing more than the unfortunate victim of court politics, albeit one that had to face the consequences of his actions. Ammianus could have chosen to describe Silvanus as a foreign entity, one who didn’t really fit into the Roman world or shouldn’t have been given such a lofty command in the first place, which is something he did in other cases. And, as we saw earlier, Ammianus didn’t exactly hold non-Romans in general in very high regard, but his account of Silvanus’ usurpation implies that he at least respected Silvanus as a Roman commander who simply happened to be a Frank ethically. I think this is important for this question because it shows, as do the careers of men like Stilicho and Arbogast, that not only did these people who were ethnically not Roman view themselves either as partly or entirely Roman via their military service, it shows that in some cases even ethnic Romans like Ammianus viewed them that way as well. They weren’t seen as invaders seeking out the downfall of the Roman Empire, at least not all of them were seen this way, in some cases they weren’t even viewed as second class citizens but as Romans. These were people who spent their entire military careers serving Rome and defending its interests. Sure there are plenty of cases of non-Roman leaders and soldiers rebelling, but usually they had a reason to do so, and there were also plenty of Roman generals doing the exact same thing.	1643140221.0	hu715gn	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu713kb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu715gn/
wnig7	Vandals, Suebi, and Alans and the Invasion of 405/6        But for now, this is where we take our leave of the Franks, though not completely, and set our sights on another group of Barbarians, one that is a more eclectic grouping of peoples than the Frankish confederation. That being the Vandals, Suebi, and Alans who crossed the Rhine into the Roman Empire in either 405 or 406. The popular account of this is that on December 31, 406 the Rhine froze solid and allowed a large number of Vandals, Suebi, and Alans to cross into northern Gaul. There aren’t any contemporary sources that claim the Rhine was frozen solid at this time, and while that would have made crossing the river quite easy, it is also possible that this coalition of tribes used boats or Roman bridges to cross into Gaul. As for the uncertainty of the year in which this crossing occurred, I believe the only written reference to 406 is from Prosper of Aquitaine “"In the sixth consulship of Arcadius and Probus, Vandals and Alans came into the Gauls, having crossed the Rhine, on the day before the kalends of January." (Kalends being the first day of the month on the Roman calendar) Michael Kulikowski argues that it should actually be dated to December 31, 405 because Prosper chose the year 406 to make the chronology of his chronicle flow better for contemporary audiences. Of course, this doesn’t actually have any real impact on what we’re looking at but I always think it’s interesting how such significant events can be dated differently depending on different sources, and I will likely be referring to it as having occurred in 405/6 so I wanted to explain why briefly.            Like I said earlier, the crossing of the Rhine by the Vandals, Suebi, and Alans is much closer to an actual invasion to the point I wouldn’t necessarily argue against calling it an invasion, though I would still argue that “invasion” is not a perfect fit for this event. To start, the reason I’m more comfortable with using “invasion” to describe the 405/6 crossing of the Rhine is because the Vandals, Suebi, and Alans did not ask for permission to enter the Roman Empire like the Goths had, they crossed the river and came into immediate conflict with the Franks, and then pillaged northern Gaul, before setting up their own kingdoms in Hispania (and of course they eventually conquered North Africa). Whereas the Goths had clear intentions on becoming subjects of the Roman Empire, these peoples seemed intent on carving out their own realms rather than submitting to Roman authority. That being said, when you examine the overall state of affairs inside the Roman Empire and in the frontier regions just past the Rhine (and other places) at this point you’ll find that these were people who existed in a very precarious situation with few options available to them.             To really examine this we have to jump back in time for a little bit (hence why I broke this up into sections to hopefully avoid any confusion), and look at the relationship between the Roman Empire and the barbarians who lived along the Roman frontier. So for this I will be using Guy Halsall’s Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, because he has a rather detailed discussion of the importance of Roman material culture to tribes beyond the Rhine. Halsall makes the argument, based largely on archeological findings, that by the time of late antiquity barbarian kingship in the trans-Rhenan societies was underpinned by Roman symbolism and material culture. Kingship for the tribal groups, especially those in close contact with the Romans, heavily depended on Roman material goods as a sign of one’s power and status in their own society.             To this end, Roman artifacts were often used in a ritual context to convey this. These artifacts could, and often did, come in the form of booty brought back from raids, but just as often it was acquired via trade with the Romans. Of course, warfare (again through raiding) against the Romans could also bring its own form of prestige on top of the material wealth it could provide, but sometimes these raids were also used to secure better trade gifts from the Romans. For example, Halsall mentions an event in 364 when a group of Alamanni raided the empire to protest what they believed were inferior gifts from Valentinian I. In fact this story comes to us from Ammianus who recorded the raid and the reasons behind it in his res gestae:         “The Alamanni violated the German frontier. The reason for their exceptional hostility was that the envoys whom they sent to Roman headquarters to receive regular gifts that they had come to expect were fobbed off with smaller and cheaper presents, which they thought unworth of them of threw away in a rage…they went home with an exaggerated account of the matter and roused their savage countrymen to revenge the insulting treatment they had received.” (Ammianus Marcellinus, History, 26.5)        Ammianus’ accounting of this event shows that these gifts weren’t a one off or occasional thing, they were a regular tribute that the Romans used not only to placate the tribes living in the frontier regions, but also to control who was or wasn’t in power. The fact that so many different peoples were so reliant on some kind of relationship with the Romans to secure their own place atop the hierarchy of the local tribes means that the Romans almost always had some sway over who was in charge, meaning they could ensure that the leader of, for example, the Alamanns was someone friendly to Rome. In fact, it seems that the idea of barbarian kingship (though they might not have been kings as we understand the term), was so closely tied to the status and power conferred onto these leaders by a connection to Rome that Halsall believes it was possible that none of the groups between the Baltic Sea and the Rhine even had their own original idea of kingship. Instead their entire political structure may have been based entirely on the Roman system, each with its own local flavor perhaps. That being said, I’m not very familiar with the archeological record beyond the Rhine so I’m relying almost entirely on Halsall’s work for this, and I cannot comment on what the current consensus is compared to when Halsall was writing his book. Nonetheless I believe it provides a good examination of how societies beyond the Rhine functioned and why the Roman presence in this region was so important throughout late antiquity.	1643140242.0	hu717h3	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu715gn	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu717h3/
wnig7	With that out of the way we can make our way back to the “great invasion” (as Halsall calls it) of 405/6. So the reason that I felt the need to explain the extensive relationship between the Romans and the people living beyond the Rhine is because this relationship sets the stage for what we’re about to discuss. So like I said before, the Vandals, Suebi, and Alans were in a difficult position by the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. There were two main reasons for this, the presence of the Huns and the diminished Roman presence along the frontier areas, though just how diminished the Roman presence was may depend on how you define “Roman” as the Franks were still defending the Rhine as Roman subjects. Nonetheless, Stilicho had likely been pulling troops away from the Rhine border for years by this point to deal with several internal threats (including Alaric and Radagaisus) and a potential conflict with the east. This not only meant that the Romans could no longer be relied upon for providing gifts and trade that would prop up individual tribes and/or kings, it created a power vacuum beyond the frontier regions. People who had previously relied on a relationship with Rome and the status provided by Roman goods/wealth very suddenly found themselves without access to these goods, and just as suddenly there was a new major power in the region in the form of the Huns. In fact Radagaisus’ invasion of 405 was likely a response to this new dynamic beyond the Roman borders. In addition as the previous hierarchy fell into turmoil and tribes/kings fell from power (or at least rapidly lost their influence over their neighbors), many of these groups may have turned to the Huns as the new source of power.             So where does this leave our current subjects? Well, let’s start with the Alans. And just as a quick aside most of the background information for the Vandals, Alans, and Suebis will be coming from Walter Goffarts’ Barbarian Tides: The Migration Age and the Later Roman Empire, like Hallsall, Goffart is an excellent historian of late antiquity and non-Roman peoples (Barbarian Tides is a sequel/revised version of Goffarts’ earlier book Barbarians and Romans A.D. 418-584). The Alans actually aren’t a Germanic people at all, as I said way back in the beginning of this answer, the Alans were an Iranian people who originally lived near the Don River. The Romans had known about the Alans since at least the 1st century, when they settled in the Black Sea region and launched multiple raids against the Romans and Parthians, but by the 3rd century the Goths had broken their hold over the Pontic Steppe (though it seems the Goths adopted some parts of Alani culture such as heavy cavalry). Around 370 the Huns attacked the Don Alans and killed a large portion of them, Ammianus says they then made a “pact of friendship” with the survivors, this may have been an alliance or the Alans became Hunnic “subjects” of some sort. It was these Alans, together with the Huns, who pushed the Greuthungi Goths out of their territory. In fact, we’ve already met an Alan in this answer, when discussing the Goths. When the Greuthungi crossed the Danube one of their leaders, if you’ll recall, was a man named Alatheus. Based on Alatheus’ name he was quite possibly an Alan, and we know that there were Alans with the Greuthungi when they crossed into the Roman Empire. The Alans continued to splinter at this point, some fought for Rome (including at Adrianople), some remained with the Huns, some joined the Goths, and others still joined the Vandals and Suebi. In fact, despite their Iranian origins and heritage, many Alans in the 4th century were culturally Gothic, or they had at least become “Gothicized” and adopted many aspects of Gothic culture just as the Goths had previously adopted some aspects of Alani culture.              While we have a good deal of information about the origins of the Alans and some of their early interactions with Rome, and even their service for and against the Romans in various wars and battles, we basically have absolutely no idea which group or groups of Alans actually made up the Alan contingent of the Rhine crossing in 405/6. Some historians believed this particular group of Alans was actually an alliance of Huns, Goths, and Alans who had all fought together against the Romans at Adrianople in 378, and then eventually settled as foederati in Pannonia, but Peter Heather refuted this idea. Goffart seemingly agrees that the Alans in question were not associated with the Goths at Adrianople (though there were Alans present), but also says that this leaves us with no firm scholarly opinion of who these Alans actually were. He does, however, propose an idea that is rather tenuous and without firm evidence to support it (though there is some that can be expanded upon), he says that these Alans might be the same ones Orosius refers to in his Seven Books of History Against the Pagans; “I say nothing of the many internecine conflicts between the barbarians themselves, when two divisions of the Goths, and then the Alans and Huns, destroyed one another in mutual slaughter.” (Paulus Orosius, Seven Books of History Against the Pagans 7.37.3) As you can see, this is pretty much nothing, a mere sentence in an entire historical text, one that isn’t even dated (though if Orosius was writing in order then this event took place between 402 and 405), which means the idea that these Alans were the ones who led the Rhine crossing is pure conjecture, which even Goffart admits. That being said, it is an idea that Goffart entertains because A) the other explanations don’t really seem to hold up well and B) despite the lack of evidence it is possible. It’s possible that the group of Alans Orosius is referring to migrated back across the Danube around the time the Vandals et al. were migrating towards the Rhine. Goffart postulates that this would help explain why the Alans were the de facto leaders of the Rhine crossing, because they were Roman veterans and were thus capable leaders of such a large group of mixed ethnicities. He also speculates that if these same Alans are indeed the Alans in question then they could have, and certainly would have needed to, reinforced their limited numbers by recruiting Sarmatians (a related people) still living on the Danubian steppes, as well as Don Alans. Whatever specific group, or groups, of Alans comprised the bulk of the Alani peoples that crossed the Rhine we do know that they were more or less in charge because they were the strongest group present militarily speaking.	1643140262.0	hu719l4	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu717h3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu719l4/
wnig7	Far less is known about the origins of the Vandals than the Alans, in fact most of what we have from Roman sources are total fabrications from Procopius and Jordannes. There 2 distinct groups of Vandals that are mentioned in Roman sources are the Hadsingi and the Silingi, the Hasdingi are the most well attested as they assisted the Romans in the Marcomanni Wars during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The Hasding Vandals are the ones who went on to establish a kingdom in North Africa. There is also no evidence to suggest that the two groups of Vandals had any kind of alliance to one another, nor do we know why the Silingi chose to join the Hasdingi and cross the Rhine, though evidence suggests that the Silingi were the larger group at the time. The only major event involving the Vandals that we’re sure of and is relevant to this discussion is their invasion of Raetia in 401, as told to us by Stilicho’s personal poet Claudian:        Now had the peoples broken their treaties and, encouraged by the news of Latium's trouble, had seized upon the glades of Vindelicia and the fields of Noricum. Like slaves whom news of their master's death lures into luxury with an idle tale, if mid the debauch and while wild licence riots with wine and dance some unexpected chance bring back their lord, then they stand panic-stricken and, abhorring liberty, servile terror shakes their guilty souls; so all the rebels were struck with terror at the sight of the general and in one man the Emperor, Latium and all Rome blazed before their eyes… "Put ye such faith," he cried, "in Getic arms? Is it they that swell your hearts with empty pride? Fate has not brought Rome's name so low that she cannot punish your rebellion with but a handful of her forces. Not to delay you with foreign tales, hear this example from your deeds of old. When warlike Hannibal was spreading destruction throughout the cities of Italy, and Cannae had doubled Trebia's cruel losses, a vain hope drove Philip of Macedon to turn his feeble sword against a people which, as he thought, was in difficulties. The monstrous insult roused the Roman Fathers, although more pressing dangers were crowding upon them, and they took it ill that, while two great cities were disputing the mastery of the world, a lesser race should be insolent. They determine upon instant vengeance and command Laevinus, even while he conducts the war with Carthage, to do battle also with the king of Macedonia. The consul obeyed his orders, and Philip, intruding his feeble arms between mighty nations, was routed by a passing band and learned that it does not do to tempt the anger of power­ful peoples even when they are in distress.” With this warning Stilicho alike checked the threatened war and won new allies for war, enrolling them at their entreaty and setting such number to their forces as should best suit — neither a burden to Italy nor a terror to its lord. (Claudian, De Bello Gothico)    Now, it is clear that Claudian doesn’t actually name the peoples who overran Raetia, but, as Goffart concludes, his mentioning of Noricum by name is enough information to conclude that it was the Vandals and not the Alamanni. Claudian also implies that the reason the Vandals disregarded their treaties with Rome, presumably they were foederati of some sort, is that they were inspired by Alaric’s invasion of Italy (indeed this Vandalic incursion is why Stilicho’s army was not in position to repel Alaric in 401), and presumably they sought to join up with Alaric’s forces. But Stilicho was able to repel the Vandals and they crossed back into their own territory, setting the stage for their later Rhine crossing. Claudian also indicates that Stilicho was able to recruit at least some of the Vandals into his own army. The poem also implies that the Vandals were mostly pacified because of Stilicho’s threats, and presumably Roman reinforcements, and there may have just been a few small skirmishes before the Vandals retreated back across the Danube. This would also explain why there was still a large number of Vandals present in the coalition that crossed the Rhine into Gaul a few years later.         That leaves us now with the Suebi. Unlike the Vandals and the Alans, the Suebi were a rather large, and somewhat loose, group of related peoples who occupied a large portion of Germania (particularly the middle-Danube region), as told to us by Tacitus in his Germania,  “We have now to speak of the Suevi; who do not compose a single state, like the Catti or Tencteri, but occupy the greatest part of Germany, and are still distributed into different names and nations, although all hearing the common appellation of Suevi.” (Tacitus, Germania, 1.38.207) So here we have a Roman author stating that the name Suevi is a rather generic one that applies to a large grouping of different peoples, many of whom had been known to the Romans since at least Caesar’s war against the Gauls. Caesar, who fought the Suevic kings Ariovistus, described the Suevi as the “largest and most warlike nation of all the Germans” (Julius Caesar, De Bello Gallico, Book IV, sections 1-3, and 19; Book VI, section 10) While Caesar’s account of his time in Gaul is certainly embellished in places, it is somewhat reasonable to accept that the Suebi were a large group, especially since the term applies to a large number of different tribes. Also, just to clear up any potential confusion, Suebi can also be spelled “Suevi”, I prefer Suebi clearly but both terms are acceptable and refer to the same group.        Goffart believes that the Suebi were likely the smallest part of the Rhine crossing, which seems somewhat likely as there were still a large number of Suebi in the Danube region into the 6th century. We don’t know specifically which Suebic peoples accompanied the Vandals and Alans across the Rhine, but it’s possible that it was the Marcomanni and Quadi as both disappear from the historical record following this event. Furthermore, Paulus Orosius mentions that they “rose in rebellion” alongside the Sarmatians, Vandals, and Suebi. Though take note that he specifically mentions the Marcomanni and Quadi separately from the Suebi. In addition, when he discusses the crossing of the Rhine, he only mentions the Vandals, Alans, and Suebi by name and simply alludes that many others were with them. It is, of course, possible , probably even likely, that individuals from other tribes/groups made up the force that crossed into Gaul, but if so they were probably in very small numbers. I think the fact that the only kingdoms that popped up in Spain in the 5th century were Vandalic, Alani, and Suebic reinforces the idea that any other groups who crossed the Rhine in 405/6 did so in numbers far too small to be of any note in these new realms.	1643140288.0	hu71c3s	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu719l4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu71c3s/
wnig7	So it was these three peoples who crossed the Rhine into Gaul in 405/6 and pillaged northern Gaul. A lot of people like to believe the story of the Rhine freezing solid on December 31, allowing the barbarians to easily cross into Roman territory. I find this to be rather unlikely, no contemporary sources mention the Rhine freezing solid, and it just seems like too convenient of an explanation for why the border was so “easy” to cross. Michael Kulikowski traces the myth of the Rhine being frozen back to Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, though to be fair to Gibbon, he merely stated it was a possibility rather than the definitive explanation. Nonetheless, the idea that the Vandals, Alans, and Suebi were only able to cross the Rhine because it had frozen solid feels more like a holdover of the Roman beliefs that non-Romans were…less than competent. It just seems more likely that they were able to cross either by using boats, or by crossing over bridges built by the Romans. In addition, there’s really no need to explain away the “ease” with which they crossed the river, because it wasn’t easy. While the Roman presence along the Rhine was likely diminished, perhaps even nonexistent, due to the invasions of Radagaisus and Alaric, the Roman side of the river was still defended by Franks and Alamanni. In fact, at a battle, which was probably fought near Mainz, the Franks initially turned back the Vandals. It wasn’t until the Alans turned back to help that the Vandals were able to get past the Franks, but the Vandals still lost several thousand men and their king Godisgel was killed as well.         In addition, the defenders of the Rhine were actually joined by a group of Alans led by Goar, these particular Alans were Roman veterans (quite possibly the ones that had been mentioned by Orosius), and they may have felt overshadowed by the larger presence of their Alani cousins weren’t military veterans. It stands to reason that up to this point these particular Alans had probably led the way across the Rhine, but decided to join the Roman side when the opportunity, or birbe, presented itself. This is further evidence, in my mind, that many of these people were looking to live within Roman territory rather than taking it outright. The fact that the Vandals, Alans, and Suebi were able to make it so far into Roman territory and establish their own independent/semi-independent kingdoms seems as if it was a happy accident more than a concrete plan that was formulated before they crossed the Rhine, and even that took several years.         It was at this point that the Rhine crossers began to pillage much of northern Gaul, now completely bereft of Roman defenses. But northern Gaul is where they likely stayed for the next two years. This is at least partially due to the efforts of Constantine III, usurper and the last of the British emperors, who crossed into Gaul with his army and defeated the Vandals, Alans, and Suebi at a large battle. He was, however, unable to kill their leaders or give chase once they fled because he was forced to turn his attention to another Roman army that had been sent by Stilicho to eliminate him. Constantine III was able to defeat this army in the long run and then sent his son Constans to take Spain, this gave Constantine III control of much of Gaul and Spain. But shortly after Spain was taken, one of Constantines’ generals, Gerontius, rebelled and declared a man named Maximus as emperor (seriously the political situation of the late Roman Empire was insane). Gerontius then sent out a call for support from the barbarians. There’s no proof that this call was answered by the Alans, Vandals, and Suebi, but several historians believe it was them, and that this is the reason they finally left Gaul (and at this point they were likely still bottled up in northern Gaul by Constantine) and crossed the Pyrenees into Spain, seemingly against the wishes of Maximus and Gerontius.         So now we have a group of barbarians that crossed the Rhine, in an effort to settle in Roman territory, possibly answering the call of a Roman general and entering Roman service. A tale that we have seen repeated over and over again by this point. In fact, Goffart goes so far as to say that Rome’s growing acceptance of non-Roman soldiers, and decreased reluctance of allowed barbarian migrations (evidenced by the admission of the Goths), may be what inspired the Vandals and others to cross into the Roman Empire. It’s hard to say for certain as these peoples didn’t really leave behind any written evidence as to what their motives were, but based on the fact that they repeatedly found themselves in Roman service at least implies that this was a more than acceptable outcome to them, and that establishing independent kingdoms within Roman territory probably wasn’t ever a goal until they found themselves in control of large parts of Spain, with little to no opposition from the Romans.         In fact, despite basically being kingdoms ruled by kings, some historians believe that the Alans, Vandals, and Suebi were actually foederati, perhaps having been given land by Gerontius and Maximus. Though there is little evidence to support this idea, it is possible that Maximus made some kind of deal with them, though the Roman government in Ravenna almost certainly did not. Nonetheless, these were peoples living in kingdoms and being ruled by kings at this point, Roman recognition or no. Anyway this is mostly conjecture, but something I wanted to touch on briefly.	1643140306.0	hu71dok	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu71c3s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu71dok/
wnig7	“Post”-Roman Kingdoms and the Visigoths    It’s at this point that our old friend the Goths rejoin the story. So the Goths, who I will be referring to as “Visigoths” from this point forward, hadn’t been up to much since Alaric’s death. The Goths, now led by Athaullf, left Italy in 412 and pledged their support to Jovinus, yet another usurper in northern Gaul. Jovinus was also supported by some Alans and Burgundians. Unfortunately for Jovinus, this alliance was short lived and resulted in his death. Shortly after Athaulf joined Jovinus they were joined by another group of Goths, this one commanded by Sarus. Sarus, however, was an old enemy of Alaric, and the two had never really cared for one another, this extended to Athaulf and who promptly slaughtered Sarus and his men. It’s at this point that it becomes clear that Athaulf viewed Jovinus as nothing more than a puppet, and was only seeking some form of imperial recognition like Alaric (Jovinus’ other barbarian allies were likely fighting in return for settlement in northern Gaul). The final straw that ended this alliance was Jovinus’ decision to name his own brother as his co-emperor, apparently he did so without Athaulf’s permission and so Athaulf switched sides, captured Jovinus and his brother, and turned them both over to the Romans. Both men were executed and their heads were sent back to Ravenna to be displayed alongside Constantine’s. Despite handing Jovinus over to the Romans, this did not improve Athaulf’s standing with the emperor. The Visigoths took Narbonne but it was quickly blockaded by one Constantius, one of Honorius’ consuls, and the Visigoths were forced to flee into Spain and settled in Tarraconensis.        In 415 Athaulf was murdered, the details of which are not pertinent to us, and he was succeeded by Wallia. By the end of his four year reign Wallia proved to be an effective king and military commander. It was also under the kingship of Wallia that the Goths reentered Roman service, yet again. In 417, or perhaps a little earlier, Wallia and the Goths were settled in Aquitaine as foederati by Honorius. The Romans then quickly turned the Goths loose on the rest of the barbarians occupying Spain, and they were quite successful. This combined Roman-Visigothic army nearly wiped out both the Siling Vandals and the Alans, both of whom fled north to take refuge with the Hasdingi Vandals (whose kings were, from then on, styled as King of the Vandals and Alans). After these victories, Constantius, for some reason, chose to withdraw and gave the Goths land in Aquitaine. Wallia was already dead at this point, and his successor Theodoric I ruled the Visigoths from Toulouse.         In regards to this settlement in Aquitaine, and to explain why Constantius ended the campaign in Spain, several historians have speculated as to why this was done. Some argue that Constantius wanted to play the Visigoths, Suebi, and Vandals against one another so that neither could grow too strong, hence why he stopped his campaign instead of fighting the latter two groups directly. They also claim that he chose to settle the Visigoths in Aquitaine because it put them in a good position to fight off any invasions from Spain. Others believe it may have been because of threats from northern Gaul, like Saxon raiders. Halsall, however, disagrees with these ideas. He argues that the Romans were acting from a position of strength when they moved the Visigoths back to Aquitaine, whereas others believe the Romans and Visigoths were equal partners at this point. We really only have one primary source of these particular events, Philostorgius who was using Olympiodorus as his source (Olympiodorus was a contemporary to these events and wrote his history two decades before Philostorgius), and Halsall argues that Philostorgius was too far removed from Olympiodorus’ writings to really understand the political context of the Visigothic settlement. Several historians, such as J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz, believed that this settlement was a permanent one, this belief stems from the later settlements of the Burgundians, in the 440s, as a defensive line to protect southern Gaul (it’s possible that by this point the Romans had temporarily laid aside the idea of retaking northern Gaul). But the political situation of the 440s was not the same as it was two decades earlier, particularly the fact that the Romans had just successfully destroyed two non-Roman kingdoms in Spain with relative ease. Instead, it’s better to view this settlement of the Visigoths as a temporary measure that became permanent due to later circumstances, rather than saying it was intended to be permanent because that’s what it ended up being. It’s entirely possible that the Romans had intended to remove the Visigoths from Aquitaine to settle them, permanently this time, in northern Gaul after they re-established Roman control over the region, but because that never came to fruition the Visigoths had to remain in Aquitaine instead.	1643140342.0	hu71h85	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu71dok	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu71h85/
wnig7	The reason I say all of this, and honestly there’s so much more that could be said just about this one settlement, is because it shows that the Visigoths were still, undoubtedly, Roman subjects at this point in time, and that the Romans still had the upper hand in the relationship. People often claim that the Roman military had become ineffectual by the early 5th century, but I think the campaign in Spain and their dealings with the Visigoths demonstrate that while the Roman military had certainly become weaker over time, it was far from ineffectual. The Visigoths might have been ruled by a king already by this point, and that certainly made their existence within the Roman Empire a unique one, but they were not an independent, or even semi-independent, kingdom yet. Theodoric I was effectively a king in name only, and still answered to the Romans. In fact this remained the status quo for several decades, even as the Roman Empire continued to lose power in the west. It was until the reign of King Euric (a son of Theodoric I), that the Visigoths rebelled against Roman rule and established themselves as a truly independent realm, conquering most of southwest Gaul, and most of the Iberian peninsula.     So again, just like it was with Alaric, the Visigoths’ weren’t particularly interested in overthrowing or destroying the Roman empire, they wanted Roman recognition and land to settle on, and they got exactly that in the long run. I feel like some people who only have a surface level understanding of Roman history look at all of the non-Roman kingdoms that popped up in the 5th century in former Roman territory and just kind of assume “oh well the Vandals, Franks, and Visigoths, must have destroyed the Roman empire.” But that simply isn’t true, yes the Vandals did end up conquering Roman territory twice (and the loss of North Africa was definitely devastating), but it’s hard to believe that was ever their original plan all the way back in 405/6. The Franks dutifully defended the Rhine for over a century and only really became hostile to the Romans during the reign of Justinian when they tried to conquer Italy during the Gothic War. The Visigoths remained Roman subjects until the Romans were too weak to stop them from rebelling in the late 460s, by which point it hardly even mattered anymore. That’s not to say, of course, that these peoples didn't play a role in the downfall of the empire in the west and its transition into the “Germanic” kingdoms of western Europe, because they absolutely did, but they weren’t the cause. There was a lot going on by that point, and by 476 the Romans really only had control over Italy, and the Roman Emperor in the west effectively had no real power anymore.         I know we’ve stopped short of the actual fall of the Roman Empire, but that is honestly an entirely different answer in its own right and I don’t want to get into that here. I will say that I know I’ve left the Huns out of my discussion for the most part, but I think they are an obvious exception to what I’ve been discussing. So just allow me to briefly say this, the Huns were out to conquer and expand their empire, they had a much more concrete idea of kingship compared to the various groups who migrated into the Roman Empire. The Huns under Atilla were absolutely interested in conquering the Roman Empire, and were in a decent position to do so had they not been stopped by the combined Roman-Gothic army at Chalons in 451. That being said, the Huns aren’t anymore responsible for the collapse of the western Roman Empire than the Goths and Vandals, and were but one factor in a complex series of events that played out over the course of two and a half centuries.         This response has kind of gotten out of hand, another reason I'm stopping it here, but this brings us back to the beginning of my answer. The Romans were not a bunch of pushovers who “allowed” barbarians to bully them into submission. The Romans maintained the upper hand in this relationship for decades even after the Battle of Adrianople. There wasn’t some kind of collapse of Roman “self-confidence”, certainly not on a civilizational scale anyway. And while the 410 sack of Rome could have been prevented, it was not nearly as disastrous as some like to believe, and even with the later sack of 455 the severity of that event is still debated. The Roman Empire in the west “fell”, from a combination of internal issues that eventually just could not become overcome as the Roman state gradually weakened over time. But no, the Romans, in no way, shape, or form, “allowed” their empire to collapse around them. As we’ve seen throughout the course of this, admittedly long winded, answer, they fought back at every step, fought off invaders, incorporated numerous barbarians into the imperial hierarchy, and adapted to situations as best they could (well sometimes anyway, nobody is perfect after all). The decline of the Roman Empire was a very complex event that can not, and therefore should not, be boiled down or simplified to any one reason, particularly not “they let it happen”. I know this answer is probably way too long, but late antiquity, and particularly the events in question, is a period that I have spent a lot of time and energy studying and I can get quite passionate when I see it being boiled down into such a simplistic view. That being said, I hope you find this to be an adequate answer to your question. As always, I’m going to include a list of sources, including some I didn’t actually use for my answer but are still good for anyone who wants to study late antiquity in greater detail.	1643140390.0	hu71lu8	t3_rrfiaz	t1_hu71h85	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rrfiaz/did_the_5thcentury_western_roman_empire_have_a/hu71lu8/

Palmyra was named and discovered in 1802, but I’ve always wondered if it had a unique Japanese name and if it was regularly visited prior to its western discovery date.  I’ll start with these and see where it goes, thanks again!	1643141193.0	hu73rfu	t3_sck9yt	t1_hu6y59f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sck9yt/how_do_i_start_researching_the_japanese_history/hu73rfu/
ypk73k	This will be another post dealing with the question of pre-Common Era year dating, basically because it’s a good excuse to bring up the Seleucids.  One of the Hellenistic successor states, the Seleucid Empire at times controlled areas from Asia Minor to a border with Mauryan India.    More to the point, upon declaring himself king in 304/305 BCE, Seleucus I Nicator instituted a new Seleucid Era system of year numbering, which was retroactively set to begin in 311/312 BCE, the year he retook control of Babylon.  The double dating, e.g. 311/312, accounts for differing New Years dates between our calendar and historical annual calendars.  Interestingly the Seleucids themselves seem to have had a problem with this, as the Macedonian and Babylonian systems simultaneously held that the year changed in what today would be Fall or Spring, respectively.     This post has drawn and will draw primarily on *Time and its Adversaries in the Seleucid Empire* by Paul Kosmin (Harvard University Press, 2018).  In that monograph Kosmin argues that “This Seleucid Era was the world’s first continuous tally of counted years and the unheralded model for all subsequent era systems, including the Common Era” (p.22).  For instance, the Saros Tablet displays the dates of eclipses, at 18 year intervals, from entries dated by regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar II and Nabonidus, to entries expressed inSeleucid Era dates.  These Seleucid entries stretch across the reigns of multiple kings, but the year counts do not reset, and the name of the specific ruler is no longer mentioned.    Seleucid Era dates were also written differently in the Greek alphabetical numbering system than other numbers.  Essentially, the character for the ones place was written before the 10s place, which was itself before the 100s place.  Normal numbers were written in the opposite order, as we do today.  This made the era dates identifiably significant compared to numbers used in other ways.  The Seleucid Era date also formed parts of official seals, for example in the approval of weights and measures used in trade.  Kosmin argues that this insertion of the Era system as an ideological construct into daily life was an effort by the Seleucid rulers to move past personal, charismatic leadership and institutionalize and systematize their dynastic rulership.  This is something the dynasty struggled to do convincingly on a wider political level (see Chrubasik *Kings and Usurpers in the Seleukid Empire* Oxford Classical Monographs, 2016).   The Jewish Maccabean/Hasmonean period also began as assertions of local control against the imperial Seleucids, and Kosmin argues that the new political invention of the Seleucid Era inspired much of the Jewish apocalyptic tradition from this time, among other traditions.  When time itself bears the mark of a hostile(ish) power the end of times takes on new meaning.  He also identifies and links to the Era a tendency of periodization, such as the second chapter of the Book of Daniel in which a statue is made of parts of gold, silver, bronze, and iron+clay, representing a series of overlord empires, including the Seleucids, each of which has a defined beginning, *and end*.   In addition to *Time and it’s Adversaries* Paul Kosmin also wrote a chapter with Ian Moyer in *Comparing the Ptolemaic and Seleucid Empires: Integration, communication, and Resistance* edited by Fischer-Bovet and von Reden Cambridge University Press, 2021.  While the Ptolemies did not have an era system similar to the Seleucids Moyer argues that the representation of most of the Ptolemaic rulers as a separate dynasty, and the development of the traditional divisions of Egyptian history into ruler dynasties (seen earliest in Manetho) show a new approach to the division of time in that state.   If anyone is further interested in a much better presentation of this history, the Harvard University YouTube channel records a presentation by Paul Kosmin on the Seleucid Era which covers pretty closely the first section of *Time and it’s Adversaries*, iirc.  I believe it comes up first when searching for that historian and topic, unsure if I should link directly.	1643141200.0	hu73s12	t3_scc4kv	t3_scc4kv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scc4kv/tuesday_trivia_time_timekeeping_this_thread_has/hu73s12/

es64ses7	Possibly the most unfiltered portrayal we have from the time period is a racist song parody written by Japanese men mocking the comfort women. With the obvious caveat that I am translating it to demonstrate the widespread feelings of Japanese at the time and not to agree with the contents, here is the original.  > 雨のショポショポ降るぱん（晩）に カラス（ガラス）のまと（窓）からのそ（覗）いてる まてつ（満鉄）のきぽたん（金ボタン）のぱか（馬鹿）やろう  > さわるはこちせん（五十銭）見るはたた（只） 三円こちせん（五十銭）くれたなら かしわ（鶏）の鳴くまで 付き合うわ  > あか（登楼）るの帰るの とうしゅる（どうする）の 早く精神ち（決）めなしゃい ち（決）めたらけた（下駄）もて あか（登楼）んなしゃい  > お客さんこのころ（頃）紙高い ちょうぱ（帳場）の手前もあるてしょう（でしょう） こちせんしゅうき（五十銭祝儀）をはちみ（弾み）なさい  > そしたら私はた（抱）いて寝て ふたち（二つ）もみっち（三つ）もおまけして かしわ（鶏）の鳴くまで ぽぽしゅる（ぼぼする）わ  > ああたま（騙）されたたま（騙）された こちせん（五十銭）金貨と思うたに ピールピン（ビール瓶）の栓かよ たま（騙）された  Here's a translation in eye-dialect to match the general tone of the original:  > Rain fallin’ down and I watches the window, thinking of that cheapskate Mantetsu man  > Fitty sen is not my price. Just make it three fitty and I’ll go all night  > Men come to play, what should I do? I’m not one who’s easy to play, but when I do, you gotta play hard  > A john came by and the price was high, but he got past the bouncer and tipped me fitty sen  > So ah hugged ‘im an got in th’ sack, then all night long he stabbed my c--t  > Aah, ah was betrayed, betrayed! All for a fitty sen coin… Ah was popped like the cap on a beer bottle  Some notes on this translation: The entire song is written in a crude dialect, mocking Korean pronunciation. "Mantetsu" is the Manchurian Railroad Company, Japan's major colonial corporation. Fifty sen is less than a dollar. Japanese racists thought the way non-native speaker Koreans pronounced “fifty sen” was extremely funny, and it was used as a shibboleth to identify and kill Koreans during the 1923 Kanto massacre.  We don't have contemporary reactions from Koreans for two reasons: Japanese controlled the printing presses especially after the 1930s, and the Japanese propaganda was that impoverished fathers were selling their daughters into prostitution, which at the time was considered the lowest of professions and not something a Korean nationalist idealist would want to write about.   But we have this Japanese parody, called the "Mantetsu Song" (満鉄小唄), which not only demonstrates the persuasiveness of the propaganda, but also eagerly dehumanizes the supposed singer and degrades her with markers of ethnic difference. It sort of reads like a minstrel song, except that instead of imagining Koreans as happy and nostalgic for old times, it emphasizes the pain and cruelty undergone by comfort women in order to produce joy in the Japanese audience. It's easy to see that comfort women were seen as an inferior species of being, freely available for the Japanese men to abuse. If you read debates about the comfort women system you will see all manner of primary sources that Japanese created at the time to whitewash what they were doing, but I have never seen this song mentioned.  While this dehumanization seems to have been widespread and dominant even after World War II, it was not all-pervasive. The 1959 Japanese film *The Human Condition* (人間の條件), made just 11 years after Japan's surrender, portrays comfort women as victims of the capitalist and colonialist systems, robbed of their freedom but trying to make the most of their situation.   Unfortunately, though, in both Japan and Korea, the postwar consensus view was that comfort women did not deserve to be thought about or remembered; that their dignity had been taken away from them by their fathers, basically. Again, to a large extent this narrative was perpetrating the wartime propaganda, and to a large extent Confucian dogmas of both countries. It was only in the 1980s that Koreans started to see comfort women as victims of Japanese rape, rather than as selling themselves out to the Japanese.	1643141902.0	hu75nk0	t3_sc51j2	t3_sc51j2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc51j2/how_were_korean_comfort_women_seen_by_their/hu75nk0/

69l7d	I will start by giving a quick plug to /r/ChineseHistory because there are some educators over there who might have a useful perspective on this. The answer you will probably get is that the Qin and Han are "classical", the Shang and western Zhou are "ancient" and considerable disagreement about where to put the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.  You are correct that the distinction seems subjective, because ultimately it is, in two ways: for one, the terminology is an importation of terminology from the west in an attempt by western and western trained scholars to find equivalence in Chinese history. This does not mean it is useless and false, terms like "medieval" and "early modern China" are still used today because they usefully convey certain ideas, but that does mean they fit somewhat uneasily. I have a book called *Medieval Chinese Warfare* which implicitly makes a very useful case for the aptness of the word, but that does not mean you will find an equivalence in the court of Charlemagne or Eleanor of Aquitaine for the position that Tang era Chang'an holds in the Chinese popular consciousness.  The second reason is that even in the west the term--and its distinction with ancient--is vague and fraught. *Classicus* in Latin means classy or high status, engaging in "classical learning" means engaging in the education of the upper class. Which means, for complicated reasons, the literary study of Greek and Latin texts from the period before about 500 CE. This term then becomes conflated with the cultures and civilizations that produced it, such that we might talk about "classical civilization" much as we talk about "Vedic civilization" in India or, indeed, the "Spring and Autumn Period" of China. But even classical studies has its classical studies, such that "classical Greek literature" is that produced in Athens from about 500-300 BCE, and "classical Latin literature" is that produced from about 80 BCE-20 CE. These are based on events (the Persian Wars to Alexander and the Late Republic and Augustus respectively) but if it all seems a bit arbitrary, well, it is. The point is that "classic" is entirely a retrojection, it is fundamentally the period that people look back on as "the acme".  So you combine these two vagaries and you can understand how “classical China” is itself rather vague, it is best thought of as referring to the period of China that is thought to occupy a similar position in “the story of China” as Greece and Rome do in “the west”. While the comparisons between the Roman and Han imperial periods are fairly obvious and in fact constitute something of fruitful subdiscipline today, beyond that it gets a bit strained. For example, it is possible to compare Plato and Confucius in terms of position within their respective philosophical histories, but they did not occupy similar social or political worlds at all. And while the Hellenistic period and Warring States period have certain similarities in that they were the crucibles of later state development, the comparison is hardly 1:1.  And of course over all this there is a certain question of whether it is better to simply stick with the traditional Dynastic periodization. For example, much of what I wrote here comes from jacques Gernet’s *A History of Chinese Civilization*, an influential textbook from the 70s that forcefully made the case that as artificial as they are, terms like “classical” “Medieval” “Renaissance” etc allowed us to get away from the strictures of purely dynastic categorization, but if you actually read the book he never really gets away from it.	1643142099.0	hu766q5	t3_scfls1	t3_scfls1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scfls1/whats_the_actual_difference_between_ancient_and/hu766q5/

mdu63	Thank you for your quick response.   I've also looked at some of Hiraoka's essays, reworked and integrated into his monograph but also published in online repository.    [Hiraoka 2008] focuses on the incident in Pearl and Hermes Atoll, but without any mention to Palmyra Atoll.   >Palmyra was named and discovered in 1802, but I’ve always wondered if it had a unique Japanese name and if it was regularly visited prior to its western discovery date.   Then, I'd say "no/ extreme unlikely" with certainty.    The Japanese began to settle and look for albatross feather and plumage across some Pacific Islands (mainly near Japan) in the last decade(s) of the 19th century, not earlier than Meiji Restoration in 1868 and after the official annexation of Ogasawara/ Bonin Islands with Japan.    It should be also mentioned that some settlers into these islands primary came from southern part of Izu Islands (like Hachijo Island), not directly from Bonin Islands. Torishima (an volcanic island between Izu and Ogasawara Islands) had been known as a nesting site of albatross in Japan, so inhabitants of southern Izu islands got used to these birds. According to [Hiraoka 2005], their motive of initial attempts into some islands west to Okinawa was also albatross (plumage).     Reference(s):    * Akitoshi, HIRAOKA..

3tdu5sz6	Is this not a little methodologically unsound?  If your aim is to explore the hypothesis that extensive deregulation or lack of regulation leads to totalitarianism the same as extensive regulation (you seem, incidentally, to be taking *as read* that extensive regulation leads to totalitarianism which I'm also not sure is exactly settled) then shouldn't you do one of the following:  * Look at a randomly selected sample of states that extensively deregulated versus a sample of states that didn't (ideally in a similar time period), and see which set leans more towards totalitarianism. * Look at a randomly selected sample of states that became totalitarian, and a randomly selected sample of states that didn't, and compare their regulatory frameworks.  You can't explore the hypothesis that X leads to Y by specifically seeking out examples of Y that were preceded by X while ignoring examples of Y that were not preceded by X and examples of X that were not followed by Y.	1643143391.0	hu79mzi	t3_scmxke	t3_scmxke	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scmxke/i_am_looking_for_a_period_of_history_where_large/hu79mzi/

goa72d3z	Titulus Regius was formally declared in January 1484, yes, however that does not stop whole situation existing before. Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury were actually declared illegitimate back in May/June 1483 when Bishop Robert Stillington brought to Richard, Duke of Gloucester's attention that the princes were not legitimate. The legislation Titulus Regius only made this all official, hence why it was a bit later on- Edward and Richard were already known to be illegitimate before the legislation.  Another thing to note, although Domenico Mancini's work is contemporary, we need to remember that we cant always rely on everything he says. He admits himself that he cant actually vouch for a lot of the things hes telling us. He also commonly used the Woodvilles (Richard III's enemy) as a source for his book, and of course they want to demonize Richard, so inaccuracy may be quite prevalent in it.	1643143639.0	hu7aawu	t3_qwyjxz	t1_hlx2o46	/r/AskHistorians/comments/qwyjxz/why_would_richard_iii_kill_the_princes_in_the/hu7aawu/
ba5uj	 Qin (221 BC–206 BC) is the start of **Imperial China,** whereas Qing (1636–1912) marked the end of Imperial China.  Within the umbrella of Imperial China, Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC - 220 AD) are commonly considered **Early Imperial China** marked by the emergence of a highly centralized, bureaucratic governance framework across a vast multi-ethnic territory, known in Chinese as 大一統王朝 (“grand unified imperial dynasty”). Many historians (as well as most Chinese history textbooks) also group the subsequent three and half centuries of (mostly) continuous state of warring factions, competing claims of imperial authority, and cultural convergences which spans across [Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms), [Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(266%E2%80%93420/) and [Northern and Southern dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_Southern_dynasties) also as part of the Early Imperial China, whereas others would categorize this period of disunity (220 AD - 589 AD) as a separate transitional period.   The re-unification of China under the [Sui dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_dynasty) 589 AD also marked the beginning of the textbook category of **Middle Imperial China.** Just like **Early Imperial China,** modern day Chinese historical taxonomists often sub-divide this period into a "grand unified imperial dynasty"  era between Sui (589 - 618), Tang (618 - 907) and Song (Northern, 960 - 1127) dynasties, and a later era of division and changing ethnic relations from the [Jingkang Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingkang_incident) to the end of [Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty) Dynasty.   The **Late Imperial China** is a less messy and contested category, typically consists of the last two “grand unified imperial dynasties" of Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1636–1912). However, history textbooks in China typically group everything between the beginning of the [First Opium War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Opium_War) in 1839 and the end of the last Chinese Civil War in 1949 under the category of 近現代史 (“near modern China”).  The term "classical China" is NOT a commonly used general historical label/category within China. It is however used to denote a particular moment of Chinese philosophical and literary history, of which the **classical period of Chinese intellectual** roughly corresponds to **春秋戰國時代** which encompasses the [Spring and Autumn period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_period) and the [Warring States period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period), between 776 BC and 221 BC.   **Pre-Qin China** or 先秦時代 is the most commonly used umbrella term covering the period prior to Qin's unification in 221 BC all the way up to the [Shang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty) (c. 1600 BC – 1046 BC). The upper limit of **Pre-Qin China** is defined by the earliest confirmed written Chinese historical record, which is so far the [Oracle bone script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script) from Shang period.   Whether [Xia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty) belongs to **Pre-Qin China** is a still debated issue in China. There are numerous archaeological urban cultures discovered throughout China that roughly correspond to the quasi-legendary Xia period, but Oracle bone texts made no mention of Xia, and contemporaneous Xia written records have yet to be found. For this reason, more often than not, Chinese history textbooks places Xia dynasty along with other early Bronze Age cultures into the category of **史前時代** "Pre Written History China."  I hope this helps.	1643143920.0	hu7b24q	t3_scfls1	t3_scfls1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scfls1/whats_the_actual_difference_between_ancient_and/hu7b24q/
5921x	I finished my PhD not too long ago.  For my field (1st C BCE/CE Rome) there's not much new *per se*.  Sometimes we find a new papyrus or something, but as a rule all the evidence is out there already.  What does change is the interpretation: the lens through which you view the evidence.  You can grab such lenses from other fields to give your topic a spin.  So, my diss, for instance, was investigating the Roman integration of Italy around the events of the Social War of 90-88 BCE.  I indeed read the scholarship backwards, as you were recommended to do.  I'm going to narrate going forward though.  The traditional view of the Social War, going back to the ancient sources themselves, is that Rome's allies (the *socii*) bore the burden of Roman military expeditions to an increasing extent without having access to Rome's foreign policy, and they hoped to correct this by gaining the Roman citizenship.  When they failed to achieve this through legislation (the last proponent of extending the citizenship, Drusus, was assassinated) they resorted to violence.  Rome won the war, but only by fracturing the alliance of the *socii* by granting citizenship first to those that didn't defect, and then to those that put down arms, and eventually to everyone.  In 1996 this guy Mouritsen came along and said, "Hang on; that narrative only pops up about 200 years after the war in question.  The earliest historian we have that reports anything about that war is living in a world in which Italy is entirely integrated into the Roman state.  He's *explaining* the nature of the state he lives in rather than *describing* the history that brought it into being.  It may well be Rome didn't accept Italians into the state, but rather imposed the Roman state on them, a punishment for their revolt, by destroying their own civic identities and polities."  There was some pish-poshing about this opinion, but no one really made an argument against it except "all the sources say this," nevermind the earliest historians were writing 200 years after the fact.  I wasn't happy with the pish-poshing.  I think the traditional narrative can have a better defence than "that's just silly."  So this is what I did: while I don't have a historian writing about that war for about 200 years after the fact, I do have some foundation narratives that are roughly contemporaneous with that war.  I know from political scientists like Ronald Suny (I have a background in polisci) nation-states tend to produce foundation narratives that address political issues at the time *they were composed* rather than actually describing something that happened in the past (think about the traditional Thanksgiving narrative in the USA - far more useful for explaining why people of European extract are here and framing the whole affair as a friendly thing, rather than, you know, genocide).  So I have two things to do now: 1) despite the fact that most theorists consider nation-states to be exclusively modern, show Rome was sufficiently close enough to a nation-state that I can read Roman foundation narratives in the same way we read foundation narratives of modern nation-states, and 2) provide a reading of the relevant Roman foundation narratives that lends support for the traditional account of the war.  I accomplished #1 by looking at political theorists of nation-states.  In particular I found Smith and Kymlicka helpful.  Smith challenges the notion that nation-states are modern, and Kymlicka introduces the notion of a nation-building-state.  I used both of these polisci peeps to argue that Rome can indeed be seen as a nation-state, and so I can read the foundation narratives the way we read modern foundation narratives.  That lets me use those Roman foundation narratives to inform my understanding of the issues underlying the Social War, even though I don't have contemporary historians to work with.  No new evidence.  I'm not even questioning the traditional narrative.  I'm in fact trying to support it.  But to the best of my knowledge, and the knowledge of my committee, no one had applied modern political theory to this particular historical problem.  How did I stumble onto this topic?  I don't really know.  I remember applying for grad school right after finishing my BA and being asked to write a PhD proposal.  Fuck that.  I didn't know nearly enough to write a proposal.  I only took an interest in the Social War when I learned the *socii* were minting their own coins and I became interested in the iconography on those coins, and I thought back to my polisci days and started making connections.  I don't remember why or how the Italian coins came to my attention. But my polisci background, interest in coins, and interest in foundation narratives gave me what I needed to create a new lens and a new interpretation.  That's a bit of a long story.  I hope you find some part of it useful.	1643144042.0	hu7be0a	t3_scm1uv	t3_scm1uv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scm1uv/how_does_one_go_about_finding_something_new_in/hu7be0a/

96gqp	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643144537.0	hu7cppl	t3_sclvdq	t3_sclvdq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sclvdq/who_was_cicero_and_why_was_he_so_important/hu7cppl/

ajdl30e8	That's a very insightful story, thank you very much sharing! Did you have any guarantees when you started, that applying the nation state and polisci ideas would indeed support the traditional narrative of the Social War? Had you already "seen it" in the primary sources or was it more of a wager that ended up with a positive answer?  I am doing something very similar by applying the lens of sustainability thinking (my background is in environmental change) to agricultural texts of Middle Ages hoping to change the usual story of "ancestors of empirical science" to one of "humble farmers who see nature as Creation." But so far, I am finding a lot of difficulty!	1643145503.0	hu7fa8d	t3_scm1uv	t3_scm1uv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scm1uv/how_does_one_go_about_finding_something_new_in/hu7fa8d/

875tv	"Nae Hair On'T" was part of the book "The Merry Muses of Caledonia" published 1799, while Burns died 1796. So he didn't see any direct criticism or consequence.   *Merry Muses* includes other famous bawdy songs / poems "Nine Inch will Please a Lady" and "Madgie cam to my Bedstock". It was a collection of songs sung at the local pub with Burns' friends, a convivial club called "[Crochallan Fencibles](http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/CrochallanFencibles.245.shtml)".    Individual songs may or may not be Burns work, as he was both collector and writer. Someone (likely Alexander Smellie, the son of one of the other members) published songs known from the pub. The original (one in Burns' handwriting, if it existed) doesn't survive, but there are two copies of the printed version in the Lord Rosebery library and G. Ross Roy collection. There are two letters in which he mentions a volume of bawdy songs he has been working on collecting for a long time, but not saying they are his own work.   However after his death, the book was published and many bad imitations were made. His publisher refused to admit his involvement in *Merry Muses* for 100 years.   > editor-printer of the original Merry Muses of 1799 was probably Alexander Smellie, the son of one of Burns’s wittiest carousing companions. Watermarks indicate that the paper upon which The Merry Muses was printed comes from the same batches that Alexander used for two of his father’s posthumous works, the Characteristical Lives and volume two of the Philosophy of Natural History, which we know with certainty were produced in his shop in 1799. Furthermore, Alexander was a Crochallan himself and had in his possession his father’s “disreputable” correspondence with Burns, as well as his own memories of the songs that he had sung as a young man in Douglas’s tavern with his father’s trusted and distinguished friends. The volume Alexander Smellie printed is a fellow performer’s enduring testimony to the good times that song afforded the Crochallans and that Alexander had enjoyed in the company of a father he appears to have worshipped. -Stephen Brown  * [The Merry Muses of Caledonia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Merry_Muses_of_Caledonia), digital text version of the 1911 printing by Burns Federation * [The Merry Muses of Caledonia](https://ia800903.us.archive.org/27/items/merrymusesofcale00burnrich/merrymusesofcale00burnrich.pdf), digitized scan of the 1911 version.

7xgnjo	To a certain degree it effects cavalry units as a whole, officers and troops. But it should be said this is often a case of unit by unit disparities. Especially steady units, such as Cromwell's own cavalry unit (yes that Cromwell), the Ironsides, were noteworthy in their time especially compared to the Royalist cavalry largely consisting of young gentlemen who were more enthusiastic than dependable. And often the difference comes from whether the units have had time to train discipline nor not. Newly raised units are more prone to extreme behaviour so to say, and especially as with a good horse you can easily get away, compared to an infantryman, when cavalry flees they do so quickly. Your temptation is greater you could say to save your own skin. A lot cavalry units raised for the wars in the 1600s were also volunteers of various stripes which means they might not quite be as committed to "the cause". So e.g. at Lützen 1632 Wallenstein had many newly raised cavalry units that barley fought at all. It became known as the Fahnenflucht and led to court-martials after the battle where officers who it was felt had not done their duty were executed. With little oversight of the entire battlefield panic could easily spread in nearby units as you can only tell what is happening on your little slice of the battle. Panic and flight spreads quickly, steadiness and advances not so much. Ultimately the officers are as much dependent on getting the men to obey (whether that means to stand fast, halt or to go on in the face of danger) as the men are on being able to control the horses. There are a lot of moving parts basically.  The other basic problem is that there is no real way to get cavalry to receive new orders and even if your officers remember their larger duty they might be dragged along a unit that won't easily be hearing new orders anyway. So you risk that cavalry lose sight of the greater strategic picture and when they do their greater mobility means they quickly pass beyond your effective control. In extreme cases you might literally be unable to control the animal you sit on too. But usually it's because the cavalrymen are too enthusiastic. Often units like light cavalry was recruited from cultures where independence and a certain wildness of spirit was prevailing and this tended to affect their performance on battlefields too. So e.g. again at Lützen Croat light cavalry was used as a screen by the Imperial army to hide it's weak left flank, but they were quickly dispersed and they ended up looting their own baggage train on their way off the field.  It's not unique to the 1600s as such, horsemen have both the mobility and carrying capacity to get some extracurricular looting done, but it does happen several times that cavalry disperse the enemy and then forget about the battle to go looting win or lose. That armies expanded quite a lot to meet the demands of the intensive warfare in the period and that cavalry tactics was undergoing something of a transition just as infantry tactics did. So e.g. Prince Rupert who commanded the cavalry of king Charles I had been fighting in Europe and was keen to implement the more aggressive tactics used there. Leading his cavaliers in wild charges helped change the the word's meaning from simply "cavalryman" through "follower of the king" to "rash".  To try and collect my ramblings a bit I would probably say, it wasn't necessarily chronic, but there were larger trends that lead to a lot of less disciplined cavalry being used in the 1600s. But anytime you use cavalry  that is more enthusiastic than professional you can end up with problems. Even as late as the US Civil War during Lee's campaign into the north in 1863 the Confederate cavalry under Stuart is given a lot of latitude to roam freely which causes them to lose contact with the rest of the Confederate thrust and effectively blinding Lee's army as he lacks the scouts the cavalry would normally provide. A similar issue, but much more localised to a single battlefield is what am trying to get across. Pursuits tend to scatter the attackers as well as the defenders and it can be difficult to gather up your scattered troops again. Sometimes when your victorious cavalry troops arrive back at the main army they will find a battle lost they had been winning.	1643148621.0	hu7nbbe	t3_sb8okf	t1_hu639mv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8okf/was_cavalry_often_used_to_sneak_back_behind_enemy/hu7nbbe/
5921x	I always had issues with the nation-state as exclusively modern.  When I ran into that idea as a freshman in college, without knowledge of any of the theory, I basically thought "are y'all idiots?"  That was an opinion formed from ignorance; as I learned the literature, though, I continued to hold the opinion that there could be ancient nation-states, even if most ancient states wouldn't fit that category.  When I discovered the Italian *socii* and the Social War, and in particular the coinage and its imagery, I thought I had a good test case to work with for the ancient nation-state thing.  This is def. wading into the area of confirmation bias, but that's what my committee is for.  I had to convince them each step of the way, from my proposal to my defence, that I had a good (not necessarily right), interesting, and original idea.  Or I just wrote enough that they wanted to stop reading, and they passed me just to get me out of their hair.  Either way, you have to call me Dr. now.	1643148679.0	hu7ngbw	t3_scm1uv	t1_hu7fa8d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scm1uv/how_does_one_go_about_finding_something_new_in/hu7ngbw/

It would just end up generating threads here in this subreddit asking if this dude on youtube really knew what he talked about. :D	1643149298.0	hu7oyoz	t3_sb8okf	t1_hu64htq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8okf/was_cavalry_often_used_to_sneak_back_behind_enemy/hu7oyoz/

cckyme74	Looking for French revolutionary babe! PLEASE HELP  If I am recalling this correctly I may have initially read about her in Popkin's "A New World Begins" (2019). She was only mentioned briefly in the second half of the book but it is killing me.  After forgetting her name I have been searching for QUITE some time to find the woman who I'd consider, THE most beautiful of the French Revolutionary era. The only FACT I have to work with is that she was thought of at the time to be incredibly beautiful. (and that she has a wikipedia page.) Outside of that I have some vague, possibly incorrect memories which are as follows: She was a politicians wife or mistress in the provinces or south of France (read: not Paris)(?) after the Thermidorian reaction(?). She may have been of the royalist or conservative persuasion. I thought maybe she was Tallien's wife but seems not to be the case (unless he had a mistress after his breakup?), this may imply its someone in Tallien's circle or someone he interacted with? I think she's wearing a green dress in her wiki portrait. And maybe only has a few paragraphs in her wiki as well. She's a brunette bombshell. She isn't one of the top most famous women (for sure would put all of them to shame in the looks department) of the era but she may have personally influenced her man to lean right? As I said, those are fuzzy memories and may be incorrect, but any help would be greatly appreciated!	1643150929.0	hu7t29n	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu7t29n/

n4bht	It sounds like you're mainly wondering how efforts against fluoridation got associated with both far-left-wing and far-right-wing at the same time. Both have been associated with it from the beginning so there wasn't ​some "transition" as you imply; it's simply that conspiratorial views can be reached by multiple avenues. The 1960 study *Classification and Appraisal of Objections to Fluoridation* identified 255 different objections although the claims can be boiled down to roughly  1. Fluoridation is not medically effective.  2. Fluoridation is not cost-effective.   3. Systems that provide fluoridation can fail.  4. Fluoridation is a health hazard associated with (pick a disease).  5. Fluoridation is socialized medicine / communism.  6. Fluoridation is a violation of individual liberty.  7. Fluoridation is part of a general conspiracy by either government to pacify the population, or corporations to get rid of chemical waste.  You'll notice that the alternative-medicine types might tend to 1 and 4, while opponents of big government might attach instead to 5, 6, and 7. Same goal, different motivations.  For an instance of the alternative medicine approach, consider Fred J. Hart, with a passel of "alternative" medical electrical devices in the 1950s but had run-ins with the government. Blood samples would be sent in with diagnosis sent by mail, but the FDA found his "medical" equipment was essentially equivalent to a doorbell and put an injunction for him to stop his services. He refused and was cited for criminal contempt in 1962. As part of his fight against the FDA he founded the National Health Federation, and part of the group's platform included anti-vaccine (including polio, and polio vaccine pushback was not significant at the time!) and anti-flouridation.  Other groups in a similar vein are the "National Nutritional Foods Association" (1936) and "Earth Island Institute" (1982).  Conspiracy theories are hardly just the purview of the right-wing; for example, one of the ones trotted out with fluoridation has to do with the Manhattan Project. The Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester did do some (horrifying) experiments with plutonium in relation to human subjects. (Quoting the [Atomic Heritage Foundation](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/human-radiation-experiments): "Between 1946-1947, physicians injected six patients with uranium with the research goal of discerning the minimum dose that would produce detectable kidney damage".) Once uranium hexafluoride was known to be a substance in use there were some fluoride experiments added to the docket, but note that there is a major difference between fluoride and the uranium version, which has one atom of uranium put with six atoms of fluorine (hence the "hexa"). As you can imagine, folks like the John Birch society were more focused on the "socialized medicine" part of the conspiracy and (being generally supportive of more bombs) less the derivative-of-the-atom-bomb angle.  So, there hasn't really been a shift in position, even through more modern times. The 1991 study *Scientific Knowledge in Controversy: The Social Dynamics of the Fluoridation Debate* -- using interviews with people debating fluoridation in Australia -- identified this issue as one with particularly monolithic blocks where it is very hard to change minds;  interviewees claimed the evidence was completely on their side, and there was very little criticism of "inaccuracies, exaggerations, and simplifications".  This is still a current issue,  especially regarding places other than the US, where the number where 50%+ of the population has fluoridated water is very small: Australia, Brunei, Chile, Guyana, Ireland, Singapore, Canada, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and New Zealand. The only places with 100% are Hong Kong and Singapore. Ireland is the only country in Europe that mandates fluoridation.  ...

3xjttg75	He was a man who was a decorated war hero who was a higher up in the nazi government and took part in the assassination attempt of Hitler. When his involvement was discovered he was offered three options. 1) defend himself to Hitler 2) been sent through kangaroo court and killed along with his family and servants or 3) chew on cyanide and have the press call him a hero with his family getting his pension. He chose the third. But why was the third offer given to him when they could have just tortured him and have the press say otherwise.	1643153755.0	hu806el	t3_scr5ka	t3_scr5ka	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scr5ka/why_was_erwin_rommel_offered_cyanide_as_an_option/hu806el/

This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to /r/AskAnthropology.

9v6a6	We've removed your post for the moment because it's not currently at our standards, but it definitely has the potential to fit within our rules with some work. We find that some answers that fall short of our standards can be successfully revised by considering the following questions, not all of which necessarily apply here:    * *Do you actually address the question asked by OP?* Sometimes answers get removed not because they fail to meet our standards, but because they don't get at what the OP is asking. If the question itself is flawed, you need to explain why, and how your answer addresses the underlying issues at hand.    * *What are the sources for your claims?* Sources aren't strictly necessary on /r/AskHistorians but the inclusion of sources is helpful for evaluating your knowledge base. If we can see that your answer is influenced by up-to-date academic secondary sources, it gives us more confidence in your answer and allows users to check where your ideas are coming from.    * *What level of detail do you go into about events?* Often it's hard to do justice to even seemingly simple subjects in a paragraph or two, and on /r/AskHistorians, the basics need to be explained within historical context, to avoid misleading intelligent but non-specialist readers.  In many cases, it's worth providing a broader historical framework, giving more of a sense of not just what happened, but why.    * *Do you downplay or ignore legitimate historical debate on the topic matter?* There is often more than one plausible interpretation of the historical record. While you might have your own views on which interpretation is correct, answers can often be improved by acknowledging alternative explanations from other scholars.     * *Further Reading*: [This Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/) provides further exploration of the rules and expectations concerning answers so may be of interest.    If/when you edit your answer, [please reach out via modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) so we can re-evaluate it! We also welcome you getting in touch if you're unsure about how to improve your answer.	1643156149.0	hu85y0u	t3_scdgx5	t1_hu5qiw0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scdgx5/did_the_use_of_the_m1_garand_as_a_primary_issue/hu85y0u/

6r0xp	I just read "The Daughter of Time" by Josephine Tey which argues that the princes were still alive and well when Richard died, and only disappeared after Henry VII seized power.  All documents implicating Richard were not contemporary but later Tudor propaganda.  e.g. Thomas More was only a child at the time, and his account came from Tudor sympathiser John Morton.    Also:      There was no political advantage for Richard III in killing the young princes. With Titulus Regius enacted, the two princes represented no threat to Richard once he was crowned king.  The princes were far more of a threat to Henry VII, as his claim to the crown was far inferior to theirs.      Henry VII's Bill of Attainder brought against the deceased Richard after the battle of Bosworth makes generic accusations of "cruelty and tyranny" but no mention of the princes - suggesting that they were not yet missing.      The mother of the princes, Elizabeth Woodville, remained on good terms with Richard once he was king, and her daughters regularly took part in social events at his court.       If Richard had ordered the princes killed, he would have presented their bodies and claimed they had died of illness.  He could not simply have them disappear because he would inevitably be blamed.  Henry, however, could have them disappear because he could easily transfer the blame to the deceased Richard.	1643156687.0	hu878lf	t3_scai1f	t1_hu56w8c	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scai1f/was_henry_vii_not_richard_iii_the_real_culprit/hu878lf/

7xgnjo	>The September to June calendar  Well this is odd. I had a read of this reply, and then I see you debunk the "Summer vacation for agricultural work" thing. And fair enough. But this gets me thinking, in Finland and Sweden we basically follow the same school year schedule as the one you outline, and it's \*always\* blamed on the agricultural year. In fact up to the 1970s in Finland there was a "potato picking vacation" in the Fall. I tried to search a bit and absolutely every result I get points to the agricultural year as the reason. Without necessarily sourcing it. I do note on wikipedia that the Swedish reforms (which Finland's system basically copied) of the 1800s eg the 1842 reforms copied ideas from America. Which would mean it is actually quite possible the NYC system is to blame. Which would be positively bizarre.  Would love to hear someone with deeper knowledge about it.	1643158492.0	hu8bkqw	t3_scc4kv	t1_hu5obw0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scc4kv/tuesday_trivia_time_timekeeping_this_thread_has/hu8bkqw/

3wpri40y	Different but related answer [about Norse mythology and dwarfs here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1fi2b6/how_did_the_norse_treat_people_with_dwarfism/): essentially it seems that perhaps the modern conception of a fantasy dwarf as a stout beardy fellow and the older folklore of dwarfs as supernatural entities are totally different and that people with dwarfism couldn't have been confused for the other.	1643158892.0	hu8cjnd	t3_schjq0	t3_schjq0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/schjq0/im_a_medieval_germanic_peasant_who_was_raised_on/hu8cjnd/
g85sb	An archeologist trying to decipher a unknown script is presented with a problem similar to a intelligence officer trying to decipher a coded message: You have a written text in front of you and you want to know what it says.   The intelligence officer usually a few things to work with: They generally know which language they're trying to decipher, they can reasonably assume that every letter is coding another letter. Sometimes they can even make educated guesses about parts of the message helping them cracking parts of the code or reducing the number of possible solutions. With that kind of information you can use statistical models and so forth to decipher the code.  An archeologist does not have this luxuries, especially in the case of the Indus Valley script:   1. We don't know which language it is  2. We don't know what the individual symbols are representing   Now you may think: Ok, that's the case for most ancient scripts, so how come we can read others but no this. The answer to that often lies in something we call a bilingual: The same text or inscription written in multiple scripts.   The most famous example of this is the Rosetta Stone, a trilingual inscription written in Hieroglyphic script, demotic script and ancient Greek, which allowed deciphering hieroglyphs.   If you can read the Greek text (which we could) you can use it as basis to assign meaning to the script you can't read, in that case hieroglyphs.  Unfortunately we don't have a bilingual for the Indus Valley script. Basically we're missing a starting point. We'll most likely never find one either, there's a more that 1000 year long gap before the next script was used in India.  (By the way: It is possible to decipher a script without a bilingual. The Maya script would be an example for that, but for this we had other points to start from: An alphabet (even though it was incomplete and proved to be pretty confusing), knowledge of the language and inscriptions we more or less knew what they were about, like calenders)	1643158949.0	hu8coo3	t3_scisyy	t3_scisyy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scisyy/why_hasnt_the_indus_valley_script_been_deciphered/hu8coo3/

8brve	There are basically two approaches to novelty. One is finding a new question to ask, which is what /u/LegalAction describes in detail. (We call this "applying a new framework" but I find "finding a new question" to be a more straightforward way of saying the same thing.) You can do this with any period or topic of history, and it can cause you to completely read the same evidence or sources that people have looked at for centuries (if not longer) totally differently.   The other way is to find new sources, and by "find new sources" I really mean "use sources that other historians haven't really used much before" most of the time (historians are very rarely the people who actually "find" any new sources in a real sense). There are occasionally genuinely "new sources" added to archives, things that either had been lost to time and rediscovered, or more recent things that were not accessible to historians previously (for example, I use the Freedom of Information Act to get government documents from the mid-20th century — they are "new sources" only in the sense that they were classified and kept from historians until I got them). New sources can be useful in telling new stories and asking new questions. But without having already seen said sources, or being guaranteed access to them, it's very hard to formulate anything like a hypothesis or research agenda that relates to them. So when writing up a PhD proposal, for example, that might rely on new sources, you describe the general thing you plan to look at, the general questions you plan to ask, and what your hopes are for potential sources. But the final product will always depend on what you can find.   And yes, in searching for things that might be interesting, it really does help to become familiar with the existing literature. Sometimes it is about "gaps" (though as a former advisor once put it, sometimes it turns out the "gaps" are there for a good reason, because the world doesn't need a monograph on literally everything that happened in the past), but often again it is just about asking a new question. Very well-trod topics tend to dig "ruts" in the kinds of questions they ask; it can be very hard to get out of those "ruts" and start asking different questions.  An example from my own work: the topic of Truman's "decision to use the atomic bomb" has been gone over by historians since 1945 in great detail. One would think there are no new questions to ask of it. But it turns out that most of the time, people were just asking and arguing over the same questions repeatedly — e.g., "were the atomic bombings necessary, what were the real motivations of the atomic bombings, did the atomic bombings end the war or was it something else?" These are perfectly good questions but it is hard to imagine, as a junior scholar, coming up with a genuinely novel answer to any of them at this point, at least without using radically different sources than had been used before (Hasegawa's _Racing the Enemy_ was novel in the sense that it used American, Japanese, and Soviet sources simultaneously, which had not really been done — which highlights how specific "novelty" can be).  But there are far more questions about Truman and the atomic bombings that one could ask than this. The question I ended up finding very productive for my own work was: "What did Truman know about the targets before the bombings took place?" These kinds of "epistemological" questions (when did X know about something, and what did they know?) are common in my main field (the history of science, which is all about epistemological questions) but uncommon in diplomatic history, so what I ended up doing was grafting one "framework" (a new question) onto a topic that hadn't had it applied to it well before. And then I went over pretty much every book, source, footnote, etc. that I could find that seemed like it might enlighten me on it. I found nothing "new" in the sense of a genuinely novel document, but I used some documents that had never been used before, and read things into them that hadn't been read into them before (e.g., drafts of the speech that Truman gave on August 10, 1945, which had started being written before the bombing of Hiroshima and then incorporated different language about the bombings into it, which in my framework is revelatory to how Truman's initial understanding of what kind of target Hiroshima was got "adjusted" by information about mass casualties there on August 8th).   From this new question I ended up with an entirely new argument about how to think about the bombings, and ended up with a totally different focus than previous historians had. As historians have known for decades, Truman was not that involved in the "decision to use the atomic bomb." But he WAS involved with one decision, which was whether Kyoto or Hiroshima would be the target of the bomb, and in my paper ([published in 2020](https://alexwellerstein.com/publications/2020-wellerstein_kyoto_misconception.pdf)) I argue that this event that is usually barely a footnote in most accounts is actually quite important, because it may have been the source of a fundamental confusion Truman had about the nature of Hiroshima (whether it was a city or not).   Anyway — I elaborate on the long example just to make it clear that asking a new question does not necessarily mean pulling out some fancy new French theory or wading into jargon or even asking anything particularly _complex_. It just means finding a different way to interrogate the past, and then looking at what the implications of that interrogation might be.   As for the fear of having nothing new to say — generally I always tell people to trust themselves on this, that if they do the work they will end up with something new to say. In some fields that is going to be harder than others, of course. (I did a research paper in grad school that touched on the history of Freud and I concluded that it was so overgrown as a field of study that it was absolutely un-fun to work on, and would take far more effort than I was willing to put in to have anything novel to say.) But again, the trick is not to look at the same old questions and come up with new answers.

If the result is a storm of machine gun fire, they’re German.  If the result is a human wave attack, they’re Russian.  If nothing happens, they’re American- and you should move, because in five minutes your position will be obliterated by artillery or air strikes.	1643165460.0	hu8s3qt	t3_scdgx5	t1_hu8m7j1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scdgx5/did_the_use_of_the_m1_garand_as_a_primary_issue/hu8s3qt/

n3dwy	You may want to ask questions like this in the Short Answers to Simple Questions thread, which AFAIK should be regularly stickied on the front page.    In brief, yes, many wars ended with a more or less clear victory for one side without any occupation of the enemy capital.  The first that came to mind for me was the Seven Years War, in which it was the *winner* whose capital was occupied (multiple times!); the Prussians never seriously threatened any of the capitals of the three Great Powers facing them (Vienna, St. Petersburg/Moscow, and Paris), but successfully exhausted their enemies until they accepted a status quo peace.  There are many other wars I could name that fulfilled this criteria; without tallying up every armed conflict, I would venture to guess *most* wars concluded without occupation of the enemy capital.    Why was this?  In many cases, especially in the 18th century, these were wars for territory, since in primarily subsistence economies, land was the primary source of wealth and thus power.  These tend to resolve themselves through sieges, since it is impractical to try taxing a region if there's still a fort full of hostiles planted in the middle of it.  Because sieges consume vast amounts of supplies, the closer the site is to one's sources of supplies, the more successful they will likely be.  In the case of Early Modern period, most states had great difficulty making rapid, drastic changes in taxation and manpower policy.  This made armies difficult to replace, so rulers and their agents preferred relatively safe, predictable campaigns, where a small setback or spot of bad luck will not spell the ruin of their armies.  As a result, these wars tended to take the form of nibbling at the edges of enemy territory.  Capitals ensconced deep in a Great Power's territorial core were usually safe from immediate threats.    As a rule of thumb, most powers decide to sue for peace for three main reasons.  Either their means of resistance [i.e. armies and the territories that support those armies] have been stripped away, the price of success seems to be more than their objective is worth, or the chance to succeed appears too low.  The latter two often apply long before the enemy has made serious inroads towards one's capital, especially for states with the financial inflexibility I mentioned above.  In the waning years of the Seven Years War, the Austrians were forced to downsize their army in response to shaky finances, making it that much harder to bring the war to a successful close.	1643165944.0	hu8t88b	t3_sc5z34	t3_sc5z34	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc5z34/was_there_ever_a_country_that_won_a_war_without/hu8t88b/

2m8yl53s	In short, yes, there was an evacuation of refugees, and no, staying behind wasn’t an option - the Mamluks were determined to eradicate the Franks entirely from the mainland.  The answer actually goes back a hundred years earlier to the Third Crusade in 1190-1192. Saladin, the sultan of Egypt and Syria, had taken Jerusalem back from the crusaders in 1187. The crusaders weren’t able to get Jerusalem back again but they did retain Tyre, Beirut, Jaffa, and other cities along the Mediterranean coast - most importantly, Acre, which became the new capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The other crusader states int he north, the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch, also survived. During the crusade, king Richard I of England also conquered Cyprus, so another crusader kingdom was established there as well. In Cilicia (the southwest part of modern Turkey), the Armenians had also established a kingdom, which was very friendly with the crusader states.  The Franks (the usual term for crusaders) did manage to get Jerusalem back in 1229, but it was lost again in 1244, and another crusade was launched against the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt and Syria, the successors of Saladin (whose given name was Ayyub). This crusade was led by king Louis IX of France, who was defeated and taken prisoner, but the pressure of the crusade led to a revolt against the Ayyubids by their own enslaved Mamluk soldiers. The Mamluks overthrew the Ayyubids and established their own dynasty in 1251. Since Saladin and his successors had failed to completely dislodge the Franks from the mainland, the Mamluk sultans generally made it their objective to finish the job.  Meanwhile, the Mongols arrived in the Near East as well, and the Franks thought maybe the Mongols could help them defeat the Mamluks and Ayyubids and recover Jerusalem. The Mongols weren’t very interested in an alliance, but they were interested in subjugating the crusader states. The prince of Antioch and the king of Cilician Armenia were among those who allied with the Mongols. The Mongols conquered Baghdad and seemed unstoppable, but they were finally defeated by the Mamluk sultan Qutuz at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. Soon afterwards, Qutuz was assassinated by one of his generals, Baibars.  Baibars set out to punish the Franks and Armenians for fighting alongside the Mongols (even though they hadn't really had much choice in the matter). In 1265 he conquered the crusader cities of Arsuf and Haifa, as well as the Templar castle of Safed. He also invaded and devastated Cilician Armenia. In May 1268 Baibars conquered the principality of Antioch. In the city of Antioch itself, the inhabitants were either killed or sold into slavery. Whoever could escape fled south to the County of Tripoli or remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, or sailed over to Cyprus.  Baibars turned back to the south as well and conquered Jaffa, Ascalon, and Caesarea later in 1268, and in 1271 he captured the famous Hospitaller fortress of Krak des Chevaliers. There seemed to be nothing stopping him from conquering all the Frankish territories, but finally a new crusade arrived, led by the Edward of England (the future king Edward I). This gave the Franks some relief and Baibars turned to other targets like Nubia, the Seljuks in Anatolia, and the Mongols in Persia.  Baibars died in 1277 but his successors Qalawun and al-Ashraf Khalil were equally committed to rooting out the Franks. In 1289 Qalawun destroyed the other major crusader state on the mainland, the County of Tripoli - and again the population was either killed or enslaved, if they could not escape to the south or across to Cyprus. The only territory left for the Franks on the mainland now was the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which was now nothing more than the city of Acre and a few other cities (Tyre, Beirut, Sidon, and some Templar castles).  The king of Jerusalem at this point was actually king Henry of Cyprus, but clearly he was powerless to do anything about the Mamluk conquests. He had no control over anything that happened in Acre either. In 1290 a large group of Italian crusaders arrived to try to help stop the Mamluk advance, but as often happened with new arrivals from Europe, they were much more zealous than their fellow Franks who lived in the east. The Italians attacked and killed some Muslim merchants in the city, which provided Qalawun with the perfect excuse to invade.  Qalawun actually died in November 1290 before setting out for Acre, but his son Khalil besieged Acre in April 1291. The situation was so dire that King Henry arrived in person from Cyprus, but again there was nothing he could do. The walls were breached on May 15 and the city fell on May 18. Henry escaped back to Cyprus, but some prominent Franks did not, like the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, who drowned in the sea while trying to board a ship. The Templars held on to their headquarters in the city for another ten days, but they were eventually defeated and executed. By August, the Mamluks had taken Tyre and Beirut and all the other remaining crusader cities and castles.  There may have been as many as 100,000 refugees on Cyprus in 1291, in addition to the people who had fled there after the conquest of Antioch and Tripoli. It was an enormous economic and humanitarian crisis. The refugees weren’t just Latin Catholic Franks either, they also included Syriac and Armenian and maybe other kinds of Christians from the mainland, who were also targeted by the Mamluks (as allies of the Franks, and for their ongoing attempts to ally with the Mongols).  >“Many of them, both Franks and Christian Syrians, were reduced to poverty, and their condition must have been made worse by a series of harvest failures in the mid-1290s. The king and his mother are said to have done much to alleviate distress: in 1296 Henry issued an ordinance designed to control the price of bread, and he is also reported to have recruited refugee knights and sergeants into his service…A number of leading families from the kingdom of Jerusalem had acquired property in Cyprus long before, but many people lost their entire means of support in the disasters of 1291. After the fall of Acre, the Templars and Hospitallers established their headquarters in the island, and Cyprus also became the home for other religious communities that had fled the Muslim conquests.” (Edbury, pg. 101-102)  Some may have continued on back to Europe eventually, especially if they were new arrivals - crusaders from Venice, Pisa, Genoa, and England had taken part in the defence of Acre. But the most part the Frankish refugees had been born in the crusader states and didn’t know Europe at all. They stayed on Cyprus, the closest thing they had to a home.  At the time, some believed this might just be a temporary loss. There were plans for new crusades, but they would be much more difficult without foothold on the coast. The Templars tried to invade the mainland in 1299-1300 but they failed. New attempts to ally with the Mongols also failed. By the early 14th century when it was clear that the Mamluk conquest was secure, Frankish merchants were allowed to travel and trade on the mainland, and Latin Catholic religious communities (like the Franciscan and Dominican monastic orders) were allowed to settle there by the middle of the century. But the Mamluks ensured that no Frankish political/military presence was ever allowed to return.  The Mamluks occasionally raided Cyprus but never really tried to conquer it. The Franks continued to rule over a diverse population of Greeks, Latins, Syrians, and Armenians until 1489 when the kingdom became a colony of Venice. In 1571 it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, which by that time had also conquered the Mamluk territories in Syria and Egypt  So, in brief, none of the Franks chose to live under Mamluk rule because the Mamluks didn’t give them that option. A hundred years earlier in 1191 the crusaders were able to recover Acre and partially restore the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1291 the Mamluks didn’t want to leave anything or anyone for them to recover. Urban defences were destroyed, and all the Franks were either killed in the fighting or taken prisoner and/or enslaved. Most of those who were able to escape fled to the the only remaining crusader state, the nearby Kingdom of Cyprus.  Sources:  Hans E. Mayer, *The Crusades*, 2nd ed., trans.

989fuguo	Kinda! Linear B turned out to (1) be very similar to a language we knew very well (classical Greek), (2) related to other languages we also knew well (the entire reconstructed PIE corpus), and (3) have preserved place names which matched close enough to those mentioned in the script. So collections of symbols which disproportionately showed up in a place were assumed to stand for something very similar to their later place name.  It’s like if you noticed the places named “San Francisco”, “San Jose, “San Diego”, “Santa Clara” all started with the same symbol, and then you filled in “san” everywhere else you have that symbol, in words like “sandals” or “sanctuary” (this is merely an English analogy). It didn’t take terribly many of those sorts of clues to start figuring out all of the Linear B syllables symbols, as, as I mentioned, we know Ancient Greek very, very well and we successfully guessed it was Greek.	1643167066.0	hu8vrtq	t3_scisyy	t1_hu8dvtw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scisyy/why_hasnt_the_indus_valley_script_been_deciphered/hu8vrtq/

4sv8x	Hi there! You’ve asked a question along the lines of ‘why didn’t I learn about X’. We’re happy to let this question stand, but there are a variety of reasons why you may find it hard to get a good answer to this question on /r/AskHistorians.    Firstly, school curricula and how they are taught vary strongly between different countries and even different states. Additionally, how they are taught is often influenced by teachers having to compromise on how much time they can spend on any given topic. More information on your location and level of education might be helpful to answer this question.    Secondly, we have noticed that these questions are often phrased to be about people's individual experiences but what they are really about is why a certain event is more prominent in popular narratives of history than others.    Instead of asking "Why haven't I learned about event ...", consider asking "What importance do scholars assign to event ... in the context of such and such history?" The latter question is often closer to what people actually want to know and is more likely to get a good answer from an expert. If you intend to ask the 'What importance do scholars assign to event X' question instead, let us know and we'll remove this question.    Thank you!	1643167611.0	hu8x0gx	t3_scsa5l	t3_scsa5l	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scsa5l/why_do_we_not_learn_about_henry_fords/hu8x0gx/

4sv8x	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1643167786.0	hu8xesd	t3_sclx0u	t3_sclx0u	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sclx0u/is_there_a_historical_reason_we_dont_all_refer_to/hu8xesd/

u6ezf	Krupp licensed its armour plate technology to the British - who improved it to the point that British armour was about 10% stronger than German. And so on. The presumption of the primacy of private over public interests was very strong in both Germany and Britain, but also the realisation that some technologies simply could not be kept secret - better to make money on a license than have it copied for free.	1643168345.0	hu8yo2s	t3_ru8k84	t1_hr3w67c	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ru8k84/before_wwi_the_british_were_locked_in_a_hideously/hu8yo2s/

It's really good, lots of colorful characters, and Fink's wonderful wordsmithing combine well. Even if you're not looking for academic rigor, this is a worthwhile read.

bkb37	One of the defining characteristics of COVID time for me has been the feeling that things don't really seem to happen *to us as individuals* anymore. Sure, we're living through a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, and in that sense history is being produced in overdrive, but for quite a while over the spring of 2020 it really felt like history had well and truly come to a halt, in a way that Francis Fukuyama had never predicted. The massive protest movement that sprung up in the summer of 2020 almost seemed to exacerbate the feeling, strangely; again, after the first few weeks, where it felt like we were living through an unprecedented moment again, the lack of concrete change other than tokenistic street-renaming made things feel very stagnant, and our personal lives seemed to be stuck in uncertain limbo more than ever.  That, if you ask me, is the chief characteristic of COVID time: things are both happening much faster than we're used to, and yet nothing ever seems to really change either. It's not simply that time passes differently now; the passage of time has diverged, or forked, into historic time and utterly non-historic time, more than it ever had previously. It was always a bit difficult to see the connection between the everyday moments that somehow joined together to make up the sweep of a month or a year, but now it seems impossible.   Strange as the comparison may be, then, in a way, we share this with the people of the late 1920s and early 1930s in the Soviet Union. The feeling that history is moving faster than ever and yet that our personal lives stay more motionless than ever is in fact very, very Soviet. It's the tension at the heart of basically every Soviet diary written in the early Stalin period, and why so many people struggled to make sense of their place in Stalinist society. Not because they opposed the restrictions on their political freedom, not because they rejected the new social organization as unjust or illiberal, but because they *did* try to see themselves in it, to write their lives as though they were a "positive hero" of Socialist Realism, and they couldn't measure up.   Now, I will admit, there's a pretty big difference in theory. Life in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and early 1930s was supposed to have "broadened", become faster, fuller, more cultured. ​The average Soviet proletarian was supposed to have access to all manner of self-actualizing activities the moment they stepped out of their factory at the end of the working day, from vocational training to factory literary circles to theatrical productions to sport clubs. That's not exactly quarantine torpor. But there is a similarity. Soviet citizens who did not have access to this broadened life, or probably even many who did, must have felt a disconnect between their daily lives and the supposed march of history towards a world ever more meaningful and joyous, in the same way that we feel time seeming to speed up around us and yet our daily lives become more of a homogenous blur. As Yulia Pyatnitskaya wrote in her diary,  > Every day that I live pushes me further back. New machines are being built: lathes, agricultural tools, machines for the Metro, for bridges, etc... Engineers are raising in new ways questions of organization and the technology of tool production. In general, there is no doubt that life is moving forward, regardless of any 'spokes in the wheel.' The wonderful Palace of Culture for the ZIS factory. I’m downright envious: why aren’t I in their collective?  History was rushing towards utopia, and it must have seemed to many people that they were the only ones unable to experience it. Our culture hardly thinks that our current moment is rushing towards utopia, of course; but I think there is a feeling that we are ever more relegated to watching history unfold from the sidelines.  ___  There's also the more mundane matter of the Soviet calendrical reforms. First, in January of 1918, the reform from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian, jumping forward twelve days — talk about time being out of whack. In December of that year, the Council of People's Commissars created a new list of Soviet holidays to stand alongside and eventually replace the old Orthodox ones. This was, in my opinion, the moment of creation for the Bolshevik calendar as a concept, more than simple pan-European modernization. This Bolshevik calendar entered a new phase in 1925, when Lenin's death (January 21, 1924) joined the list as the highest holiday in the growing Lenin cult, and several new dates were marked as special, though they remained working days.  The Bolshevik calendar and the new way to experience time that it brought also came into conflict with the Orthodox church more and more directly. Starting in 1923, the church signaled a willingness to move to the Gregorian calendar, but soon reneged; the Soviet state, meanwhile, went ahead, not only basing its Bolshevik celebrations on the Gregorian calendar, but proceeding to shift Orthodox holidays to the Gregorian calendar as well. Julian holidays were Gregorian working days and vice versa, and the conflict between the two was a point of leverage for the state as it pressured the church to submit to its authority.  The high-water mark of calendrical reform came in 1929. Industrial production kicked into overdrive with the introduction of the First Five-Year Plan, while avant-garde artistic and leftist political radicalism experienced a new rush of toleration. Caught up in this heady environment, the Soviet state instituted a five-day continuous workweek, or *nepreryvka* in Russia. Under this scheme, laborers would have four days on and one day, with no single day shared by all of society. The *nepreryvka* had great benefits in theory; it disassociated the working week from any religious origins, but mainly, by giving people different days off, factories could continue to produce without interruption.  In practice, though, the *nepreryvka* was awkward at best and painful at worst. Workers objected to the loss of their common day off which they could spend with their families; even some days which they would not have taken off had religious holidays associated that provided color and variety to the workweek. Non-factory institutions, meanwhile, from shops to cafeterias to clubs, often failed to shift to the *nepreryvka*, causing confusion and inefficiency. And worst of all to the state, which, obsessed with production in the First Five-Year Plan, had instituted this workweek in attempt to raise productivity, machines couldn't actually handle constant operation, leading to frequent stoppages and breakdowns. The five-day *nepreryvka* was dropped in favor of a six-day week in 1931, as the wave of cultural radicalism crested, and then in favor of a seven-day week again in 1940.  The *nepreryvka*, then, was the ultimate Soviet attempt to dislocate time and usher in a new future, and a wonderful example of time going absolutely, and intentionally, out of whack. But when you compare it with the ways people have quit jobs, devoted time to hobbies, and pursued passions in the pandemic, it does begin to look actually quite unimaginative. There were all these intoxicating visions of utopian societies, both then and now, and the most that Stalin and co. actually cared to try for was... cutting out a day or two.  ___  Now, I haven't even talked about the ways that the revolution divided history into pre- and post-1917 time, or how both time either before or after 1917 was divided into relevant and irrelevant moments, but it's later than I planned to be writing this and I'm tired and this is a lot. So here you go, and maybe ask about it, if you give me a few days' heads-up.	1643168611.0	hu8z9e5	t3_scc4kv	t3_scc4kv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scc4kv/tuesday_trivia_time_timekeeping_this_thread_has/hu8z9e5/

1hl3phkl	To start I would like to state that I am not an expert on Korea under Japanese rule but I can read Japanese fluently enough to know the translation you have used is wrong. So I would like to ask where did you find that translation? Did you translate it by yourself? Did you perhaps copy paste a different verse?  This being said the gist of the song is correct. It is from the perspective of a comfort woman and does dehumanise the Korean comfort woman and is written in what seems to be a racist stereotypical accent. If the original text you included did not have the modern Japanese in the brackets I probably would not have understood it.  Here is the translation as I understood it, but do note it is in a very heavy accent but I will just translate the meaning as it is.  \>雨のショポショポ降るぱん（晩）に カラス（ガラス）のまと（窓）からのそ（覗）いてる まてつ（満鉄）のきぽたん（金）のぱか（馬鹿）やろう  At a night when the rain is falling, from out the glass window, a Mantetsu golden buttoned idiot is peeking in.  \>さわるはこちせん（五十銭）見るはたた（只） 三円こちせん（五十銭）くれたなら かしわ（鶏）の鳴くまで 付き合うわ  To touch is fifty sen. To watch is free. If you give me three yen and fifty sen I will go with you until the chicken calls. (Until the morning.)  \>あか（登楼）るの帰るの とうしゅる（どうする）の 早く精神ち（決）めなしゃい ち（決）めたらけた（下駄）もて あか（登楼）んなしゃい  Make up your mind and decide if you will enter\* or go home. If you decide to enter\* pick up you Geta (Japanese wooden clogs) and come in\*.  \*The Japanese word I translated as enter or come in is specifically used for visiting a brothel  \>お客さんこのころ（頃）紙高い ちょうぱ（帳場）の手前もあるてしょう（でしょう） こちせんしゅうき（五十銭祝儀）をはちみ（弾み）なさい  Dear customer at this time there is a receptionist (bouncer might fit better as you used) with a high price. Come and tip fifty sen quickly.  \>そしたら私はた（抱）いて寝て ふたち（二つ）もみっち（三つ）もおまけして かしわ（鶏）の鳴くまで ぽぽしゅる（ぼぼする）わ  \*This part uses a few slang and I am not fully confident translating it, and your translation does get the meaning across.  So hold me and lay down, and I will give you two or three freebies(?). Until the chicken calls (morning) you can use my pussy.  \>ああたま（騙）されたたま（騙）された こちせん（五十銭）金貨と思うたに ピールピン（ビール瓶）の栓かよ たま（騙）された  Ah I was tricked, I was tricked. I thought it was a fifty sen Gold coin but it turned out to be the cap of a beer bottle. I was tricked.  &#x200B;  While I have translated it using normal English as the original answer mentioned it is in a very thick accent which the original answer identifies as a stereotypical Korean accent. Or at least what racist colonial Japanese thought such as accent sound like.  Once again I would like to mention I am not challenging your answer about the question, just how you translated the song. Regardless, as you mentioned the song is racist and is making fun of the Korean comfort women. Saying they were happy to sell their body for just fifty sen and being so dumb they cannot tell the different between a gold coin and a beer bottle cap. So even if how you translated it is wrong the gist of your answer is still entirely correct.	1643169337.0	hu90ujn	t3_sc51j2	t1_hu75nk0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc51j2/how_were_korean_comfort_women_seen_by_their/hu90ujn/

ddvhx	Sure! Most of them are found in the context of Gilgamesh's relationship with Enkidu, so I'll start with Gilgamesh's prescient dreams about Enkidu, related by Shamhat in the Standard version starting on line 244 of Tablet 1 (A. R. George 2003), also appearing in the Old Babylonian version from the Pennsylvania Tablet, column 1 line 1.  In Gilgamesh's dreams, Enkidu appears symbolically in two forms as interpreted by Gil's mother; first as a meteorite and second as an axe.   The meteorite appears in line 248 of Tablet I in the Standard version:  >*kīma*(gim) *ki-iṣ-ru ša  ^d a-nim im-ta-naq-qu-tu e-lu ṣēri*(edin)*-ia*  Translated by A. R. George as "like lumps of rock from they sky they kept falling towards me" with "kisru sa a-nim" being literally "a lump of Anu," the sky god, e.g. a meteorite.   Then the axe is on line 278: >ḫa-ṣi-in-nu- na-di-ma eli(ugu)-šu paḫ-ru "an axe was lying and people were gathered around it"   In both dreams, Gilgamesh presents the object to his mother, and "loved it like a wife and I caressed and embraced it, and you made it my equal," which Gil's mother interprets in both cases to mean that Gilgamesh will find a companion and "you will love him like a wife, caressing and embracing him."  Susan Ackerman in "When Heroes Love" argues that both of these terms contain word-plays hinting at the nature of Gilgamesh and Enkidu's relationship: *kiṣru* for meteor is taken as a pun on the term *kezru* in the Standard version, and *haṣṣinnu* for axe in both the Old Babylonian and Standard versions is take as a pun on *assinnu*.  *Kezru* is a rare term but it seems to mean "a male with curled hair," though it has a feminine equivalent, *kezertu,* which is more common and "denotes a member of a class of women under the special protection of Ishtar, often mentioned beside *ḫarimtu*-women."  *ḫarimtu* has been translated often as "prostitute", and the association with the cult of Ishtar suggests to Ackerman that we should understand the female kezertu and male kezru as being "somehow sexualized in nature: 'a male wearing his hair in a distinctive manner to suggest prostitution' is how Benjamin R. Foster puts it." To me, that also brings to mind a line earlier in the Standard version, where Enkidu is described as being "adorned with tresses like a woman; the locks of his hair grow as thickly as Nissaba's" (lines 107-108 Tablet 1).  Ackerman continues: >Such a sexualized connotation further suggests that the wordplay is meant to indicate that the meteor representing Enkidu... is an object that, like a prostitue, is intended to entice Gilgamesh sexually.  Moving on to the *haṣṣinnu*/*assinnu* wordplay, *assinnu* is a controversial term which doesn't have a clear meaning, but is certainly someone in the cultic entourage of Ishtar "and thus someone who, through his associations with the goddess of sex and love, seems to have at least some eroticized aspects to his character. This again suggests that the pun found in Gilgamesh's axe-dream visions, in both the Old Babylonian and Standard versions, is meand to portray the axe or the metaphorical Enkidu that Gilgamesh imagines seeing in Uruk's streets, as an object that, like an *assinnu*, is meant to arouse his erotic desires." Ackerman quotes prof. Anne Kilmer:  >The implication of the double pun is, of course, that the often suspected, much discussed but of late rejected sexual relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu is, after all, the correct interpretation.  An interpretation that is supported by the repeated insistence that Gilgamesh will "love it like a wife and caress it," especially since the term for "caress," *ḫababu*, occurring previously in the text in reference to Enkidu and Shamhat's explicit love-making, the episode which frames the whole dream discussion in the Standard version.  Ackerman also points out that Gilgamesh bringing the axe/meteor/Enkidu to his mother is also consistent with a known near-eastern custom of bringing a lover before one's parents, known from various other contexts, then goes on to elaborate another possible wordplay: that the word for Gilgamesh taking such and placing it at his side, *aḫiya*, is a pun on the word for brother, "aḫum," and that referring to a lover as one's "brother" or "sister" was another long-standing tradition in the near east, attested also in Egypt and in the Bible.   Then there's the mysterious "pukku and meku," a pair of objects variously translated as "drum and staff, puck and stick, hoop and stick, ball and stick, musical scraper and stick" or many other things, associated with Gilgamesh's oppression of the youth of Uruk in Tablet 1 and seen in underworld narrative from Tablet 12, also appearing in the myth of the "Huluppu tree." Nobody can agree on what those were; most people take them as ceremonial implements or sports paraphernalia, but it's also been suggested that if you read Gilgamesh's oppression of the youth as being sexual in nature, then "pukku and meku" could be read as a pun for genitals; going along with Gil "mounting" the young men and making them cry out "Oh my back, oh my hips!" (I think this is lines 66-76 of Tablet 1, Standard).   Sources for more info:  mainly Susan Ackerman, "When Heroes Love: The Ambiguity of Eros in the Stories of Gilgamesh and David", 2005  A. R.

e7k4p	Technically, we sort of still do unofficially use them.  Have you ever bought a fifth of your preferred alcoholic beverage and wondered what it's a fifth of? 1/5 of a gallon, 4/5 of a quart, 757 milliliters, although it's now standardized at 750 ml, at various points called a short quart or commercial quart.  Similarly with pints, a short pint being 4/5 of a pint.  These are what Grant was referring to. Standardization was the reason for the changes in size and nomenclature.  For as long as people have been bottling and selling alcohol, they put it into whatever bottles they wanted and sold it as they saw fit.  In the US, the government started to take issue with this, especially with that short quart business, in the 1960s. To be clear, it was legal to sell 4/5 of a quart bottles, but calling it a quart was deemed too confusing.  This led to new regulations in bottle sizes, proposed by the ATF and codified into law taking effect in 1980.	1643171496.0	hu95css	t3_scuncl	t3_scuncl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scuncl/in_the_1959_film_north_by_northwest_cary_grants/hu95css/

qo8dj	First off you have to take all modern German beer and pour it down the sink. Although lagering (i.e. cold aging) was certainly done that far back, you didn't have anything like modern lagers. Lager yeast seems to be a hybrid between ale yeast and some kind wild New World yeast, possibly from Argentina. How that hybrid yeast ended up in German beer cellars is unclear but we don't have to worry about it because our Berlin burgher is going to be drinking top-fermenting beer with a wide variety of ingredients, the sort of beer that predominated in northern Germany before the malign influence of the Reinheitsgebot was imposed on northern Germany following German unification.  So, we're going to be getting some really old school beer that looks totally unlike modern German beer, but what kind? For a long time Berliner Weisse predominated in Berlin, which is a sour, low ABV wheat beer that almost went extinct before undergoing a very minor revival in recent years. It'd be probably be easier to find Gose for sale these days than Berliner Weisse and Gose is a roughly analogous style except a bit salty, which isn't the case with Berliner Weisse. For more information about this kind of beer and other older styles of German beer see Der Vollkommene Bierbrauer oder kurzer Unterricht all Arten Bier zu brauen (1784). It's main points are summarized here in English: Der Vollkommene Bierbrauer oder kurzer Unterricht all Arten Bier zu brauen  But we have a problem. You want 17th century beer, not 18th century. 17th century is a bit too early for Berliner Weisse and our information gets a bit more murky that far back but the kind of beer that your burgher was probably drinking would've been broyhan, which is now extinct.   Broyhan originated in Hannover, not Berlin, but Hannover was a big exporter of beer and Berliner Weisse SEEMS to be a descendant of that style of beer so it's a safe bet that something in the ballpark of broyhan would've been drunk by your burgher as his regular everyday drink.  OK, what the hell was broyhan?   Well, in general, historical styles of beer were a lot more loosely defined than modern ones and shifted around a lot over time and from brewer to brewer. If you do a google search for "broyhan" you'll find all kinds of conflicting things (dark vs. pale, what grains used, hops or not, etc.). because of that. One thing that's universally stated about old school broyhan was that it was a weissbier. In modern times "weissbier" means a wheat beer but that was NOT the case in the early modern period. Weissbier at the time meant that it used air-dried malt (luftmalz) which would've been a lot lighter in color than more heavily kilned malt, giving the beer a light "white" (i.e. "weiss") color. However, broyhan often DID contain wheat.  What else do we know? Broyhan was probably quite weak as pre-modern malting techniques were quite inefficient and older strains of yeast were not very attenuative (i.e. the yeast left a lot of sugars leftover in the beer compared to modern yeast) also some descriptions of it say that it was sour which meant that there was bacteria in the beer competing with the yeast. This is a bit later than I'd like for your question, but a good detailed description of the beer can be found in the 1773   Oekonomische Encyklopädie, the relevant passage translated here: [barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2008/03/breihan-broyhan-part-ii.html](https://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2008/03/breihan-broyhan-part-ii.html)  "Wiessbier or Breihan    Beer is also brewed from wheat malt, either from that alone or with the addition of barley malt, sometimes without hops, sometimes with a very small amount of hops. The general name of this beer is Breihan or Broihahn; in many pplaces it is also called Weissbier, although this is mostly made from air-dried barley malt \[Luft-Malz\]. I want to only say this and that, because anyhow you can refer for everything else to the general instructions. When just wheat malt is to be used, which must be air-dried or only very lightly kilned, so that there is no brown to be seen, to give the beer a yellowish-brown colour; so it can be reckoned, for example, for 3 Tonne \[1 Braunschweig Tonne = 101.18 litres\] beer 12 at most 15 bushels of malt, partly because wheat is more than double the price of barley; partly also because it contains more than twice as much strength, which is extracted during brewing . Brewing itself is carried out exactly as shown on page 153, except that usually when the wort is drawn off it is allowed to run through some hops, although it wouldn't be incorrect, for a brew of 30 Tonne, to soak a few pounds of hops in warm water for 1 or 2 hours and to later mix this extract thoroughly with the wort. To give just one example, I will detail the method of brewing Breihan which Hr. Verf. des Chemischen Lehrbegriffs from the Wallerius gives, and which presumably must be used in Sweden. It consists of the following:      'Take 2.5 parts of barley malt, a half part of wheat malt and as much oat malt and air-dried malt as you want. After they have all been mixed, they are milled, and wort made in the way beer is made, except that a handful of hops is laid in front of the hole in the Gestelkübel \[a tub in a frame\]. About 3 to 4 Kanne of this \[the wort\] are specially drawn off; of the remainder, a fifth is boiled and afterwards, while it is still warm, mixed with finely ground spices, such as cloves, cinnamon, coriander seeds, Galgant \[ don't know what that one is\] and violet root; when it has cooled, start it fermenting with a good fermentation medium, including two parts of French brandy. Afterwards, watch to see when the peaks and towers raised during fermentation begin to collapse. As soon as this happens, the liquid has to be put into barrels and the barrels filled with the wort which was held back.'"      It doesn't note the kind of yeast used or whether there was bacteria in it, because that wasn't well understood back then.  So what do we get? A pale very lightly hopped beer with spices and probably some amount of bacteria imparting sourness as more modern Berliner Weiss which seems to have developed out of this style was certainly sour. Later on brewers figured out how to keep bacteria out the beer better but I wouldn't count on 17th century brewers to have a good handle on this.  So, what beer can you buy that would taste like this?  Well, none. Nobody brews beer like this anymore.   But if you want to get in the right ballpark get a Belgian white ale, since those already have coriander generally speaking and maybe sprinkle in a tiiiiiny bit of cinnamon and cloves. Then mix that with a modern Berliner Weisse if you can find it, if not grab any lightly hopped sour wheat beer you can get your hands on, perhaps a Gose, then water the mix down a bit (early modern beers wouldn't have been as carbonated as modern ones and were fairly weak) and a little bit of sugar syrup to imitate the lower level of attenuation. That won't be quite right, but it'll be as close as you can get.	1643173219.0	hu98pjf	t3_sbxxac	t3_sbxxac	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbxxac/im_a_burgher_in_17th_century_berlin_how_is_the/hu98pjf/

c87eyxyh	I’m not necessarily a naval expert but the IJN didn’t fully buy into the battleship doctrine of Euro-American sea superiority. Since the days of “gunboat diplomacy” employed by European powers the battleship was considered the most powerful weapon on Earth. It was the atomic bomb of the early 20th century. Sending the  battleship fleet was akin to the threat of a nuclear strike. Battleships were a nation’s power manifest and treaties often involved negotiating how many battleships a nation could have.   Japan knew how expensive battleships were to build and maintain. They only floated about 12. Turned off by the resource drain, Japan instead took a leading interest in air power and was convinced early on that aerial superiority was the future of warfare. This was reinforced by the British victory at Taranto over Italy in 1940; an air squadron disabled 3 battleships, a cruiser, and two destroyers. This kind of power was unheard of to the old brass of WW1. Japan took that knowledge and invested in a mobile air fleet that could project power and reach across the Pacific, culminating in the attack on Pearl Harbor just a year later in 1941.  Japan’s most effect vessels were probably their aircraft carriers, followed closely by their destroyer and sub fleet. Submarines were devastating in WW2; the US practically leaned on the sub fleet for any effectiveness for months after Pearl Harbor. Probably the most effective sea weapon of either side was the torpedo. Whether dropped by torpedo bombers or launched by submarines they absolutely sank the majority of the tonnage in the war. At one point the Japanese invested in something of an aircraft carrier sub (the I400) that could launch two torpedo bombers and even retrieve them after their mission. Had the US not pressed the Japanese homeland with the seizure of Iwo Jima, the I400 fleet would have launched an attack on the Panama Canal channel locks (such an attack would drain Gatun Lake) to cut the trans American Allied supply lines. The subs were en route in June 1945 before being recalled to protect the homeland from imminent US invasion.   After Midway, Japanese air mobility in the Pacific was largely crippled. Air forces launched from land were still threats to US battleships and carriers, so it was the large IJN destroyer fleet that picked up the slack and hunted our sub fleet. The Philippine Sea would see the demolition of Japan’s air power and Leyte Gulf effectively reduced the IJN surface fleet. With the loss of the oil fields of Southeast Asia, the IJN had no oil to power its ships, essentially ending the reach of then navy. From then on the war was about uprooting the IJA and striking the homeland to cripple industry and moral.  For all of the early effectiveness of the carriers, subs, and destroyers, Japan could not keep up with American industrial might. We didn’t have the best or the largest equipment but we had more and we got it where it needed to be. We were fast and effective. The only cumbersome superweapon the US really employed was the atomic bomb, which has unfortunately haunted humanity ever since.	1643176070.0	hu9dvas	t3_scxwpq	t3_scxwpq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scxwpq/which_ships_of_the_imperial_japanese_navy_in_wwii/hu9dvas/

bxxavjax	Your answer is factually incorrect.  Elizabeth Woodville was most certainly not on good terms with Richard III. He stripped her of all her landholdings given to her by her husband. She conspired with Margaret Beaufort to marry her daughter, Elizabeth of York, to Henry Tudor (which ended up happening) once he returned to England, and was positioned alongside Buckingham and the Stanleys *against* Richard.  Regarding your comment on Titulus Regius, legal document or not, medieval lineage was a product of birthright and bloodlines. Wars had been fought over a persons right to be King which did not hold legal standing. As long as the Two Princes were alive, Richard’s crown was under threat. He didn’t want any future figureheads for any rebellion of the nobility to coalesce around. They were spectres of his own illegitimacy.	1643181692.0	hu9mgto	t3_scai1f	t1_hu878lf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scai1f/was_henry_vii_not_richard_iii_the_real_culprit/hu9mgto/
6y02w	The story of your dissertation seems super interesting, but I'm confused.  You seem to say that nation-states come up with interpretations of the past that help solve current problems, not that accurately describe past problems.  How does this support the traditional narrative? It seems like this argument would say "the traditional narrative is solving a problem that the Roman nation state had 200 years after the social wars, not accurately describing what happened with the social wars".  I'm sure I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, I don't know much about the social wars besides from pop history, but I don't understand the logic you're using. What am I misunderstanding here?	1643181786.0	hu9mli9	t3_scm1uv	t1_hu7be0a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scm1uv/how_does_one_go_about_finding_something_new_in/hu9mli9/

9orrg	Generally no, but: Languages _in general_ do not and did not. Nomadic societies aren't exceptional in this case.  Romani never had a unified standard and only recently has been shifting toward some uniformity. Mongolian only had established written forms around when they shifted toward Empire in the Chinese model, adopting the old Uyghur script (what's used today) or ʼPhags-pa or other external scripts. Khoe uses the Latin script.  A notable exception is Tifinagh used to write Berber, which has a considerably longer history of use.  The vast majority of languages of the world do not have writing (or did not until recently and most still don't). I'm not sure there's been a proper accounting of it, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if languages spoken by nomadic societies had no statistically significant difference to those of more stationary societies prior to the modern era.	1643183158.0	hu9ogg4	t3_s7qqa4	t1_hu21jg7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu9ogg4/
fz8r3	Let's look at what Chamberlain himself wrote privately to the Archbishop of Canterbury a few days later:  >"I am sure that some day the Czechs will see that what we did was to save them for a happier future, and I sincerely believe that we have at last opened the way to that general appeasement which alone can save the world from chaos."  Missing in this is anything about ulterior motives or a grand strategy; Chamberlain genuinely believed that appeasement was the best and only way to deal with Hitler's demands.  Give into them, and avoid war.  At the end of October, he made an even more direct statement about rearmament in a Cabinet meeting where he lashed out at those ministers who had argued for a more robust expansion of it and even hoped Munich might eventually result in arms *reductions*:  >"A good deal of false emphasis had been placed…on rearmament, as though one result of the Munich Agreement had been that it will be necessary for us to add to our rearmament programmes. Acceleration of existing programmes was one thing but increases in the scope of our programme which would lead to a new arms race was a different proposition. [He] hoped that it might be possible to take active steps and to follow up the Munich Agreement by other measures, aimed at securing better relations,” just as he also hoped that “some day we should be able to secure a measure of limitation of armaments, but it was too soon to say when this would prove possible."  So, no, Chamberlain was no 5 dimensional strategic chess player buying time; he was someone who honestly believed that if he properly appeased Hitler there would be "peace in our time."  Interestingly enough, while Harris - who besides writing great thrillers generally does outstanding research (there are 53 references at the end of his *Munich* book) and stays relatively close to actual history as the spine of his stories - has been far more sympathetic to Chamberlain over the years than most, even he doesn't go so far as to have his fictional PM of the book assert that he was trading away land for time; that's a movie addition.  Now the interesting part is that this indeed has been an argument raised by various historians over the years who've defended the Munich agreement; Great Britain indeed badly needed to modernize its air fleet, and 1939 saw not just Spitfires and Hurricanes ramp up manufacturing but also a vast investment building Chain Home (radar) stations.  But the gaping hole in that argument is that 1938 Germany wasn't exactly ready to go into a two front war either; Erich von Manstein stated shortly after the war that "neither our western border nor our Polish frontier could really have been effectively defended by us, and there is no doubt whatsoever that had Czechoslovakia defended herself, we would have been held up by her fortifications, for we did not have the means to break through."  This has been generally confirmed by a variety of military analysis; in short the West feared 1938 Germany a lot more than it should have - partially thanks, believe it or not, to Charles Lindbergh, whose estimates of Luftwaffe strength were wildly off but also widely believed by a good part of the political leadership.  The underlying problem was that Germany took better advantage of that year of peace than did the Western allies, and in the process they closed the gap significantly.  That was the immediate failure of Munich.  A terrific recent book that goes through this is Tim Bouverie's *Appeasing Hitler: Chamberlain, Churchill and the Road to War*, who looks to be one of the better young writers of popular history for years to come.	1643183748.0	hu9p9ig	t3_scipvu	t3_scipvu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scipvu/the_new_film_munich_the_edge_of_war_argues_that/hu9p9ig/

i6kyb	Hi there! You’ve asked a question along the lines of ‘why didn’t I learn about X’. We’re happy to let this question stand, but there are a variety of reasons why you may find it hard to get a good answer to this question on /r/AskHistorians.    Firstly, school curricula and how they are taught vary strongly between different countries and even different states. Additionally, how they are taught is often influenced by teachers having to compromise on how much time they can spend on any given topic. More information on your location and level of education might be helpful to answer this question.    Secondly, we have noticed that these questions are often phrased to be about people's individual experiences but what they are really about is why a certain event is more prominent in popular narratives of history than others.    Instead of asking "Why haven't I learned about event ...", consider asking "What importance do scholars assign to event ... in the context of such and such history?" The latter question is often closer to what people actually want to know and is more likely to get a good answer from an expert. If you intend to ask the 'What importance do scholars assign to event X' question instead, let us know and we'll remove this question.    Thank you!	1643186553.0	hu9su11	t3_sd0am1	t3_sd0am1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0am1/why_is_the_muslim_crisis_of_the_19th_century/hu9su11/
i6kyb	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643186591.0	hu9svr6	t3_sd18tp	t3_sd18tp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd18tp/after_the_stock_market_crash_were_there_ads_made/hu9svr6/

1fm87vy1	While I cannot comment on Finland and Sweden, I am familiar with the legal side of school organisation in Austria.  School education was declared compulsory by the "Allgemeine Schulordnung für die deutschen Normal- Haupt und Trivialschulen in sämmtlichen Kaiserl. Königl. Erbländern", a law passed during the rule of Empress Maria Theresia on December 6th, 1774. The school year was divided into a Winter term and a Summer term.  Please note: in the following paragraphs "school" denotes a so-called "Trivialschule" or "Volksschule", a sort of elementary school which was attended for either 6 or 8 years, depending on the era and which provided education to all people, regardless of their class. Other, "higher" schools (Hauptschulen, Mittelschulen, Bürgerschulen) could have varying terms - in places where such schools existed, the Volksschule was expected to adjust their terms to the higher school's terms (later laws only stated that if different schools existed in one place, they had to unify their terms).  The terms were handled differently for city schools and rural schools. City kids were expected to attend both terms. Winter term started on the Saturday before Nov 3rd and ended on the Saturday before Palm Sunday. After two weeks of Easter break, school would resume with the Summer term from Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter and go on until Michaelmas. The main break therefore was the entirety of October, with a smaller break around Easter.  For children in rural areas, the Winter term started on Dec 1st and went on until "at least" the end of March. The Summer term was the same as for city kids, timewise. However, because the children were expected to help with work during Spring and Summer (explicitly stated in the law), they were not expected to attend the Summer term, which was compulsory only for the six- to eight-year-olds (on account of them being unable to withstand the harsh winter weather on their way to school). During harvest, the Summer term could be interrupted by three weeks of break, if necessary.  Subsequent reforms granted local authorities greater autonomy. The reform of 1869 and 1870, respectively, saw the duration of the school year set to 46 weeks, with the remaining six weeks of the year being set as "Hauptferien" (main break). The start of the school year was not strictly determined, but as a rule had to be between September 1st and November 1st. The exact position of the break was to be set by local authorities in accordance with the circumstances and the employment type of the local population.   For Tyrol and Vorarlberg, special leave could be given during summer months. While this rule wasn't explicitly set into an agricultural context, both Vorarlberg and Tyrol were provinces where cattle was (and is) traditionally driven to mountain pastures in the summer (typically from May to St. Bartholomew's Feast on August 24th or early September), where especially boys where supposed to help with herding.  Another reform in 1905 shortened the school year to ten months, with the remaining two months comprising the Hauptferien. School (again) started between September and November. The law explicitly states that the break could be positioned freely by local authorities, so that children were available for important field work (examples given are vintage and potato harvest).  In 1941, the start of the school year was moved to September for the entirety of the German Reich. Unfortunately, I have not found a reasoning for fixing September as the starting month, other than that it seemed to already be the case in most areas of the Reich, seeing as the law explicitly dictated September for those areas where that wasn't already the case. Subsequent laws in Austria (1964 and 1985 respectively, the latter with a number of additional changes) more or less kept this rule, with school starting on the first or second monday in September (some schools could, however, start as early as August 16th).   To conclude, agricultural work factored into the design of the Austrian school year until the 1940s, and is explicitly mentioned in the corresponding laws. However, the rules were tailored either to the entirety of the planting and harvesting season or offered flexibility in setting the break between the Summer and Autumn months, according to local necessity. July and August did not seem to be especially important in that context.	1643191255.0	hu9ylol	t3_scc4kv	t1_hu8bkqw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scc4kv/tuesday_trivia_time_timekeeping_this_thread_has/hu9ylol/

From what Google tells me, the author / collector seems to have deliberately remained anonymous, so I infer from that that there would have been some repercussions for the people involved had they been known (and in Burns' case, still alive.) Is that correct?  &#x200B;  Secondly, if I wanted to buy a book like this in the 18th century, could I buy it from a normal bookshop? Or would the content mean it was a bit harder for me to get my hands on?	1643195092.0	hua3fca	t3_sch20f	t1_hu7gx63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sch20f/how_was_robbie_burns_nae_hair_ont_received_by_his/hua3fca/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1643195209.0	hua3kvy	t3_sd2z7k	t3_sd2z7k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd2z7k/does_padshahnama_mention_taj_mahal/hua3kvy/

1wbc	This is more of a clarifying question than a proper response but I have a few examples up my sleeve too.  It's not like 6th century Italians looked around at Roman aquaducts and wondered "what the heck are those things?" They knew what they were and retained the basic principles of their construction. They built enclosed irrigation systems, after all, and bridges. Combining those two technologies gets you aquaducts but it's expensive and difficult and not the sort of thing that anyone without a population center the size of late Republican Rome is going to bother with.  So, I think we need to separate the concept of "did people forget that something was possible" from "did they lose the ability to do it" from "did they just stop doing it because it wasn't worth it anymore."  Continuing with the Roman period, the Augustin legions used a banded mail breast plate called the Lorica Segmentata. The use of that armor diminished as the empire declined due mostly to expanse and diminished need but it's not as if Romans couldn't make one if they felt like it.  Contrast that with the construction of the Pantheon dome - a free standing concrete dome, the likes of which wouldn't be seen in Europe for about another 1000 years. Generations of people walked through the Pantheon who had absolutely no idea how one might build such a thing. But they still knew that domes were possible... just beyond them.  I'm struggling to come up with an example of an actual lost technology - one where even the idea of the thing vanishes. The best I can manage is the use of primitive steam engines in children's toys and the like, but I expect that's a failing on my part rather than historical contemporaries. I expect that someone with a better background on the history of steam power could document continuous knowledge that boiling water can turn thermal energy into rotational energy.  But - back to that clarifying question. When you talk about a technology being lost, which of these do you mean?	1643203269.0	huagn8y	t3_sd0f30	t3_sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huagn8y/
ajdl30e8	Thank you very much for this. Indeed, I am trying to as you explained, no fancy French theory needed.   My questions for medieval agriculture pertain to what kind of relationship with nature they exhibited, and less so to the usual transfer of techniques or social structures that govern them. I guess my issue is that the sources I am using are the same that have been used before, and I am not finding much in them apart from answers to the old questions. Maybe a statement here and there about a personal opinion on trees saplings being similar to animal foetuses, but that's it. I should probably cast a wider net as to what can be considered a "source" for this, and not just the farming manuals which are the obvious ones to answer questions related to agriculture.   I wish I had access to diaries of agronomists or documentary evidence about land use patterns, but 11th century Spain doesn't have much in that way!	1643203416.0	huagxt3	t3_scm1uv	t1_hu8mkjg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scm1uv/how_does_one_go_about_finding_something_new_in/huagxt3/
um4xp	So these are fairly basic questions that one could easily look up, but I'll add a few more details. As regards your first question, the Panhellenic Games were all dedicated to deities: the games at Olympia and Nemea to Zeus, at Isthmia to Poseidon, and Delphi to Apollo. It's a cliché to say that the ancient Greeks had no word for "religion" because the gods were everywhere, but it's true. All of these festivals and games were organized to honour them. To the ancient Greeks, organizing a festival, whether big or small, without involving the deities would have been alien.   As regards the second question, very briefly -- the content of the plays did not have to relate to the deity celebrated. There were about a handful of playwrights during these occasions, and most of them would have performed in the play, too (or so the thinking goes). Plays were initially just a back-and-forth between the actor (or actor-playwright) and the chorus. In Athens, a jury was selected by lot who evaluated the plays and awarded a prize to the sponsor and/or the playwright. Prizes were mostly symbolic (e.g. a wreath), as per usual in the Greek world.    Again, the books I cited earlier are a good start to learn more.	1643204961.0	huak4dq	t3_sbpjil	t1_hu4yvte	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbpjil/generally_speaking_how_long_were_the_classic/huak4dq/

9i89m	Welcome to history!  At times it can seem as though half the world is applying gold leaf to portraits of their heroes, and the other half has buckets of hot tar that they're ladling over them. Henry Ford has certainly gotten more than his share of both gold leaf and tar. This is not something new, however. He bought the *Dearborn Independent* and in the 1920's he and his editors William Cameron and Ernest Liebold began writing and publishing articles about an international Jewish conspiracy, which Ford had felt was responsible for causing WWI. Ford was at the height of his popularity at the time, but there was a considerable outcry against the anti-Semitism of the articles, a defamation suit , and in 1929 Ford apologized and shut down the paper- but publicly faulted Cameron for it, even though Cameron was certainly following Ford's instructions. Ford's anti-Semitic beliefs were similar those of another rural Michigander, Charles Lindburgh, and likely in part came from widespread beliefs  among midwestern farmers about eastern New York bankers.   On the other hand, like Lindburgh, Ford didn't think he was anti-Semitic: he employed Jews at his factories and had a Jewish architect who designed them. He certainly had factories in Germany in 1933 when Hitler came to power but he had no love for the Nazis and they, not he, had control of them during the War. He was in favor of allowing Jewish refugees into the US at a time when most politicians were against it, and it was the viewing of film footage of the liberation of the concentration camps in 1945 that seemed to have been the final blow to his already deteriorating mental state.  It might be annoying to hear historians constantly say that something is complicated. Bur Ford really was complicated.  He wanted his workers to have a living wage, but he employed a thug, Harry Bennett, to have union organizers beaten up. In his huge economies of scale he built giant factories that employed thousands of workers and so created a dense urban landscape: yet he hated the dense urban landscape and thought everyone should live like they were in a small colonial-era village, going to church and attending square dances (and of course that small village and all the Founding Fathers were White, like him). He embraced the ideal of family life, but was a genuinely terrible father to his on Edsel. He had great sympathy for the hard life of a farmer, and was responsible for the development of both the farm tractor and the soybean industry, yet he resisted making any great changes to his Model T for years until finally forced to do so by his son and engineers.  Ford had so many contradictions that when Steven Watts wrote a biography of him, he decided to write about several people named Henry Ford. It was not a bad approach: one chapter for gold leaf, another chapter for tar.  Watts, S. (2006). The People’s Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century (Illustrated ed.).

1csgnzcu	Historian of technology here. The way you describe technology as something linear and progressive, and how these games portray it, has long been a very dominant way of thinking about technology. It's essentially thinking of technology as a series of groundbreaking innovations. And when a new innovation comes, it replaces an old one. Still a lot of people, and especially also politicians, think like this.   However, in historians of technology have disproved that view for a while now. Historically, technology has not developed linear, and if you stare blindly on innovations and new technologies, you will miss out on a lot of aspects of technology. Most of the technological development is about slow incremental improvement and maintenance.   I will give you an example: if we think about coal and steam engines, what is the century you would associate that the most with? Chances are that you would say the 19th century. Well, there has never been as much coal combustion as at the end of the 20th century. Fossil fuel power plants have never been as efficient as now, due to constant improvement and maintenance. We don't only have to look at when something was invented, but also when it is used.   Another example from my own research: when you think about nuclear power plants, chances are that you immediately think about uranium, futuristic control rooms, white lab coats, and radiation. Well, 80% of most nuclear power plants are water or steam components: pressure vessels, steam generatores, valves, pipes, pumps, etc. The first nuclear power plants were essentially spin-offs of fossil fuel power plants and nuclear weapons labs. And nowadays, more money (and political effort) goes into maintaining these old installations than in designing new ones.   So to answer your question: maintenance has only recently entered our thinking about technology, and this insight is still very absent in society I feel. And that's a problem I think, because if we were, we would devote much more resources to actually maintaining our current infrastructures (for instance, crumbling highway bridges, train tracks, corroding power plants) instead of only on innovation. And these games are not helping by spreading an essentially outdated view on technology.   In case you are interested: a great reading tip on this is Shock of the Old by David Edgerton.	1643206495.0	huani3t	t3_sd0f30	t3_sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huani3t/

nxyvc	I already wrote about this in the thread linked by /u/Holy_Shit_Heckhounds, but it's always worth expanding on just how unhistorical and even anti-historical the tech tree model is.  While tech trees work fine for a game, their fundamental flaw is that they treat technology as a quantifiable substance - something you can produce, collect, and own. Something of which you can have more than other people, which gives you an advantage even when you are equal in all other respects. From a historical perspective, this is simply not what technology is. There is no technology mine from which you can dig up more technology to put in your technology storehouse.  To put it simply, technology is practice. It does not emerge or exist outside of its practical application within a society, economy, or culture. It is not pursued or preserved for its own sake. It has no intrinsic value. A given technology either has a use (in which case it may be developed and passed on) or it doesn't.  Writing is a good example. The Mycenaean Greeks of the Late Bronze Age had a syllabic writing system (Linear B), which we can read. They seem to have used it primarily to keep administrative records: palace inventories, letters between governing officials, and so on. But when the palaces burned and the administrative structures that ruled from them disappeared, writing went with them.   When writing re-emerges in the Greek world some 400 years later, it is completely different: an alphabetic system, directly based on the Phoenician alphabet, which seems to be primarily used to mark objects with names and lines of poetry. The first written works of Greek literature are all poetry; it takes a century for the first written laws to appear, and many more centuries for writing to be reapplied to practical administration.  What happened here is not that writing was "lost" in the sense that people forgot how it worked and couldn't make it work anymore. Rather, with the fall of the palaces, writing simply lost its practical application. Why would anyone pass on the art when no one was using it for anything? Why would anyone take the time to learn how to write when there was no status or advantage to be gained that way? Writing didn't come back until a much changed society found a new use for it. (We could argue that the alphabetic script was objectively superior to the old syllabic one, but this is irrelevant because the Greeks had long forgotten it.) Again, technology has no value *of its own*; without practice, it is worthless. That includes technology of which we now think the value is self-evident.  You are right, then, to assume technology shouldn't be seen as a linear process of compounding improvement. But it also shouldn't be seen as something you need to "maintain" through the investment of resources. Rather, certain technologies will be kept when your society is currently using them, or lost when it isn't. This is in fact the same process as what we call "progress". Probably the most common reason for technology to be lost is the introduction of new technology that does the same job in a way that a society or culture perceives as better or more suited to its needs (cheaper, faster, using different materials, better aligned with other cultural practices, etc etc).   When modern states "invest in technology", they are still not pushing the creation of new tech for its own sake. They are creating and fostering a *culture* in which the invention of new technology is associated with wealth and social status. That is its practice. When we perceive history as a linear progression from simple to advanced technology, it is because we are so captured by a culture that values technological progress *as a moral and social good* (creating a practical use for technology even when the technology itself is useless) that we lose sight of how artificial this perspective is and how technology actually works historically.	1643207211.0	huap5hr	t3_sd0f30	t3_sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/huap5hr/

96gqp	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1643208069.0	huar61u	t3_sd6wtr	t3_sd6wtr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6wtr/looking_for_a_speech_by_a_british_barbarian_in/huar61u/

You’ll be able to find info online though. Compared to Boudicca he’s often overlooked, but I find his exploits actually more fascinating.  He may also have entered Welsh mythology (the word Caradoc being eponymous with him, which is a place name you find all over wales).	1643208144.0	huarcmo	t3_sd6wtr	t1_huaq29k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6wtr/looking_for_a_speech_by_a_british_barbarian_in/huarcmo/

168sly	The Russian Federation is called the Russian Federation because it is a federal republic, but that's a bit of a circular answer so I will provide some further background. I'll try to do a *very* brief rundown of Russian constitutional structure and nationality policy (they're related) from 1917 to now.  First I'll note that there actually never was a "Russian Soviet Socialist Republic". The entity that the Russian Federation is actually descended from is a mouthful that was known as the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (hereafter RSFSR because even I get the name mixed up).  The Russian Empire had been for the most part a unitary state - despite it having provinces, everything was directly controlled by the central government (and *that* government largely controlled by the tsar). The February 1917 revolution had replaced this government with a republic under the control of a Provisional Government *and* the Petrograd Soviet - there was no clear constitutional structure for the country, and elections to a Constituent Assembly were scheduled for December 1917, with the assembly to write a new constitution and sort everything out. The Petrograd Soviet (and soviets in general) by the way was not originally something controlled by the Bolsheviks, but a workers' council.  Anyway, before the Constituent Assembly elections, the Bolsheviks managed to gain a majority in the Petrograd Soviet and also overthrow the Provisional Government. They only got about 25% of the vote in the constituent assembly elections, and so closed that body down after one day of meeting. They then went on to write their own [constitution](https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/article1.htm) that was adopted in July 1918 for what was officially now known as the RSFSR.  The RSFSR reflected a lot of Lenin's ideas around the nationality question, namely that non-Russian ethnicities should not be oppressed by "Great Russian chauvinism", but should have as much autonomy as possible (as long as that autonomy broadly stayed within the confines of socialism acceptable to the Bolsheviks). A big part of this was for tactical reasons, as numerous nationalities of the former Russian Empire had already declared independence, or had asserted a great deal of local control.   As such, the 1918 constitution asserted:  >"The Russian Soviet Republic is organized on the basis of a free union of free nations, as a federation of soviet national republics."   And also explicitly recognized the independence of Finland and the right of Armenia to "self-determination".   The federation was supposed to be voluntary:  >"In its effort to create a league- free and voluntary, and for that reason all the more complete and secure- of the working classes of all the peoples of Russia, the Third Congress of Soviets merely establishes the fundamental principles of the Federation of Russian Soviet Republics, leaving to the workers and peasants of every people to decide the following question at their plenary sessions of their soviets, namely, whether or not they desire to participate, and on what basis, in the Federal government and other Federal soviet institutions."  Anyway - as matters turned out, there were parts of the former Russian Empire that were not part of the RSFSR, namely Byelorussia, Ukraine, and the Caucasian countries of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Through the Russian Civil War these republics ended up under Bolshevik control by 1921, but were still formally independent countries, whose ruling parties happened to be sections of the Bolshevik Party in Russia, and whose foreign relations operated out of Russian embassies. There was some internal debate over how to reorganize matters. Stalin favored absorbing these republics directly into the RSFSR, but Lenin opposed this, and his view prevailed. This resulted in the 1922 Union Treaty which established the USSR.  The USSR then was actually a federation of federations: the member states were the RSFSR (a federation), the Transcaucasian SSR (which was a federation of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan), and the Byelorussian SSR and Ukrainian SSR, which weren't federations. A constitution for this union was enacted in 1924, with newer ones in 1936 and 1977. The RSFSR itself got a new constitution in 1937 and again in 1978 to mirror the changes to the Soviet constitution. Of particular note in the 1977 Soviet constitution is the right of member states to secede from the Union, which was pretty much an unlikely and empty right as long as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union maintained its constitutionally-guaranteed monopoly on power across the USSR.	1643211698.0	hub0cd9	t3_sd1fny	t3_sd1fny	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd1fny/why_is_russia_called_the_russian_federation/hub0cd9/

I'm also going to bracket out militant Islamic groups in Northeast Africa and along the coast of East Africa because that requires getting into the geopolitics of the Red Sea, the Arabian peninsula, the quite specific history of Islam and Christianity in the Horn of Africa, etc.  So let's talk about West Africa instead, where there are militant groups identifying themselves as Islamic operating in the southern Sahara, across what is commonly called the Sahel (the arid region bordering the Sahara on its south side, Arabic for "shore") and the savannah areas just south of that in turn.   For the most part, Islam came into West Africa slowly across trans-Saharan caravan routes over a period many centuries, from the late 800s CE into the 1700s. Generally it was spread by merchants and caravan leaders--the merchants were frequently based in the cities of the North African coast or in Cairo, the caravans were generally made up of Berber-speaking pastoralists known as Tuaregs who were relatively early converts to Islam during its initial expansion into North Africa. For quite a long time, most converts were rulers of major urban centers or of centralized states along the Niger River's upper and central regions and a bit later in the Senegal River valley down to the Atlantic coast. For centuries, Islam was thus mostly the religion of royal courts, marketplaces and elite soldiers--it spread very slowly to general populations. Many rulers who converted to Islam also kept their ties to traditional religion, which sometimes led Islamic travellers and scholars in the region to write critically about the quality of Islamic observance there.   While it seems clear that wider populations might be basically fine with their rulers and many city people adopting Islam, there's some signs here and there of tension that intensified after 1400 CE or so. One major example of that is the career of Sonni Ali, who is generally regarded as the founder of the Songhay Empire, centered in the cities of Gao and Timbuktu along the Niger. Sonni Ali ruled from about 1464 to 1492, and while we don't know exactly why, we do know he was intensely anti-Islamic and persecuted Islamic scholars and followers in the major cities under his control. We know that primarily because Islamic scholars later on are the ones who are our major sources for the history of Songhay, and they are harshly critical of him while intensely praising his piously Muslim successor, Askia Muhammed.  On the other hand, just to show that Islam in West Africa up until fairly recent times was a complicated thing, in the Senegal River valley, Islamic practice was mostly influenced by Sufism and took on a really different cast, including being spread throughout communities fairly quickly for the most part.   So what changed? Well, starting in the late 18th Century, essentially at the tail-end of the most intense period of the Atlantic slave trade, a series of Islamic reform movements appeared in various parts of interior West Africa, most predominantly in the Senegal River valley and among the Hausa-speaking cities of what is now Northern Nigeria and Western Niger/Northern Benin. These movements drew numerous followers with great speed and proceeded to overthrow many of the existing rulers of various cities and towns. In general, the leaders of these movements argued that the rulers were corrupt and impious, that they didn't observe true Islamic principles--and in particular complained that the old rulers had committed the sin of enslaving fellow Muslims and selling them into the Atlantic slave trade. But they also argued that the old rulers had been too tolerant of "heathen" practices (or indulged in those themselves) and pushed for people to convert to a purer, more observant kind of Islam--they were very focused on the practices and pieties of the general population of the areas they controlled.   These movements had some resemblances to other waves of "fundamentalist" reform movements and uprisings elsewhere in the Islamic world in the 19th Century (and likely some actual connections in terms of ideologies and individuals as the 19th Century wore on). The route between that moment and the present is winding and indirect--militant groups in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, etc. today get weapons, operational goals, ideologies from sources outside the immediate region and are very influenced by the history of the last thirty years--but the 19th Century "jihad" reform movements are also a strong influence in various ways.	1643212667.0	hub2y1v	t3_scd446	t1_hua6ck4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scd446/as_per_pew_research_center_report_the_share_of/hub2y1v/

168sly	Anyway, now we can fast-forward to the end.   Gorbachev enacted a series of ever more radical reforms in an attempt to revive the Soviet economy and enforce greater accountability among the Communist Party elite. Ultimately, he decided to base his power in governmental structures over party structures, as the Party elite (perhaps unsurprisingly) were collectively dragging their heels implementing reforms that threatened their perks and power.   To this end, he removed the CPSU's constitutional monopoly on power, encouraged multicandidate (but not multiparty) elections, and created the office of Soviet President for himself. Mirror changes were made at the republican level, which ultimately saw the creation of a Russian Presidency and the popular election of Boris Yeltsin to that office in 1991. As a new constitutional order was negotiated in 1990 and early 1991, the Soviet Republics declared "sovereignty" in a so-called "war of laws", meaning that they proclaimed the primacy of republic law over Union law and claimed ownership of resources located within their borders. This wasn't "independence" per se (although Lithuania *did* declare independence) as much as negotiating positions staked out against the union government in establishing a new constitutional order. A new treaty, replacing the 1922 and replacing the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with a "Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics" was to be signed and enacted in August 1991 - the unsuccessful coup attempt that month was an attempt by conservative members of the Soviet government to prevent this from happening. In the ensuing power struggle between Gorbachev and Yeltsin in the months that followed, Soviet government power and institutions were effectively taken over by the Russian ones, and other republics swiftly declared independence, if they hadn't already done so. Yeltsin and the heads of Byelorussia and Ukraine met at Belovezha to sign an accord stating the 1922 Treaty was null, and after a couple weeks of negotiations 11 of the 15 more or less agreed to this in the Alma-Ata Protocol. Russia was recognized as the legal successor to the USSR, got the Soviet nukes, Security Council seat, and debt, and a new Commonwealth of Independent States was enacted as a very loose international organization. Gorbachev resigned a few days later and the last bits of the Union government came under Russian (ie Yeltsin's control).  However, the RSFSR technically did *not* cease to exist along with the USSR. It had been renamed in December 1991 to the Russian Federation, removing the old and unfashionable soviet and socialist bits, but otherwise keeping the 1978 constitution, albeit with heavy amendments. Most notably, this meant keeping a wide variety of federal "subjects" in the federation, as instituted in Soviet times according to nationalities policy. Mostly ethnic Russian areas tended to be oblasts (basically provinces), federal cities or krais (essentially territories), while areas with non-Russian nationalities were organized with different sorts of autonomy based on the perceived level of national development, from autonomous okrugs to autonomous soviet socialist republics (ASSRs). These latter were renamed to republics and there are 22 in the Russian Federation today. In the post Soviet period these republics likewise adopted constitutions and presidents, much like the Russian Federation did, and it was initially very unclear what their relationship to the central Russian government would be, if any.   Yeltsin had rather famously told RSFSR regions in August 1990 to "take as much sovereignty as they could swallow". This of course was when there was still a Union government, and no Russian presidency, and so his position in 1992 was somewhat different. Chechnya and Tatarstan most notably were *not* interested in any sort of union with Russia, and did not sign a March 1992 Federation Treaty with the Russian government that the other former ASSRs signed. In Tatarstan's case, protracted negotiations eventually led it to accept union with Russia in 1994, and in Chechnya's case the matter eventually led to the First and Second Chechen Wars.  The rest of Russia was part of the federation, and eventually a new constitution was enacted in 1993 to replace the 1978 one (this in itself was part of a protracted constitutional crisis that saw major fighting in Moscow and the shelling of the Supreme Soviet in October 1993). However, federal relations between the central government and the federal subjects was something of an absolute mess all throughout the 1990s (it wasn't terribly clear whose law took precedence over whose and in what circumstances). This wasn't really sorted out until the Putin presidency, most of which is beyond the 20 year rule. A big part of the sorting out was the asserting of the central government's authority as much as possible, including with the creating of extra-constitutional presidential plenopotentiaries overseeing federal districts made up of subject areas. Basically the central government asserted its control over the federation, with the federal form remaining on paper but much less federal relations in practice.  In conclusion - the Russian Federation is the direct continuation of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, as established in 1918. This federal system was often more formal window dressing than actual practice, but was considered (especially by Lenin) as a very important way to address nationalities policy. In a lot of ways, the Russian federal structure in both the Soviet and post-Soviet periods is more like the British federal structure than, say, the US one, namely that it is asymmetric (not all federal subjects get the same rights or autonomous) and its devolved (the federal subjects tend to get powers given to them by the central government, and this can change based on the policies and relative power of that government).	1643213296.0	hub4mgz	t3_sd1fny	t1_hub0cd9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd1fny/why_is_russia_called_the_russian_federation/hub4mgz/
n4bht	There was definitely pushback in the US when iodine was first introduced. Iodized salt was first introduced in the US in the 20s and some communities were worried they were getting "poisoned"; Cleveland in particular had quite a few households avoid iodine.  One of the weirdest events was the Bureau of Chemistry of the USDA wanting to put a skull and crossbones on the packaging to indicate poison (they eventually backed down).  There was a 1948 bill from the U.S. Endemic Goiter Committee trying to introduce the iodine nationally that was shot down (this is right when water fluoridation was happening).  I'm not clear why it didn't survive in the US as strongly as a conspiracy theory (I would theorize water-supply introduction was more universal and "insidious", allowing for wilder ideas like government mind-control), but it definitely still survives in both India and Pakistan as one. A good chunk of India believes iodine in salt to be a corporate conspiracy (see *Salt, toothpaste, and the CIA: conspiracy theory in contemporary Indian society* from a 2004 issue of *Skeptic*).	1643213325.0	hub4pda	t3_schf18	t1_hu98sx2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/schf18/fluoriderelated_conspiracy_theories_have_been/hub4pda/

esjzc	Why is Friday called 'Congregation Day' in Arabic?  I have looked at a previous Ask Historians thread about why Muslims congregate on Friday as well as searched online.  There is general agreement that the Quran commands muslims to congregate on 'Congregation Day' AKA Friday in Arabic, but this seems circular.  If Friday was already known as Congregation Day before this command, then why was that so? Was there a customary congregation on the 6th day in pre-Islamic Arabia? And if so, why the sixth day and for what purpose?  If Friday became known as Congregation Day AFTER the Quranic command, then why was the 6th day chosen?	1643213850.0	hub64ix	t3_sd6m46	t3_sd6m46	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6m46/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_26_2022/hub64ix/

6mur6sbz	>When modern states "invest in technology", they are still not pushing the creation of new tech for its own sake.  So what exactly drives technological innovation in premodern societies? The video game model tends to imply that, broadly, states need to invest in it. When the waterwheel was invented, could we expect that some king, noble or wealthy patron had an R&D guy paid to, well, invent? Or would it have been done "organically" by some enterprising peasant who had a problem that needed to be solved (i.e. milling flour)? Basically, would pre-industrial societies actively foster a culture of innovation, and would that correlate to increased technological progress/change where it was successfully done?	1643213354.0	hub4s4o	t3_sd0f30	t1_huap5hr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hub4s4o/

However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question.

Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643214784.0	hub8p28	t3_sd9xzo	t3_sd9xzo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd9xzo/so_i_was_wondering_do_you_like_the_virginia_plan/hub8p28/

16peg5l6	I will try to answer this the best that I can, but I would argue that it is hard to take the New Deal and lump it all together. Two great books that tackle this McElvaine’s Down and Out in the Great Depression: Letters for the Forgotten Man and his book simply title The Great Depression. The former is a collection of letters written to the Roosevelts during the Depression and serves as, at least in my opinion, a template for the latter book’s creation. The New Deal is a less monolithic piece of legislature than it is often portrayed and talked about.         I don’t have my sources immediately available, but the first thing to do is to split the New Deal into two parts, the early parts roughly 1933-1935/36 and the latter parts 1937-1941. This is because Roosevelts second term brought about a shifting political landscape as the overwhelming majority the democrats had in the Federal Government slipped a little bit in the election of 1936. This was caused by a small recession that occurred in 1935-1936 ish if I remember correctly.         On top of this the New Deal was not just one monolithic piece legislature like 2009’s TARP or the current BBB bills. It was a combination of a lot of smaller bills and executive orders, with a fair number of both being shot down by the Supreme Court. It is why the New Deal is sometimes referred to as “Roosevelt’s Alphabet Soup.” You had the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), The Emergency Conservation Work Act (ECW), and the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). These acts also created a tone of varied and different agencies to oversee their portion of the New Deal, with my personal favorite being the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC).         Additionally, we need to look at the two methods that you mentioned were used to help the economy recover, Hoover’s Austerity and Roosevelt’s Keynesian economic ideas. Hoover, and by extension the Republican Party, believed that by cutting government spending and having fiscally conservative policies the markets would eventually self-correct and everything would sort itself out. It placed an emphasis on the individual person being fiscally responsible and “tightening their belts.” Whereas Keynesian economics believes that when the economy enters a depression the government should open the flood gates of government spending and try to put money in the economy.         These are super oversimplified explanations of these policies, but they get us to the New Deal more to your question of did the New Deal actually do anything? Unsurprisingly the answer is complicated, because Yes some programs did help and No some did not. Something you yourself noticed in your question.         Overall, I do not think it is fair to look at the New Deal monolithically, each part is different. Individual parts helped in different ways and others did not. The CCC for example, Neil Maher cites this agency as having a roughly 80% approval rating in his book Nature’s New Deal. He also goes on to argue that program but young men with no experience to work improving the country’s farmland, National Forests, and National Parks. There is a wealth of material championing the CCC, including myself. This goes back to the fact that in many ways you need to look at it piecemeal.         McElvaine ends his book with a similar stance if I recall, but I think he would agree that overall, I think it’s fair to say that the New Deal was a mixed bag policy that did not go far enough. Much like the criticisms of those modern-day policies from the 2007-8 recession. It definitely stabilized the economy for the most part and led to the US being able to tool up for the Second World War much faster. I think the best way to categorize the New Deal is that it stopped the bleeding, and helped to stabilize the economy, for the most part, but failed to go much beyond that.         Hopefully this makes sense and is not just the ramblings of a madman.	1643214988.0	hub99m3	t3_rymiie	t3_rymiie	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rymiie/how_effective_was_the_american_new_deal_in/hub99m3/

8xrkkmvu	The introduction of grain elevators in the 1840s caused a transition from shipping grain in bags to shipping it in bulk (when the grain is poured undivided into the cargo space of the vessel).   Grain elevators presented heightened risk of dust explosions and fire, and these risks were present to a degree in the maritime transport of grain. But the greater danger with grain cargos came from the fluid nature of grain shipped in bulk, what is termed the “free surface effect.”   When a ship carrying grain ‘lists’ (leans to one side), gravity causes bulk grain to flow like a liquid in the direction of the list. Whereas normally the ship’s ballast will naturally counteract the listing of the vessel, grain shifting to one side will counteract the ballast, potentially causing the ship to take on water or sink entirely.   The ‘free surface effect’ can be counteracted by what are called “shifting boards”, these are dividers which run fore-and-aft (from the front to the rear of the vessel) and limit the extent to which grain can flow to either side of the vessel. To be effective, shifting boards must be placed in relation to the height of the grain cargo in the hold. A pamphlet from 1874 notes that functional shifting boards must extend from the “top of the grain to the keelson” or “the heavy lurching of the vessel in a gale will force the grain up to leeward, under the shifting board.”   The perceived inadequacy of shifting boards for truly rough seas caused some grain merchants to avoid the transition to bulk shipment. California grain remained bagged until at least the 1920’s, as such shipments originally took a long and tempestuous route around South America, through the straits of Magellan. However, bagged shipment of California Grain continued after the opening of the Panama Canal, so tradition likely played a role as well.   Other methods of counteracting flowing grain were also used. Sometimes a layer of bagged grain would be placed on top of the bulk grain. Some ships employed a system of layered cargo dividers or cargo bins. In some places in America “it was usually to mix cotton with the grain” presumably this refers to bales of cotton, but I’m uncertain precisely how this worked.   Shifting boards seem to have been the most widespread solution by the 1880’s, and the year 1876 saw the introduction of British legislation which required grain shipments to employ shifting boards or carry 1/3 of the cargo in bags/barrels. David Williams places the most dangerous period of grain shipping slightly earlier, with the greatest mortality in the late 1860s and early 1870s. But it is possible that grain was still the most dangerous cargo in the 1880’s.  **Sources:**  * Crocheron, Bertram Hanford, and Carl J. Williams.

Outside of its obvious utility in Civ-style games, I've always took it to mean that things will occur in order, but you may not realize it because of  how *many* things are involved. You can't lay railroad track without first knowing about sawmills. You can't make rails without knowing about bellows, so forth and so on.  Apparently this disagrees with with the current thinking of the history of technology, which makes me kinda sad... it's some of the best philosophy I've parsed on my own.	1643216502.0	hubdjg7	t3_sd0f30	t1_huani3t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hubdjg7/

fz8r3	To use the classic Simpsons meme, the classic multivolume academic biographies of 'the mediocre presidents' - not that Polk really falls into the obscure category, as while his actions were often questionable they certainly are memorable - aren't being written nowadays.  As a format, nobody is particularly interested in buying exhaustive examinations of generally unsympathetic characters to a modern audience, so academics tend to stay away from them.  One example: what's still the best biography of Warren Harding dates from the late 1960s (and has the portions with his erotic love letters X'd out, since there was a successful restraining order placed on the writer by the Harding family.)  In the case of Polk, the standard reference academic biography is still Charles Sellers' award winning two volume series from the 1950s and 1960s, *James K. Polk, Jacksonian/Continentalist*, which still holds up well but has never been rereleased digitally so is hard to find.  However, there's been more recent work in shorter but still well researched material.  Robert Merry's *A Country of Vast Designs* is where I'd start.  It's a generally positive look at Polk that at least acknowledges his problems with truth and more questionable actions.  William Dusinberre's *Slavemaster President* is a far more critical assessment, and while he shares the stage with several major political and military figures of the Mexican War, Amy Greenburg's *A Wicked War* offers an outright withering portrayal of Polk's Presidency.  And last, I still have no problems recommending McCollough as a starter biography for his many subjects.  They're popular biographies, but they're generally good reads and reasonably well researched.  It's when you want to get into more detail and analysis that you go a bit deeper into the lit, and hence why here we recommend things like the two other major biographies of Truman once you've finished him as your introduction.	1643218837.0	hubk6l5	t3_sd5dn0	t3_sd5dn0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd5dn0/what_would_be_the_recommended_biography_on_james/hubk6l5/

35o90f0i	There is not the slightest hint of any evidence to support the actual persecution of Buddhists or the destruction of monasteries as such by Vedics.  The account of Pushyamitra Shunga attacking the Buddhists is a myth based on the document of *Ashokavadana,* the purpose of which was only to glorify the reign of Ashoka and isn't reliable as a source of history.  Rhys Davids had already brought out the source of this fabrication and as to how it gained importance and dismissed it in his book, Buddhist India.  [Buddhist India](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8ofIwJO0uDkC&lpg=PA319&ots=vOsLkfS9Q8&dq=rev%20wt%20wilkins&pg=PA319#v=onepage&q=rev%20wt%20wilkins&f=false)  BM Barua, an Indic Buddhist scholar rightly references this in his book as well and presents the studies of other scholars on this important question as well. None of them have accepted the supposedly heinous acts by the Shungas. Search Pages 20-23  [https://rarebooksocietyofindia.org/book\_archive/196174216674\_10153039333031675.pdf](https://rarebooksocietyofindia.org/book_archive/196174216674_10153039333031675.pdf)  However, there is ample literature to show that both sects made disparaging remarks and attempts to wrongly portray deities of that time. Bhattacharya's book on Buddhist Iconography.  [https://archive.org/details/indianbuddhistic033312mbp/page/388/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/indianbuddhistic033312mbp/page/388/mode/2up)  The scope for speculation and interpretation was always an integral part of spiritual discourse and so the Shakyamuni Buddha's dismissal of caste and the obsession for maintaining purity by Vedics pointed merely to sectarian social biases that never resulted in heinous crimes of any sort. The inherent nature of the Dharmic tradition lies in debate, and it was the prevalent method in those times for the loser to acknowledge and follow the tenets of the winner after the debate. Due to similarities in the basic philosophy, there might have been assimilation because of the segregation of Varnas among different philosophical systems and a few reverting back to it. Each future philosopher was better prepared to present their interpretation of the Truth, thanks to the previous debates.   TRV Murti affirms this in his book as to how this natural evolution of philosophy is the characteristic of the Dharmic tradition.  [Studies in Indian thought](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=d7ryQuk_inUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false)  RC Mitra has done extensive research on how there was no such persecution by Hindus at any point of time and he traces the extent of Buddhism is different states. AL Basham points this out as well and critiques him in another places but agrees with this conclusion. Full paper seems unavailable.  [Basham, Mitra paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies/article/abs/rc-mitra-the-decline-of-buddhism-in-india-visvabharati-studies-20-v-164-pp-calcutta-visvabharati-1954-rs6/952B72A56E7D9E12595B96157444BD0C)  As to what was the clincher in its decline, even Dr BR Ambedkar in his writings provides many sources and opines that it was the Muslim invasion of India that caused not just the downfall and destruction of Buddhism and its monasteries, but also attempted to destroy the fabric of Dharma itself.  Lars Fogelin presents the growing difference among lay persons and the over-reliance on the Stupas by Sangha to estbalish authority might have weakened its prospects for longevity, and that helped the Vedics in some way and that it was a gradual process.   So what you're suggesting is starkly opposite to the epitome of intellectual thought during an unparalleled era of knowledge where as the other part of the world was haggling over intolerant conversions and what not.	1643219348.0	hublndl	t3_s2jn9v	t3_s2jn9v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s2jn9v/buddhism_flourished_in_india_for_hundreds_of/hublndl/

fz8r3	Your question is well into /r/whatif territory, but the 40 divisions Hitler had available in 1938 for the operation would have gone up against 34 very well equipped Czech divisions and substantial fortifications that vanished when the Sudetenland was turned over, something that Churchill notes as well (and many others don't.)  This also ignores all three parties with treaty obligations; Manstein's quote also references the possibility of the Soviet Union coming in early to honor mutual obligations along with the French to defend Czechoslovakia, even if their particular support would probably have been fighters through Romanian airspace and supplies - nobody wanted the Red Army marching through their territory.  That was just on the Eastern front.  The West would have basically been even more wide open than it was in 1939, and it was a matter of political will rather than manpower and equipment; Germany still wasn't where it needed to be on the ground in 1938.  It was the almost apocalyptic fears of bombing raids - the potential effects of which were viewed at the time akin to something resembling nuclear strikes - which really was what kept the West in check.	1643220153.0	hubnyfs	t3_scipvu	t1_hubgfpd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scipvu/the_new_film_munich_the_edge_of_war_argues_that/hubnyfs/

8brve	It's definitely the case that technological systems emerge out of existing technical and social contexts. The question is whether it is _teleological_ or not — whether there is a specific order and technology moves on its own towards a specific end. That is the real problem with the "tech tree" approach. It is not wrong to say that there are preconditions for many technologies (you will truly not develop nuclear weapons without atomic theory; but having atomic theory does not mean you will develop nuclear weapons, and there are probably multiple imaginable routes to atomic theory and nuclear weapons other than the ones we experienced as a species).	1643220952.0	hubq75t	t3_sd0f30	t1_hubdjg7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hubq75t/

3a27b	> When writing re-emerges in the Greek world some 400 years later, it is completely different: an alphabetic system, directly based on the Phoenician alphabet, which seems to be primarily used to mark objects with names and lines of poetry. The first written works of Greek literature are all poetry; it takes a century for the first written laws to appear, and many more centuries for writing to be reapplied to practical administration.  Why do you state that writing re-emerged in Greece, rather than Phoenicia? Did the Phoenicians simply not write enough for us to consider them having used "writing"?	1643219384.0	hublrb0	t3_sd0f30	t1_huap5hr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/hublrb0/
8xrkkmvu	No, the term appears years before OxyContin was on the market.  Russel Portenoy likely popularized the term with a 1990 article, but it appears to have been commonly used in the context of cancer pain even before this.  I haven't seen Dopesick, but my understanding is that Portenoy appears and is depicted as a sort of stooge for Opioid manufacturers. This depiction, and claiming 'breakthrough pain' is a corporate sales tactic both fit with the long-term tendency by journalists and academics like Kolodny to portray the entire 'pain as the fifth vital sign' movement as some sort of corporate plant or astroturf movement.  Perdue did pour money into patient activist movements after 1996, And may well have incorporated terminology like "breakthrough pain" into their sales pitches. But corporate greed here dovetailed with a preexisting progressive medical movement to take patient pain and suffering  more seriously.  &#x200B;  * McQuay, H. J., and A. R. Jadad. "Incident pain."

gde6c	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

9i89m	This is a story I have not heard- would be curious as to the details.  While Ford did not like the Nazis, the Nazis were quite besotted with Ford, and he would be awarded the Grand Cross of the German Eagle on his 75th birthday in 1938. And he did not return it: which is yet another Ford contradiction. There's also the question of how much or how little Ford could have cooperated with the Nazis- the head of his factory in Berlin certainly was a willing collaborator, but how much Henry Ford himself could or should have fought against cooperating with the regime is pretty hotly debated. Ford, instead of pulling out, seems to have hoped to gain a better share in the German market against GM, his biggest competitor there.	1643225559.0	huc347i	t3_scsa5l	t1_hubiy38	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scsa5l/why_do_we_not_learn_about_henry_fords/huc347i/

nkmng	Part 1  This is a great question, and for a truly comprehensive answer I would recommend you consult a book called "The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History" by a fellow called David Hackett Fischer. It's $10 on Amazon and well worth the read as it meticulously traces average prices back for over 800 years through alternate periods of stability and inflation. It's also short enough to cruise through in a few hours and engaging enough to hold your interest.  Most of this answer will be sourced from that treatment.  So what does the history of inflation look like over the last 1000 years? Well if your familiar with the view of inflation taken by many modern economists a low level of inflation is a good thing (2% has been the generally quoted number and if your American it is also the inflation percentage targeted by the Federal Reserve)  It's also generally just accepted as natural because over the last 120 years that's roughly been the rate of inflation in the Western World. There have been variations around that rate notable the 1970s Stagflation in the US, black market inflation driven by World War 2 rationing and even a short period of deflation during the Great Depression. But, generally speaking for as long as anyone alive can remember we've generally witnessed a gradual inflation. Things that used to be 10¢ now cost $1-2 and that's just the way things are...  Or is it?  Well, no, not always. Since roughly the year 1200 inflation in the Western world has progressed in four great waves (hence the book title) each wave of inflation has run it's course over several generations lasting between 90-180 years depending on the particulars. And right now we are approximately 120 years into the fourth wave that began in approximately 1900 and has continued through to today.  The four major inflationary periods are, approximately (ie plus or minus 30 years depending on location) 1180-1350 approx .5% inflation per year 1470-1650 - approx 1% inflation per year 1720-1820 - approx 1.7% inflation per year 1900-today - approx 2% inflation per year  Interestingly these periods of inflation roughly correspond to the, rise of the black death, the wars of the reformation, the rise of colonialism and it's associated wars culminating with the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, and closer to home, both World Wars, and The Cold War. While the periods of price stability in between roughly correspond to the beginning of the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and the Victorian Era.  The periods in between exhibited long term price stability usually beginning with sharp price declines (deflation). This means that, generally an ounce of silver in London in 1830 would buy about as much grain as the same ounce in 1890. But an ounce of silver in 1800 would buy substantially less grain in London than in 1700.   Looking at each period of inflation is really too much for the scope of this answer, but we can start at the first period and examine some phenomena that are common throughout. So let's hop back in time to 1180 when things were better... I guess?  The Medieval world was actually shockingly good at keeping price records for various common items and by pulling from these reams of data Fischer reconstructed a broad outline of changing prices over time.  The first great wave of inflation begins in approximately 1180 and ends circa 1350 (again all these dates are plus or minus 30 years base in the pyres of the black death. Generally it saw a gradual price increase of about .5% per year and a steady rise in social instability and war. Now by modern standards that's not a huge amount but the inflation occurred over a sustained period contributing to substantially higher prices by the peak of the wave. Now I should also note that these price variations were not uniform or consistent. Medieval prices often exhibited the sort of wild oscillations that Wall Street Bets folks dream of. This could be driven by a whole host of issues, poor weather, bumper crops, flooding, a late spring or just an army rolling through and stealing all the food could easily send prices for essentials to the moon and back. This makes our data for medieval price changes very noisy as some kings decision to wage a war can show up as a wild perturbation in the dataset.  However, generally speaking prices increased across more than a hundred years and this trend is broadly visible in the historical price data. So why?  Well, the simplest answer is that there were more people. Fischer's view is that period in question appears to have correlated with a general increase in population which drove more demand for... Everything (this population boom appears to be a common theme in all secular inflation cycles). There were also monetary aspects to this phenomen but Fisher takes the view that population pressures predominated.  Now the interesting aspect is the effects of this inflation. This part can be regarded as controversial mainly because it's difficult to untangle cause and effect when you're dealing with events from multiple lifetimes ago. As a disclaimer regarding where I stand on the issue, I personally think sustained inflation is an absolutely devastating phenomenon.  So what happened during this inflationary wave? Well, a bunch of people died and society kind of fell apart in various ways. But to be more specific firstly, wages fell in real terms. This means that perhaps you were still paid the same amount of silver for a days work, but adjusted for inflation that amount bought less bread, milk, firewood... whatever. Now, not everything increased in price uniformly and essentials like food and energy generally outpaced manufactured goods.  The second thing that happened was that rents increased at a rate faster than wages. Now when I say rents in this context I'm not really talking about upper class apartments in Paris, rather rent was the amount paid to a landlord by a occupant (often a farmer)for use of the land or facilities (such as a mill). Generally speaking rents and land values went up very quickly. Now some rents were locked in at a certain amount (a fact that Adam Smith mentions in his own opus talking about the preference over the long term for rents paid in grain vs money since at the time Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations England was locked in another inflationary wave that had greatly devalued it's money). However with lots of time to think about the problem medieval landholders appear to have gotten creative in extracting money from their tenants. In modern terms you can think or rents as capital (ie stocks, bonds, real estate, or other interest bearing or productive assets) while labor is basically your paycheck. And so what was happening at it's core was that, on average, the rich were becoming wealthier while the cost of living increased and wages stagnated. So you might say that wealth inequality is in fact... medieval (cue laughter).  Governments were not unaware of these issues and reacted in several ways. Firstly, they began running deficits that grew more severe over time and borrowing to make up the difference. They also actively tried to increase the money supply, (ie gold and silver in circulation). This was accomplished partly via mining and in later cycles by exporting precious metals from the newly discovered America's. (Most recently we've discovered the joy of printing presses to mint money unbacked by anything). People also resorted to melting down various precious objects and by debasing their coinage, ie minting a silver coin that is 25% silver instead of 50% allows you to double your currency in circulation or more importantly, tax revenues, while normal people took to the time honored method of filing coins and keeping a small amount for metal for themselves. Finally governments attempted to impose various price controls which generally met with much resentment.   Taken together all this combination of growing population and increased money in circulation more or less pressured prices higher over the next hundred years and slowly pushed society to the edge of a proverbial cliff.  The fall over that precipice came in several forms. Particularly there was an increase in wars, revolutions insurrections, famines and general disasters culminating in the Black Death. Interestingly many of these events such as famine or disease were not unique to this period (medieval society was always rather violent by modern standards), but in a society where inflation had systemicatically stripped the lower classes of their resources to the benefit of the rich there was no buffer to absorb these shocks like there might have been in better times. To help a modern reader understand, its essentially the difference between losing your job with a mortgage plus a car loan and only $50 in the bank, vs loosing your job with a paid off house and a $2000 emergency fund. Your options and reactions are fundamentally different.  The end result of this was conflict, much of it class based as the poor revolted against the wealthy and the wealthy fought back with their inferior numbers but vast resources (This occured in various ways in all inflationary cycles). These conflicts in turn created their own feedback loops of instability that aggravated the underlying problems and left governments in increasingly dire straits. In short, Europe kind of blew itself apart and the Black Death compounded all those underlying issues to leave a devastated continent.	1643226411.0	huc5hrp	t3_scchc6	t3_scchc6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scchc6/how_do_average_rates_of_inflation_over_the_past/huc5hrp/
nkmng	Part 2  It wasn't until 1400 (the dates vary by country as each nation had it's own unique circumstances)that things began to recover and the severe population decline tapered off. Over that time prices either declined or stabilized depending on the item. Wages rose in real terms and rents tended to decline. In short there was a lot of money but not enough people and so labor dominated over capital for a time.  To help tease out a bit more clearly what this all looks like, let's glance at the French Revolution through this lens.  In simple terms, the French Revolution was driven by severe structural inequality, the nobility avoiding taxes while the poor suffered due to crop failures and general oppression and loss of opportunity. Taken alone these things had been happening for years, but in France they culminated in an explosion of violence. Part of this was facilitated by a wave of inflation that had been building for decades that had slowly impoverished the poor and enriched the wealthy. And so while at another moment people might have accepted the failed harvests and moved on, at this particular moment people hit their breaking point and turned to violence. To quote Fischer:  "A sense of outrage against the arrogance and imbecility of ruling elites developed rapidly throughout Europe."  Inflation had the effect of weakening all the social ties that bound various classes together. While also impoverishing the French government that, by this point, was cosmically deep in debt. It's interesting also that grain prices in Paris hit a peak on the day the Bastille was stormed. Now, were grain prices high because there was chaos in the city or was their chaos in the city because prices were high... In a way the answer seems to be both at once. As inflationary waves crest their effects become self reinforcing. The French Revolution was partly driven by unsustainably high prices leaving people hungry and angry.  At the same time, the destruction of the ensuing war led to elevated prices in other places and in a way contributed to other instability. As just a small example, the British naval mutinies later in the Napoleonic war were partly driven by poor pay. Which was partly driven by the vast cost of war and the corresponding upwards pressure that also put on prices. In that sense it's all one giant tangle where inflation begets instability which drives more inflation which drives more instability and so one until things hit a breaking point.  So yeah, in answer to your question, there have been several periods of historical inflation throughout the last hundred year. Meanwhile the challenges and solutions to that inflation that we see in the modern world aren't really that new. Perhaps the most interesting novelty of the last 50 years is the decoupling of the dollar from gold which means that governments can create money at will. This is not totally novel as, even as far back as Rome, governments were debasing their coinage, but it does put us in somewhat unexplored territory. As for what happens next though... Well that breaks the 20 year rule...	1643226433.0	huc5k4l	t3_scchc6	t1_huc5hrp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scchc6/how_do_average_rates_of_inflation_over_the_past/huc5k4l/

yd423tf	I'm writing a short fiction piece that references famous romantic or erotic poets. I won't explain the plot, but the theme is the Greek muse Erato, whose domain was mostly lyric/'erotic' poetry. So far I'm planning on referencing Sappho, Rumi, Shakespeare, Robert Herrick, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson  Most of these poets did not primarily create erotic or romantic work, but they've all written various erotic or romantic poems. For example, I'm planning on highlighting Shakespeare's Sonnet 20, Sappho's Fragment 16, and Dickinson's For Each Ecstatic Instant.  What I'm looking for is 3-5 poets to fill the gap between Sappho and Rumi, so roughly 650 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E. I'd especially like to highlight poets who aren't from English-speaking countries, even better if they aren't from Europe at all, since most of my list right now highlights white, English-speaking poets. They must have written at least one poem with romantic or erotic themes, and it must be available in translation for me to read.  Please do not suggest poets who lived and worked past 1600 C.E. or before 650 B.C.E., unless you have some particularly good ideas who are not white/English speakers.

1n19jp1g	I would not say that it's *always* been seen this way, but it certainly is an old idea (depending on how you define "old"). Notably, the idea that fashion and beauty standards are a tool used to oppress women, whether to debilitate them or to simply distract them, is something we do see in the Dress Reform Movement in the nineteenth century. However, the Dress Reform Movement was quite fringe in the period, so you would not actually come across this opinion much until, essentially, after the corset fell out of use. I have a couple of past answers that deal with this:  [If corsets were normal undergarments, why did suffragists fight against them?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ldxo72/if_corsets_were_normal_undergarments_why_did/gmmvnh9/)  [Where did the myth that the corset was a form of male domination over women's bodies come from? (fashion history)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g4uxk1/where_did_the_myth_that_the_corset_was_a_form_of/fo6y8q8/)  [How much was known about the damaging effects of corsets in the 1600s, 1700s and 1800s? And were they treated?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/auaaz0/how_much_was_known_about_the_damaging_effects_of/eh95spi/)  Cosmetics specifically, though, are more difficult to slot into this narrative - as I discuss in [When did makeup become standard for women in western culture?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/64598u/when_did_makeup_become_standard_for_women_in/dg05aiy/), cosmetic use lived in a confusing middle ground in the nineteenth century where it was both stigmatized and common. This did not come up in the same kind of Victorian criticisms.  >There's also this idea (in the most radical feminism) that being “natural” aka not using any makeup or adorning oneself, not shaving, etc. is a form of fighting against “the patriarchal system”. However, it is my understanding that what we view as “natural” is a social construct as well.  You would probably be better off asking this specifically in /r/AskSociology, because it's really a question about the present day or about how people "work" rather than historical context.	1643229171.0	hucdbgs	t3_sc2er0	t3_sc2er0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc2er0/the_idea_of_adorning_oneself_using_makeup_having/hucdbgs/

1b84uc	I already knew the Russian Federation was still on paper the RSFSR but i had no idea the name change was just simply taking the name and removing the communist bits from it to make "Russian Federation"     Personally it slightly bugs me that the name of the new democratic Russia was just kinda made up on the fly without any input from the people, or inspiring backstory or speech, Forgive me for delving out of history slightly and into politics but personally if i was the Russian president i would try to pass a vote on what the new name should be for Russia, and saying that the people finally deserve a say in what the legal title of their Country is instead of it being just made up by a few guys in politics.     But my personal theory is that the guys in the RSFSR who were told "Okay come up with the name of this new Russian state" (If it happened like this) my thought was that they talked for a good bit about what the name should be with some saying "Oh let's call ourselves the second Russian Republic in honor of the 1917 Republic" while others might have said "Nah we are a bit like them but it would be a insult to say we are a exact continuation of it" others may have said "Why not Russian Democratic Federal Republic?" (The Russian Republic was renamed that in 1918) while someone might have said "Nah that is mouth full, why not just "Russian Federation"     I honestly thought the Russian Federation name idea came more from the events of 1918 and not so much the RSFSR and the name was a boil down of the ""Russian Democratic Federal Republic""     I personally hope that before these people die of old age that there is a interview from some of the people who were there when the Federation was formed to find a even more narrowed down answer.     (Side note thank you for the correction that it was not SSR but RSFSR for Russia, I often forget that)	1643229295.0	hucdo2w	t3_sd1fny	t1_hub4mgz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd1fny/why_is_russia_called_the_russian_federation/hucdo2w/

8rkx9	A core problem here is the term "myth," which easily conveys meaning in a way that likely did not apply to the story of the seige of Troy. Traditional European oral narratives tend(ed) to manifest as folktales or legends. Folktales (manifesting with various names in diverse languages) are/were stories told as fiction. Legends (also manifesting with various names in diverse languages) are/were stories told generally to be believed.   There are typically a wide spectrum of legends including etiological (stories about the origins of things usually in primordial or at least much earlier times), historical (stories about more recent events and people), and what are referred to with a number of terms, but let's agree to call them "testamonial legends." This last group of legends are accounts that people tell as occuring in the present or near present, serving as evidence that extraordinary things are possible (today, our urban legends fit into this slot).  When we consider ancient literature that seems to be reflecting contemporary oral narratives, we tend to group all of the evidence of stories under the term "myth." This creates a modern perception of those ancient stories that is not necessarily correct. There is an enormous difference separating an ancient account about how humanity came into existence from the story that Homer recounts about the Trojan War.  Modern Americans tell a story about George Washington chopping down a cherry tree and being forced into confession when asked about it by his father, because, Washington says, "I cannot tell a lie." This absurd story and the equally absurd quality bestowed upon Washington does not mean that Washington did not exist. The historical legend was told to be believed, but it is apparently false; Washington, however, was a real person.  Applying this standard to something like Troy and the Trojan war allows us to understand that the historical legend about the war must be understood as such: specific elements may or may not be true, but other elements may be verifiable in the historical and/or archaeological record.  That we can treat the "myth" of the Trojan war in this way, does not mean that other ancient Greek narratives that we group under the umbrella as "myth" can be regarded in the same way. Each story must be understood in its context, and it must be understood that not all the stories played the same role in ancient Greek contemporary oral traditions. The singular term "myth" generates profound misunderstandings.  I will continue this thread with an excerpt on the term "myth" from one of my books.	1643230732.0	huchqsh	t3_sddlk2	t3_sddlk2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/huchqsh/

8rkx9	One of the problems I have encountered with the term "myth" is the way it is often applied to the folklore of various modern people - especially to people who are not white. For example, people throw around the term "Indian myths" or "African myths" in ways that convey something that is not accurate and that can be hurtful.   I once had a student in a folklore class who asked about "Indian myths," and as it happened, I had a Native American graduate student in class; I indicated that we should not refer to Native American folklore with the term "myth," and I asked my grad student how she viewed this term in that context. She indicated that many people in her family were believers in the traditional stories and that she found the term "myth" to be offensive.  For something that may be more immediately relatable, consider the difference if we were to refer the "Resurrection Story" as the "Resurrection Myth." The second option is clearly dismissive, conveying the idea that only someone who was gullible and superstitious could take the story seriously. What we would apply to a belief system that most would regard as modern and that is clearly in the international majority, should be applied to the same for everyone.  For my [Introduction to Folklore](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Folklore-Traditional-Studies-Elsewhere/dp/1521423261), which I used for my folklore classes, I included the following:  >Something also needs to be said here about myth. People use this term awkwardly. In a European context, myths tend to be the artificial constructs of ancient and Classical-era priests or literate people who sought to weave folk traditions into a comprehensive whole. The exercise often had political purposes, designed to provide diverse people with a single set of beliefs and stories. By reconciling similar traditions, the shared culture of these groups could be seen as more important than the differences, justifying the central rule of the king and his priests. Myth is also a way of organizing and reconciling folk traditions, which by their nature can be contradictory and highly localized. Myth tends, however, to make gods of supernatural beings, giving those powerful entities a status – for modern readers – similar to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God, even when this comparison is not justified. Of course, it is also important to point out that myths were stories that were told – and then written down – and they were different from religion itself. Many myths were simply the shared cultural inheritance of a group of people.   >In general, the word myth is best set aside when discussing more recent folk traditions, recognizing its proper status as a literary genre. Nonetheless, ancient documents recording myths can assist in understanding the history of various stories and beliefs. The authors of these texts were, after all, the first folklorists, and they were the only ones coming close to practicing the craft at the time.  >Some folklorists carelessly use the term myth to denote those legends that deal with a fantastic, remote time. This primal era saw the creation of many familiar things such as day and night, fire, animals, people, mountains, and all other aspects of the present world. Folklorists properly refer to these stories as etiological legends explaining the origin of things. Sometimes, however, people interchange etiological legends with the word myth. The problem with this is that “myth” can imply something that is inherently wrong, linked to “primitive” superstitious beliefs. When the term “myth” is used for the folklore of existing cultures or for the traditions that were viable only a generation or more ago, it can take on an insulting, derogatory tone. It is best to reserve the word “myth” for ancient and Classical-era texts.	1643231493.0	hucjve0	t3_sddlk2	t1_huchqsh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hucjve0/

If you want something that intersects theology with literature the obvious recommendation is *Piers Ploughman*--a note is that you should not even bother reading it in the original, even if you did not have problems with the Middle English of Chaucer. *Piers* is written in a regional dialect and is essentially unintelligible.  Beyond all that though, a good suggestion for any topic is to check out what sourcebooks are available, as they will give edited (and often with commentary) compilations of many different texts that will give a flavor for the breadth and variety of literature for a particular period.	1643231652.0	huckbd6	t3_sd6m46	t1_huaog0y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6m46/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_26_2022/huckbd6/

mdu63	It sounds like the famous 13th century account of Scandinavian pre-history, Snorri Sturluson's *Heimskringla* (or its beginning, *Ynglinga saga*, Ch. 5):     > "A great mountain range runs from the north-east to the south-west. It divides Svíþjóð in mikla from other realms. To the south of the mountains it is not far to Tyrkland (Land of Turks, Asia Minor). There Óðinn had large possessions. At that time the rulers of the Rúmverjar (Romans) travelled widely around the world and conquered all nations, and many rulers fled their lands because of this aggression. And because Óðinn had prophetic and magical powers, he knew that his descendants would inhabit the northern region of the world. Then he appointed his brothers, Vé and Vílir, to rule Ásgarðr, while he, and all the gods with him and many other people, left. He went first west into Garðaríki (Russia) and then south to Saxland (Germany). He had many sons. He made himself king over large parts of Saxland and established his sons there to guard the land. Then he went north to the sea and took up residence on a certain island. That place is now called Óðinsey (‘Óðinn’s sanctuary’; Odense) on Fjón (Fyn)......" (Translation is taken from: [Finlay & Faulkes trans. 2011: 8])    Virtually all of researchers now, however, interpret these passages not as a reflection of Scandinavian memory of the distant past, but as a later reconstructed legend under the influence of medieval historical writings, namely based on an euhemerism and Trojan origin myth (Concerning these jargons, please check /u/Platypuskeeper's explanations in: [How much do we actually know about the ancient religious traditions, deities and narratives of the Norse?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ad0i2z/how_much_do_we_actually_know_about_the_ancient/edddbxk/))    Reference:    * [Snorri Sturluson. *Heimskringla*, i: *The Beginnings to Óláfr Tryggvason*, trans.

And that's what I was trying to clarify in my post, but don't think I did- I knew it wasn't a contemporary explanation, but had at least assumed it was an after the fact mythologization of the past.	1643232256.0	hucm0co	t3_sdg3y1	t1_hucl484	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sdg3y1/did_the_roman_state_come_up_in_norse_sources/hucm0co/

1g9u1qcg	In the case of far-right groups in Russia, u/Kochevnik81 wrote an [answer on the rise of Zhirinovski's ironically-named Liberal Democratic Party](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9fivso/vladimir_zhirinovsky_won_8_of_the_popular_vote_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), which should serve as a good spark for further discussion.  As for far-right organizations in Ukraine, they only really started to accumulate momentum in the 2010s, and thus for now fall outside the scope of this subreddit. These organizations sometimes claim the heritage of certain Ukrainian far-right organizations active during the Interwar period and the Second World War. Mostly, they reference the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and related Ukrainian Partisan Army (UPA), which had complicated relationships with the Nazis, as u/Kochevnik81 [also previously described](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/o6cbrx/comment/h342fh9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Due to a lack of time and confidence (my specialty is on the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1921), I will conclude by providing you a resource for further reading.  Below is a citation for a translated anthology of Ukrainian philosophical and political thought. The anthology contains an essay written by Dmytro Dontsov (an important political theorist who heavily influenced Ukrainian radical nationalist discourse during the Interwar period), the Manifesto of the OUN, and an essay written by Petro Poltava (an influential theorist within UPA).

168sly	I think in fairness to the Russian government, the name change happened on December 25, 1991, ie the very day that Gorbachev resigned, the Soviet flag was lowered, Yeltsin took control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, and also took control of the UN Security Council seat. The Russian legislature (which was still the Supreme Soviet of the 1978 constitution) made the formal name change and Yeltsin submitted it to the UN the same day: "henceforth the name of the Russian Federation will be used in the United Nations instead of USSR".   Yeltsin's administration was also in the midst of planning radical liberal economic reforms, and price controls were lifted a week later on January 2, 1992. The Soviet economy was already experiencing implosion and supply shortages (the US military was airlifting food supplies for the population of Moscow) and severe inflation, and the latter would actually worsen in upcoming months.   Which is to say, there was a *lot* happening simultaneously at the time of the name change, and a public debate and referendum on the official name of the country was extremely low on anyone's list (in any case, it's a very formal name and not necessarily more commonly used than "Rossiya", which is also an official name under the current constitution).   There's also a whole further discussion of the fact that national symbols in Russia from 1990 onwards have been something of a cludge. The flag raised over the Kremlin on December 25, 1991 to replace the Soviet flag is the pre-1917 tricolor (no one voted on that either). The RSFSR had adopted a song without words ("The Patriotic Song") as its republican anthem in 1990 (supposedly this was chosen instead of a reworked "God Save the Tsar") and this replaced the Soviet national anthem in Russia after the latter's collapse. However, having a wordless anthem rankled enough people that eventually the tune of the Soviet national anthem was reused for a new Russian national anthem in 2000, which was written by Sergei Mikhalkov (who had written the lyrics for the Soviet anthem as well). For good measure the red star was restored as a Russian military symbol two years later. However, Russia *also* restored the tsarist double-headed eagle as a state symbol in 1992.  So Russia has had a very complicated relationship to names and symbols from its tsarist and Soviet periods, as well as its brief republican period in between.   As a note I'm not actually sure that Russia was called the "Russian Democratic Federal Republic". Wikipedia claims so, but that's Wikipedia, and the Bolsheviks had already renamed the country to RSFSR by then, and the previous government was by its own admission provisional.	1643234522.0	hucsat9	t3_sd1fny	t1_hucdo2w	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd1fny/why_is_russia_called_the_russian_federation/hucsat9/

wka2b	TL:DR - Is it safe to wear and breathe through a WW2 gas mask?  I have recently acquired [THIS](https://ibb.co/f1DNQsF) WW2 British Gas Mask. Is it safe to put on, strap up and breathe through it? If not. What can I do to make it safe?	1643294273.0	hufyebo	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hufyebo/
7s4rt2oe	So this is a pretty big topic in the collecting community and I myself own a couple gas mask. So it can very based on what gas mask it is but the overall advice is usually no. A lot of gas mask from that era, including British ones, contain crocidolite asbestos or other forms of asbestos in the filters. It was a useful thing to help filter out the gasses. However, as we know today, asbestos is dangerous and carcinogenic.   Many advocate against breathing through it or handing it too much as moving it can cause asbestos fibres that broke down in the filter to become airborne, which you then breathe in. Some collectors and museums use a mixture of clear PVA wood glue and water to cover the holes on the filter in order to make them safe and avoid contamination. Some mask dont have asbestos both there can be other things in the filter that its best to avoid.	1643294362.0	hufylss	t3_s7qqa4	t1_hufyebo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hufylss/

7s4rt2oe	You do not need a ton to cover it and it should be easy to do. Im sure there are guides online on how to do it. And if  you are worried cause you put it on a couple times or been moving it, you dont need to be. Obviously its not good to breathe in asbestos but its not like youre going to get lung cancer within a week of doing that. It takes long term exposure and a decent amount of it to have anything happen. But precaution is always advised.	1643294692.0	hufzemn	t3_s7qqa4	t1_hufyxj8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hufzemn/

SS Great Eastern did cost more than $6,000,000. Even less ambitious projects, like SS Servia could cost more than one million.  Large civic projects.

I admit that the past two years (for obvious reasons) have sorely taxed my patience and inclination to humor others "beliefs", and I also have the luxury of more powerful empirical data to rely on in my interpretations,  but I am genuinely curious if there is any real value as a folklorist in differentiating between myth, legend, etc, based on those that contain objective fact vs. those that are entirely subjective. Or is this really irrelevant?	1643295687.0	hug1vb9	t3_sddlk2	t1_hudwz7b	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hug1vb9/
989fuguo	For an introduction, labor historian Erik Loomis wrote the excellent “A History of America in Ten Strikes”. It’s a synthetic work (little original research, mostly drawing from other works), but it cites its sources so it functions as a very short (like 200 pages of simple text) extended table of contents.  This recommendation means more coming from me because Loomis is pretty infamously, uh, not a nice person and I’ve personally had negative interactions with him (so you might see weird criticisms of him which are actually not related to his work). That said, he is a good scholar and his work is solid.  Are there any specific periods/questions you are interested in from there? It sounds like you want to learn about the global labor movement too?	1643295918.0	hug2fzi	t3_sdobz7	t3_sdobz7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sdobz7/what_are_some_good_sources_about_the_history_of/hug2fzi/

9ouov	So as you can see though from my old answer, the Muslim calendar borrowed from the Christian calendar borrowed from the Jewish and late Roman calendar, and they all borrowed from the Babylonian calendar.   Now, when they got somewhat universal associations appears to be the Alexandrian version of calendar appeared in the second century BCE. That appears to be where we first got “Saturn’s day”, “the Sun’s day”, “the moon’s day”, etc. So second century BCE appears to be the answer your looking for. But there Tuesday was the day of Mars (cf. Mardi in French). If you’re asking specifically about the Tues- element, that was originally Tiw/Tiwaz’s day. Though etymologically Tiw is related to Deus/Zeus, he was thought to be the god of war so ended up associated with Mars. That involves the translation into Germanic languages. Tuesday has cognates in variety of Germanic languages. Old Frisian tiesdei, Old Norse tysdagr, Swedish tisdag, Old High German ziestag. Etymoline helpfully adds, “In cognate German Dienstag and Dutch Dinsdag, the first element would appear to be Germanic ding, þing ‘public assembly,’ but it is now thought to be from Thinxus, one of the names of the war-god in Latin inscriptions.” If second century BCE and Alexandria isn’t what you’re looking for, are you looking for the first time Tuesday was associated with the Germanic god Tiw(az)?	1643297272.0	hug5w0i	t3_sctk61	t1_hue8ni6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sctk61/when_did_the_days_of_the_week_become_fixed/hug5w0i/

6ottoaji	I would recommend starting with Alexander of Macedon, 356–323 B.C.: A Historical Biography by Peter Green.   Green doesn't go for what I refer to as the "hero worship style" that I find prevalent in many biographies of military leaders. He approaches the subject with a critical eye which is always welcome. He also gives Philip his fair due in relation to Alexander's military success.   If that book piques your interest, afterward i would recommend reading Plutarch and Arrian's biographies. Granted, it's been quite a while since I've read anything on Alexander, but that book has always stayed on my shelf.  Hope this helps.	1643299572.0	hugbyio	t3_sd6m46	t1_hudevxh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6m46/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_26_2022/hugbyio/

96gqp	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643302447.0	hugjsno	t3_se134w	t3_se134w	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se134w/did_the_good_economy_help_move_to_renaissance_era/hugjsno/

The English translation is available as: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Song_of_Everlasting_Regret   * Another poet from Tang China who is famous for its sensuous style is Li Shangyin (d. 858), but I know little of the availability of his poem in English (I don't know which of his poems are covered in [this recent translation](https://www.nyrb.com/products/li-shangyin?variant=53522374855)).  * (Added): Among female noble poets during Heian Period in Japan, Ono no Komachi (9th century) and Izumi Shikibu (974-1034) are especially famous, I suppose.

4b32h	>There was scepticism among specialists of course, but that was over his interpretations of the finds (which were wrong), not the city itself. Schliemann successfully conflated 'pre-classical' with 'mythical', and the result was confusion and misinformation.  So tell me whether I understand this correctly.:  The classical/medieval location of the city of Ilium/Troy was never in dispute. Everyone also assumed, but had not proven, that a pre-classical Ilium/Troy had existed at the same location too. In or around 1790, two other academics suggested that the pre-classical city of Ilium/Troy may have existed in a location other than that of the classical/medieval Ilium/Troy. They thought maybe it was a few miles further inland. However, this dispute was resolved by the 1820s and most people went back to assuming that the pre-classical city was somewhere underneath the classical/medieval city. Schliemann shows up in 1870 and blows the site up with dynamite. In addition to damaging other layers and artifacts in the explosion, he finds evidence of the pre-classical city under the site of the classical/medieval city. So basically, he just proved what scholars had already assumed since the 1820s and before the 1790s. Schliemann then goes on a self-promotion tour and announces that he has discovered Homer's Troy, which, he argues, adds credence to the Iliad. He falsely claims that no one believed the pre-classical city had existed prior to his discovery. The public hears this and amateurs believe him that no one believed in a pre-classical city until now. Some members of the public are skeptical of Schliemann and disbelieve that he has discovered a pre-classical city at that location. This then, leads to skepticism of whether the pre-classical city existed.   Is that right?	1643305687.0	hugszri	t3_sddlk2	t1_hueh322	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hugszri/

ypnyd	Well hell. I'm a forty-five-year-old history professor, I read Ancient Greek (albeit poorly), and it was literally today that I learned that the story of Schliemann having traced Troy's lost location to Hissarlik using the text of the *Iliad* is bullshit.  (I mean, I'm a medievalist, not a classicist, but I'm still embarrassed that I'd been carrying the Nobody Knew Hissarlik Was Troy bit of Schliemann PR around in my head for more than thirty years.)	1643306636.0	hugvo1u	t3_sddlk2	t1_hueh322	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hugvo1u/
4q6xobw4	I'm planning on running a nautical themed d&d campaign for my group and I'm struggling to find cross sectional diagrams or detailed information on the layout and design of brigantine vessels from the 18th century. Exactly how many decks would a brigantine have had? Aside from the main deck, I know that a brigantine used for piracy would likely have had a gun deck, but would there be further decks below that? What would they be used for?	1643306667.0	hugvr50	t3_sd6m46	t3_sd6m46	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6m46/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_26_2022/hugvr50/

The Dowager Empress Maria and Grand Duchess Xenia originally fled to England as Queen Alexandra was the Empress’ sister. There, they lived almost entirely on the generosity of the British royal family and whatever they could make from selling the few belongings they’d brought with them. Maria eventually went back to her native county of Denmark where her nephew, the king at the time, provided her with an allowance. She already owned a country house named Hvidøre where she lived until her death.  It was a similar story for Xenia who stayed on in England. She was given Frogmore Cottage as a grace and favour home. In 1920, she was allowed to take control of Nicholas’ estate in England, but this was only worth £500. When her mother died, she inherited and sold Hvidøre along with much of her mother’s jewels. With this, she bought Wilderness House near Hampton Court and lived there until her death.   Nicholas other sister Olga actually stayed in Russia for a little while. Her husband was considered a commoner by the new government and so she was too by association. They rented a small farm in the Caucasus and worked it for about a year before Olga began to feel unsafe and the family joined her mother in Denmark. They lived at Hvidøre with her until her death when Olga, with her portion of the sale, bought a farm in Ballerup. It’s a little uncertain as to whether she received an allowance from the Danish royal family, but it doesn’t seem likely. Her family worked the farm much as they had in the Caucasus, and Olga supplemented this by selling her paintings. She and her husband eventually sold the farm and moved to Canada. Olga died only a few years later, in a tiny flat above a beauty parlour which she shared with two friends.  Most aristocrats who didn’t have the benefit of allowances from other families simply lived on the dwindling income that selling their jewels brought them. Nicholas II’s niece Irina attempted to start a fashion house with her husband, but the business wasn’t very successful and was eventually forced to close. In their final years, they were living almost exclusively off the remnants of a lawsuit won by her husband against MGM.  So, in conclusion, exiled royalty was generally able to survive by living on the generosity of others and by selling their belongings. They had no real skills with which to make their own money—and often felt it was beneath their dignity to do so. And so they struggled on with scraps until their misery was over.	1643306814.0	hugw62s	t3_se16t1	t3_se16t1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se16t1/how_did_rulers_fleeing_their_countries_pay_for/hugw62s/
2m8yl53s	Sure...in fact it's hard to think of a single good example because this happens all the time. This is big part of working as an historian, "the art of verifying dates".  A date could be off by a couple of days, a year, even decades. The further back you go, before the invention of any of the modern calendars, the harder it is to pin down a date. For example for ancient Egypt or Sumer there are a few possible chronologies that differ by several decades at least.  I answered a question here once about the [unusually specific dates for the reign of pharaoh Thutmose III](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i23mr0/wikipedia_states_that_pharaoh_thutmose_iii/g0lpjr7/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \- how do we know those dates? Well thanks to records of astronomical observations in Egypt it's actually easier to figure out months and days than it is to determine what the year was.  A couple of other examples spring to mind from my actual area of expertise, the crusades. The court historian of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the 12th century was William of Tyre, who is an extremely valuable source, but he was pretty bad with dates. He was often off by a year when he's talking about when a king succeeded or died - his date for the death of King Baldwin III is very specific, February 10, 1162, but when compared to other information is his own history, and dates and ages given in other sources, modern historians now agree that Baldwin III died on that date in 1163. That's what the "art" is all about, knowing how to harmonize all these sources that sometimes disagree with each other (and internally).  Another example is the date of William's own death, which we know was September 29 - but what year? Unfortunately no one ever recorded it, but based on the dates that other people held his offices (he was chancellor of the kingdom as well as the Archbishop of Tyre), it must have been 1185 or 1186. Historians generally agree that he died in 1186, but...we actually just don't know and probably never will.  I'm sure I could go on forever! Pre-modern dates are hard to determine precisely and the further back you go the harder it gets.  My source for William is Peter W. Edbury and John G. Rowe, *William of Tyre: Historian of the Latin East* (Cambridge University Press, 1988). There are also lots of guides with lists of regnal years and dates and so forth; a popular one in English is C.R. Cheney, *A Handbook of Dates for Students of British History* (revised edition, Cambridge University Press, 2000). The original *Art de vérifier les dates* goes all the way back to 1750 but historians were also working on the subject at least as early as the 17th century.	1643306967.0	hugwle9	t3_sd6m46	t1_hub9d7j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6m46/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_26_2022/hugwle9/

nxyvc	To refer to any text that doesn't describe historical events as "the equivalent of Spiderman" is so absurdly reductive that it probably doesn't merit a response, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.   First, the date of the destruction layer is a red herring. The Greeks didn't actually know when the Trojan War happened. They didn't derive the often-cited conventional date from any continuous historical record. Instead, they took king lists from places like Sparta (where the royal houses traced their royal lineage back through generations of mythical kings to Herakles) and multiplied the number of otherwise unattested kings by a fixed number of years. Comparing several of these (invented) genealogies allowed them to establish the "true date" of the Trojan War. By pure coincidence, the number they came up with happens to match the Bronze Age destruction layer at Troy.  Second, it should be stressed that the treatment of the Trojan War as a datable historical event is a late development of Greek historical writing. The epics themselves make it very clear that the events are set in a hazy, unfixed past: the heroic age, when the gods walked the earth. This world is explicitly separated from the audience's time by repeated stories of what the heroes of epic could do that modern men could not. The story also depends entirely on divine agency; most of the events lack any kind of secular motivation (much to the frustration of modern authors, who love to invent trade disputes or other nonsense to rationalise what the poems actually say). In other words, the story does not give the impression of being a mythologised version of real events, but a "realified" version of myth.  Third, when we suppose that there must be some kind of historical war that was "embellished" in the poems, we have to ask ourselves what minimum requirements we set for that historical war to **be** the Trojan War. It is apparent to any reader of the poems that the world they describe is not Mycenaean Greece; the modern consensus is that they describe Early Archaic Greece (some 500 years later) with a few archaising elements mixed in. So in order to get at the "historical" core, we'd have to strip away almost everything the poems care about: customs, social and political structures, weapons, armour, tactics, peoples and places, characters and their decisions. What is left? There is contemporary evidence that Troy may have been ruled by a king named Alexandros (Paris) and may have been in conflict with the Achaians in the 12th century. We could argue that this proves the historicity of "the" Trojan War, but all we're really able to prove is that there was a war roughly around the right time involving some of the right actors. Is that enough to suppose that the entire epic cycle - which, as I said, preserves practically no detail of its supposed historical context - is rooted in a distinct event?  What we're falling into here is the positivist fallacy: that anything that has left a trace must be significant. Late Bronze Age Troy may well have burned because of a war, but if so, we cannot name it or explain its causes or its course. Conversely, if the Trojan War cycle is indeed rooted in a genuine historical war at Troy, that conflict has left almost no trace *in its own story* apart from its location and apparent outcome. At that point it doesn't really matter whether the war was ever real; the version we currently have is clearly not.	1643309901.0	huh4v0z	t3_sddlk2	t1_hugeuiv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/huh4v0z/

For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1643310539.0	huh6lha	t3_se5rh4	t3_se5rh4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se5rh4/have_there_been_any_historical_wars_that_were_not/huh6lha/

This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to /r/AskEconomics.

Even at the time it was argued by religious leaders that looking for witches or witchcraft, especially through questionable means like counter magic or ducking, was as bad if not worse than the act of witchcraft itself. Increase Mather himself made a point in a speech on October 3, 1692 that as dangerous as witches were, "It were better that ten suspected witches should escape than that one innocent person should be condemned."	1643311132.0	huh87vy	t3_sdj18w	t1_huh6un6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sdj18w/when_the_people_of_salem_threw_suspected_witches/huh87vy/

8rkx9	> sorely taxed my patience and inclination to humor others "beliefs"  I understand entirely! Pulling a punch to avoid trampling upon someone's feelings/beliefs is something I always try to do; taking punches because of someone else's beliefs is another matter. I lost my patience decades ago for situations where our ability to advance understanding of anything - our world, the past, etc. - is inhibited because of someone else's religion. I understand.  In fact, all the folklorists I trained under regarded themselves as scientists first. And it happens that the first article I submitted (before being drawn to history or folklore) used computer analysis to determine Martian soil composition and internal geology based on crater morphology using a matrix program and the Mariner photographs. It was over fifty years ago, and I just turned sixteen. The article was rejected! But at my heart, I am a scientist.  As a scientist, one of the things that drew me to the humanities was the need to think in nuanced terms, dealing with a world where "objective facts" where rare if non-existent. That’s the case, perhaps, in all disciplines – I understand that now, but at the time, the complex problem of dealing with human “truths” drew me in.   There are many paths to folklore, and I am sure someone out there lays with the role of objective fact in oral narrative. That said, I believe we would find a near consensus among folklorists that what is important is whether a narrative circulates – something that is far more important than whether what circulates is true or not. Here is an excerpt from my [Introduction to Folklore](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Folklore-Traditional-Studies-Elsewhere/dp/1521423261):  > One of the most widespread modern legends deals with the supernatural communication of death or injury by the traveling soul. My own family has two of these stories, both involving World War II. My father was in England before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, and he met an English family who had lost their son in combat. They explained that they had known the moment of his death because his picture on the mantel suddenly fell over with no explanation. His mother said she immediately understood this to mean that her son had died.  >While my father-in-law was fighting in Europe, he was wounded in the hand. Family oral tradition maintains that at that very moment (the exact moment, of course, would be difficult to verify), his mother, sitting at the dinner table in Iowa, felt a pain in her hand. She immediately announced, “Donald has been hurt.”  >Legends like these are repeated thousands of times in the modern world. They reveal the on-going belief in the ability of the soul to transcend space and death.  > One more example: there is a widespread legend told by countless families of the ghostly appearance of a loved one in anticipation of news that the individual died. This became a popular tradition in post-Famine Ireland because so many relatives lived in North America or elsewhere. But it is frequently told by all sorts of people internationally. So, we can ask, are there real-life, actual inspirations for this legend? That is, do the spirits of the dead actually come to visit loved ones? Well, how the hell should I know? To paraphrase a famous line from the television show “Star Trek,” “Damn it Jim, I’m a folklorist, not a ghost hunter.” And I have no intention of becoming a ghost hunter. It doesn’t matter what is behind stories so much as it does that people tell these stories. I’m in it for that part of the game; I consider stories as they are told over time, to gain from that material some insight into the past, into culture, and into the human condition. I am a folklorist. And with that, my plate is full.  So, let’s do a mind experiment. The story of “The Vanishing Hitchhiker” is well known and widespread – telling of a young woman who thumbs a ride, is taken to the requested destination, and then disappears, leaving the driver to do some detective work to find out that in fact the young woman died long ago and has been playing this ghostly trick on drivers for many years. Clearly, this is folklore, right?  What would happen, then, if we arrived at “scientific proof” that our spirits survived death in one form or another, and that one of the things our spiritual imprinted remnants do is to manifest in these sorts of ghosts. Would this story cease to be folklore? I don’t think so. The story is popular and it circulates. Any objective “facts” in the matter don’t play in the mix as far as I am concerned.  I hope that helps!	1643313896.0	huhfrj4	t3_sddlk2	t1_hug1vb9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/huhfrj4/

128xjc	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643315797.0	huhkwlh	t3_se79el	t3_se79el	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se79el/what_exactly_is_postmodernism_structure_and_flux/huhkwlh/

I would also consider it more likely than not that the main characters described in the epic (i.e. names of kings or great warriors like Hector and Achilles) actually existed.  >In other words, the story does not give the impression of being a mythologised version of real events, but a "realified" version of myth.  I don't know what this means. Either a war actually happened or it did not. Divine agency doesn't mean the "secular" events didn't actually happen. Virtually every civilization other than the modern West describes past events with reference to Divine agency.  >Conversely, if the Trojan War cycle is indeed rooted in a genuine historical war at Troy, that conflict has left almost no trace in its own story apart from its **location and apparent outcome**.   That is all we need to consider the war more likely to have happened than not. It is more likely that Homer wrote his poem based on an actual conflict than for it to be a mere coincidence.	1643316719.0	huhne7d	t3_sddlk2	t1_huh4v0z	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/huhne7d/

8rkx9	I'm confused by the term "storyteller" here. Oral historians don't normally refer to their informants as storytellers. Oral historians focus on historically verifiable information, enriched by firsthand narratives that explain elements of the past. Modern oral historians are carefully to understand the background of their informants so that any coloring of the narrative is understood in context.  Folklorists work with storytellers because their focus is the nature/qualities of the narrative. They also work with informants along the lines of ethnographers, when not retrieving storied narratives specifically, but rather, general information about folk life and other elements of culture. Again, folklorists and ethnographers attempt to understand (and describe) the background of their storytellers/informants to place the testimony acquired in perspective.  One is always frustrated with first-person narratives captured in historical documents, which fail to give us the fully biographies of narrators. As a folklorist, I am always craving just a little bit more information about the storyteller involved. Too often, there is no information at all – all we have is the story with no idea who told it!  But I’m not sure that’s where you are heading.	1643318380.0	huhrvwl	t3_se7k5a	t3_se7k5a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se7k5a/whats_the_place_of_the_storyteller_when/huhrvwl/

ii81e	Sadly not.  Many crusade sources, and accounts written by those living in Outremer, like to talk about the wildlife. For example, the Third Crusade ran into trouble when it encamped near a network of tarantula nests:  > As each night approached a sort of little vermin threatened them. They crawl in swarms along the ground giving the most horrible stabs and are popularly called ‘tarantulas’. By day they did no harm; but as night came on they would make an assault armed with very irritating stings. Anyone they stung immediately swelled up with the raging poison and was in terrible agony, although the noblemen and the more wealthy eased the swelling and reduced the pain by immediately applying ‘theriaca’, which was an effective antidote. At last the more vigilant noticed that a loud noise would make the pestilential vermin run away. So when the tarantulas approached, they would begin to make an enormous bang and clatter, each of them banging and beating on shields and helmets, stools and boards, casks, flasks, basins, plates and cooking pots, and any appliance or item of furniture suitable for making a noise which came to hand, since the racket drove the vermin away.  But it is unlikely that hamsters, if encountered by crusaders, were deemed noteworthy. Hamsters were not an exotic animal. Although most people are familiar with the Syrian hamster as a pet, there are European hamster populations in much of central and eastern Europe. The word 'hamster' comes from the German word 'hamstern' meaning 'to hoard'. However, the European hamster is aggressive and has resisted all attempts to domesticate it. They've been hunted as pest control to prevent them eating seeds and ruining harvests. The European hamster fills a similar ecological niche as rats - not noteworthy to any German crusader who may have seen a Syrian one.   However, although hamsters are a popular household pet, the Syrian hamster is very rare in the wild. Although it is hard to judge how many wild Syrian hamsters there are, it is unlikely to be more than a thousand. Even before human encroachment on their habitats, they were a rare animal. The most thorough book on animals in the medieval Middle East - *Mamluks and Animals: Veterinary Medicine in Medieval Islam* by Emilie Savage-Smith - makes no mention at all of hamsters. It seems they were only properly 'discovered' in the early modern period and were only captured for study in 1930. Obviously, local farmers and hunters would have known about them for the entirety of history - and had apparently called them the Arabic word for "saddlebags" - but nobody had actually been able to capture one for study until *less than a century ago.* Since then, truly wild Syrian hamsters (as opposed to escaped pets) have only been found a few times. They're elusive little fluffballs.  So no, neither crusaders or the people of Outremer say anything about hamsters. This may be because they just weren't noteworthy, but more probably because the wild population of Syrian hamsters has always been very small and the odds of a crusader finding one - let alone having the chance to study it and write down its characteristics - are extremely low.	1643318658.0	huhsnbi	t3_se1rv3	t3_se1rv3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se1rv3/did_the_crusaders_say_anything_about_hamsters/huhsnbi/

bsq2c	I struggled with the word choice tbh: 'speaker' seemed too generic, and 'interlocutor' implied an imposition by/role for the historian/recorder that might not (or maybe should not?) be there. I guess 'source' or 'informant' would have been preferred.	1643318859.0	huht6zi	t3_se7k5a	t1_huhrvwl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se7k5a/whats_the_place_of_the_storyteller_when/huht6zi/
ndy6v	I should point out that, under the constraints of the 20-year-rule of this sub, if John Paul II indeed starts this trend, he would be, for our purposes, a one-off phenomenon. He would remain pope until 2005. The short answer is that no, the papal celebrity factor doesn't really exist until the 20th century.   Before the 14th century, priests were asked that they prevent parents from giving their children ridiculous (and especially pagan) names, but this was not really universally observed. With the rise of the morality play and hagiographies for mass consumption in the 14th century, names began to take a turn—not towards the reigning pope but towards great saints. Spain and Greece even began to use names like Christ and Jesus for young boys. Catholic Europe doubled down on this with the Reformation in the 16th century, perhaps as a show of Catholic identity. (Protestants would replace saint names with the names of Old Testament figures; hence the stereotype in American media of good Protestant farmboys being named Obadiah.) In the Catholic world, great saints, especially local saints, would reign supreme.   In the Italian city of Padua, for example, Anthony has historically been the most popular name for boys, and Maria for girls. Maria, as a variant of Mary, is uniformly popular in Catholic circles---especially in Mexico, where she doubles as the subject of the Guadalupe apparitions---while Anthony was the name of Padua’s famous patron saint, Anthony of Padua.   A quick perusal of baptismal records in one parish of the United States gives an example of this pattern: Nearly every person in the Holy Trinity Church baptismal register in 1793 were given names which are easily associated with saints; though it is possible that they were named after family, those family bearing names like Catherine hearken back to the days when Catherine of Alexandria was one of the most popular saints of Medieval Europe.    I can’t find a source on this, so here’s my best guess at what made it change: It would take the rise of mass media beginning in the late 19th century, the dispute (and victory) of the ultramontanists around the same time at the First Vatican Council, and the disruption of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s for a figure like John Paul II to use celebrity status to attempt to unify a church undergoing several crises. The names appear to follow from what the churchgoers care about; since John Paul II, they care a lot more about the reigning pope.

8rkx9	"Storyteller" rang the folklore bell - hence my arrival. Given what you're after, then I believe the answer should be a resounding yes - oral historians should be using the same level of source criticism that one applies to long-dead authors of historical sources. Of course, not all oral historians are created equally. Some are less able than others (just like historians in general!).  That said, we need someone who works with oral histories, particularly with underrepresented communities, to weigh in here.	1643319444.0	huhurzr	t3_se7k5a	t1_huht6zi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se7k5a/whats_the_place_of_the_storyteller_when/huhurzr/

96gqp	Hi: What you're seeing is not actually a bug or anything of the sort, but is indeed a feature of our moderation. We have higher standards than many other subreddits when it comes to providing answers for the questions posted to /r/AskHistorians. As such, we end up removing a lot of subpar, incorrect, and low effort content that fails to meet these standards.  Unfortunately, Reddit (the website) does not update the comment count that appears for threads, even when items are removed by us or deleted by the authors of comments (which we have most certainly protested and the admins have clearly neglected to address). This is explained further in [this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h8aefx/rules_roundtable_xviii_removed_curation_and_why/), and to help mitigate this, try the [browser extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i6b42q/rules_roundtable_xxvi_be_kind_remind_revisited/) developed by a user that helps to provide a more accurate comment count.  You're welcome to re-ask your question once 24 hours have passed.	1643320378.0	huhx9js	t3_se8obk	t1_huhsmq9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se8obk/did_france_only_get_the_scraps_repost/huhx9js/

Anyone may start a meta post, but please [check with the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) if you aren't sure you're using the label correctly. Short questions (e.g. clarification of moderation policy) that don't require discussion are better sent to the mods directly.  * An **AMA** ("Ask Me Anything") with a historical expert or panel of experts. These should be arranged with the moderators beforehand – please [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) if you're interested.	1643320447.0	huhxg76	t3_se9m2e	t3_se9m2e	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se9m2e/are_machine_gunners_an_east_target_for_snipers/huhxg76/
96gqp	This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).    For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.	1643320460.0	huhxhfj	t3_se9nbc	t3_se9nbc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se9nbc/embrace_communism_or_return_to_feudalism_why/huhxhfj/
96gqp	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1643320494.0	huhxknl	t3_se9m5k	t3_se9m5k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se9m5k/would_you_say_there_has_been_a_country_that_could/huhxknl/

u9kma	This is mostly very accurate.  > The classical/medieval location of the city of Ilium/Troy was never in dispute. Everyone also assumed, but had not proven, that a pre-classical Ilium/Troy had existed at the same location too. In or around 1790, two other academics suggested that the pre-classical city of Ilium/Troy may have existed in a location other than that of the classical/medieval Ilium/Troy. They thought maybe it was a few miles further inland.  Just a couple of small points -- Le Chevalier was a diplomatic attaché, not an academic, and the site simply wasn't well known in western Europe. There had been a few visitors who wrote about it, like George Wood, but not much, and there wasn't much there to visit -- not at Troy itself, anyway: for tourists the interesting remains were along the coast, on the sites of Sigeion and Alexandria Troas. Archaeology was only beginning to be a thing so no one had really even thought of digging anything up.  > However, this dispute was resolved by the 1820s and most people went back to assuming that the pre-classical city was somewhere underneath the classical/medieval city.  Mostly. The alternate location did live on in people's imagination for some time: [here's a map from an 1842 survey](https://i.imgur.com/gAIoHim.png) that still shows both 'Ilium Novum' (the classical city) and 'Ilium Vetus' (the place where Le Chevalier imagined Homer's Troy was). When Schliemann wanted to excavate Troy, he still thought Le Chevalier's site was the place to dig, and had to be talked out of it by Frank Calvert, who was a bit more clued-up.  > Schliemann shows up in 1870 and blows the site up with dynamite. In addition to damaging other layers and artifacts in the explosion, he finds evidence of the pre-classical city under the site of the classical/medieval city. So basically, he just proved what scholars had already assumed since the 1820s and before the 1790s. Schliemann then goes on a self-promotion tour and announces that he has discovered Homer's Troy, which, he argues, adds credence to the Iliad. He falsely claims that no one believed the pre-classical city had existed prior to his discovery. The public hears this and amateurs believe him that no one believed in a pre-classical city until now. Some members of the public are skeptical of Schliemann and disbelieve that he has discovered a pre-classical city at that location. This then, leads to skepticism of whether the pre-classical city existed.  Pretty much. I'm not sure Schliemann ever actually claimed in so many words that 'no one believed the pre-classical city had existed prior to his discovery' -- but he certainly didn't discourage the idea.	1643322315.0	hui2dd8	t3_sddlk2	t1_hugszri	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hui2dd8/

u9kma	Cheers for the relevant snippet, but I suspect what /u/thesearmsshootlasers was getting at was: if Troy was only a thing from the 700s onwards, why were stories about a much older time set there?  The answer to that is that the older city had been abandoned around 950 BCE, and people forgot an awful lot of things about the past as the generations passed; BUT placenames can often be quite good at sticking even if no one's living there. The same holds true for a bunch of other placenames in Homer that were no longer inhabited by the time the *Iliad* was composed.  Also, there were (presumably) still some remains of the older city around at that time. Some activity in the neighbourhood of the site may have continued as well -- the cult of Apollo Thymbrios near Troy, for example, looks likely to have been continuous since the late Bronze Age. So it's a different situation from, say, Camelot, which is a wholly unknown place and may be genuinely unreal for all I know.	1643323273.0	hui4ujg	t3_sddlk2	t1_hufp2eg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hui4ujg/

4eqpgt78	This is a great question!        Before we begin, I would like to simply add a few disclaimers.   **Disclaimers**  The first of which being that as is often the case with naming conventions, nothing is absolutely certain, nor is it always consistent. To wrap all of the rationale of naming conventions into a nice conclusive package would be ideal, but it would also miss all of the intricacies and beauty that can make names so interesting!     The second important disclaimer I would like to add is that this sort of naming convention is not unique to Scandinavia, nor to the middle ages. Having ridiculous names and nicknames is as old as the written record, and even some of the terminology I intend to use in this answer actually derives from Greco-Roman tradition (cognomen is an Anglicized version of its Latin counterpart *cognomina*). You would likely find names such as Shaggy-Breeches more jarring as you often think of nicknames as generic (the Great, the Bold, etc), but by no means are these naming conventions rare or uncommon. To this disclaimer I will also add that the reverse is true, while King Harald is not named King Harald the Aldi Shopper, he is still called King Harald *of Norway*, which itself is a cognomen and descriptor of the location of his rule. Other modern monarchs, such as Queen Elizabeth, have even longer titles *Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith*. Just as it might be hard to delineate a clear time when this sort of naming convention started, it might be similarly difficult to narrow down a decisive period when it stopped (depending on your metric). That being said, I will give context as to why names like this existed, as well as why they might have fallen by the wayside. I will also only approach this from my area of expertise in the Scandinavian period, where the name you used as an example came from. My answer will also note nicknames, not “last names”, such as those ending in the suffix -dottir and -son, as I believe the answer to “why” for those sorts of names, is fairly obvious.         All of these disclaimers now officially noted, we can proceed with an answer!  **Intro**        Ragnar Shaggy-Breeches, as you noted in your question, is indeed a funny title and cognomen, and there are a few answers as to why we might see names such as this frequently within Scandinavian history (Ragnar himself may or may not have existed, something which I will get to later). I will divide my answer into three portions, naming as a function of literature, naming as a function of culture, and naming as a function of nobility, so I can explain the full breadth of just why we might have seen naming conventions like the ones in place for Ragnar's name.         **Naming as a function of literature**        Ragnar, and many kings and historical or semi historical figures like him, have lives that are not recorded in compact histories, but rather in sagas. These sagas themselves were composed throughout the “viking age”, and should be seen less as complete records or biographies, but a complex tapestry of oral tradition, folklore and real history. As such, sagas combine myth and historical figures, written down after decades of passage solely through oral tradition. Remembering what equates to thousands of lines of poetry, complex storylines and often repeating names, means that it is possible that names such as “bluetooth”, “wood cutter”, “shaggy-breeches” acted as helpful “kernels” to assist the poet in remembering storylines or deeds of famous figures. Ragnar, for instance, received his name from the breeches that he wore in a battle with a serpent. Given the nature of his enemy, he crafted them from wool and tar so as to avoid the serpent’s deadly venom. His death poem, *Krákumál*, composed in the 12th century,  recounts this as follows,        *Hjoggum vér með hjǫrvi.*    *Hitt vas æ fyr lǫngu,*    *es á Gautlandi gingum*    *at grafvitnis morði.*    *Þá fingum vér Þóru,*    *þaðan hétu mik fyrðar,*    *es lyngǫlun lagðak,*    *Loðbrók at því vígi;*    *stakk á storðar lykkju*    *stáli bjartra mála.*        *We cut with swords. It was ever so long ago, when we went in Gautland to the murder of the digging wolf (serpent). Then we received Þóra, and from then on warriors called me Loðbrók, when I killed the ling-eel (serpent) at the battle; I stabbed the steel of bright inlays (spear) into the loop of earth (serpent).*        An alternative account (in his formal tale *Ragnars saga loðbrókar*), which was part of the Volsunga manuscript that was written down formally in the 13th century (nearly 4 centuries after Ragnar himself was said to have lived), elaborates,       *But meanwhile he had made for himself a strange coat. It was wrought out of a hairy hide, which he boiled in pitch, drew through sand, and then dried and hardened in the sun. The next summer he sailed to East Gothland, hid his ships in a small bay, and at dawn of the next day proceeded toward the maiden's bower, spear in hand and wearing his strange coat. There lay the dreaded serpent, coiled in a ring round the wall. Ragnar, nothing daunted, struck it boldly with his spear, and before it could move in defence struck it a second blow, pressing the spear until it pierced through the monster's body. So fiercely did the snake struggle that the spear broke in two, and it would have destroyed Ragnar with the venom it poured out if he had not worn his invulnerable coat.*      Cognomens like “Shaggy Breeches” would have been easy for the poet to use and to recall the full story of Ragnar’s early legendary deeds, great feats of memory being assisted by seemingly ridiculous names.	1643324528.0	hui81em	t3_sd7coc	t3_sd7coc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd7coc/why_and_when_did_rulers_of_certain_countries_stop/hui81em/

4eqpgt78	2/2  **Naming as a function of culture**        While naming conventions might have served a literary purpose, they likely also served a function as a reflection of the culture. Even simple last names “-dottir” and “-son” in Icelandic sagas, allowed readers/listeners to determine who one was related to. Additional names could change through the course of one’s life or with accumulation of deeds (“the white”, “the brave”, etc.) While not nearly as strange as “shaggy-breeches” they were notable as they demonstrated what role one played in society, to their neighbors and family, and to those where their reputation might have preceded them. There is some indication that some thought that more cognomens made one more “lucky’, *Þorsteins saga hvíta* recalls         *Fekk hann af þessu þat viðrnefni, at hann var kallaðr Brodd-Helgi, en þá þótti mǫnnum þat miklu heillavænligra at hafa tvau nǫfn. Var þat þá átrúnaðr manna, at þeir menn myndi lengr lifa, sem tvau nǫfn hefði.*     He received the nickname from this event that he was called Brodd-Helgi, and back then it seemed to people greatly promising to have two names. At that time, it was people‟s belief that the people who had two names would live longer        Even among ordinary people, having names that indicated their function, physical features or pedigree could be a valuable tool. Especially with regards to areas where land was scarce and tensions could run high (such as in Iceland), having descriptive details for an individual was important in building community, and occasionally, fracturing it (if a negative nickname was assigned). I would highly suggest looking through this index \[[https://www.ellipsis.cx/\~liana/names/norse/vikbynames.html](https://www.ellipsis.cx/~liana/names/norse/vikbynames.html)\] , and briefly observing the variety of cognomens that can be found in just three sources (it should also be noted that often one could accrue more than one nickname, Magnús berfœttr “barefoot‟ – berbeinn “barelegged‟ – berleggr “barelegged‟ – enn hávi “the tall” – Styrjaldar-Magnús “Age of Unrest-‟ Magnús, is one example found within an Icelandic sagas).         **Naming as a function of nobility**        This portion attempts to marry the points made in my previous two sections. The addition of nicknames for kings can be seen as a combination of assigning local cultural values into myths and legends. Just as one might associate their neighbor with a certain deed, they might be assisted in remembering the legacies of kings (real or not) by recognizing a nickname. These nicknames helped in creating a collective memory that was distilled in the voices of skalds and traveled across thousands of miles and hundreds of years. In distant reaches where medieval Scandinavians might have limited contact with their rulers, passing along the deeds of their kings and legendary heroes could both build community and build the reputations of monarchs and warlords that people might never know. It is worthy of note that at certain points of the “viking age”, Scandinavian settlers were spread across the Atlantic from northern Canada (L'Anse aux Meadows in New Brunswick has clear archeological data to suggest a small settlement), to continental Europe. The tradition of oral storytelling was an unbelievably valuable tool. Just as the heroic and ferocious deeds of kings and warlords could be canonized in collective memory, the failures were also remembered. Associating oneself with a powerful king could carry social currency, and having a base of knowledge as to who was a “good” or “strong” king would be particularly valuable. As I mentioned previously, Ragnar himself may or not have existed (a quandary suitable for another lengthy answer), but his sons most certainly did exist (we are aware of their existence from outside sources as well as archeological and numismatic evidence that correlates with their mention in continental European sources). However, their legacies were important in that they first sought vengeance for the death of their father. They were associating their own names with not just any Ragnar, but Ragnar Lodbrok, the man who had, in his youth, cleverly designed pants to fend off a deadly serpent. Their father was brave and clever, and so seeking revenge on his behalf would have been justified. Names of kings, legendary or not, held great weight.         **What happened to these names/why did they stop being used?**        My final answer to this question is a reflection of all of the points made above. Lengthy cognomens were useful in literature, culture and as symbols of status. Why this practice stopped is likely a function of a change in all three of these factors. A change in literature, with a decline in oral tradition as a means of storytelling and the imposition of Christianity  (many of the sagas that I reference above were written down by Christian authors in Iceland who likely had a complicated web of organizing Christian religion with a “pagan” past). A change in community occurred, (the Black Death, a change in dynamics of local versus collective rule, declining seafaring and expansion, and many other factors fundamentally changed many aspects of Scandinavian culture in the 11th-15th centuries). Finally, the age of warlords and legendary and heroic leadership declined with the end of the “viking age”, expansion declined and towering reputations were no longer the currency of the land. However, as I noted at the beginning, narrowing down a decisive reason or end date for this practice is both unwise on my part, and also misses a lot of nuance necessary with discussion of naming practices.        **TL;DR**: Nicknames served many literary, political and cultural functions in medieval Scandinavia. Changes in all of these factors towards the end of the “viking age” led to a decline in their use.

Out of the list above, only Olga wrote a memoir herself but the husbands of both Xenia and Irina wrote their own memoirs.   Another good example is Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna the Younger— a first cousin of Nicholas II, but much younger than him. Her brother Dmitri (and her, but to a lesser extent due to her marrying very young) was treated by Nicholas much like only one of his own children. She wrote a memoir, but as a personal note I’ve always thought it a shame that Dmitri never did. I suspect the reason is his shame over his involvement in the murder of Rasputin which he would obviously have to address in a memoir (along with his relationship with Irina’s husband Felix) but still, it’s one of my top historical missed opportunities.  Excuse my little personal diatribe, I hope I answered your question!	1643325946.0	huibjpd	t3_se16t1	t1_huhsnxi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se16t1/how_did_rulers_fleeing_their_countries_pay_for/huibjpd/

alo03	Mormons largely saw the Civil War as punishment being meted out to the United States for their treatment of their faith in the years leading up to it.  By the time of the Civil War began in 1861, the majority of Mormons had traveled west and settled in Utah, which at that time was US territory and called Utah Territory.  This group, often referred to as the LDS Church or the Brighamite Church,  as it was led by Brigham Young, had a largely negative view of the United States government.  Just four years prior to the beginning of the Civil War, the Mormons were involved in the Utah War.  Much can be said about that conflict, but essentially it was a conflict between the appointed administrators and judges of the Utah territory who were non-Mormon, and the populace, which was overwhelmingly Mormon and preferred to recognize their religious leaders as having authority over almost everything.  As these administrators reported back to Washington and then some left their posts for fear of their safety, President James Buchannon sent troops to Utah, fearing rebellion.  The Mormons in turn prepared for the troops, which they had learned were coming but whose intentions they did not know.  They prepared for evacuation (and actually did leave Salt Lake City before troops arrived) and made plans to burn their homes, crops, and property so the US troops would have no resources to stay.   The result of the Utah War was that Buchannon replaced Brigham Young as governor and left a garrison of US troops to enforce civil authority in Utah, which was immensely resented by the Mormons and described as an occupation.   In that context, and with the prior grievances of Mormons stemming from conflicts in Missouri and Illinois, the Civil War was seen as an affliction upon all of the United States, and one that was not within the Mormon's ability to control or influence.  As a result, the Mormons largely did not participate in the war.  Their only real involvement was in raising a couple groups of Calvary to maintain trade/mail routes safe from Indian raids when the US troops left as a result of the need for all troops to engage in the Civil War.   The best estimate of Mormon participants in the Civil War indicate that only a few hundred Mormons participated, mostly for the North, as the majority of Mormons had originally been from the Northeast of the United States.  Mormon men were not encouraged to fight in the war.   Most leaders who expressed opinions on the matter indicated that the war was God's punishment to the United States for its treatment of the church, both in Missouri, from which it had been expelled, and then in connection with the Utah War.   One leader of the church, Orson Hyde, during the Civil War, declared that "Joseph Smith once said, on the stand in Nauvoo, Illinois, that if the Government of the United States did not redress the wrongs of the Mormon people inflicted upon them in the State of Missouri, the whole nation should be distracted by mobs from one end to the other; and that they should have mobs to the full and to their ‘hearts content.’"   Another leader, Wilford Woodruff, speaking in 1862 about the Civil War declared, "It is a hard dealing of the Almighty and we cannot help it.”   Brigham Young also declared it to be a scourge on the United States for its treatment of the church and its members.  “God has come out of his hiding place and has commenced to vex the nation that has rejected us, and he will vex it with a sore vexation. It will not be patched up—it never can come together again—but it will be sifted with a sieve of vanity, and in a short time it will be like water spilled on the ground.”  During the War, the church and its militia, the Nauvoo Legion largely stayed out of the war.  In 1862, during the Civil War, the United States passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in response to the polygamy practiced by Mormons at that time, as well as the massive ownership of property by the Mormon church.  The law banned polygamy in US territory and also prohibited non-profit ownership of land in US territory over $50,000.  According to the book Zion in the Courts by Edwin Brown and Richard Mangrum (2001), Abraham Lincoln chose not to enforce the law in exchange for Utah's non-participation in the Civil War.  "Abraham Lincoln reportedly compared the LDS Church to a log he had encountered as a farmer that was 'too hard to split, too wet to burn and too heavy to move, so we plow around it. That's what I intend to do with the Mormons. You go back and tell Brigham Young that if he will let me alone, I will let him alone.'"   So the Mormon church did not pick sides, and rather stayed out of the conflict and rather saw it as a conflict between those that had afflicted them.  For more reading, see the book above and also “We Know No North, No South, No East, No West”: Mormon Interpretations of the Civil War, 1861–1865 by Richard E. Bennett.	1643328527.0	huihr9c	t3_se5p2n	t3_se5p2n	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se5p2n/how_did_mormons_react_to_the_american_civil_war/huihr9c/

c0sk2	This is a great question! To answer your question let me outline what the political landscape looked like during the election of 1860, essentially the eve of the Civil War. A glimpse of the parties involved will give us insight into how the American people felt. Keep in mind our ideas of "left" and "right" wing that we use today don't really apply to 1860, so I will avoid using those terms when describing the spectrum. During the 1860 election we have 4 political parties:     * The Republican Party - The candidate is Abraham Lincoln who received almost 40% of the popular vote. The general Republican platform on the slavery issue is that slavery should not be extended into new US territories or future states. Namely, they were against the Kansas-Nebraska Act which allowed those newly created territories to hold a popular vote on whether or not slavery would be allowed within their borders. This was a direct nullification of the earlier Missouri Compromise, which would have banned slavery in both Kansas and Nebraska because they both were above latitude 36°30'. Disregarding the Missouri Compromise meant that slavery could possibly continue into new territories, while the Republican Party wanted to simply contain slavery where it already was. The Republican Party would have been seen at the far side of the spectrum for these 4 parties.    Although politicians like Lincoln were actually fairly moderate, the party was popular with die hard abolitionists as well. If we go all the way to the extreme end of this side of the spectrum, we end up with the Radical Republicans, with members like Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens. Radical Republicans held the idea that slavery should be abolished and black emancipation granted. The Radical Republicans often directly insulted Southern planters, and were the group that greatly inflamed Southerners into threats of succession. A great example is when Charles Sumner gave an hours long speech on the senate floor about the horrors of the Kansas-Nebraska Act while simultaneously throwing personal insults at plantation owner Andrew Butler by calling him a pimp for owning slaves. Days later he would pay for his speech by being beaten with a cane by South Carolina senator Preston Brookes  * The Constitutional Union Party - Their candidate was John Bell who received about 13% of the vote. This newly formed party was about as centrists as you could get in the 1860s. They wanted to completely shift their focus away from slavery altogether. The party itself was made up of Southerners who did not want succession, but wanted to keep their slaves. The reason this group is typically seen as moderates though is because they were the only one of the 4 parties to not adapt any official stance on the slavery question.  * The Democratic Party - Their candidate was Stephen A Douglas who received about 30% of the popular vote. At this point in time the Democratic party had fractured into 2 distinctive branches formed mostly by geographical lines. Northern Democrats wanted to preserve the Union, keep slavery where it already was, and allow new territories to vote on whether or not they wanted slavery (Known as Popular Sovereignty). Southern Democrats by contrast wanted to actively take part in the say of slavery in new territories (I'll explain more about them below). The Democratic Party would eventually make a clean break, with the Southern Democrats making their own separate party, and the Northern Democrats being all that was left of the original Democratic Party. On the spectrum, the Democratic Party would be off centered far away from the Republican side.  * The Southern Democratic Party - Their candidate was John C Breckenridge who got 18% of the vote but carried almost every Southern state. This party represents the far side of the spectrum opposite the Republican Party. The slavery question was simple for them: new territories should be allowed to have slaves automatically, or at the very least a slave state be admitted for every free state. On the extreme end of this party would be those labeled as "fire-eaters", Southerners who openly spoke about secession if pro-slavery laws were not passed. This is the group that frequently blamed the Radical Republicans for their threats of secession, believing that the Radical Republicans influenced all political decisions.     So now the other part your question: Was there blame laid on anti-slavery forces for pushing away centrists? The answer is yes. Abolitionists who believed slaves should be freed were seen as fairly extreme, hated in the South, and not very well liked in much of the North. Northerners feared immediate emancipation would greatly disrupt the economy and social structure, and typically wanted to keep slavery contained or look at gradual emancipation. They looked at abolitionists with fear that their extreme views would bring complete social upheaval both because it would upset Southerners and possibly lead to secession, but also because it would mean a huge influx of black people to Northern cities. Likewise, Southerners hated abolitionists because their ideas meant the end of their society, both economically, politically, and socially. To them, abolitionists were the antithesis of everything they hated about the North. In the end though, abolitionists and the Radical Republicans ironically had far more influence on Southern Democrats and Fire-Eaters than on fellow Republicans in the North. The Radicals extreme views brought out the worst fears in Southerners, and completely drowned out moderate voices like those of the Democratic Party or the Constitutional Union Party.  Sources:   A great book on the politics right before the Civil War, and where I got most of this information from is: *Year of Meteors: Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, and the Election that Brought on the Civil War* by Douglas R. Egerton     For opinions on the North and South's views on abolitionists and the attack on Charles Sumner I mostly used information from the book: *The Caning: The Assault That Drove America to Civil War* by Stephen Puleo	1643331598.0	huip4fl	t3_schvo4	t3_schvo4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/schvo4/in_the_lead_up_to_the_american_civil_war_where/huip4fl/

Many posts from five years ago would be deleted today.   And I’ll we’re talking about is imaginary Internet points. I’d like to think as gratified as the posters would be by the upvotes the best way to acknowledge them is by referencing those old posts in new answers.	1643334128.0	huiv3bj	t3_se8xn2	t3_se8xn2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se8xn2/meta_has_the_possibility_of_enabling_voting_on/huiv3bj/
9v6a6	Yes, the mod team has discussed it internally, when the change first rolled out, and our determination at that time was not to turn off archiving for now at least. We want to see how other subs deal with it, and how much content actually ends up happening in older threads, and how easy it can be moderated.  While there definitely are some positives that suggest itself with such a change, we also have serious concerns about how effectively we would be able to moderate comments in older threads.   A reevaluation and discussion of the state of things will likely happen at some point, but it also isn't a high priority at this time. What would certainly be nice is if we could *adjust* the archive period... But that of course isn't a thing right now.	1643334184.0	huiv7yg	t3_se8xn2	t3_se8xn2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se8xn2/meta_has_the_possibility_of_enabling_voting_on/huiv7yg/

To summarise the relevant details, there were a number of plans for such a landing in development in 1915. The first was a vaguely formulated plan for a landing in Flanders in early 1915, pushed largely by the Army. This was cancelled as the troops that would have been used for it were instead sent to Gallipoli, seen as a more important strategic target as it would make shipping between Britain/France and Russia much easier and more practical, letting Russia take a larger and more effective role in the war. After this, Admiral Bacon, commanding the main British force in the Channel, put together a plan to land   from fishing vessels in Ostend. This was cancelled following an increase in German coastal defences. Operation Hush would then be developed, starting in 1916. The planning and preparations needed for this complex attack pushed it back into 1917.	1643335388.0	huiy0fn	t3_secy1r	t3_secy1r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/secy1r/why_didnt_the_entente_attempt_an_amphibious_in/huiy0fn/

7hg014qq	I have to admit, my google-fu failed me prior to posting this question, and after I posted I noted several similar questions on the subject!  Reading your second link, I am glad you mentioned the Baltic project. I had forgot about that. Your response is more a detailed explanation of that, than I have previously seen. My initial thought on the subject, is that it appears to be largely wishful thinking and unfeasible. It seems that the admiralty did not seem to take into account the German internal lines of communication via the Kiel Canal, and just assumed they would give the German High Seas Fleet a good drubbing. From what you posted, it seems that there was quite some thought put into the project and it was not just some pipedream.     As to the rest of the post, it seems that Gallipoli hung its head over everything (naval forces being used elsewhere), and that the initial 1915 plan was essentially just a proto-Operation Hush and not a Gallipoli-size landing. That to me, unless I missed something, kind of returns to my core question: why Gallipoli rather than a large scale offensive to try and win the major front?	1643337162.0	huj24kp	t3_secy1r	t1_huiy0fn	/r/AskHistorians/comments/secy1r/why_didnt_the_entente_attempt_an_amphibious_in/huj24kp/

1rq4zc	Really interesting question! It seems the Act generated fairly little controversy, and with the exception of a few activists and articles, it doesn't seem that many Native Americans were all that enthused about citizenship anyway (in fact, some were opposed to it). So how did the Act pass, and why with so little fanfare?   It's a combination of three factors:  *Most Native Americans were already citizens, so people weren't that worked up about it, and only made  about 125,000 people citizens in a nation of over 100 million *The vestiges of Progressive politics were still kicking around, and *perhaps* there was a desire to reward Native Americans for their service in the First World War  *Just because they were citizens didn't mean they could vote  So the first thing to know is that most Native Americans were already citizens by the time the Indian Citizenship Act was passed. Various laws and treaties had granted most of them citizenship before 1924.   Through the 19th century, treaties with tribes and individual agreements with the federal government granted citizenship to Native Americans. Sometimes, when the feds were removing (i.e., ethnically cleansing) Native Americans from certain lands, some Indians were granted citizenship and land if they refused to move. This wasn't a huge method by which Indians were granted citizenship, but it did happen. Sometimes treaties with entire tribes would be entered into, in which the tribe was dissolved in exchange for citizenship.   The big mover for Native American citizenship pre-1924 was the Dawes Act of 1887. This Act forcibly allotted Indian land to individual Indians (the goal was to force Native Americans to adopt private property), and those who accepted their allotment were given citizenship. However, the land was held in trust for 25 years, ensuring Native Americans couldn't really dispose of the land like a typical landowner. (A bit ironic that the system was intended to build a culture of private property among Native Americans, but denied them the main benefits.)  The 1906 Burke Act helped to speed things along in a counterintuitive way. It changed the rules so that citizenship was only granted at the end of the trust period, *but* gave the President the discretion to shorten the trust period from the 25 year default. With the shortened trust periods, Native Americans were more willing to accept their allotments, and when the trust period ended they became citizens. By 1901 a little over 150,000 had been granted citizenship, roughly half of the total number of Indians in the country.   Also, in 1919, several thousand Native Americans who served honorably in WW1 were given the ability to petition courts for citizenship.   This brings us to the second point: the vestiges of progressive sentiment and recognition of Native American gallantry in WW1. Now, the common explanation for the Act has generally been that Congress was grateful for the gallantry of Native American soldiers and decided to grant all Native Americans citizenship in recognition of this. This is the explanation you'll see on most websites if you google the Act (with the only cited sources saying the same thing without actual evidence). There are a few problems with the WW1 explanation. First, Congress had already passed a law allowing Native American soldiers to become citizens. Second, if the law was passed in gratitude for service in WW1, why did it happen five years after? Third, why is there no mention in the legislative history (that is, the congressional records of debate on bills) of Native American service in the passage of the Act? The most logical explanation is that WW1 had little to do with it (probably not *nothing*, but it isn't the main factor, in my opinion).   The explanation given in a fascinating article from 1972 in the New Mexico Historical Review is that the Indian Citizenship Act was written the way it was to curb the power of the Department of the Interior. The bill that was the starting point of the Indian Citizenship Act was introduced in January 1924, and was *very* different from what ultimately was passed. This bill, HR 6355, gave the Department of the Interior the discretion to grant citizenship to Native Americans. In other words, no blanket grant of citizenship--the Interior Department would write rules on how Indians could become citizens (presumably they'd be pretty complicated) and would be the ultimate decider. Yet less than 6 months later, in May, the bill granted *all Indians born in the United States citizenship.* A drastic difference. How'd that happen?   Well, the senators on the Committee for Indian Affairs were mostly Progressives of the Wilsonian variety, and were suspicious of giving a bureaucracy as notoriously inefficient and corrupt as the Interior Department (just recovering from the Teapot Dome scandal) yet more power over the lives of Native Americans. Their solution? Just give them all citizenship and go home. The change was accepted, generated almost no debate, and the law was passed in May 1924.   Yet that still doesn't quite answer the question, now does it? How could the Senate have made such a seemingly dramatic move--to grant *all Indians* citizenship--without massive political blowback? Indeed, how was the House bill giving the Department of the Interior discretion to grant any Indian citizenship even a political possibility in such a racist era?   The answer probably lies in the aforementioned fact that most Indians were already citizens, and also that the law did not, in the slightest, mean that every Indian could vote now. The only question asked on the House floor when the Senate version of the bill--which, again, was a blanket grant of citizenship--was whether the law would affect state voting regulations. The answer was *no.*   It is critical to understand that in the United States, citizenship does not automatically mean you have the right to vote. States decide who is qualified to vote, and they have extremely broad discretion. For example, many states deny felons the right to vote, even though felons are citizens. Some states even let non-citizens vote in certain elections! Now, there are certain constitutional amendments and federal laws in place stating that the vote cannot be granted to one group but excluded to another. For example, the 15th Amendment bans voting discrimination on the basis of race, and the 19th on the basis of sex. But that is *not* the same as saying the states *have to give everyone a right to vote.*   The result is that states have enormous discretion in their voting laws, and often use them to discriminate against groups they don't like--including Native Americans. The case of *Porter v. Hall* in Arizona, from 1928, is a good example--Native Americans were categorically denied the right to vote in Arizona because of their status as "wards" of the federal government. (That case would be overturned 20 years later by the Arizona Supreme Court). Utah used the fact that Native Americans lived on reservations and therefore weren't Utah residents to deny them the franchise until 1957. In addition, many of the same tools used to deny Black people the right to vote during Jim Crow were used against Native Americans, particularly in Western states with high Indian populations. Poll taxes, literacy tests, taking away polling places in Indian communities, you name it, they tried it.   So another big reason why no one seemed to care too much about the Indian Citizenship Act is that it *didn't* actually expand the voting base in a meaningful way. States were still free to deny Native Americans the right to vote even though they were now citizens. Life wouldn't change much for Native Americans as a result of their new citizenship; they got few additional rights, and the government would continue to find new and creative ways to screw them.   Hope that answers your question.  Sources:   Willard Rollings, CITIZENSHIP AND SUFFRAGE: THE NATIVE AMERICAN STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE AMERICAN WEST, 1830-1965, 5 Nev. L.

amauf1bf	The Mormons imported slaves from Southern cotton plantations (about a dozen, IIRC) into the Utah Territory near present-day St. George to raise cotton. They failed because of the climate.  Also, Mormon theology was very specific on the status of dark-skinned people: they "bore the Mark of Cain for their intransigence in the premortal estate." They had to have been at least sympathetic to the Southern cause of preserving slavery as a means of separating the races.	1643339153.0	huj6oen	t3_se5p2n	t1_huihr9c	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se5p2n/how_did_mormons_react_to_the_american_civil_war/huj6oen/
4dhzmogu	Technically, they don’t.  They use English nicknames, their legal names are Chinese characters.  Pre Handover, it was a political stance of how to interact with the colonial British  - if you used an English nickname, you ‘went along to get along’  - If you used the initials of your Chinese name (so TS Wong) you were anti-colonial, but not pro Beijing  - If you used your full Chinese name, (Ho Sin Hung) you were anti-colonial and pro-Beijing  You could see political shifts in names.  The first post-handover lead (Tung Chee-Hwa) had been CH Tung until he moved into the pro Beijing camp  A prominent pro Beijing politician (Tsang Yok Sing) insisted on being referred to as such in newspaper, even though everyone knew that he used the name Jasper in day to day life and with friends and family.  It was only when British rule was a distant memory that he started being referred to as Jasper in print.  Some other fun facts.  For girls, flower and month names are popular/ common.  This dates back to when nuns in schools would assign English names at the start of school - going round the class with ‘April, May, June, Iris, Daisy’ etc  Raymond is a popular mans name as it sounds good in Cantonese.  Richard is very uncommon as it sounds bad in Cantonese (homonym for ‘limp penis’…)	1643339173.0	huj6q1t	t3_seg1ro	t3_seg1ro	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seg1ro/when_did_hongkongers_start_using_english_names/huj6q1t/

62kfpgka	So two issues raised here:  soldiers trying to find a general they like serving under, and secondly trying to find a better posting.  As for the first: Roman generals (*legati Augusti*) cycled through at a relatively brisk clip: the average term was 2-3 years (Agricola's seven years in Britain is the longest provincial tenure attested, and was exceptional). So if you hate your general and think he's an idiot, you basically can grit your teeth and wait him out.   We definitely know that Roman soldiers tried to switch units, although usually the motive is professional opportunity, particularly since there was an overall status hierarchy in the army from the fleet (lowest), to the auxiliary cohorts and then the legions (highest). For example, papyrus letters from a soldier named Claudius Terentianus show his enlistment in a fleet after his failure to get a position in the legions, his hopes of transferring to an auxiliary cohort, and his eventual transfer into a legion.   We know from centurions' careers that they routinely transferred from legions (as well as commanding auxiliary cohorts praepositus), and clearly these were positions that they sought out, through various personal and professional connections and a great deal of patronage.  There is little evidence to suggest that Roman soldiers tried to transfer for other reasons (e.g. don't like the weather), although there is evidence of units proving reluctant to deploying to new locations (especially given that Roman soldiers tended to put down roots).  In short, probably very few transfers on account of the weather or bad leadership, but you might successfully transfer to a more desirable unit, or in pursuit of promotion and advancement.	1643340189.0	huj90ez	t3_scg67f	t3_scg67f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scg67f/could_roman_soldiers_transfer_between_generals/huj90ez/

i6kyb	*Le Roman de Silence* is one of the most interesting medieval texts, although it was clearly less popular than *Yde et Olive*, which has some of the same cross-dressing themes (but which aren't explores in anywhere near the same depth).  *Raoul de Cambrai* is the classic *chanson de geste*, full of bloody battles, feuds and duels and is often used as a source for medieval warfare.  *Aye d'Avignon* is a personal favourite, with some red hot lines and a protagonist whose first thought on being locked in a tower is "okay, how do I escape?"  *The History of William Marshal* is an excellent work of vernacular literature, designed to entertain with amusing anecdotes as much as praise the subject. Bryant's translation is very readable and captures the spirit of the original quite well, and he footnotes where he's changed the phrasing significantly to convey the meaning better to a modern audience.	1643340978.0	hujas52	t3_sd6m46	t1_huaog0y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6m46/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_26_2022/hujas52/

35o90f0i	In the context I've mentioned, the Turkic invasion was the tilting moment for the decline, and the primary reason was because of this concentration on just the monastery. The killings of the Buddhist scholars created a massive dearth and the lay people were sort of left rudderless. Dr Ambedkar covers this in his book.  [https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume\_03.pdf](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_03.pdf)  What he adequately doesn't address, later research by Lars sheds more light on this.  So when the main front-runners of the Sangha were harmed, the fall of Buddhism was confirmed because the Turks could not stand to see the idols of Buddha, or the knowledge of the monasteries and thereby burnt it. This was equally true for the Hindus in Kashmir as well, the destruction wasn't less but one of the important factors that slowed down the process was because it was not as centralized and restricted to the Sangha like the Buddhists, there are various other factors too though.  Bhattacharya's book actually mentions there were more Buddhist scholars than the Vedics until like the 12th or 13th century. Adi Shankara's efforts to present the true idea behind the Vedas, certainly took some time to materialize and his padayatra was primarily about constant debate with other scholars, there is no record of any brutality.   With this in mind, 'fabric' here means the invasions targeted directly the roots of Dharma itself(monastery, temples, universities) and tried to erase everything related to their life and culture. Dharma roughly can be translated to a way of life or the *kind of life* that allows one to uphold their duty.   Their very existence was destroyed, sculptures were defaced and even the term 'Buddha' was contorted to suit their agenda, with intention to hurt religious sentiments, and it was never just a political conquest for the Muslims. Dr BR covers this.  All three Dharmic religions, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism agree that the Truth always existed and so the actual moment in history as to when the doctrine came about, the texts were written does not affect the religions as such, but in does in the modern world because others are dismissive and hateful of the religion itself. So Dharma is nothing but this path of life, the Truth itself. How each religion interprets what 'Dharma' is, this path, again differs, and they follow what their scriptures and Masters explain about it.  So the second part of your question makes no sense and is irrelevant as long as one isn't in conflict with the other, like how the Turks couldn't stand the idols, couldn't accept Polytheism, couldn't bare to see fire rituals - the list goes on. There's no inherent philosophical issue from the standpoint of any of three Dharmic religions, Jainism, Buddhism, or Hinduism with regard to any other religion.	1643342284.0	hujdn14	t3_s2jn9v	t1_huhg9va	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s2jn9v/buddhism_flourished_in_india_for_hundreds_of/hujdn14/

7hg014qq	David Fletcher is the expert on British tanks. His work *British-Made Tanks of World War II* provides two reasons for the naming of three different tanks.    The TOG 1 and TOG 2, to the best of my knowledge prototypes, were named after the "Old Gang" (Eustace Tennyson D'Eyncourt, Ernest Swinton, William Tritton, and Harry Ricardo. Fletcher implies the old gang may have comprised more, but there were the main people behind the Special Vehicle Development Committee).    The A25 Harry Hopkins was named after FDR's special adviser in the UK at the time. However, Fletcher concedes "why it should \[be\] named after him is not known".	1643343516.0	hujg71e	t3_seeo1a	t3_seeo1a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seeo1a/was_the_naming_of_equipment_and_fortifications/hujg71e/

1rq4zc	Interestingly, Native American support for citizenship was pretty mixed in the leadup to the Act. Many did not support citizenship at all. One of the stranger things about the Act is how little Indian commentary there was on something you'd think would be momentous. The inference I draw from this is that Indians weren't all that worked up about citizenship because they (accurately) felt that it wouldn't change much for them.	1643344542.0	hujiaj4	t3_se3htl	t1_huj6s4t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se3htl/in_1924_at_the_height_jim_crow_laws_and/hujiaj4/
7hg014qq	I just had a look in Fletcher's *The Great Tank Scandal* and he does not appear to agree with Chamberlain and Ellis.   He wrote "How the Valentine got its name is still the subject of divided opinions", and states the design was not handed in on Valentines Day, but a few days before. So it "may hold a kernel of truth". However, he also wrote that it is possible it was named in in tribute to Sir John Carden. He had designed the suspension, and his middle name was Valentine. However, Fletcher notes he had been dead for three years by that point. A third suggestion, which he does not think holds water, is that is an acronym of Vickers-Armstrong Ltd, Elwswich & Newcastle-upon-Tine.   He also disputes the idea that Elles' coined the Matilda name, and stated that it was just an inhouse codename while they were designing it and that it stuck.	1643345018.0	hujj8ov	t3_seeo1a	t1_hujg71e	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seeo1a/was_the_naming_of_equipment_and_fortifications/hujj8ov/
gde6c	"Cultural relativism," a phrase usually associated with anthropology but relevant in most social sciences and humanities, is hardly "controversial." Rather, for an anthropologist like myself, it's one of the fundamental assumptions that makes my work possible.  The following is copied from my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/lutnuc/anthropological_case_against_cultural_relativism/gp9ycix).  Cultural relativism is not moral or ontological relativism.  It's the analytical approach/theoretical basis used by any anthropologist that says you have to look at the use and history of something within a culture, and only within that culture, to understand it. It cannot tell you if something is "good" or "acceptable" anymore than a thermometer can measure an object's weight. It's simply the wrong tool.  Cultural relativism must be understood in context of earlier anthropology theory, specifically the evolutionary models of the 19th century. These paradigms understood cultural practices in terms of universalizing categories. "Cultures with a God of Blood are necessarily warlike" or "Cultivating tubers means that a society believes in an underworld." Often this took the form of evolutionary stages: "Cultures with traits X, Y, and Z are in the stage of upper barbarism, and so we can say A, B, and C about them." These approaches would assign certain qualities to human sacrifice- e.g. people do it to stabilize population levels, or it occurs in cultures that don't differentiate humans and animals- and then make inferences across all cultures that practiced it.  Cultural relativism was the result of people at the turn of the 20th century actually going out and doing fieldwork. It turns out that those universalizing norms aren't very helpful for understanding humans. Even cultures who inherited a practice from the same source don't understand that practice in the same way. Consider something as simple as watching soccer. There are millions of people doing this at any given moment, and there's clearly a single origin for this practice. Yet what it means to people in different communities can be very, very different. Going to a soccer game at my high school and university, both of which had recently won big conference titles, was a different practice then going to one at my grad school, where people forget we even have sports teams. The status of soccer compared to other sports varies between towns, states, and countries.  All cultural relativism says is that if I want to understand what soccer means to the people in this small Irish farm town, it doesn't matter much what it means to students in Dehli, India. Watching soccer isn't inherently "manly" or "lower class" or a "builder of group cohesion" or a "performative display of nationalism." It could be any of those things in a culture, but its role is specific to that culture and not a property of soccer itself. Conversely, the non-relativist approach is me claiming that soccer is a "ritual contestation of masculine identity," and then analyzing soccer as such in every case where it is played.  ___  The rest of that post discusses what cultural relativism looks like in the context of a moral question, which isn't quite what's come up here.  I would instead recommend [this introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/kf4bo7/how_many_otherkin_are_actually_out_there_and/gg69x39) to a recent PhD dissertation about folks who identify as ["Otherkin." ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherkin). As with "myths," studying Otherkin communities invokes questions of what is "fantastical." Putting it into a modern context without the baggage of religion, etc. helps see how one can engage with these ideas at an analytical level (what role do these narratives serve? What sociocultural environment lead to them?) without having to confront that whole issue of "how distant are these from reality?" You'll find that if you try to answer those analytical questions from the starting point of "why are they so disconnected from reality" you'll get really limited answers.	1643345208.0	hujjma5	t3_sddlk2	t1_hue4zvl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sddlk2/historians_used_to_believe_the_city_of_troy_was/hujjma5/

4sa5v	Although it was hardly the only way Japanese citizens processed defeat, surrender and occupation, *kyodatsu* (虚脱) was the term applied to the mix of "depression and disorientation" collectively experienced across the country.  [In Embracing Defeat, John Dower writes:](http://www.endofempire.asia/0815-3-defeat-and-despair-3/)  >On the morning after the emperor’s surrender broadcast, farmers in Kanagawa prefecture did something unprecedented: they slept late. What is one to make of this? Had years of physical and emotional exhaustion caught up with them? Was this collective behaviour an all too human response to the shock of defeat? Is it best seen as a homely harbinger of the enervating ‘kyodatsu condition’? Surely, the farmers’ fatigue was all of these.   >   >Acknowledging defeat was traumatic, and this trauma found immediate expression in a rhetoric of despair. People spoke of the ‘shame and dishonour’ of unconditional surrender. For many, sudden confrontation with the hitherto unspeakable words maketa senso – ‘lost war’ – was almost stupefying. Since the early 1930s, the Japanese had been told they were a ‘great country’ and a ‘great empire,’ a ‘leading race’ destined to overthrow Western imperialism and bring about a ‘Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,’ a people possessed of a unique and indomitable ‘Yamato spirit.’   >   >Now, what could one say to the war dead? How was one supposed to survive, spiritually as well as materially, in the midst of such a stupendous abandonment of purpose? Any people mobilized to fight a holy war and then, after prolonged sacrifice, told that they had been totally defeated, that it was now incumbent on them to go along with whatever the victor commanded, might have responded similarly. However elusive the term kyodatsu might have been, little was peculiarly Japanese about the state of depression and disorientation it described insofar as the immediate psychic numbing of defeat was concerned.   >   >To attribute the ‘kyodatsu condition’ simply to the shock of defeat would be misleading, however, for exhaustion of a deep and complex sort had set in long before 15 August 1945 as a result of the government’s policy of wasting its people in pursuit of impossible war objectives. In the final year of the war, the secret records of the police as well as diaries from the privileged elites were shot through with expressions of apprehension concerning the war weariness and declining morale of the populace. Similarly, the fact that exhaustion and despondency lasted for years did not so much reflect the lasting trauma of defeat as the manner in which wartime fatigue was compounded by incompetence and outright corruption on the part of the post-surrender leadership. In the long view of history, Japan rebounded quickly from defeat. For ordinary people, however, the postwar recovery seemed agonizingly slow.  I heavily recommend *Embracing Defeat* for a comprehensive view of Japanese society's views and reactions to the American occupation.	1643347430.0	hujnulc	t3_seb70p	t3_seb70p	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seb70p/what_were_the_reactions_and_sentiments_of_the/hujnulc/

eduun	While I can't provide an answer to how "common" archery was in the USA in 1900, I can contextualise the rise of organised competition in that time period.  Of particular note is the work done by brothers J. Will & Maurice H. Thompson after the Civil War, in which Confederate soldiers were not allowed to own firearms, necessitating the use of the bow as a hunting tool. The Thompson brothers would publish two notable texts, [How to Train in Archery](https://www.archerylibrary.com/books/train/) and [The Witchery of Archery](https://www.archerylibrary.com/books/witchery/) \- the former being a comprehensive text on competition shooting using the standard York round, the latter being a detailed manual on bowhunting and fieldcraft.  The Thompson brothers founded the National Archery Association (NAA) in 1879, which continues today as USA Archery, the national governing body for sport archery.  The 1904 Olympic Games in St Louis was host to an all-American event, otherwise formally the 26th Grand Annual Target Meeting of the NAA, with 23 men and 6 women competing across all events.  Notably in the 1920s, there was a revival of interest in Native American archery through the work of [Saxton Pope](https://www.archerylibrary.com/books/pope/hunting-with-bow-and-arrow/), relating his experiences with [Ishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishi), the last Yana Indian.  In brief, while I doubt we can come up with exact numbers to ascertain how common archery was, we can certainly say that archery was promoted as a form of hunting and sport, given the foundations of significant individuals and organisations during this time.  **Further Reading:**  * [The Archery Library](https://www.archerylibrary.com/) * [Olympedia](http://www.olympedia.org/editions/3/sports/ARC) * [History of Archery and the NAA, Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/olympics/longterm/archery/archhist.htm) *	1643349268.0	hujr3o9	t3_riupez	t3_riupez	/r/AskHistorians/comments/riupez/how_common_was_the_archery_bow_in_the_usa_of_1900/hujr3o9/
aez4r	For Wilhelm II, although he abdicated the throne and therefore surrendered his rights to any official income from the state, he (and other members of the Hohenzollern family) retained substantial holdings both within and outside of Germany. In addition to this property, Wilhelm had large cash reserves, to which he retained access.   The Weimar government also allowed the former royal family to keep many items that were housed in erstwhile Royal palaces. 60 train cars of their possessions were removed from the Potsdam complex and sent to the Netherlands, including silver, artwork, and expensive porcelains.   The wealth of the Hohenzollern family has been in the news relatively recently. [A New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/arts/design/german-royals-property-claim.html) from last March details how the current head of the house has been in negotiations with several state governments in an attempt to recover property that was expropriated by the East German government in the wake of WW2. The distinction here of East German is important, because the Hohenzollerns never lost ownership of many properties held in West Germany, and indeed still own some of them today.	1643349488.0	hujrhd5	t3_se16t1	t3_se16t1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se16t1/how_did_rulers_fleeing_their_countries_pay_for/hujrhd5/

craypd3p	To answer the first part of your question, no there were no "brands" as such of the period, although gunsmiths might have stamped their mark on a pair of particularly crafted items. In the period, the production of firearms was initially limited to a relatively few expert craftsmen and artisans before the wars. However, the wars themselves demanded such large numbers of firearms, in such large numbers, that anyone that could provide firearms of useable quality could find a buyer. In the case of the matchlock, this often required little expertise, but the flintlock mechanism needed rather more skill.    There second part of your question is a little more difficult to answer. We look back on the development of firearms and tend to group the mechanism types together. However, in the period there were many different forms of firing mechanism which relied on a flint, and the design itself was in flux (as indeed was the musket itself, ranging from the lighter caliver to the heavier musket), with "types" such as the English lock, the French lock, Doglocks, Snaplock, and Snaphances all being recognisably a FORM of flintlock, but not the more universally accepted form of flintlock which graced the Charleville or the Brown Bess. Indeed, soldiers of the period seem to have referred to these by the collective term of 'firelocks' or the better know Snaphance, than by their particular designs.       As for 'rare' it depends what you mean.    If by "classy but retro" probably a wheellock, but their complexity compared to the flintlock meant they were rapidly going out of use by the British Civil Wars although cavalry or officers might use them if they could not get flintlocks. I suspect you mean "an awesome example" probably a rifled doglock. Doglock as common in England at the time, and capable (due to the 'dog') of sitting at half-cock. However, for military purposes rifling pistols was rarely used so it would be a private order made with the nobility in mind. I am unaware of any examples of these, as rifling of firearms (or 'screwed' firearms back then) was known but focused on shooting for game, and therefore on wealthy men's fowling pieces. These did see limited use in the wars, but as they were so small in number the examples or few. At the siege of Lathom House the Royalist Garrison made use of 'the best and choicest marksmen who usually attended the Earl \[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby\] in his hunting and other sports as huntsmen, keepers, fowlers and the like who continually kept watch with screwed guns and long fowling pieces to the great annoyance and loss of the enemy \[Parliamentarian besiegers\], especially of their commanders who were frequently killed in their trenches or as they cam or went to for from them.'   According to Donald Reid there were some simple breech-loaders and even a repeating rifle, but these were made for nobility and royalty and all were musket-type rather than pistol.

craypd3p	The use and importance of cavalry in a battlefield army is reflected by the popularity of the pike right into the end of your period - by the latter half of the 17th century the pikeman was predominantly (and I stress predominantly - it was not a set rule) an anti-cavalry weapon to defend the firearm element. The pike did not completely disappear from armies in Western Europe until the widespread adoption of the socket-type bayonet, which allowed firearm-equipped units to stand off and defend against cavalry while continuing to fire. Through the course of the century, pikemen gradually lost their armour as they were no longer expected to be heavily engaged in pike vs pike combat. The ideal of your cavalry was the defeat the enemy cavalry on the wings of the army, then to loop around and threaten the enemy infantry, forcing them on the defensive and allowing your artillery and shot to defeat them more easily. However, in some instance (\*cough\* Royalists at Edgehill \*cough\*) this plan went awry when the victorious cavalry, after driving off the enemy cavalry, rode off to do their own thing (usually to loot enemy baggage trains)  Certainly, in the field a balance needed to be struck but its perhaps easier to think in terms of the non-battle rather than the battle. The use of cavalry and dragoons outside of the battlefield were essential (I cannot emphasise this enough) in the logistical supply and provision of a marching army (as foragers out of the line of march, patrols around the army, wagon escorts) and as scouts, escorts, as pickets, and as messengers. Without these a campaigning army of solely infantry would be incredibly hamstrung by an opponent with a more mobile element which would be able to disrupt the communications and supply of the army. If it cannot be supplied, the enemy army is defeated without need for a battle. This then, even more than the battlefield, was where cavalry came into its own and why it remained such an important element of armies even as infantry firearm technology developed.   However, contemporary generals were very much aware that a battle was a rather rare beast - sieges were the method of capturing enemy territory and winning wars. In fact many battles only took place when a relieving army came to relieve a siege. And in a siege, it was the infantry that was king - digging trenches, encircling, and finally at the assault. Perhaps the easiest answer to your question is that armies of the period were predominantly composed of infantry but the amount of cavalry remained  significant minority due to its uses. Again, this is more a reflection of cavalry's non-battle uses in an age of horse-powered supply lines, messengers, scouting etc. Lynn himself states that French cavalry numbers was usually between 1/4 to 1/3 of the field armies of the period, with the balance being composed almost entirely of infantry.^(1)        1.

4id83	Theriac was the main antidote to venoms of all sorts during the Middle Ages. It was used to treat snake-bite and rabies and taken as a cure for poison, though it was most commonly prescribed to strengthen a patient who had been bled, sweated and purged, and whose condition was, nevertheless, deteriorating. Theriacs – there were several of them in existence – were particularly complex and potent medicines, and so difficult to make that only the senior apothecaries of the largest cities were trusted to prepare them. They contained up to 70 different ingredients and were unusual in that their single most important constituent was animal: viper’s flesh. The best theriac came from Venice, and was known as ‘Venice treacle’. Venetian pharmacists bred their own vipers and mixed their theriac in bulk once each year. The concoction was exported by the Italian city-state throughout the rest of Europe, and no apothecary of the time would have been without it.	1643375937.0	huku9kn	t3_se1rv3	t1_huiwzjm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se1rv3/did_the_crusaders_say_anything_about_hamsters/huku9kn/

10rsx7	**Who was the first known person to posit that torture is an ineffective means of interrogation?**        It doesn't take much to see that torture is cruel and inhumane, as that's kind of part of the whole point. But it's been proven by today to also be highly ineffective, being more likely to yield an insane subject or the answers you want to hear rather than any truth. Now, there are people who still don't understand this today, and I know in the ancient and medieval eras torture was considered fairly standard and reliable, even necessary a procedure in cases. However, even if the science disproving its effectiveness is relatively recent in the grand scale, I'm sure there must have been earlier philosophers or thinkers who would have realised that torture can't really be that reliable. Who is the first person we have records of opining thus?	1643376398.0	hukv7j3	t3_sd6m46	t3_sd6m46	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd6m46/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_26_2022/hukv7j3/

mdu63	While much can always be said, I summarized some basic points as well as the links to the relevant posts before in: [How did life/culture differ in Danelaw compared to life in its neighbors of Wessex, Mercia and Northumbria?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mdk26v/how_did_lifeculture_differ_in_danelaw_compared_to/)    +++  The current academic consensus apparently amounts to "thousands (a few thousands)" of Scandinavian settlers, rather than ten thousands or more (Hadley 2006: 130).    On the other hand, I'm not so sure about the estimated population of (northern and eastern) England around 900 CE, as well as its growth rate during late Anglo-Saxon period. Our most reliable departure point, Domesday Book, record about 270,000 people (villeins, cottars and so on, as a head of the household) in countryside and 20,000 people in urban settings, and researchers surmise from these figures that about 1.3 million to 1.5 million of people lived in whole England in 1086 (Dyer 2002: 94).    If we assume the total population of later Danelaw as about 300,000 (this is clearly very underestimated figure) and the number of Scandinavian settlers as 9,000 (it is also highly likely to be overestimated), the very rough ratio of the settlers among the population would be 3%, and it is likely that the actual ratio would be further lower as a whole.   If their settlements had some regional concentrations, as sometimes suggested, however, it is likely that thousands of the settlers (mostly elites) left undeniable trace on some local communities as well as culture.

5te82scw	In France, under the ancient regime, how many generations did the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis apply too? Was “Children and Grand Children” the literal and defining rule, limiting it at 2 generation past the award, or would it have included great grand children if it had not been abolished in 1830?  And in completely unrelated news….  I know where the 14th Maine Infantry bivouacked before going off to war in Feb of 1862 (our old family farm) and again for their 25 year reunion or something like that, whatever reunion it was, they camped in the same field they had used in 1862.  Considering the known capacity for new privates to lose stuff, and the fact that the reunion was rained out and veterans had to be rescued from a suddenly flooding field and put up in locals homes, should I take up metal detectoring or whatever it’s called as a hobby and work that field for loot, er, I mean, museum pieces?	1643379455.0	hul1te3	t3_serfzv	t3_serfzv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/serfzv/friday_freeforall_january_28_2022/hul1te3/

8rkx9	I just posted an addendum to an article I published in the journal, Folklore, in 2020: [The Other Side of the Tamar: A Comparison of the Pixies of Devon and Cornwall](https://www.academia.edu/42235274/The_Other_Side_of_the_Tamar_A_Comparison_of_the_Pixies_of_Devon_and_Cornwall). That article compares pixy legends from the two British neighbors, concluding that there was little diffusion of legends across the border and that the far west of Cornwall was extremely isolated from Devon when it comes to folklore.  The [addendum](https://www.academia.edu/69382049/The_Other_Side_of_the_Tamar_Addendum_for_the_Comparison_of_Pixies_from_Devon_and_Cornwall_ML_7015_and_ATU_124) incorporates a new source I recently found, English Forests and Forest Trees, Historical, Legendary, and Descriptive. This is an extremely early publication (1853) that has apparently escaped notice when it comes to Devonian folklore, given that its title gives no obvious hint about this subject being covered. The text provides additional legends about pixies, augmenting the content of my original article. Here is the abstract:  > In March 2020, I published an article comparing the pixies of Devon and Cornwall, appearing in Folklore, the journal of the Folklore Society. Since that time, I found a relevant source, Ingram, Cooke, and Co., English Forests and Forest Trees, Historical, Legendary, and Descriptive (1853). It includes remarkably early references to Devonian pixies, enhancing the ability to understand the traditions of the two neighbors on either side of the Tamar River, which forms much of the boundary separating Cornwall and Devon. This source (featuring ML 7015 and ATU 124) allows for an augmentation of my original article, enhancing and supporting the conclusion that I reached, namely that the pixy traditions of Devon and the far west of Cornwall were not expressions of diffusion from one place to the other.	1643379958.0	hul2zw9	t3_serfzv	t3_serfzv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/serfzv/friday_freeforall_january_28_2022/hul2zw9/
9i89m	First, yes, the McKinley Tariff was definitely protectionist. Although from the midwestern state of Ohio, McKinley was firmly on the side of the Gold Standard and eastern banking interests, and saw protection of American industries as more important than avoiding price increases for consumers.  However, that was Congressman McKinley in 1890. The Spanish-American War came in 1898 ,years later, and to President McKinley. When it did, he played the part of a very reluctant imperialist:  >First, in the cause of humanity and to put an end to the barbarities, bloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries now existing there, and which the parties to the conflict are either unable or unwilling to stop or mitigate. It is no answer to say this is all in another country, belonging to another nation, and is therefore none of our business. It is specially our duty, for it is right at our door.  >Second, we owe it to our citizens in Cuba to afford them that protection and indemnity for life and property which no government there can or will afford, and to that end to terminate the conditions that deprive them of legal protection.  >Third, the right to intervene may be justified by the very serious injury to the commerce, trade, and business of our people, and by the wanton destruction of property and devastation of the island.  McKinley stated position was that the Cuban revolt against Spain had endangered US citizens and US property in Cuba: that Spain had not allowed a peaceful settlement, and that the US, while not acting to take possession of the island, did not think the Cubans capable of having their own government. He would use similar rather racist language when the US took control of the Phillipines: they should be free from tyranny, but they're not able to have their own government yet-so we'll help.  This paternal language was often deployed to cover imperialist actions, and was rather convenient to the economic interests of the US: Cuba was right next door, the Philippines provided a valuable coaling station for US ships. McKinley simply voiced the position that he was very reluctant, but America clearly had no choice. But it  was rather transparent.... While a tariff was to be a protection for home industries, those industries needed an outlet for their products- if not colonies, something like them: a prime motivation for imperialism. Neither Cuba or the Philippines had any competitive industries, but they did have customers. As Peter Finley Dunne's Mr. Dooley remarked, it was "hands across the water and into someone's pocket".

I keep hearing it argued that although we see Mesolithic cultures and people as relatively peaceful, they were actually anything but, yet without naming any sources or linking to evidence.	1643381599.0	hul6xmt	t3_serfzv	t3_serfzv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/serfzv/friday_freeforall_january_28_2022/hul6xmt/

12xk8n	Not OP, but thanks for the awesome response. Can you comment on why it was uncommon for rifling to be applied to firearms intended for the military, despite the concept and production technology already being in use? There must have been serious downsides, since rifling seems to increase accuracy so significantly.	1643383641.0	hulc4mc	t3_seb921	t1_huk9k74	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seb921/is_there_a_list_of_types_of_flintlock_pistol_used/hulc4mc/
168sly	FYI arachnid photos are linked.  Europeans would not only have encountered spiders, but also tarantulas - the name is actually an Italian one (supposedly they are named after the Southern Italian city of Taranto). It was originally applied to the [European Wolf Spider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycosa_tarantula#/media/File:Lycosa_tarantula.png) which lives in Southern Europe, but isn't a true tarantula.   Southern Europe also has true tarantula species as well, such as Ischnocolus andalusiacus, Ischnocolus holosericeus, Ischnocolus valentinus  in Spain, and Ischnocolus triangulifer in Italy. [Here](https://granadanatural.com/imagenes/fauna_fichas/ischnocolus-valentinus_-1.jpg) is Ischnocolus valentinus, which also lives in North Africa.   The description of them showing up in camp at night and delivering painful bites sounds a lot more like camel spiders to me though, image of a North American one is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifugae#/media/File:Sunspider.jpg). Camel spiders are from the order Solifugae and are not properly spiders, but more or less in between spiders and their scorpion Arachnid cousins. Camel spiders can give a painful bite, but are not venomous, yet even today are the subjects of all sorts of wild stories, especially when camping in the desert at night is involved.  Anyway everything I just described is based off of modern taxonomy and Medieval people wouldn't particularly care about these levels of distinction, to be honest.	1643383873.0	hulcqmj	t3_se1rv3	t1_hujdsca	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se1rv3/did_the_crusaders_say_anything_about_hamsters/hulcqmj/
7xgnjo	Battering rams are very effective and attested in artwork and writing from the ancient world. I talk a bit about ram's effectiveness and how it differs from the "videogame experience" [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rsuhz0/were_battering_rams_really_capable_of_knocking/).  I was going to say that animal heads probably wasn't a thing. They are depicted in "historical" manuscripts from early modern periods which sometimes takes a more fanciful approach. The "hardened endpoint" was absolutely used. Most of the stuff depicted when I poured through some books are of pointed such heads. The Ancient Greeks well understood the concept of making a pointed head and even had a variation of the ram known as a "borer" as it was effectively a large stone drill. Such devises were used into the medieaval period too. Another example is a bronze wedge shaped ramhead (complete with a small embossed ram's head on the side, which suggests the idea of connecting a ram, the animal, with a ram the thing has been around) found at Olympia from the late 5th century (BC I think they mean). It is suggested it was designed to cut through brick type materials, common in the region for building various structures including citywalls. So metal headed rams were absolutely common and they shaped them to improve penetration.  Animal heads though? Apparently both Josephus ("Rome's Jewish Wars") AD 66-73 and Marcellanus writing in the AD 360s mention ram's heads cast in animal shapes, if I paraphrase them: shaped as a ram's head as is customary, which gives the ram it's name. The why question doesn't seem explicitly answerable. The shape of the head matters some depending on what kinda of material the walls is built from. I suspect the Roman's use, and they were more liable to escalade the walls, is partly because it made for a great pun. That they had a sense of humour can be seen in e.g. sling pellets cast in lead with messages on them, like "this hurts". But there is also likely what I can best describe as mystical approach to it. You want to bestow the "spirit" of the animal to the ram so it err rams better. I won't say there isn't a good explanation I just can't find anyone at this moment mentioned.

craypd3p	Sure. There were several problems with producing rifling - not least due to increased cost in time and money in rifling the twist to the inner barrel.    The distinct lack of standardization particularly in ammunition, bore sizes, firing mechanisms, even weight and length of weaponry (the Ordnance Office was a very small underfunded institution at the time, acting more as a store and repair house than a proofing and testing system) was another.   These were not unique to the period, military rifled-muskets remained relatively few in number until the development of the Minie ball in the mid-19th century (which expanded under pressure of ignition to 'fit' into the rifling and therefore take the spin imparted by the rifling). Prior to this rifling required very snug fitting ammunition, a problem with muzzle-loaders as it needed to be forced down the barrel to seat against the powder charge.      Wadding, or wrapping the ball in a small piece of leather or cloth was often used in the 17th century amongst private rifle owners, but the system of battlefield loading and firing drill in the period often required men to begin the reloading process while marching back from the front rank having fired there. Musketeers would be in multiple ranks, sometimes even six ranks, firing when at the front, and then retiring to the rear to reload and continuing their reload process as the ranks continually rotated in order to maintain a rate of fire. Adding in more complexity to this process was seen as dangerous.      The major ones would be the cost and lack of standardisation, even a smoothbore musket  'fower foote in length, the bore according to the bullet of ten in the pound standing, and twelve rowleing' would be 8 shillings and 10 pence. To clarify, that is a barrel four foot long, with a bore between 10-bore and 12-bore (gauge), costing the equivalent of a weeks wages for a skilled worker. Note the acceptable variance of the barrel - as long as a shot made of 1/10 of a pound of lead would fit snugly, while 1/12 of a pound would roll out as too small it met requirements. With such a variation, there was no effective way of using rifling.	1643385228.0	hulgctl	t3_seb921	t1_hulc4mc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seb921/is_there_a_list_of_types_of_flintlock_pistol_used/hulgctl/

for0hho1	I am not sure this follows and would be interested in hearing more from the OP or other experts.   My understanding is that many white Americans on both sides of the war favored racial separation, in many cases claiming a religious justification for their beliefs. But this did not mean they supported slavery. Even some abolitionists supported separation. Indeed, some opponents of slavery said that one of slavery's many ills was that it put white and black people into close contact (rather than "separating the races") and if not for slavery America would be all-white. The vision of a multiracial America was not widely shared.   Regarding the Mormons, my understanding is that Joseph Smith had included an anti-slavery plank in his presidential platform. While Brigham Young advocated racial separation and had very negative views toward black people, he also opposed slavery as it was practiced in his time.	1643386636.0	hulk4df	t3_se5p2n	t1_huj6oen	/r/AskHistorians/comments/se5p2n/how_did_mormons_react_to_the_american_civil_war/hulk4df/

8w886	One thing I didn’t add back when I wrote that comment, was the context around the speech. This was a speech given to the Utah territorial legislature, which was discussing  whether or not to allow slavery in the territory, and under what rules, and whether to allow free blacks to vote. Young was specifically in favor of black slavery, but wanted a slave code with more protections and “rights” for the slaves, if rights can be the right word under such circumstances.   > It is a great blessing to the seed of Adam to have the seed of Cain for servants, but those they serve should use them with all the heart and feeling, as they would use their own children, and their compassion should reach over them, and round about them, and treat them as kindly, and with that humane feeling necessary to be shown to mortall beings of the human species.  Young, at the time, regarded himself as a reformer, improving the overall rights of blacks. His overall sentiments wouldn’t have been particularly unusual for the time.   I don’t know if it was online 5 years, ago but you can now read the [full text of the speech here](https://archive.org/details/CR100317B0001F0017). At least to me, it’s a fascinating piece of oratory.	1643386738.0	hulkeap	t3_ser2qk	t1_hulg25z	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/hulkeap/

2m8yl53s	Ethiopia (or Abyssinia) played an important role in early Islam. Around 615 some Muslims emigrated to the Kingdom of Aksum in Ethiopia due to persecution in Mecca, before Islam was accepted by the rest of the Arabs (the “First Hejira”). The king of Aksum is traditionally known is Islamic sources as “Najashi” although that might simply be a representation of his Ethiopian title, “negus”. Aksum was initially a powerful state with control over the Red Sea and southern Arabia, and competed with the Persians for influence over the Arabian peninsula. But once the Arabs adopted Islam, Aksum’s influence decreased and the kingdom disappeared entirely around the 10th century. Eventually it was replaced by the Zagwe kingdom.  Aksum and Zagwe were Christian, following the same Coptic Christianity as the Christians in Egypt. To the north of Ethiopia was Nubia, where there were two more Christian kingdoms, one in Makuria with its capital at Dongola, and the other in Alwa (or Alodia).  By the middle of the 7th century, Egypt and the Near East had been conquered by the Muslims. Since Nubia acted as a buffer between Ethiopia and Egypt, the kingdoms of Aksum and later Zagwe were pretty isolated from the Islamic expansion. Muslims also remembered king “Najashi” and his support in the earliest days of Islam, so the Muslims in Egypt and Arabia generally left Ethiopia alone. The Fatimids also thought the source of the Nile was in Ethiopia and the king might have some sort of magical ability to shut off the flow of the river, so it was best not to disturb them!  The Zagwe dynasty and the crusaders in Jerusalem were aware of each other, but the crusaders didn’t really know anything about Ethiopia/Abyssinia. They probably didn’t know Nubia and Abyssinia were different places or that there were two kingdoms in Nubia. The crusaders noted that they were sometimes fighting against “black Ethiopians” in the Fatimid army, but it’s more likely they were from Makuria, the part of Nubia closest to Egypt.  In 1217 there was a new crusade against Egypt, and the crusaders were very interested in the Christian lands to the south, which might be interested in an alliance. According to the chronicler Oliver of Paderborn:  “Ethiopia holds very broad lands, and has an innumerable Christian population partly under Christian kings and partly under the rule of the Saracens.” (Crusade and Christendom, pg. 209-210)  He was probably confusing Ethiopia with Nubia though. Ethiopia was also thought to be the homeland of the legendary “Prester John” who would hopefully arrive to help the crusaders fight against Islam. But Prester John could easily be assigned to some other area of the world - in the 13th century the crusaders also believed John could come from the east. They were right, a powerful army did come from the east, but it was the Mongols, who weren’t quite as friendly as the crusaders hoped.  The crusaders were defeated and expelled from the Near East in 1291, and direct contact between Europe and Ethiopia only occurred after that. For example, there was an Ethiopian delegation at the Council of Florence in 1441. Among other things, this council discussed reuniting the Greek and Roman churches and organizing a new crusade, but by this point no one was seriously expecting to recover Jerusalem.  So, although the crusaders and the Zagwe kingdom were vaguely aware of each other, there was no direct contact with them and Ethiopians wasn't really involved in the crusades. Ethiopia also had a pretty neutral relationship with the surrounding Islamic states, since Aksum was remembered as a place of refuge for the earliest Muslims.

4eic8	> (2) Also, how would you define microhistory? I'm thinking about Ginzburg's work and Natalie Zemon Davis, but they don't give me clear answers...  To try an easy summary, microhistory is a methodological approach that seeks to answer large historical questions through an investigation of a narrow and well-defined topic, object, person, event, etc., while simultaneously putting a focus on the agency of individuals. However, there are different approaches to microhistorical investigations that will vary from scholar to scholar, from nation to nation. Ginzburg, for example, wrote as part of *microstoria* which uses the concept of *eccezionalmente normale* (exceptional normal), something that clearly fits into the very unique case of Domenico Scandella in 16th century Italy and Ginzburg's investigation into his world and beliefs.	1643387480.0	hulmf61	t3_serfzv	t1_hulfdc5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/serfzv/friday_freeforall_january_28_2022/hulmf61/
yfege	There's some truth-ish as the accuracy of such teas is going to come down to timing - historically and biologically speaking - and the contents of the tea. First, to clarify, the purpose of an abortifacient is to cause an abortion; to end a pregnancy. In the hours immediately after sex, there is nothing to abort as fertilization and implantation most likely hasn't happened yet. This is why, in the modern era, the first day of someone's last menstrual period is used as the start date for a pregnancy - there's simply no way to know the exact moment the pregnancy began. This is also why its more wishful thinking than anything else for characters to know immediately after sex that conception has occurred (that's not how it works dot gif.) It can take up to five days for implantation to occur and then typically, several days after that for someone to generate enough pregnancy-related hormones to be able to detect it without a sensitive pregnancy test.  The "morning after" pill - a pharmacological intervention that needs to be taken within 5 days following sexual intercourse to prevent implantation - was created in the 1960s and it wasn't until the late 1990s that organizations like the FDA approved the particular combination of chemicals that were safest for interrupting the process. But again, "Plan B" pills are not abortifacients as they prevent a pregnancy, not end one. (Generally speaking, IUDs function in the same way - they interrupt the process even earlier and prevent fertilization.) To the first part of your question, it is highly, highly unlikely someone could brew a tea with the precise quantity of progestin needed to interrupt the fertilization and implantation process. However, that doesn't mean people who could get pregnant wouldn't try.   Human beings likely knew from fairly early on in our existence that sex can result in new humans. As such, those who very much did not want to be pregnant would try whatever they thought would interrupt the conception process. Given nature of the chattel slavery in America, enslaved women and girls had a number of strategies, with  varying degrees of risk. From Perrin's *Resisting Reproduction: Reconsidering Slave Contraception in the Old South*:  > Newbell Niles Puckett talked with [formerly enslaved women] who described medical and magical efforts to prevent conception or to induce abortion, including swallowing gunpowder mixed with sweet milk or just "nine bird-shot," drinking separate measures of "black haw roots" and bluestone with "red shank" roots followed by the juice of dog-fennel root, and a teaspoonful of turpentine each morning for nine consecutive days.   It wasn't until fairly recently - like the research leading up to the creation of the birth control pill - that we had an understanding of the finer details and exact specifics in terms of timing and mechanics around getting pregnant. This lack of understanding meant that a person who could get pregnant had to rely on a different set of cues regarding a possible pregnancy. For most of human history, regardless of the society, *amenorrhea* - one or more missed periods was the most likely reason a person would seek out our prepare an abortifacient. However, as we explained in the *Roe v. Wade* [megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qkdhi8/megathread_roe_v_wade_and_abortion_in_america/) last month, a missed period didn't necessarily mean a pregnant. The mental model that says, "my period is late, I might be pregnant" is a fairly modern one. The most common method of confirming a pregnancy was the *quickening* - the time at which the pregnant person begins to feel the movement of the fetus. Before that point, someone would be more likely to seek out *emmenagogues*, herbs that stimulates bleeding or contractions in the uterus, which would, in effect, restart her period.  So back to the teas. If someone suspected their were pregnant (or their period was "blocked") and they ingested a tea containing an emmenagogue with the goal of restarting their period (or ending a suspected pregnancy), they would expect results. In other words, it's highly unlikely someone would casually drink the tea as part of their morning meal. In effect, the purpose of the tea is to poison the taker just enough to generate a physical response but not enough to kill them. While there were a number of wild and cultivated herbs that could generate the desired side effects, one of the most common means of inducing an abortion was savin, created from drying and powdering the leaves of or extracting oil from a juniper plant. According to James C. Mohr, author of *Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy*, accidental overdoses of savin were common throughout American history. Historian Carla Spivack documented the use of savin in Early Modern England and identified cases where users were either too cautions and took enough to make themselves ill but not end the pregnancy or too zealous about the quantity and nearly killed themselves. Women, through formal midwife networks and informal family or community networks, shared their understanding of the relationship between the timing of the suspected pregnancy and the quantity of needed herbs.	1643387550.0	hulmlwx	t3_sejxco	t3_sejxco	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sejxco/are_contraceptive_teas_just_fiction/hulmlwx/
8r9ab8s4	I think the threads in this sub over the years and the negative reviews linked in this response prove that Zinn's book has many flaws. Wineburg clearly demonstrates certain parts, specifically on WWII, get things plainly wrong. I believe one of the comments in the FAQ argues the book is better thought of as Zinn's political manifesto than a dispassionate work of academic history. As /u/CommodoreCoCo mentions, Zinn himself is of course honest about his political ideology up front. I certainly understand why professional historians would caution serious students of history about this work.  But, that's not the target audience. It's is written for young people whose only exposure to history is through grade school textbooks. Once that is clear, it becomes less obvious to me why it's not worth reading.  Kazin, a Democratic Socialst, says in his review that Zinn has "virtuous intentions." Wineburg is less approving but offers that he agrees with the work "in some places," citing Zinn's sections on Indian Removal and Wilson's racism.  Both seem to find at least some value in a project that challenges, [as Zinn puts it](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Letters-t-1.html), the "simplistic history fed to young people over the generations." For those of us who agree that there is value in such a project, to me it seems a bit myopic to tear the book apart the way those two reviewers did.  This particular book has been the most successful of its kind at reaching a large audience. If enough people are dissuaded from reading it, they won't go pick up a more nuanced, peer-reviewed work, they simply won't get any counter-narrative and will miss out on both the good (the eye opening chapter on Indian Removal, IMO) and the bad. Upon closer reading of the reviews, it strikes me that the complaints are equal part valid critique and personal disagreement with Zinn's opinions, to the extent that I  wonder if they actually do agree with the project.  My question to Zinn's critics is, do you agree with the value of his intentions, and if so, is it really so bad that he introduces a certain skepticism of simplified narratives to young students? Or is there a practical, better way to accomplish that?	1643388209.0	huloemc	t3_sedxp9	t1_huixoa3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sedxp9/how_accurate_are_zinns_a_peoples_history_of_the/huloemc/

43nlok6v	Illustration was not typical of Roman papyri in antiquity at all, although that isn’t to say it never happened. Pliny describes some authors who illustrated treatises on plants (Plin. *HN*. 25.4), and some examples survive, but they are rare.  One very well preserved example is [P.Oxy. 22.2331](http://163.1.169.40/gsdl/collect/POxy/index/assoc/HASHa630.dir/POxy.v0022.n2331.a.01.hires.jpg), a third century illustrated account of the labors of Hercules. The papyrus intersperses writing and illustration, keeping the images in line with the columns and giving visuals for the story as it is narrated. While the outlines in ink stand out most clearly from the pictures in the current state of the papyrus, in antiquity you would still have been able to see colors used to fill in the illustrations, and traces remain of the hero’s yellow hair and the green ground. If you want to get a better idea of what a more full color illustration looks like, [P. Köln IV 179](https://papyri.uni-koeln.de/stueck/tm63497#T_d1e76550) (late second century) is a good one to look at.  The Hercules papyrus is also remarkable in another way, though. Its simple vocabulary and style, large text size, and word gaps (Greek and Roman *scriptio continua* did not normally leave gaps between words) all indicate that P.Oxy. 22.2331 was an educational text, aimed at less experienced readers. This is an incredible rarity, however. While we do find texts aimed at children, generally identifiable because they present simplified or less sophisticated versions of other texts, like a poem about a war between a weasel and a mouse, to find a text aimed at entertaining new readers that also contains illustrations is highly unusual.  This isn’t to say that text and illustration didn’t appear together anywhere in the ancient world, and we have examples and attestations of their existence in bookrolls as well as in epigraphic contexts. But it wasn’t typical of a papyrus roll to contain illustrations, and there was no tradition or cultural expectation that these be included.	1643391083.0	hulw7ba	t3_ser71i	t3_ser71i	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser71i/what_do_we_know_about_roman/hulw7ba/

myubw	Absolutely!  Taking Romans as an example, and conquest, since you've mentioned it, the display of triumphal goods was a key aspect of conquest. To bring it back a little bit, a triumph is a ceremony that (successful) Roman generals would be awarded on their return from a campaign. This is similar to an open top bus victory tour after a major sporting achievement (like [this one](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/DHRC3E/atmosphere-chelsea-fc-european-champions-league-victory-parade-the-DHRC3E.jpg) for a ~~second rate~~ football team), but with a few more goodies on display: Ida Östenberg wrote the canonical work on spoils in 2009, if you're able to have a look at it.  We have a few visual depictions of triumphal processions in Rome, and the best example of the spoils on display is probably from the [Arch of Titus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Rom%2C_Titusbogen%2C_Triumphzug_3.jpg/1920px-Rom%2C_Titusbogen%2C_Triumphzug_3.jpg), depicting the Jewish Triumph of 71 CE, and completed in c. 81 CE. As you can see, there are some spoils depicted here, most prominently the menorah, and these were probably housed in the Templum Pacis, or Temple of Peace, which was built from the profits of the conquest (which included the profits from balsam, according to Pliny, *Natural History* 12.112).  This isn't the best example, however, since it is only a 'probably'. So let's slip back in time and drill down into one of the biggest and best known examples: Pompey's complex on the Campus Martius, completed 55 BCE after his triumph over Pontus (modern day Turkey).  This complex consisted of a theatre, portico, temple, senate house, and was essentially a microcosm, publicly accessible, and an ideal venue for Pompey's museum of conquest. Propertius (*Elegies* 2.32) tells us decades after the complex's construction, that it was home to Attalid drapes, plane trees (Pompey displayed the ebony, but that wouldn't grow in Rome), statues of the conquered nations ([Kuttner](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/284436.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ad44f0bb77ac9283de5a9cc17a5661a69&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&origin=), 1999), and other elements that Kuttner goes into more detail on. The primary motivation for displaying these elements was to demonstrate power, and to associate the conquest with Pompey himself - not only did the complex bear his name, a statue of him observed proceedings in the senate house. By doing this, Pompey was able to give a permanent home to the temporary ceremony of the triumphal procession, and to demonstrate that he had been there, conquered the nation, and bought the t-shirt, and do so for decades after his death - his museum was his legacy.  **Bibliography**:   Kuttner, A.L. (1999) ‘Culture and History at Pompey’s Museum’, *Transactions of the American Philological Association* 129: 343-73.   Östenberg, I.

33wgo	>  For most of human history, regardless of the society, amenorrhea - one or more missed periods was the most likely reason a person would seek out or prepare an abortifacient. However, as we explained in the Roe v. Wade megathread last month, a missed period didn't necessarily mean a pregnant. The mental model that says, "my period is late, I might be pregnant" is a fairly modern one.  This sounds to be a fairly American or at least western centered view. I know that at least in Ayurveda, the medicine system of the Indian subcontinent, morning sickness was strongly associated with pregnancy. I also remember, (but could not find the reference) that at least Susruta mentions missed period.	1643392052.0	hulyubm	t3_sejxco	t1_hulmlwx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sejxco/are_contraceptive_teas_just_fiction/hulyubm/

168sly	Just to speak for myself, but I think the problem with Zinn is that while he's writing to counter a selective simplified grand historic narrative taught in schools, he's basically doing it by writing a selective, simplified grand historic narrative. Unfortunately with history you can't take one polarized version of history, combine it with its polar opposite, and arrive at a null point of objective truth.   This unfortunately in my mind means that it becomes its own version of propaganda for its own political ends, and Zinn does often torture the evidence to meet his agenda. The most egregious would be his take on the US Civil War, but even his take on mid-20th century America gets to that level. As the older threads note, Zinn seems to have trouble with the idea that historic actors and groups might actually mean what they say - often in Zinn's retelling everything comes across as the machinations of an "Establishment" as means to divide and control "The People" (the definition of which constantly shifts to meet Zinn's needs).   I won't pretend that I didn't learn things from Zinn, so I don't mean to imply that there isn't value in his work, especially (to use your Kazin quote) - "in some places". It's certainly the first I ever heard of New York patroons and the Anti-Rent War, or of the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island. And I should add that even quite a few [big name academic historians in US history](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-feb-01-la-oe-miller1-2010feb01-story.html) had good things to say about him, even if they disagreed with his takes.  But still I think at the end of the day, *it's just not good history* - it's a morality play. As I like to say, if you really want to read a single volume, nuanced take on US history from a Marxian historical perspective, you'd just be better off reading one of the US histories that Eric Foner wrote, even if you eschew his more massive books like *Reconstruction*.	1643392576.0	hum0a56	t3_sedxp9	t1_huloemc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sedxp9/how_accurate_are_zinns_a_peoples_history_of_the/hum0a56/

vfjp3	Thanks for the additional details. Let me try to better clarify my question:  So today is Friday, which is the 6th day of the week. That means that 7 days ago was also Friday. So was 14 days ago and 21 days ago. So we could similarly say that exactly 7,000,000 days (\~19,000 years) ago was *also* a Friday, even though if we asked our prehistoric ancestors, they would have no idea what we were talking about.  I know solar calendars have changed over time. For example, upon the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, Thursday, 4 October 1582, was followed by Gregorian Friday, 15 October 1582. But Thursday was still followed by Friday, so the 7 days before Friday, 15 October 1582 was also still a Friday.  So how many intervals of 7 days could we go back in time to find someone(s) that decided that that today is Day 6, and directly matches up such that our Day 6 falls on the same 7-day interval as theirs?	1643393517.0	hum2teh	t3_sctk61	t1_hug5w0i	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sctk61/when_did_the_days_of_the_week_become_fixed/hum2teh/

ess5f	Note too that you didnt need to lose home to be in a world of trouble. Navigation and clear communication was critical in naval aviation, the carrier no matter what was not going to be in the same place as you left it.  For a good example of how badly this can go we can also look at Hornet's famous "Flight to Nowhere" during the battle of Midway. Where disagreements and spotty intel lead to about 1/3 of the US's aircraft at the battle never even engaging the enemy then getting lost on the way home. Some made it back, some flew to Midway, some ditched and several were never found.

ess5f	As part of the combined October IJN/IJA offensive Mikawa's 8th Fleet had a supporting mission. While Nagumo and Combined Fleet would take out the main US naval forces and the IJA forces on the island would overrun Henderson Field and the US positions around Lunga Point.   Mikawa then would escort a fast convoy to land additional troops around Koli Point to the East of Lunga, the idea being to cut off the assumed retreat of US ground forces. With the collapse of the other parts of the offensive, the landing was called off. Though a smaller landing in the area was completed in early November.

169ceaep	Good question. I'm not exactly qualified to talk about Germany, but I can explain at least some of the difficulties faced by the Soviets in imposing Communism on Poland.    First thing to remember is that the Second Polish Republic was a direct ally of Britain and France. The war in Europe started over the issue of Polish independence. Thus, the Soviets were in a delicate position, where their designs on Polish territory which they realized between 17 September and 6 October 1939 threatened to put them, like the Germans, into conflict with the Western Allies.  In the event, the Soviets were extremely fortunate in that Rzydz-Śmigły's government did not formally declare war on the Soviet Union, that the British were unwilling to jeopardize their trade interests with the Soviets, and that both Britain and France explained to the Poles that their defensive alliances were, in practice if not in exact wording, directed exclusively against the Germans. Thus, the Soviets were able to take the Kresy regions of Poland (modern day Western Ukraine and Belarus) without triggering a war with the Western Allies.   The Second Reoublic ceased to exist except as an exile government and underground state after the joint German-Soviet invasions. But Great Britain continued in the conflict with Germany, even after the fall of France. In this conflict, the Polish Government in Exile continued to be a nominal and practical ally of the British, contributing tens of thousands of soldiers, sailors, and airmen to the Allied cause, and developing a large and effective underground state, which provided valuable intelligence and increasingly harried the German occupation forces in Poland. During the 1939-1941 period, the Soviets refused to recognize the Polish Government in Exile, and contented themselves with imposing Soviet rule on the Kresy region.  The Polish underground state sought to oppose the Soviet occupation the same as the German occupation, with the goal of re-establishing an independent Polish state within their pre-1939 borders.   The Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations with the Polish Government in Exile in 1941 after the German invasion of the USSR.  The Sikorski-Mayski agreement re-establishing relations with the USSR specifically nullified the territorial agreements between the Soviets and Germans, thus opening the possibility that after the war the Kresy region, or parts thereof, might return to Polish rule. This open question of borders thus became the driving point of contention between the two states. The Poles continually sought for Churchill and later Roosevelt to press Stalin for a recognition of Poland's pre-war borders, but were unable to extract more than vague promises, sympathies, and assurances that any territorial change in the east would be compensated with German territory in the west. During the 1941-1943 period, the Poles were allowed to form the "Anders Army," from Polish exiles in the USSR, although these units would be forced by a lack of Soviet material support to make the trek through Iran to the Middle East, and eventually to Italy where they would serve with distinction alongside the British and Americans.   Relations between the USSR and the Polish Government in Exile were broken in 1943 after the Soviets refused to allow an independent Polish investigation of the Katyn Massacre (perpetrated by the Soviets on captured Polish officers in 1940.)  This break in relations, combined with the advance of the Red Army towards Poland, provided Stalin with the opportunity and motive to press the British for a private agreement that the USSR would keep the Kresy region and that Poland's borders would shift to the west (the so-called Curzon line).  They received this private agreement with Churchill at the 1943 Tehran conference, but this decision was not communicated to the Polish Government in Exile, which continued to press for their pre-war borders.   The Polish failure to gain Western support for their per-war borders was one of the contributing factors in the planning of Operation Tempest - a general uprising against the Germans immediately ahead of the Soviet advance, which would enable the Poles to welcome the Soviets as equals and establish some measure of Polish control over vital cities like Wilno and Lwow which were claimed by the Soviet Union. Operation Tempest, launched in the summer of 1944 as the Soviets began to enter Polish territory, was ultimately a failure, resulting in the capture and disarming of many Polish Home Army formations by the NKVD, and in the 63-day tragedy of the Warsaw Uprising.  At the same time, the Soviets formally broke with the Polish Government in Exile by installing the Lublin Comittee (officially the Polish Comittee of National Liberation) and promoting them as an alternative government to the London Government in Exile.   At the Yalta conference in 1945, Poland's fate was really decided.  Molotov revealed the private agreement with Churchill over the Curzon line borders, devastating the Poles, and essentially consigning Eastern Poland to the USSR. At the same time, the Western Allies were pressured into recognizing the Lublin Comittee as the basis for the postwar government of Poland. However, the West was able to secure agreements that the new government hold elections and establish a coalition Government which included the prewar major political parties. The Prime Minister of the Government in Exile, Stanisław Mikołajczyk, as well as a few other members of the London-based government agreed to participate in this coalition, albeit without much hope of exerting real democratic influence over the postwar state. Mikołajczyk would serve as deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture until his party's loss in the rigged 1947 elections. The Polish Communists, at Stalin's behest, also attempted to lend legitimacy to the political and territorial changes by holding the Polish People's Referendum of 1946, which confirmed the Oder-Niesse line as Poland's Western border, the nationalization of industry, and the abolition of the Senat. During the immediate postwar period, hundreds of thousands of Poles were involved in a massive population exchange, being expelled from the formerly-Polish regions of the east to the "reclaimed" territories of the west.   Thus we see that Stalin was caught in a difficult game, needing the support of the Western Allies who were, at least nominally tied to the issues if Polish independence and the sanctity of Polish borders. We can see that his principal concerns were for a border adjustment, which he achieved by a fait-acompli, first with the cooperation of the Germans, and later reaffirmed by skilful use of diplomacy, deception, and realpolitik. Once he had achieved his aim of territorial adjustment, it was much easier diplomatically to offer at least minor concessions in the way of promising "democratic" governments, rather than risk all the goodwill of the British and Americans by pursuing further territorial agrandizement. Stalin followed this line in many of the other countries which would ultimately become Communist-dominated puppets, first granting democratic concessions and then rigging elections and using the Red Army's influence to install governments friendly to the USSR - see Romania and Czechoslovakia in particular, since both also had outstanding territorial disagreements with the USSR. Stalin was in a strong position, but could not deny the legitimate interests of the British and Americans, and so chose to appease them with semi-democratic coalitions governments, knowing that he would later be able to turn those into loyal Communist regimes.	1643395695.0	hum8nt4	t3_sev0i4	t3_sev0i4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sev0i4/why_did_the_soviet_union_run_poland_and_east/hum8nt4/

q2f9hqd	The answer to this is rather trivial, insofar as some assumptions there are rather misdirected, as torture was not *per se* considered a *reliable* source, in early modern treaties from medieval tradition described as *res fragilis*, and needed *sober* confirmation (although naturally the fear of further torture skews these as well), and, although these criteria differ widely from place to place, prior indices of presumption of guilt, etc., to be eligible for torture. But this period from roughly thirteenth to eighteenth/nineteenth century covers too much for meaningful generalities due to various and notable differences. Tracing this back to original sources would be highly problematic ( and practically impossible ) for, as treaties are not preserved (and are known through references only), authors and works unknown - quotations, excerpts and summaries unattributed - but the unrealiability and dangers of ( specially unrestrained ) torture ( or hints towards it ) were already picked implicitly up from Roman sources (see, for example, Ulpian's *fragilis et periculosa res, et fallens veritatem* ).  F. Casoni in the famous *De indiciis et tormentis (1557), ...*  M. Montaigne *On Consience (1580);*  >Torture is a dangerous innovation; it would appear that it is an  assay not of the truth but of a man’s endurance. The man who can  endure it hides the truth: so does he who cannot. For why should  pain make me confess what is true rather than force me to say what is not  true? And on the contrary if a man who has not done what he is  accused of is able to support such torment, why should a man who has  done it be unable to support it, when so beautiful a reward as life itself  is offered him?  For example, S. Guazzini wrote in *Tractatus ad defensam inquisitorum, carceratorum, reorum, et condemnatorum (1664);*  >But let judges be on their guard against resorting to torture  with facility, as it is an expedient which may prove fragile or perilous, and may play  false to truth, because some persons have such an incapacity for the endurance of pain  that they are more willing to lie than to suffer torments.  A century later, Beccaria in rather famous work,  *An Essay on Crimes and Punishments, Chapter XVI Of Torture (1764 );*  >Every act of the will is invariably in proportion to the force of the impression on our    senses. The impression of pain, then, may increase to such a degree, that, occupying    the mind entirely, it will compel the sufferer to use the shortest method of freeing    himself from torment. His answer, therefore, will be an effect as necessary as that of    fire or boiling water; and he will accuse himself of crimes of which he is innocent. So    that the very means employed to distinguish the innocent from the guilty, will most    effectually destroy all difference between them.  So, it is not that during medival and early modern it was thought of as reliable, the dangers of it were known and discussed, extensively, and were addressed methodologically to minimize it, but other developments, concerns, factors ( nature of proof, inquisatorial procedure, ... )etc. (this is hardly the place for comparative analyses, if it can even be done, since these kinds of inquiries are problematic) ensured its practice.  Also, that torture was fairly standard needs some further temporal and geographical qualifications, so does the quality of the crime for which it was supposedly applied. One could very well said that it was not standard with just the same conviction - see, for example, statutes of Italian city states during thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.  \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Not sure about any particular work for on this, but perhaps this one should be a fine enough a general overview in English (although the specific matter at hand is not addressed explicitly and at length );  Edward Peters.

2m8yl53s	The Latin Catholic church sort of abstractly knew that Georgia existed, but really only that it was a far-away country, east of the Byzantine Empire and somewhere around Armenia. In Latin it was sometimes called “Iberia” because that’s what the ancient Romans called it - but that could be confusing because Iberia is also the name of the peninsula where Spain and Portugal are.  Georgia probably wasn’t ever on the minds of Latin Europeans until the crusades. The Latin crusaders in Antioch and Jerusalem encountered Georgian monks and nuns, who helped them make contact with the Kingdom of Georgia further to the northeast. Between crusader Antioch and Georgia was the sultanate of Great Seljuk, the Turkic state ruling over the lands of the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad. There were also independent Seljuk emirates in Mesopotamia and Anatolia, and when the crusaders arrived in the area in the late 11th century, the Seljuks were all fractured and fighting with each other. The presence of the crusaders and the infighting among the Seljuks was beneficial for the Georgians as well. In 1121, King David IV defeated the Seljuks at the Battle of Didgori in 1121 - apparently with help from 200 crusader knights.  The Seljuks kept the Georgians occupied throughout the 12th century so there wasn’t really any direct contact with the Latin crusaders. But the Georgians benefitted from the crusades again in 1204, when the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople. Georgia supported the creation of a Byzantine breakaway state in Trebizond, which was more or less a tributary state of Georgia. Now Georgia’s influence extended from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea and pretty far west along the Anatolian coast. This meant that it was now even easier for the rest of Europe to contact Georgia, through the crusader Latin Empire in Constantinople. The western church was in contact with the Georgians when preparing for the Fifth Crusade against Egypt, but then the Mongols arrived in the Caucasus in 1220 and subjugated the Georgians (as well as Trebizond).  So there was some contact with the Kingdom of Georgia but the crusaders (and thus the Latin church in general) were much more familiar with the Georgians who lived in the crusader states in the Near East, who were either monks and nuns who lived there in monasteries, or visiting merchants and pilgrims. The crusaders were very interested in cataloguing all the various types of Christians they lived with and the Georgians were recognized as being among the Eastern Orthodox, who “copy the Greek rite in almost all ways.” Whether the Latin crusaders knew it or not, the Georgian Orthodox church was actually “autocephalous”, meaning it had its own patriarch, worshipped in its own language, and didn’t depend directly on the Greek patriarch on Constantinople.  As for the Armenians, the relationship between them and the Latin Church was much, much closer. The Armenians usually lived within the borders of the Roman/Byzantine Empire, although in the 11th century they were mostly under Seljuk rule, after the Seljuks took control of most of Byzantine Anatolia. The Byzantines asked western Europe for help against the Seljuks, which resulted in the First Crusade, and direct contact with the Armenians.  The Armenians were also Orthodox like the Georgians but they were autocephalous too, with their own patriarch and worshipping in their own language. The Greek Orthodox tended to consider them a heretical sect though, so they were persecuted by the Greeks when they lived within the empire. The arrival of the Seljuks in the 11th century, and the infighting amongst the Seljuks that was so helpful for the Georgians and crusaders, was also beneficial for the Armenians, who ruled independently in several cities in eastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia. The first crusader state to be established, the county of Edessa in 1097, was founded in a mostly Greek and Armenian city. The crusader counts Baldwin I and Baldwin II also became kings of Jerusalem, and brought their Armenian families with them. Baldwin II’s wife was the Armenian Morphia of Melitene, and their daughter became queen Melisende of Jerusalem.  There was already a big Armenian community in Jerusalem when the crusaders arrived. The Armenians had probably been there since the 4th century when they converted to Christianity, and there had been an Armenian patriarch in the city since the 7th century. They had their own quarter in the city, built around the monastery/cathedral of St. James in the southwest part of Jerusalem, near Mount Zion. The Muslim rulers seem to have left them alone, but they were very enthusiastic about crusader rule - supposedly the patriarch even joined in the massacre of the Muslim inhabitants in 1099. The Armenian cathedral of St. James that exists in Jerusalem today was built during the crusader period in the 12th century.  By the late 12th century the Armenians in Anatolia were able to establish their own kingdom, which we usually call “Armenian Cilicia” or “Lesser Armenia” (as opposed to the Armenian heartland in the Caucasus, which was ruled by the Seljuks and the Georgians). The Cilician Armenians even agreed to unite with the Latin church in 1198. The union didn’t last, but they were Latin Catholics for the rest of the crusader period in the 13th century. They were so closely allied with the crusaders in Antioch that Armenia and Antioch were effectively one state, until they were both subjugated by the Mongols, like the Georgians were. Antioch and Armenia were eventually both conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks.  So Latin Europeans were rather distantly allied with the Georgians, but they were very familiar with the Armenians, some of whom even united with the Latin church for awhile.

8r9ab8s4	Thanks, that makes sense. I believe your take is much more measured than Kazan or Wineburg’s.  I think almost anyone agrees a deep and nuanced understanding of history is best. But to use your dual “grand narratives” concept, I feel like Zinns detractors are presenting a bit of a false choice while functionally arguing for the traditional narrative alone, over two flawed narratives that at least challenge each other.  Last note- I actually just looked up the Massachusetts high school history curriculum (where I spent part of my childhood) and see that they actually recommend reading Tecumseh’s 1810 call for pan-Indian resistance. I can assure you that was not part of my reading as a child. It also happens to be one of the sources Zinn quotes. Maybe the primary point today would be that things have changed and his project is no longer as necessary? I have no idea how much his book influenced changes in curriculum but it can’t be zero given the stir it caused in the 90s and 2000s.	1643399065.0	humhnuv	t3_sedxp9	t1_hum0a56	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sedxp9/how_accurate_are_zinns_a_peoples_history_of_the/humhnuv/

8w886	You are correct. The traditional Mormon doctrine developed over time. But they always believed that black people had souls.   Mormon belief about souls was/is complex. I’ll try and sum up the pre-1978 doctrine.   It includes a pre-mortal period between when souls were created and when they were embodied here on Earth. During the pre-mortal period, before Earth was created, there was a great council where God talked to all the souls and debate was held over how beings were to be embodied and how their existence on Earth was to handled. The two plans were presented by Jehovah (Jesus) and Lucifer (Satan). The debate devolved into “war” and Satan and all those that took his side were cast from heaven, never to get a chance at a mortal life.   There were however a group of people in this pre-mortal existence who didn’t take part in the war. These fence sitters weren’t “valiant” and so don’t get the full blessings. They get to go to Earth, and eventually earn their way to lesser heavens. The best heavens were forever barred to them due to their lukewarm support, at best, for Jesus in their pre-mortal lives. All these souls are thus born black. Being born a descendant of Cain being part of their punishment for their sins in the pre-existence. Here’s a sample from a talk given by Erasmus Snow in 1880:  > that race is the one through which it is ordained those spirits that were not valiant in the great rebellion in heaven should come; who through their indifference or lack of integrity to righteousness, rendered themselves unworthy of the Priesthood and its powers, and hence it is withheld from them to this day.   The doctrine supporting treating blacks differently was explicitly predicated on the idea that they definitely had souls, just souls stained with their sins from their pre-life.   The LDS church doesn’t teach this anymore, but it’s still fairly commonly believed; especially among the older members.	1643397657.0	humdwoq	t3_ser2qk	t1_hum8ns9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ser2qk/the_mormon_church_infamously_maintained_that/humdwoq/

The Inquisitors shall carefully examine whether the sentence of torment is justified or not, and preceded by legitimate evidence. In case they have issues with this, or doubts, as the damage could be irreparable, for in cases of heresy interlocutory sentences can be appealed, shall then the appeal be granted. \[...\] When in doubt, appeal shall always be granted. Also, the sentence of torment shall not be executed until the cause is concluded, and having received the accused's defendants.*        *53.

myubw	It was still used. No name change, no nothing. It was Rome’s first permanent theatre, and had a functional seat of government. This was particularly useful to Caesar (initially) when he converted the Curia Cornelia (the regular senate house) to a temple in 44BCE and began construction of the Curia Julia (on the site of the Senate House now). Unfortunately for the big man, he ended up being assassinated in Pompey’s Curia in the intervening period.	1643401610.0	humod5w	t3_seokwg	t1_humd206	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seokwg/did_ancient_culturescivilizations_have_museums_if/humod5w/

96gqp	Hi there! You’ve asked a question along the lines of ‘why didn’t I learn about X’. We’re happy to let this question stand, but there are a variety of reasons why you may find it hard to get a good answer to this question on /r/AskHistorians.    Firstly, school curricula and how they are taught vary strongly between different countries and even different states. Additionally, how they are taught is often influenced by teachers having to compromise on how much time they can spend on any given topic. More information on your location and level of education might be helpful to answer this question.    Secondly, we have noticed that these questions are often phrased to be about people's individual experiences but what they are really about is why a certain event is more prominent in popular narratives of history than others.    Instead of asking "Why haven't I learned about event ...", consider asking "What importance do scholars assign to event ... in the context of such and such history?" The latter question is often closer to what people actually want to know and is more likely to get a good answer from an expert. If you intend to ask the 'What importance do scholars assign to event X' question instead, let us know and we'll remove this question.    Thank you!	1643401787.0	humotni	t3_sezvfh	t3_sezvfh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sezvfh/why_is_the_bhopal_gas_tragedy_not_as_well_known/humotni/

96gqp	Apologies, but we have had to remove your submission. We ask that questions in this subreddit be limited to those asking about history, or for historical answers. This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to r/SCOTUS.    If you are interested in an historical answer, however, you are welcome to rework your question to fit the theme of this subreddit and resubmit it.	1643403256.0	humsn7m	t3_seyxva	t3_seyxva	/r/AskHistorians/comments/seyxva/for_us_legal_cases_how_is_using_religious/humsn7m/
