https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm  That’s a link to a study finding 90% effectiveness of preventing infection. That’s some pretty good evidence (since 90% is way higher than other very effective vaccines in the past)  https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectiveness  There’s a link to a cdc page that collects studies that show vaccines are highly effective at preventing infections and hospitalization	<p>That being said (one more time), the Biden admin along with the COVID fascism has basically won the republicans all the popularity they need for the upcoming elections, without having to compromise. I do know some independents and moderate people who were full on board voting R because of COVID and the economy, and then Texas made that abortion law and now they are questioning again. So maybe just shy away from that extremeness.</p>	0.771

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	<p>I could take up their argument and probably make some compelling arguments for their case, but it would take a long form discussion and preparation.  </p>	0.773
Hee Haw	<p>The Olympic Committees&#39; decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition.

Everyone Omar is ISIS with lips! She’s a joke and in the end she has no power. Everyone is waking up to realizing Islam is a joke! I’ve read the whole Koran and it’s a laughable hilarity of contradiction lol and if we are arguing who holds the ownership of where the Dome sits? It’s not even close. The Jews have had that land for thousands of years before Islam was even an idea…the whole religion is a joke…why is Jesus’s name mentioned more than Mohammed in the Koran? Exactly 25 times when Mohammed’s name is only mentioned 4 times…why is the only woman named in the Koran Mary the mother of Jesus….reading it makes it clear that plagiarism and hypocrisy were the motivations of the writers of the Koran…Mohamed couldn’t even read or write for crying out loud…give it time, Omar will be a cold fart in the wind	L	0.926

this subreddit makes me facepalm	My daughter is young and a single mom.

She is currently living in a house owned by another family member who is not charging her rent. She is currently driving 120 miles a day to get her child in a better school situation.

Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms.

The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It’s not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had. We stopped driving over the pandemic and so companies stopped production because less demand. Now that restrictions have been lessening, people are driving like they used to, and so prices are going up. But companies are still running on their reduced production, which is driving prices up.   This is so simple, and the article (a professional in the industry, with more knowledge than you or me) has said that it’s not a political problem.

This isn’t an interesting post at all, first off. Also, you can’t have it both ways.

There are a fuck ton of stories of vaccine being stored in shitty places (these have to be -80 I believe and if they go above they quickly start to spoil). Plenty of stories of freezers failing and trying to scramble to get them out before they go bad.

You’re right, I’m sorry for attacking you.   From your link:  “Among 357,133 death certificates with at least one other condition, 97% had a co-occurring diagnosis of a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), or a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both.”  So, there’s at least a lot of deaths that are likely to be from Covid and it’s symptoms. Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	<p>Yeah yeah, you’re gonna say otherwise, I get it.

No that's just common sense. If you're vaccinated for one virus and not another you're no longer vaccinated. It's how the flu shot works. It's how anything works with an evolving virus.

Lol and it looks exactly like you’d expect	<p>Once again, &quot;just Google&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t even know what to say lol&quot; are not answers or arguments or explanations. You are just claiming the US healthcare is terrible with no evidence whatsoever. The US absolutely isn&#39;t LAST lmfao. If they&#39;re last in maybe some specific thing I can believe that, but at least have an idea of what you&#39;re even claiming. Are you talking about OECD countries? Then in some areas we are last yes. But we are also the lowest cancer mortality rate in that list, and one of the best at preventative procedures, visits, and vaccination. We have a big obesity problem in this country which causes us to be lower on many things such as life expectancy too. So our healthcare is not terrible by any stretch, although it&#39;s not as efficient and isn&#39;t as easily accessible. Ignoring all that though, our healthcare system still has undeniably created most of the medical advancements in the past many decades which even allow countries to improve their healthcare to this point. That&#39;s just a fact. Where do you think all the new medicines and treatments come from? The US pulls more than its weight in drug/treatment research costs, and if other countries would share that burden then we&#39;d all be better off in the long term</p>	0.775

But when you have thousands if not tens of thousands of people crossing across from the border during a pandemic, I am very scrupulous on the situation just adding people when there is an issue at had (not so much at the moment in regards to COVID -- COVID cases are very high but as evolution kind of does its thing to viruses, their evolutionary trajectory tends towards higher transmissibility but dampened infectious effects on the hosts it infects -- I'm the only one in my house who didn't get it and I'm out a lot working 2 jobs, I got vaccinated and have a robust daily vitamin regiment while I have a health complication making me at risk) but this has been going on when COVID was doing a damaging number on people (infected and killed two family members of mine, one old (grandpa) one young (29 y/o cousin).	0.87
> Four people were burned to death.  irrelevant unless this man intended that they should die by burning to death. such detail is intended to excite a thrust for retaliatory blood and anyone that acts on that information in that way would be more guilty of violence than the man in the truck.   in the heat of the moment, many people would try to run from the scene without even being aware of their actions including people you love and respect. if you don't understand that, i suggest you study psychology research circa urgent autonomic responses (fight, flight, or freeze). i would be more concerned if he showed no emotion, that would be a kind of indicator that he meant to do what he did and is likely to do so again. running is a sign that he knew he made a grave mistake and he feared the consequences. he's no saint but it doesn't seem to me that anyone is better off if he spends the rest of his life in prison.

That&#39;s the entire point. You getting infected because you&#39;re not vaccinated creates a chance that you cause the disease to mutate into something that is resistant to the vaccine. That&#39;s what we want to stop. Best way to do that is to stop giving Covid chances to mutate. And best way to remove those chances is vaccinating everyone we can as quickly as possible.</p>	0.855

We get it, you hate brown people.	Now they lie to the audience. Suppress information. They lied to and tricked the least knowledgeable voting group in the country with emotional warfare. They don't use facts. They can't even define the systematic racism they proclaim. They can't define ""white rage"" they just throw it out there like an emotional grenade and inexperienced people take it as the truth. The young people trust them.

Careful you will be excommunicated.	People who are at the most risk of covid - those older than a certain age, those with preexisting health issues should get vaccinated. Those who feel getting vaccinated will be beneficial to their health and want it should 100% get the vaccine.

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.

It doesn't make them good or pleasant people,  but it has to be noted that military measures that stay within modern SOP simply can't eradicate them. It is perhaps to the Coalition's credit that they never entertained changing procedures to be less humane and more effective, but we are seeing play out in real life the conundrum posed by George Martin in the character of Tywin Lannister: his immense cruelty in doing anything to win can actually lead to more humane outcomes than can be delivered by softer hearted characters.	0.827

Gotcha.	Minimum wage, like welfare, does not help people escape poverty. It just shackles them to it. Despite all the bad businesses that would screw over their employees, there are plenty (an abundance of small to medium businesses) that actually value employees as an investment that grows over time, as they train them internally and promote from within. These companies DO exist, and theyre more common than you believe.	0.84

Children that do not have cancer, or some other immuno-compromising condition have NO place getting this vaccine.

I will say, none of these were dismissed as conspiracy theories outright by people who actually understand the virus and vaccines.
