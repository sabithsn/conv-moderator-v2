You sweet summer child, didnâ€™t your mom ever teach you that there is a special room in your home where you can MAKE YOUR OWN FOOD?â€¦ The money that you pi$$ away eating out, I invest.	It's pseudoscience and you are all going down a dark road Now tell me the dangers of men raised by lumberjacks. Use science.  /s	0.759
I've been reading it too and it's amazing! Especially that you can find out many celebrities and people in your life who use those laws.   One of my favourite laws is conceal your intentions and I think you can apply it to FDS. It's better to not be open and direct about your FDS ideology and feminist beliefs. Sharing them and showing off how you don't need any men can be dangerous. People don't like being called out on their misogyny and LVM and pickmes will try to show you "your place".	>It may seem super romantic to have the almost-fairytale love story, or the â€˜if only, then we would be so happyâ€™ tale to keep you warm, but see it for what it is.   I can definitely tell from your replies in this thread that you've "been there, done that". I really thought I was smarter than this, or at least more grounded. I feel anytime I let a man in my life it just leads to an eventual setback.	0.795
Eww he probably does. I know a couple like that actually. The dude pays attention to everything she eats, how fast or slow she eats, and if she finishes her plate or not. He is obsessed with her losing weight.. and yea maybe she could, but he goes about it all wrong and isn't supportive.  Anyway.... the couple in the post just sound so bizarre..	Feels overwhelmed and suffocated by normal intimacy levels (though they won't communicate this, they'll likely shut down)ðŸš© Calls themself hard-to-get or difficult-to-readðŸš© Will not respond to texts in a timely manner, and will not excuse themselves for extremely late repliesðŸš© Rarely initiates communicationðŸš© Doesn't share personal information, or will immediately regret doing so afterwardsðŸš© Won't compromise on lots of things (over-rigid boundaries)ðŸš© More comfortable with sex then a deep conversationðŸš© Appears to view frequent quality time with you as a gift they're giving you, to the expense of themselvesðŸš© Relationship doesn't progress unless the other party forces itðŸš© Intimidated by or jokes about commitmentðŸš© Lists generic superficial things when asked why they like you (you're filling a girlfriend shaped hole in their life, there is no 'deep connection')ðŸš© Silent treatment when overwhelmedðŸš© 'White lies' or ommitting information to avoid difficult conversationsðŸš© Can easily emotionally detach during conflict (might make you wait until the weekend to talk things through, leaving you to stew)ðŸš© Hot-cold behaviour, mixed signals, unclear intentionsðŸš© Bad at self-reflection or being vulnerable enough for self-improvementðŸš©Takes you for granted because their mere physical presence is a prize in their viewðŸš© EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLEðŸš©   Note: a Secure person can act distant at times. However, a Secure person is confident in communicating their needs and boundaries. Whereas an Avoidant will avoid communication and tends to withdraw / shut down.  As a recovering Anxious attached, I'm running as soon as I spot Avoidant behaviour. The most important thing to recognise here is that the Avoidant feels most at ease with a partner at arm's length, because they feel suffocation easily. Whereas the Anxious fears neglect and will thus feel the urge to chase, to receive the affection they crave. This is the anxious-avoidant trap, and it is HELL ON EARTH for Anxious attached folks. So if they step up only after you push them away, that is a ðŸš©	0.857
Youâ€™re a stupid woman	Thank you for this post! I will repeat myself- we should not look at each other as competition, that does not benefit us. Tearing a woman down does not add value to you. Have each otherâ€™s back. I had a friend who would tell my most personal problems to her boyfriend (whom I didnâ€™t like at all). I cut her off and never looked back. Whatâ€™s the circle of this? She tells him, he tells his bros, his bros spread it to their bros, and everyone ends up knowing. Suddenly, youâ€™re vulnerable to strangers who can be real predators.	0.88
