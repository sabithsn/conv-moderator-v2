No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can‚Äôt really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He‚Äôs not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn‚Äôt been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos‚Äôs BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don‚Äôt even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of ‚Äúif I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit‚Äù. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre old and should die‚Äù and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he‚Äôs going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of ‚Äúrichest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone‚Äù	Take the people you mention. Calling people out as -phobic for not being with certain type of people is probably not their whole rhetoric. Now, I don‚Äôt know what the rest of it is but I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôs generally more acceptable than the other points of incel rhetoric.	0.883

Even so, counting both of them--and including evacuation-stress deaths (on top of actual radiation deaths) from Fukushima--makes nuclear power much, much closer to renewables in terms of <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy"">fatalities per power production</a> than to the other non-renewables.

I already did. You just ignored it. Go back and read it again if you want.	For cases of incest where no children are made, I think it would depend on what ""no"" means. Like if they always use a condom/birth control, even together, the risk is minimized but still present so I would say that is not acceptable. If the risk is actually eliminated through sterilization, or say homosexual incest, then I see no moral issue, though it would probably be best to still ban marriage in that case out of desire for legal consistency."	0.888
The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	There isn't a single demographic on Earth that could be spared from this sentence."	0.86

This is a blatant straw man. You leave no room for good-faith arguments.

Now were there poor illiterate whites in those times - of course. Shit my own grandfather was white and couldnt write his middle name (although he wasn‚Äôt American, but my point is I‚Äôm intimately familiar with the idea of a disadvantaged poor white man) but at-least they weren‚Äôt as heavily restricted. A black man during Jim Crow era could have been the most educated, well spoken, political speech giver, even filthy stinking rich, and he still would be kept out of positions that would have enabled him to enact change for the majority of black people who were having a really <em>shit</em> time. The last 50 years don‚Äôt make up for the land grab, gold rush ‚Äúself made man‚Äù era that African American people missed out on. They never got that chance. We still see the result of that to this day. Years ago some white people in this country decided that status quo when they brought slaves to this country, and now their descendants have to come to terms with the damage that was done, and that it can‚Äôt be undone in a lifetime. Or two. Or three. And it can‚Äôt be undone by just patiently waiting. Who knows, it might take an equal amount of back breaking hard work for 400 years like how it took for enslaved Africans to built the country in the first place. I gather you‚Äôre uncomfortable with the idea that white people have such life changing privilege that many people regard to trump other privileges- and well thats a consequence of the inhumanity that unfolded prior to your existence that youll have to live with. For hundreds of years privilege boiled down to are you black slave or are you a free white man and then they coalesced and built ontop of one another from there compounding the effect of what it meant to be white, or what to meant to be black. Eventually 400 years later, black doesn‚Äôt just mean you produce more melanin. It developed into a subconscious bias means your poor, you‚Äôre ghetto, you‚Äôre uneducated you‚Äôre incapable.</p>	0.889

Not CYV - Musk is human garbage. You‚Äôre right.	Some people ride this thought train to the end and they come to the conclusion that the way to fix this is to restore women to their ""place"". But that's evil and probably not possible since you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Another option is to consider that the masculine/feminine dichotomy was fucking stupid in the first place. Strength, loyalty, hard work, kindness, and leadership are *human* virtues.  Nurturing, grace, diplomacy, emotional intelligence, and communication skills are *human* virtues. Being a good father, partner, husband means chopping the (metaphorical) wood, carrying the water, kissing the boo-boos, and making the dinner. It's a big, complicated world and everyone needs to be able to do the work now. Getting men to reclaim virtues seen as feminine isn't a bad thing, it is reclaiming space to be a fully articulated human. Trying to restrict men to the masculine role is what's causing all the bullshit problems you identify. Being afraid to embody the entire human spectrum, to be competitive and loving, to be respectful and sexual, to care for your home and to kill it at work, is what is fucking everyone up. Trying to avoid being ""feminine"" just pushes men onto an ever-dissolving iceberg of safely masculine ideals and gives them a narrower and narrower range of ways to be. I don't want men to be feminine, I want men to be human.	0.829

The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‚ÄòJews escaping bla bla bla‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äô this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‚Äòjews as victims‚Äô justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‚Äòwhataboutism‚Äô for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago‚Ä¶.  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.

Making claims about what other people do privately is extremely weird to me, and it feels like this viewpoint has more to do with you than them. Am I wrong?</p>	0.859
Finally someone who gets me lol I gave you an upvote;)	Vote Democrat? Absolutely laughable. The party of illegal immigrants, abortions, 'everything is wacist', gun control, compromising our police, and being absolutely out of their minds. My Democratic governor lost billions of the state's tax dollars on email scams. Kamala Harris agreed that Biden was a rapist until he chose her. They break their own mandate rules all the time, put up this dementia patient to be president, and continue to fuck up this country. California, before taking your advice and voting Democrat, was a nice flourishing state. Now it's an embarassment."	0.827
can't convince a sheep	> As European commerce grew in the late Middle Ages, some Jews became prominent in [trade](https://www.britannica.com/topic/trade), banking, and moneylending,  and Jews‚Äô economic and cultural successes tended to arouse the envy of  the populace. This economic resentment, allied with traditional  religious [prejudice](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prejudice),  prompted the forced expulsion of Jews from several countries and  regions, including England (1290), France (14th century), Germany  (1350s), Portugal (1496), Provence (1512), and the [Papal States](https://www.britannica.com/place/Papal-States)  (1569). Intensifying persecution in Spain culminated in 1492 in the  forced expulsion of that country‚Äôs large and long-established Jewish  population. Only Jews who had converted to Christianity were allowed to  remain, and those suspected of continuing to practice [Judaism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judaism) faced persecution in the Spanish [Inquisition](https://www.britannica.com/topic/inquisition).	0.811
It would be my honor to change your (wife's) view...	<p>So this idea that religion is worse than science is false. </p>	0.9
OP clearly does not have kids, otherwise they wouldn't be asking this question.	I'm pretty confident i did not say it was a downgrade. It will be interpreted that way until people adjust, but that's not actually a downgrade, just a misguided perception of it.	0.877
> You only get to call me racist so many times before I stop abbreviating "the N word".  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a racist i swear! I just really want to say the n-word and the only thing keeping me from saying it is fear of people pointing out that me saying it is racist‚Äù	If conservatives were really saying what you are saying, I wouldn‚Äôt have any problems with conservatives. But that‚Äôs not what they are saying. They are not defending their freedom of speech with principles of liberty and are instead deviating from reality to justify pragmatically their beliefs."	0.826

But you are struggling with reading comprehension. Expecting someone to take off their pants so you can fuck them, is not as bad as asking them to pay. You are comparing apples to grenades.	<p>I will try an argument, what about people who criticize others for social clout? I.E a celebrity calling out any other celebrity to increase their own exposure. This person is probably uncaring about the damage and there does not have to be projection because there main goal is social clout to get better movie roles or something.</p>	0.835
Oh look, you can read. You just choose to ignore reading the sources I provided that prove you wrong.   Keep on defending rapists. Keep denying women victimize men.   Then fuck off.	<p>I&#39;m REALLY not trying to be mean or flippant here, but have you ever been in a monogamous relationship?  Because the idea that the moment you&#39;re in a monogamous relationship you cease to ever find other people attractive has almost zero basis in reality.  Maybe initially when you&#39;re in the honeymoon phase and the person is on your mind all the time, but that will eventually subside no matter how great the relationship is.</p>	0.785
That article details a different op-ed highlighting the perils American democracy faces. It does not explain what a national divorce means, and even if it did, I am asking what you think it means.   I‚Äôm not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this post. If you are not willing to explain your view, I would conclude you are unwilling to have your view changed, and I will report your post as violating this subs rules.	<p>think it depends on the person, personally, I agree, but there‚Äôs a lot of very successful very grindy games</p>	0.766

Completely abolished. These agencies have created more enemies of America then they have dismantled. They‚Äôre literally untouchable when it comes to horrific crimes do to them handling sensitive information pertaining national security. These crimes include human trafficking and coving up pedophilic acts conducted by agents.	I do think ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù which are just spending shitloads of money to collect every XYZ are kinda bullshit and I think they‚Äôre kinda stupid, but them seem to make some people happy so why not. Someone is gonna be happy that they can buy Mario jeans and t shirts and consoles and everything.	0.863
Excellent summary - but you left out the part where he claimed Covid was fake.	In North Carolina: Cunningham used the word ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù zero times in Facebook ad copy in the month leading up to the election ‚Äî while running over 700 direct donate ads in-state, despite having a robust national fundraising apparatus. Note: As of 11/15, incumbent D Governor Roy Cooper got 261,307 more votes than Cunningham.	0.84
Thank you for this comment üôèüèª reminds me that most Redditors are retarded	I think you're missing the point. It's not that people are angry that billionaires are breaking the law. Because most of the times they aren't. People are angry because our lawmakers do whatever these billionaires want, and won't change the tax laws."	0.869
