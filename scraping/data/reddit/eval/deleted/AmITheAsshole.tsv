I guess she doesn't deserve the 40k her aunt was gifting her then because you say so person who wasn't even there for the event in question.	<p>I honestly don’t think she’s trying to cause drama, she just doesn’t get my style and is frustrated by it for the most part.</p>	0.893
He only forgives her because he doesn't have the self-esteem to seek anyone else.	<p>The fact of the matter is all the people above saying that she could alter your coursework are ignoring the fact that you offered to split with her in the first place, so apparently that always would have been an option if you had originally split it with her. Also if this is something that requires you to complete a test or something to get a certificate your friend would have been paying half for nothing because she wouldn&#39;t have got that right? So you were originally going to charge your half on a course without her being able to use the full course? That sucks dude. Basically it sounds like you were trying to get somebody else to cover your education too. How is that any different from what your friend is doing? Personally anything I already pay for and it doesn&#39;t cost me anything to let my friends use I let them use all the time because I&#39;m trying to help everybody in a rising tide can raise all boats. </p>	0.881
I said we don’t do public transport.	<p>Your time and money isn&#39;t owed to her, if she doesn&#39;t want to live like a broke college student she has to earn money. Being tired after work is very normal and you don&#39;t owe her fresh food, consider where you want to be in 5 years and see how/if she fits into that life.</p>	0.858
Haha enjoy middle eastern and africans slowly taking over your lands with Islam 😂😂😂	Stand your ground. It might not be as black and white if you actually really wanted to be there but worried if it's unfair to wronged sister. But you don't want to. You don't want to have anything to do with these people. There's no moral obligation at all to put all that aside so they can innocent-wash the foundation of their relationship.	0.866
NTA. Jenna clearly hasn’t changed since high school, despite what she’d like to pretend. And I think it’s pretty rich of her to be offended, seeing as she killed someone.	<p>BUT... (and here comes the unpopular opinion).... I know you had plans but, assuming that you are in a committed relationship and you’d like to get to know your boyfriend’s family, it wouldn’t have killed you to change plans and workout the day after instead. I KNOW, you don’t want to set a precedent but I think you could’ve been more gracious about it. Maybe mention to his mom that you usually have plans and it’s better to call ahead but seeing as she is here and you wanting to get to know her, you will change your plans for today... </p>	0.902
I am not trolling, I feel what I did was justified by Kate ignoring me and betraying our friendship. You have the mental issues if you can't understand friendship.	<p>He said that i’m being a bitch and I need to take a joke. O</p>	0.843
Thanks you for your comment. Im already living my life, i just don’t want the money but I’m feeling really guilty depraving my family from it	<p>Also, weird religion/pet intersection solidarity. I’m Jewish, my dad is Anglican. He ‘baptised’ her this easter. It was a joke but it was very weird haha</p>	0.812
And diet and exercise are a choice, lol	<p>Moreover, I don&#39;t understand why you <em>want</em> to care more about your 3 day vacation then supporting a friend with an addiction. You can support her and <em>also</em> find a million other separate ways to relax. Is this literally the only source of fun in your life? It feels like you are trying to punish her.</p>	0.878
I will.	Why did you feel compelled to to that?	0.878
I think NAH.  You definitely did the right thing. Becoming homeless just so one day your sister can have a house is not practical.  However I kind of get how your sister feels? It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	My sister (female minor) is the youngest out of 7 children. I (Female minor) am the second youngest. My sister is well.... I don't really know how to really describe her. She can come off as shy to the public but is chaotic at home, Its almost as if she has two different personalities to certain type of people which I can understand.  Since she is the youngest, she is viewed as the 'baby'. I hardly see her as that. Me and my sister are three years apart if that helps.	0.83
For reals? You talk shit about people and children saying they have diseases and shit just because of how they look. So shut the fuck up	I mean, come on, wanting no children of your own is fair enough, but to say you'd never take in children of deceased relatives is *cold*. I understand why OPs wife reacted how she did in the moment, but I don't think for a moment he's the asshole in a situation where wife is saying no to even the *slightest chance* they'd take the children in. Plus treating a 'maybe someday we would have to' as a 'DEFINITELY RIGHT NOW WE MUST' - OPs brother is, as far as the post goes, healthy and in no danger of dying anytime soon.	0.86
NTA.   He knows exactly what he did. Not only is your "boyfriend" if we can call him that, a pig...he is a jerk.   He obviously did it to get a rise out of you which not only proves that is an immature idiot but a petulant child as well.   That being said, the way you explain his little outburst seems so natural and instinctual of him that I totally believe you that he'd eat the same way at home.  Honestly why are you even with him? With how petty you make him seem I can't imagine he'd be any different or any sort of good guy material.  I'd imagine you'd be cleaning up after him a lot as well considering the slop he might leave behind after he eats. Not assuming anything but just making an educated guess.   I thought it was bad enough that my Dad could go to an Olive's Garden Italian Restaurant and ask the waiter for Mexican Horchata when prompted for a drink but your guy takes it to a whole new level. If I were you it'd take a serious look at my relationship and wonder if you're this guy's gf or his mother.	<p>Also, please don’t put cookware into the dishwasher! That’s the best way to ruin it!</p>	0.777
Oh 100% YTA. So his opinion ABOUT HIS OWN DAUGHTER doesn't matter to you because "you're the mother". GTF out of here with that bull crap	<p>Long story short: You seem to have a deluded concept of a honest relationship is. You also overstep your boundaries as a mother in a stable two parent relationship. You don&#39;t get to make all the calls and need to give permission: Your husband is not your child. Please, as a person who grew up in a very unstable family, apologize to your husband and fix this entire ordeal before it escalates. From experience I can tell you that your kids will pick up on this, if they haven&#39;t already. Fox this before it escalates because no matter how small this spat might be to you, I garnetee it will seem much worse to your kids.</p>	0.919
It's obviously a made up story, but in case it isn't : Esh.  1.Your daughters behaviour is the result of the treatment they got from you and your mistress/wife. None of you cared about how your relationship would affect their lives 2.You didn't cared that you ruined their life, brought a stranger into their lives and forced them to love her otherwise they were punished.  3.I don't blame your ex wife for hating you or sara.  4. Sara had no qualms in having an affair to a married man and ruining a marriage, while at the same time crying that your daughters didn't love her. I have no respect for women who have affairs with married men.	At first I thought esh but then I read some of OP&#39;s replies. Op was willing to have any relationship with Jane to form a bond but Jane wasn&#39;t willing to budge. So OP just remained respectful and nice. Jane just wanted the title of being a mom without understanding that children are their own people. I think if Jane really wanted a child to love, she would have been more cautious with how she went about talking to OP when they first met. I do feel bad for Jane because she probably got over excited. This reddit usually hates parents that are &quot;its my way or the highway&quot;, isn&#39;t that essentially what Jane did? It was either &quot;I&#39;m your mom or I&#39;m nothing to you&quot;, she made her bed now she needs to lie in it.</p>	0.913
NTA - if someone grabbed my dinner that I had ordered, and just dug in and offered me their cauliflower rice (I also don’t like cauliflower, it upsets my stomach), it wouldn’t end well for that person. Glad you ditched the loser bf. Don’t give him any money. Send him a head of cauliflower instead.	He&#39;s 5, and manipulative.  Good on you for figuring him out, don&#39;t be afraid to address it either. He needs to know you know he&#39;s a liar. Therapy needs to confront it too, don&#39;t make the assumption he needs more attention, his behaviour is disrupting the sleep of the house (both houses), then the adults have to get up and carry on.   Ignore the behaviour and a monster will be created.</p>	0.87
no I wasn't a bully.   sorry. as their parent I would not let that kind of injustice stand. that wasn't the punishment set for the bullying and should not be allowed to stand.   think whatever you want. I'm done repeating myself.	Maybe stop assuming every is about you and do what they suggest for your child.</p>	0.748
Probably not cus we have been happy for 19 years now. It’s just a minor irritation. They have gotten bolder over the years…	Honest mistakes all around. It happens to us all at one point or another in forgetting keys or not turning on a ringer when someone needs us. It's also not like you asked him and then went to sleep. He told you he was on his way soon and showed up four and a half hours later. Sure, I can understand him being mad. But like you said, you would've woken up and rushed to the door if you hadn't forgotten your ringer and you were staying up as long as you could. Half an hour is a long time when you're dead tired, but this is more a ""lesson"" to remember to turn on your sound next time and for him to come home on time or let you know it's going to be a while longer so you can make preparations.	0.855
Yta for raising a sissy bisexual. If Finn was 100% gya he’d have thicker skin	<p>What a brat you have raised. </p>	0.866
Let's not pretend OP is going to even know his daughter moving forward if they don't make amends lmfao.   is any morally righteous point worth throwing away your entire relationship with your kid?   be the bigger person than your child...	Normally I would not advocate deleting someone else's pictures, but this dude just broke a huge boundary of going through your phone, on top of keeping pics I would bet most, if not all, of his exes would be uncomfortable knowing he still has (and uses!!!). If you do decide to stay with him, I would suggest having him delete the pictures in front of you, including the back-ups) without giving him time to make more hidden copies). That's not an insecurity thing, that's a ""these women wouldn't appreciate this and it's gross he held on to these and shouldn't have access to them anymore"" thing.	0.868
Congratulations on getting rid of that whole person.  NTA, diets are problematic at the best of times and a night off every now and then is fine, you should be enjoying what you eat whether it is ‘healthy’ food or not.  Also, you don’t need another person to police what you put in your mouth, you are quite capable of doing that for yourself.  Alan seems to have mistaken boyfriend for prison guard, how dare he interfere with your food like that, and make humiliating comments in front of other people, not only is that incredibly rude it is also disrespectful and dismissive of you and your bodily autonomy.  He also doesn’t get to then expect you to pay for the food he stole from you, or the food he ordered to replace it.  At $10.00 that’s the cheapest couples etiquette lesson he’ll ever get, always supposing he actually learns from it.  By the way that doesn’t make you a gold digger, it makes him a jerk, although I suspect he was that long before the dinner.  P.s.  There is nothing wrong with being ‘on the heavier side’, if you are comfortable in your skin and healthy then it’s up to you whether or not you diet or splurge a little.	<p>Once those children are born, you&#39;ll be stuck there fighting an endless legal battle, because it seems like he&#39;s enabling her. Move back to your family if you can, and be sure to tell your family exactly why you&#39;re there. Tell your friends about her behavior too (not necessarily your plan to get away), so that way you&#39;ll have back up. The more people who know that she&#39;s crazy, probably the better.</p>	0.835
>Well, yeah. She can't control what other people say but she can for sure say something herself to stand up for her sister. She still had a voice. Instead she chose to stand by and laugh at her sisters misery.  exactly... how come they aren't standing up for the daughter? take the asshole kids to court for what was promised to your daughter?   they advocate for that but then they want to let their daughter get bullied by the aunt's kids.    >She deserved to be punished. No graduation party is a good punishment.   she did. and no it wasn't... it was vindictive and mean to take away a milestone that only happens once in her entire lifetime like that... a more appropriate one would be some community service and volunteering possibly with local anti bullying groups...   >Unfortunately, life isn't fair   so when the daughter loses 40k it's "sometimes life isn't fair" but when someone says a mean comment about the other daughter it isn't "life isn't fair" its "how dare you not stand up for protect and take full responibility for your step sister?"   why aren't they standing up for and protecting their daughter and taking full responsibility for them?   they have no texts at all where the aunt said they wanted to give the check?    >For my daughter, my aunt asked when we'd have the party so she can give the cheque. I told her we weren't planning a party as a consequence. She understood and said she'd bring the cheque when we met up in the future.  there is likely record of this interaction lmfao.   #how can you ask her to do for her stepsister what her parents won't do for her... protect her, fight for her interests....	<p>She isn&#39;t asking for 50% of your paycheck she is asking for a fixed amount for rent and bills if I have understood you.</p>	0.765
Absolutely NTA  Hes a complete AH, however, and good on you for taking out that trash.  NOONE, male, female, relative, or acquaintance gets to body shame you. NOONE gets to dictate food choices or portions for you. Despite not wishing to cause a scene you should have made that perfectly clear to your now ex and the table.  Awesome job on your journey so far! Stay in charge!	I hope you get poked by Legos on every part of your body for the rest of your life and never get a painkiller. And that she gets full custody and takes you to the cleaners - I don't usually want that, but I don't think you can be trusted with knowing when to soothe your kid when they're inevitably going to hurt themselves.	0.857
First of all I am glad that in all this mess the dads are competent at least. That is awsome and well done to both your dad and Bob for doing exactly what needs to bee done.  OP you are a child, a grown child, but you mom's kid, not your mom's servant or live in nanny. Your younger siblings should have never been your responsibility and it was extremely kind if you to devote so much time in raising them. But no OP, your mom should either have a nanny or at least pay you to professionally watch them. That's time taken out of your day, studies and productive time you could spend creatively and with friends as teens should do.  Not to mention how your mom puts her boyfriend over her own child, takes away her personal space and allows said boyfriend to massively overstep here. You've been civil and way more mature than your grown ass adult mother! You did the right thing and removed yourself from an unpleasant situation.   She decided to procreate about 10+ years since she had you and she should have been mothering her own kids instead of passing that role to her teenage daughter who should be out having fun with her friends being a "stupid" teenager with nit a care in the world. You should be allowed to do mistakes at this age, explore the world, sneak a ship of beer and find that to be the coolest thing you can do, being "sooo baaaaad". But actually just being young, and allowed to be a child and live without major responsibilities for as long as you can. I'm 27, turning 28 and I can't believe how fast 10 years past me by. Feels like yesterday I was being so baaaaad telling my mom I'll just go downtown and actually going to hang out with boys in the next town over, feeling that's so cool and edgy or whatever teens call it in 2021.  Your and incredible daughter and sister! NTA, your mom 5/5 assholes! she should grow up and take care of her own responsibilities!	<p>I never once said he was right. All I said was that keeping it in their orbit, as a reminder of this incident, was a bad move and selling it online to a stranger would have been a better move. All of the stuff that you said only matters if she is at her breaking point and wants out because, let&#39;s be real here, he doesn&#39;t seem mature enough to be an adult about this and is more than likely going to be around the nephew/aunt in some capacity. Most families don&#39;t cut off assholes, they just suck it up and deal with them. What you said makes sense logically but, how often does logic work out in real life? Very rarely.</p>	0.854
The dad is the asshole for marrying her. Some people are too damaged to be parents. People who mate with such damaged people are enablers who are creating a new generation of damaged folks	But OP’s husband specifically said stepson and not son, which is why I mentioned it, because I’m getting the feeling he doesn’t feel parental responsibility here, particularly given how he shoved off that responsibility on other people when it became inconvenient.</p>	0.915
He did it with the thinking his son wasn't going to get the test. It is very possible his girlfriend would try to make him raise another man's bio kid since she is a known cheater. He is son is clearly a moron with no backbone who blindly trusts his girlfriend despite knowing she doesn't respect him hence the cheating. If he found out the kid wasn't his he could at least warn his son of the fact and maybe that would make him wake up.	<p>And honestly, I don&#39;t really care if people think I am an asshole. My point was that you were being naive or even ignorant in making that assumption, which you clearly missed the plot on.</p>	0.89
NTA- What an ignorant prick. What happened to you is quite common and it’s not only something you shouldn’t be embarrassed about it’s also something he shouldn’t be making jokes about. Seriously, is he 12?	<p>I don&#39;t even understand how you can go <em>slower</em> than the limit then be all Pikachu face when other people try to overtake. Some of us have places to go and don&#39;t want to be stuck behind slow pacer like you, so either you drive normally or you just let people live their lives but you have <em>zero</em> right to road rage when you&#39;re the one choosing to drive slower than expected.</p>	0.862
Yeah you do if its a family member	Don't let her babysit if she intends to keep her boyfriend.  Nope them out after what had happened to him and your husband over video games.  She thinks he had a bad day?  My ass!  She's too blind to see things clearly.  So nope.....	0.867
I think this will be an unpopular opinion, but NAH. I completely see where you are coming from. It seems like you are concerned for your friend's safety. I know a pastor who is in the military and he said that he had a marine in his office who had just gotten back from beating a man to death with his gun. But he was in the fetal position crying because his wife was leaving him. It's serious. And when coupled with ptsd, he could be a danger to himself or others. Your daughter is too young to understand that though, so obviously she is upset. But you can't wait when it comes to mental health. One day your daughter will be old enough to understand that part of it. But I don't think you were wrong. This could have made him stop going to therapy, you kept him from doing that.	I know he didn't mean it maliciously but it was so abrupt from a sweet kid that I absolutely adored who adored me that it hurt more than I could even process. My husband had him apologise to me right away and he looked so confused.	0.868
Good job, darling! No one needs the wrong kind of d1ck in their life!	You're an asshole for repeatedly forcing a child into these situations, and for not putting your abusive mother in her place.	0.907

NTA, he should have been wearing your food.	<p>Their parents come over and call me a 鬼佬 Guǐ lǎo which is a racial slur for Europeans (or white people) in Chinese, i guess literally ghost people, which is really offensive in Chinese, might not sound like it in English. They say I&#39;m not Chinese and thus I don&#39;t tell them what to do. I told them they&#39;re raising rotten kids and that they should learn some respect. The argument gets louder and people pull out their phones and surround us, with all of them posting this on wechat and weibo typical Chinese mob behavior ugh.</p>	0.858
Wow!....you need to fix this asap.	<p>I don’t like that he’s talking to you like that. I also don’t like all these others in the comments saying that YOU need to find compromises or make allowances for any issue, because it’s just wrong. You didn’t do anything hun, maybe think about if you’re going to allow him to treat you like that. Even if he’s struggling with something, resorting to anger and name calling and belittling isn’t ever deserved.</p>	0.919

my favorite part is all of them calling me a kid for reasonably noting that op's relationship with their daughter hangs in the balance over this.	OP, your mom has absolutely no say in your father’s life, unless it impacts you. He does not need to ask her permission to date or remarry. Whatever nonsense she is filling your head with about that is wrong.	0.89
Reminds me of the Op who told her co worker (Was it James?) Who is a widower that he should not be wearing his wedding band because it was "misleading". Awful and cruel. Poor guy I wish I could buy him some coffee and tell him how sorry I am for his loss.  That posr triggered me and is definately a nomination for AH of the year award.	<p>It is absolutely hypocritical for her to be mad at you for doing the same thing she does to you, and you even gave her the respect of walking in backwards. I dunno, privacy should be a basic right for anyone, even if they live with their parents. Their biological connection to you does not make peeping tom-like behavior right.</p>	0.89

What a horrible c#*t. Some folk are happy to have a laugh over this kinda stuff, some folk are not. And as for him doing it in front of his family? That's really not on. I'm not happy when my husband talks about our son's birth, because it's a very personal thing, not something to be bandied about at family things.
