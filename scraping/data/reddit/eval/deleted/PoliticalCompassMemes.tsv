oh boy wait till you see the totally sane redditlards at r/hermancainaward lmao	All the auths and rightos pretending that homosexuality had anything to the fall of ancient greece, and ignoring that the behaviours were not only present during the rise of ancient greek cultures (especially in Sparta) but also in the society that conquered greece, that being the macedonian empire.	0.833
Hitler's father beat him for every minor fault while his mom spoil him raw.	We actually need more immigration because social security is not sustainable. There are not enough workers and young people are not having kids to support the boomers	0.9

**Damn fucking right.**  I love your comment, because it‚Äôs so true.  That‚Äôs all racism is; Seeing patterns. Sure, there absolutely are people out there who literally just hate people for how they look no matter what, but ‚Äùracism‚Äù being bad is just something horrible groups of people came up with so they could keep being horrible while shaming anyone who pointed it out.  Black being more violent and savage than other races? RACIST, aka truth.  Asians being generally smarter and more hardworking than other races? RACIST, aka truth...  If ‚Äùcertain groups‚Äù wanted to stop being ‚Äùopressed‚Äù, then all they‚Äôd have to do is prove the stereotype wrong... That‚Äôs the problem though, since they cannot do that...

he is doing his very best to use his little AHS minions to run a misinformation campaign across multiple subreddits. it's basically "accept my pseudo-science on trans ideology or get banned from mass reporting". Just a creepy little middle-aged man who abused his wife and now to try and reconcile that and make himself seem like a good person, he's doing this internet social justice crusade against "hate" and "bigotry" thinking it'll either erase or make up for his wrongdoing.

>6 counties would suffice.	Not all of us women do. Fallon Fox pisses me off. I will accept and don't give a shit if people want to change genders but men changing to women and then fighting women?? Fuck that. Men are just built so differently. When Fox broke Brents' orbital bone in a fight, Brents came out against it, said another women has never hit her like that. That right there tells you something, but the fucked up part, people attacked Brents because she was transphobic for not wanting to fight a genetic man???? This world is something else....	0.865
I say instead of saying [removed] we just say gypsy now	I can‚Äôt get if you‚Äôre serious or not, but reducing the complexity of factors that go into civilizations rising and falling to a morality compass seems definitely a weird take on the matter. I mean, Rome fell not when it was at its hedonistic peak, during Commodus‚Äô reign, but when it was christian (and christianity has been considered a cause of the fell of the empire); Sparta fell under Alexander‚Äôs push, while Japan was economically conquered by the British, so being a ‚Äúmorally upstanding‚Äù country equates to nothing. On the other hand you have rich, progressed civilization built on a prophet who married a 6yo girl and had sex with her when she was 9, so I wouldn‚Äôt really call morality too often into the equation when talking about what guides the rise and the fell of civilizations.	0.809
Why is every quadrant infestated with f–∞gg–æts? Is it a reddit speciality?	No, you got downvoted for making a wall of text because about a meme, at least that's what I assume	0.809
The whole the right wing trap internet fallacy is a lie and a fetish pushed by actual sodomites that wish it was the case. When there is overwhelmingly more of them in every other political alignment.	None of those things are ok, and I am not. Please fmdo reconsider you Pedo-defending tendencies, they are not ok.	0.78
The mods in this sub are too big of cuckolds. So worried about it being banned that they won't allow us to put the socially destructive rejects in their place	Reminds me of that Eastbound and Down episode..  ‚ÄúHey kid, what‚Äôs Spanish for black?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Ä¶okay, you said it, not me.‚Äù	0.807
The Chinise media said that in Xinjiang there was a problem with terrorism and menaged to end it 10 times more successfully than any other nation in Afghanistan and Iraq. Hong Kong are riots, the protesters killed people, the protester beated people, the protesters burned people alive, the protesters rioted public spaces, shops, homes, infrastructures. The Hong Kong police didn't beat people, didn't use knifes, didn't use fire. They used shields, water and braveness. The Hong Kong rioters are just kids influenced by the filo-western media in Hong Kong and western financed media. I mean, for the COVID thing I haven't apologize, it was a shitty move but there aren't proof that the virus was originated in China, it's a virus.	Hey look at this retarded meme OP probably lives in a trailer or something.  &#x200B;  ^(/s)	0.761
