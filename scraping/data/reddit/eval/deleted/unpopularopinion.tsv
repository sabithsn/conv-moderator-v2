I bet you're an unmarried man. Men generally start complaining about this in their 30s and 40s unless they have wives who take on the entire mental burden of planning their social/vacation lives (a task which men rarely appreciate, nor thank their wives for). So my unasked for advice which you will never take is that you must start doing the social planning for yourself. Throw parties, ask people out to plays and movies, ask people to accompany you for dinner and coffee. Planning social time, you would soon see, is real work. Yet if you neglect it, as surely as your body turns to shit from not exercising, your spirit turns to shit from not socializing. My lived in 2 cents.	Where a professional could take care of her, my family would have been spared a LOT of PTSD and depression during our (the kids) formative years and my parents would have a healthier relationship. It seriously almost broke my family. So I agree with you, and don‚Äôt understand why people would give you so much hate for saying so. The only reason I could think of why they would react to a post like that would be because they have never actually gone through something like that themselves. Having to watch your nana disintegrate over time is seriously damaging to the human spirit."	0.851

Go f yourself Republican scum who put us here with your uneducated voting like you even care. I do want to defund police.	<p>Food stamps should be completely demolished, it is a bad system. None of these programs are robust enough to actually do anything and there is constant repeals and push back on them. Again there is laws that make it almost impossible to be homeless and not die. Puplic schools are extremely underfunded and the current American tax system is shit. Everything is set to keep poor people poor while America has the ability to set everyone at a decent starting point that could actually help to make progress in the world instead of uphold a system that constantly pits people against eachother instead of dealing with the issues</p>	0.844
Maybe if we add grey lead to the list of ‚Äúneeds‚Äù boomers might support this policy plan?  What am I doing, it‚Äôs a list of demands. Who am I fooling?	I'm aware that it's completely fine to go ""Look at those idiots getting fucking drunk again"", especially if you're not directly confronting someone like that. It isn't inherently derogatory, it's a pretty tame term. But the way you've generally worded your comments regarding that topic and the vibe you give off, it really seems like you honestly feel superior to ""those people"" and perceive them as of lesser intellect. If I'm reading too much into this, I'm sorry. But at least overthink how you come off towards people if you act that way."	0.843
Marinate on your opinions and go outside. That's come from a place of love.	<p>i think youre using a very rare example and it also being greatly abused right now in america. people dont want to go back to work. people cant be evicted from their apartments for not paying rent. should these people be getting free healthcare and such? the pandemic has technically been &quot;over&quot; for a while. Thats getting into another topic though. The jobs are here, people are hiring, my state is offering 1000$ sign on to people just to go back to work and they wont. MY friend who owns a restaurant cant get her staff back because theyre making more on unemployment. These all dont sound like people who deserve anything TBH.</p>	0.778
We could have limitless paper, in a paperless world.	And last but not least, like I said, nothing wrong with people who think and act different than me. Theres plenty who disagree with my thinking and just enjoy having sex as much as they can. But that doesnt mean I have to, and it certainly doesnt mean I have to accept or tolerate this from my partner. I am free to think of it this way just as you are free to do the opposite. People dont always have to agree with each other to live in acceptance and peace"	0.874
I literally never said that trans people transitioning hurts me or that it require more than minimal effort to respect their pronouns. You keep saying that in every comment as if I somehow denied that. So for the millionth time, I choose not to use pronouns that trans people claim to be theirs because I do not believe those are the correct pronouns for reasons previously mentioned. By decision to not use the pronouns is not based on fear or laziness, but on respect for the truth of which the identity that trans people claim is not.	<p>Also, it&#39;s only short term. Eventually the rich people won&#39;t have as much for you to tax. A better solution to give the government more money for Congress to burn would be to boost the economy by lowering taxes. The long and short is that that will cause more money to change hands, which the government will take pieces of for taxes.</p>	0.871
It's not necessarily that I (or anyone else cares about them) it is more so that (if nothing else) a law to dictate helmets/ seatbelts in order to reduce the chances of a kid getting traumatized from seeing someone splattered on the asphalt.	That's certainly not the impression that your no room for change title gave."	0.894
Can‚Äôt put that or I‚Äôll get banned. ‚Äò‚Äô/s‚Äô‚Äô	I personally believe that the severity of a punishment should match the severity of the crime, and so I dislike a policy that would create these strange situations. A simple speeding ticket should not carry a harsher punishment than attacking a person would. But I bet most people reading this would agree that paying millions of dollars is worse than spending a week or two in jail."	0.789

I plan on taking out student loans, and then I want the government to forgive my debt. Too easy.	And did you never made a mistake, never need a second chance? ""Oh but I never killed someone"" you're saying. That only shows an immature mind and a lack of knowledge on what concerns the lives of the others.	0.887

Do you think it‚Äôs fair you have the opportunity to have those pens, over other people? Everyone should be able to have the access to the best pens, like you.	<li><p>While he didn&#39;t quite practically adopt the rest of the gang, he comes close. Kelso has severely neglectful parents, and Red provided an aspect of discipline in his life. My sort of fan theory is that Kasey Kelso is what he would have been without Reds influence. Jackie also had very neglectful parents, and while he resented her at first for her families wealth as someone that was struggling despite working so hard, they formed a very close bond and he was very clearly a father figure to her long before her actual father was incarcerated and Red and Bob (who is also a damn saint by the way, even if he is goofy) talked it out to have Jackie move in next door with Bob and Donna. And while he would razz Fez about being an immigrant, he also did his absolute best to help Fez study for his citizenship test. And I don&#39;t remember if that&#39;s before or after he already had a heart attack when he learned that Fez (sham) married his daughter to stay in the country, and then he defied his moral beliefs by lying about the marriage to Immigration. </p></li>	0.85

It's fun and it's sunday	<p>Just the fact that you can distance yourself from the reality of racist cops, police brutality and peoples lives being treated as colateral damage proves it. When somebody says to you &quot;i am scared of cops&quot; do you tell them &quot;oh no need to, you just got that from the media&quot;? At least with mobs, gangs, cartels and thugs i know what to expect and i know they are not going to fuck with me.</p>	0.822
Well,  I have a life.  Do you ? Or were you just salivating like a dog,  waiting for a response ? ü§£	<p>I think people tend to put too much emphasis on their effects in certain situations. Like one of my ex-girlfriends got really mad (Probably hiding sadness) that I didn&#39;t cum really quick because she thought I wasn&#39;t attracted enough to her. It caused major relationship issues and I broke up with her because of it, which sucked because I actually genuinely liked her alot.</p>	0.868
Refusing to yield to faster traffic is more dangerous than speeding.  There is nothing more infuriating than being in the middle of a multi-hour road trip and having someone in the left lane who will not move over to let you by, despite going under the speed limit.  What makes the most sense is that you must yield to overtaking traffic if you are in any lane except the right lane (i.e. passing lanes).  For some reason, some people are either unaware that there are other cars on the road or they feel entitled to dictate the flow of traffic. Slow traffic not moving out of the passing lanes is what causes traffic jams and accidents due to many people passing on the right.  Slow driving in passing lanes is oblivious at best, usually inconsiderate, and dangerous at worst. Let the speeders do their thing in passing lanes, and let highway patrol do their jobs.	https://www.livescience.com/9578-common-ancestor-blue-eyes.html	0.765
The science being by a guy who made two brothers fuck one another and then one of them Killed themselves. Literally nazi level shit glad 3% of the population thinks it‚Äôs okay to be like that.	You‚Äôre first comparison is irrelevant, unless you‚Äôre attempting to make an ethical claim about killing always being wrong. If that‚Äôs the case, then you‚Äôre going to need to make a proper argument. Nevertheless it misunderstands my argument. Both myself and the other commenter agreed that firearms can be used effectively to defend one‚Äôs self. The commenter asserted this was cowardly and I disagreed, hence my question regarding the helmet."	0.813

I haven‚Äôt seen abuse this severe since your dad beat the fuck out of your mom	<li>The problem is we‚Äôre not talking about something as abstract as religion. We‚Äôre talking about real regulations in medicine, these are based on ethics and morality and the like, and when it comes to arguments in those subjects, you actually can support your opinion. It doesn‚Äôt mean one is objectively the best, but some can be more correct than others, and you not wanting to justify why you think yours is the best, instead just saying ‚Äúit depends who you ask‚Äù makes me thing you don‚Äôt have a reason. </li>	0.855
It should be illegal to have kids you can‚Äôt afford	1) first off you talk as if most city folk decided to live in cities but changed their minds - that is the biggest pile of horseshit I ever heard  - people who move to the city stay in the city, the sort of people who move to towns are people who were born in cities and people who didn't get to choose where they grew up, that's why they want to move	0.849
The government does with taxes. Ever took a civic class before. /s  Ya I can see the issue, of maybe putting a gun to someone‚Äôs head to give me free stuff.

Wow, TIL	That being said, I still completely agree with you on the 60 dollar price point of a BLANK champion hoodie. I had some feedback complaining that my hoodie was too expensive for 60 dollars, but i literally spent time designing it, calling in the order, and making sure the blank hoodie was better than a champion hoodie. And I do say, it is better."	0.801
