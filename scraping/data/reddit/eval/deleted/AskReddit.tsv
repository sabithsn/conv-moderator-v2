Im very left wing, but i think some of the pronoun stuff is a bit ridiculous. Fair enough calling someone whos transgendered by their preferred gender pronouns, but it doesnt need to be such a prominent subject that you have to ask everyone their pronouns when you first meet them, or that its on every form you have to fill in, and if you arent transgender, and even if youre gender neutral, you should understand that when other people have to refer to you when talking to others, they are just going to use whatever seems obvious. The amount of over labelling is just stupid. Pronouns are just words that have no power over you other than what you give to them	That's better."	0.832
Well, I would certainly agree with you that the real problem is ***NOT*** trans women (or trans *people* for that matter). Side note: that's a great point for me to emphasize in future discussions, so thank you for that!   But rather, I think the root problem‚Äîin this discussion anyways‚Äîis, "laws that erode the category of 'female'". In my view that's the problem that needs to be solved.  And I think it will never get solved if liberal / progressive-minded groups continue their approach of censoring, bullying, and / or threatening anyone who disagrees with them. We as a society need to be able to communicate openly with one another and try to resolve our differences. There is no "us" or "them", except in our minds. We're all human, and we're all in this together. Every single person is right about some things, and wrong about other things. And we can help each other, to fill in the gaps where we fall short, and to help everyone be a better version of themselves!   /soapbox üòÖ	3. Pull back hard. I don't mean stop being a part of her life entirely, but make yourself scarce. It'll ultimately help you get out of her tractor beam and it'll force her to respond. If she likes you she will reach out more. If she doesn't, she will let you fade out. While it would suck, not the worst thing bc then you can start looking for other dates/persons of interest.  Potential pitfall: she will see you interested in another and start giving you some attention. Just enough to keep you on the hook (""wait.  Is she into me?!?! Why else would she [insert flirt tactic]"") but remind yourself that she doesn't want you, but she doesn't want you to NOT want her. It's an ego thing.	0.855
Yea	I will specify that I live in Hawai‚Äôi. Retail and food locations still have mask requirements. I wear one in public places cause even though we have a mask mandate here.. inconsiderate tourist refuse to follow the rules. I find that the types of people who can‚Äôt be bothered to follow the rules or choose to travel during a pandemic (albeit this far along) are also the same people who think it‚Äôs a hoax or don‚Äôt take other precautions like covering their mouth when they cough/sneeze.. or wash their hands after pooping. It‚Äôs just safer in my opinion."	0.781

What was the experience? Was it addictive or bad?	<p>I got a new phone in 2019 after using my 6s for I think the previous 2/3 years. The phone itself worked fine and only had a small scratch/crack but my battery was fucked. It&#39;d only last a very short time (maybe 30 minutes), sometimes it&#39;d die randomly with plenty of battery left, and then sometimes it&#39;d turn back on at 5% or die with low battery and turn on at full or almost full battery.</p>	0.794
Baking soda is a miracle worker that cleans everything from ovens to dishwashers. It can also clean your iron  Dampen a paper towel or rag with water or distilled white vinegar and dip a corner in baking soda or coarse salt. Baking soda is less likely to scratch your iron than coarse salt. Buff the soleplate clean. Wipe clean with a damp rag or paper towel.	Why?

You've been brainwashed by the same institution that invented the term psyops in the first place. Your "people that think like you" is telling. You have been manipulated by a fascism ruse named "othering." You have bought into the idea that critical thought and skepticism should be banned world wide, that only a select few have the right to ask questions, and you call me anti-science? You have it backwards.      I won't be staying home, I'll be living my life while there's still some left of it. We can all die at a moment's notice, no matter how "safe" we pretend to be, or how much of our lives we hand to war criminals, and it didn't stop with Bush, the drones still fly today.

> The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park, after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5‚Äì0, beat her 6‚Äì1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6‚Äì2.   He beat both Serena and Venus one after the other.

Got a bunch of emails from college coaches!	<p>Anyway he drops the acid in a club and it hits him really hard. He goes the toilet to pull himself together. When we asked him about this experience once he sobered up, he said he sat down on the toilet and heard a noise. He looked down and saw his intestines and stomach falling out. These toilets were not the best and poorly lit with a lot of neon like colours and deep red walls. He said in the moment he was just losing his mind and the sight of his intestines coming out and dropping into the toilet so he starts grabbing them and trying to push them back in. When he was telling the story it took me a minute to realise that obviously his intestines did not all of a sudden fall out and that he was basically just grabbing shit and trying to put it back because he was out of his mind.</p>	0.787

What I've been reading/hearing about recently is that the whole "conversation therapy" name is really abused here. Of course it sounds horrible because we associate it with therapy that tried to force gay people into not being gay etc. But apparently the issue here is that this ban extends to the idea that a therapist would question or simply not automatically accept or agree with a kid who claims they're trans. So for example if a little girl comes out as trans after 4 other girlfriends in school did the same (apparently this is a thing) and her reasoning is that she has "masculine" interests or some nonsense, a therapist can't talk to her through that and about that, ask questions, etc before assigning her to hormone blockers or treatments, let alone reach the conclusion that the issue is something else and work with her on it. Therapists are apparently supposed to non questioningly validate the opinion of their patient	As I'm from the UK we have free healthcare for all and private (paid) healthcare if you're rich and don't want to wait in line. I don't understand the American system for such a developed country except that it can only be driven by corporate greed.  It seems almost barbaric from my point of view.  We pay for it in taxes of course but that cost is spread.	0.806
