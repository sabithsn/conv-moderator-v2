Runaway inflation. Potential stablecoin regulation that would cause a mega crypto correction. Housing market correction of around 10%-15%. Massive insider trading by our corrupt policymakers and of course the skyrocketing heart complications in young ppl from the largest experimental mass vaccination campaign in history.	<p>Also maybe look into how we started building up so much national debt and why a huge chunk of it is student debt. Guess what, it&#39;s more lobbyists getting in the wallets of lawmakers so that they can turn an even more massive profit. While you&#39;re at it go ahead and add Healthcare, the auto industry, education, Mickey Mouse/Disney and their hand in copyright laws, mega churches, and pretty much every major flaw in this country and it pretty much boils down to lobbyists and corporations digging their claws into the government and never letting go.</p>	0.82

Happens at the hands of religious people, and always directed at atheists more than any other group.  Religion is the definition of ignorance and fantasy. Many parts of the world would  murder me in the streets for saying any of this, what fun an intelligent people the religious are. Plus they have the best hats.  Fun.	Republican and democrat biased news networks literally lie and omit facts on a daily basis in order to push their own agendas. While it's obvious to those of us on the outside looking in, so many americans are all too happy to believe anything they're told if it affirms their bias no matter how blatant and obvious the lie or the spin. Sadly, many are so warped that they will make excuses for the lies, and the people telling them, to convince themselves that the lie is true because they must be right no matter what. Others will stick their fingers in their ears and scream ""racist"" when confronted because they know their ideals crumble when faced with logic or simple criticism.	0.848

Lol. We come from our fathers balls so our father would have to have sex with another women to have us	<p>One time he cheated on me and I caught him. I was crying my eyes out and he was like, &quot;I think I&#39;m gonna go to my dads tonight. Can I just call you when I get there?&quot; He wasn&#39;t phased at all by what he did to me. Later he told me that if I ever cheated on him, he would kill me and the man I slept with. He said he&#39;d kill the guy first and make me watch so that I knew what was gonna happen to me. </p>	0.811

You've been brainwashed by the same institution that invented the term psyops in the first place. Your "people that think like you" is telling. You have been manipulated by a fascism ruse named "othering." You have bought into the idea that critical thought and skepticism should be banned world wide, that only a select few have the right to ask questions, and you call me anti-science? You have it backwards.      I won't be staying home, I'll be living my life while there's still some left of it. We can all die at a moment's notice, no matter how "safe" we pretend to be, or how much of our lives we hand to war criminals, and it didn't stop with Bush, the drones still fly today.	Nobody ever said a genocide was coming.  The analogy is about a corrupt power convincing the populous to hate a group of people based only on their beliefs.  That's it.  That's the analogy.  Dismissing hate like you just did is very concerning and reflective of the exact problem I'm talking about.	0.863

If aliens exist and I truly believe they do... they could be so advanced that even our greatest achievements could be worthless in their eyes, but would that mean that Humans don&#39;t exist now? Because to aliens they&#39;re doing nothing meaningful?</p>	0.808

Im very left wing, but i think some of the pronoun stuff is a bit ridiculous. Fair enough calling someone whos transgendered by their preferred gender pronouns, but it doesnt need to be such a prominent subject that you have to ask everyone their pronouns when you first meet them, or that its on every form you have to fill in, and if you arent transgender, and even if youre gender neutral, you should understand that when other people have to refer to you when talking to others, they are just going to use whatever seems obvious. The amount of over labelling is just stupid. Pronouns are just words that have no power over you other than what you give to them	Although I'd prefer ""Trans people"" instead of ""Transgenders"", that phrase is used a lot to demean (like ""the gays"")."	0.855

What was ruined because too many people started doing it? Well, how about this exact same question appearing on the front page of Reddit every fucking week for a start?	<p>Oh man let me talk a little more about Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring.  In the West, Occupy Wall Street seemed to fizzle.  It was the subject of a <em>massive</em> disinfo psyops game, back when that stuff was new.  It laid the foundation for what&#39;s happening now every election season.  We demanded change, and the people in power said, &quot;yeah, nah.  Whatcha gonna do about it?  Also we&#39;re gonna make sure that everyone on the fence thinks you&#39;re a joke.&quot;  That was the pivotal moment where we could have either got violent or went home, so we went home.</p>	0.801
