It's almost like too many people still worship Trump. Notice how Trump only exists in America as well as the extreme push against vaccines, and America has the most deaths despite starting in China.	People like to say its ""nazi"" esq, yet 10 million plus Uighurs are living, working and eating alongside everyone else. As conservatives love to say, follow the law and you won't be punished. If you do actions that might support or encourage a terrorist group, you will be punished regardless of your ethnicity as Han Chinese have been executed for similar crimes.  The alleged ""genocide"" I would clarify doesn't actually involve killing. Not even the far fetched sources report mass killings. On top of this the majority of law abiding Uighers are free and living normally in China among other Chinese, enjoying their benefits as they should.	0.812
Ewwww. . .I mean, I'd take a second glance at her leaked nudes, but date her? She got me fucked up. It's not socially acceptable to date someone with a significantly lower IQ than me.  That would be the equivalent of me taking the girl with down syndrome to prom for social credit. It's innocent on the outside, but really creepy if you peel back the layers.	Saying Rittenhouse shouldn't have the right to defend himself for being out after curfew at a riot is like saying a woman should lose her right to consensual sex if she dresses like a slut and gets absolutely wasted.	0.854
Isn’t it just common sense to buy stock in a company that you know is going to skyrocket? I hate everything about the vaccine mandates, and I believe that the vaccine is complete garbage, but I bought 100 shares of Pfizer as soon as I heard that they were going to be one of the top vaccines available…  I won’t put it in my arm, but I’ll put their money in my wallet.  Now if only I had listened to my buddy and bought those damn tesla shares at $369…	<p>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is also in part back door gun control, a la 2012 Obama DHS where they were buying billions of rounds of ammunition for the simple sake of starving availability on the market. DHS discretionary spending report for the year will not be released until after October, but who knows. Would be curious to study that when it comes out.</p>	0.861

How about we just all identify as vaccinated?   I mean if their side can identify as a purple spotted giraffe, and we have to accept it, then they can accept what we identify as!	Full vaccination? The CDC says themselves that those who are vaccinated can get and spread the virus. Ireally hope I do not have to provide proof on the CDC point, especially with the left being arbiters of science. They should know. It only helps to lessen the symptoms. So that is obviously not the plan. Also with consistent variants, we will have to consistently do boosters.	0.727
Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>However, enforcement was a tricky subject. Any time a politician said we need to prosecute unregistered firearms hard and start throwing the book at them you would get pushback because that would disproportionately affect the black community. Historically, the government has found various ways to try to discourage minorities from legally owning guns in a way that rural whites never fully experienced, so there is some grounding there.</p>	0.847
Defend her rights, sure. She a Marxist,  and by definition marxists are domestic enemies.  She should be on trial,  not in any position of power. I would not lift a fitness to stop her or anyone like her from being drug or off office and out into the street.  We're in thecurrent mess because we stopped McCarthyism and have been playing nice with degenerates and enemies of America for the better part of a century. It has to stop soon or the country is lost.	<p>Couldn’t agree more. Nobody had to lose their livelihoods over countless tirades against Trump. Criticizing those in power is a privilege we hold as Americans. It doesn’t matter who is in office. The people should always be able to voice their concerns. If not, then we just become another failed authoritarian state with no freedom. People who are deluded enough to attack others over differences of opinion threaten our freedom. They’re just doing the corrupt government’s job, shutting up dissenters and allowing them to function completely unchecked.</p>	0.864
Sorry for being impolite to traitors. No evidence of fraud, but I’m supposed to just trust this fishy gut feeling that trump supporters are getting. The proper avenue to challenge an election is to go to the courts , which they did and the courts sent them home. Conservative, trump appointed judges mind you. I have nothing against going to the courts. I do have a problem with Jan 6 and the fact that they’re still pushing this lie	<p>Reasonable people get taken in on scams all the time. Trump resonated with people for a reason, and arrogantly dismissing that to stroke your own ego just ensures the field remains ripe for a recurrence. Even if you don&#39;t think they&#39;re particularly reasonable, or even if you think they&#39;re particularly unreasonable, it doesn&#39;t hurt you to treat people with respect. If folks on both sides of the spectrum remembered that a little more often, it would go a long way towards innoculating America against a second January 6th. The way y&#39;all treat eachother, on both sides, is abysmal.</p>	0.867

Because the answers don't draw the results in observation and the vaccine implementation actually resulted in more deaths in testing. We also have the CDC tampering with data and the drug companies being made immune from prosecution. If vaccines work, why are there more deaths this year than last?	Didn't Biden run on the promise that he would end covid? But, DESPITE HAVING A VACCINE, there have been more covid deaths under Biden than Trump? How do you reconcile that?	0.878
You are not naturally vaccinated you goober. Having COVID and then catching it again is actually a marker for a bad reaction, not a lesser one.      &nbsp;   >But leftists deny the existence of natural immunity because they are anti-science and care more about the grift than the truth.  Your mind has been poisoned with lies. You don't have natural immunity and tons of people on HermanCainAwards were previously infected with COVID at the start of this nonsense, and then die when they catch it again. Your a fool.	When you lose the truth what's left? I'm very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn't work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren’t for masks. I know very few who haven't gotten vaccinated, but those who haven't still wear masks. They're irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.	0.909
The current Republicans are more likely to be supported by voters who don't know the history of the Civil War (hint:  the Southern states seceded over wanting to continue slavery).  Dixie flag and all that.    More concerning is why any elected official, of any party, would think it acceptable to proclaim registered American citizens not be allowed to vote because of what state they lived in previously?  That's the part to focus on  because it's unAmerican.	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.861

If less ppl die when they’re vaccinated as opposed to those that aren’t. Even trump said “ the vaccine works, those that are dying are mostly unvaccinated” like I just don’t get it lol u think because covid hasn’t magically disappeared then the vaccine doesn’t work? It was never a cure it’s just armor to white off being killed or hospitalized and it doesn’t stop spread which we always knew. Who told y’all this vaccine should magically stop all covid and spread of it or it doesn’t work	<p>The way I see it, everyone has had the opportunity to get the vaccine or not get it. If you have it, you’re protected. It’s not 100% but you’re probably more likely to die of a lightning strike than die of a breakthrough case. So once you’re vaccinated, the vaccination status of those around you is irrelevant. If they want to not get it, that’s their right and it won’t affect you in any way. If they get sick and die, that’s their problem, not yours. </p>	0.903

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?  Since 2018 there has been 92 school shootings in the USA, that number would likely be higher too if a lot of learning wasn’t done remote due to covid.  We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children	<p>Even though there are 15,000 firearm murders per year in the u.s., they need the panic and fear of mass shootings to convince the public that violating the constitution is ok.

Uh no — liberal peruser here and me and all of my liberal friendie friends want shit to be back to normal. I am annoyed as f*ck that I am still dealing with this BS after almost 2 years.   And it’s not the government faking shit. People are still being hospitalized and dying — but, strangely, it’s the weirdos who refuse vaccines! They’re the ones dying!   If you guys were actually conservative... drawing on the root meaning of the word... you would be risk averse and recognize that your chance of vaccine issues is minuscule in comparison to the aggregate affect of non-vaccinated people filling the hospitals, necessitating further mandate, etc.     [If I’m removed from this sub, it’s clear evidence that conservatives actually love censorship, when it’s convenient. Especially because here I’m actually advocating a conservative, risk-averse position... and one I share with ALL of my conservative family members.]	Deaths have been on a decline for a long time now, and whether that's from the vaccines or from less virulent strains of the virus, facts are facts and this pandemic has been winding down for quite a while.

You're right in pointing this out. It is, however, the least bad choice in a situation of many bad choices. We accept that their ballots will be inherently less secure because we think the people who have volunteered to fight in our military should not be disenfranchised.

This seems like an overwhelmingly positive change. Why wouldn’t we want insurance companies to better be able to assess situations? This will allow police to more concretely arrest the right people. Many people choose to have this happen in their card already because it’s incredibly useful information to have. Would love to see this become standard in American models too (and that wouldn’t have to happen with a law mandating it)	<p>That was what solidified my views on immigration. We should be generous but firm. If you want to come here and work, great - there&#39;s nothing more American than having a dream and working for it. But if you want to bring cartel crap or cause other trouble here, GTFO. (And, yes, I did know more than a couple people who were a little too close to the cartels for my liking.)

I'm naturally vaccinated, had it last year.  But leftists deny the existence of natural immunity because they are anti-science and care more about the grift than the truth.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn’t work, I also think it’s ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don’t get vaxed. I don’t think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn’t there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.861
That's because you were not giving a vaccination you were given a shot that alters the blood in your body and the way your DNA reacts to everything not just covid.

Forcing someone to take shots is unethical, but I guess you’re ignoring the medical ethics courses they taught.

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	<p>Israeli breakthrough has also substantially changed especially when they actually study the population as a hole and not just healthcare workers.  Jerusalems hospital had a caseload of 72 patients - not a lot, but 72 hospitalization 85% of them were vaccinated and they have continued to see this trend.  4 days ago - of all the severe cases in Israel 324 total, 209 were fully vaccinated. So you are telling me they are not the ones spreading it - but are the cohort that is getting the worst symptoms at this time. The situation is fluid, just like this virus - which is why the statistics, Israel&#39;s game plan, and CDC changes its mind with the wind. Months ago they said Pfizer dropped transmission rate by 90% last week the CDC said it&#39;s as likely to spread and is showing the same viral load. The data is incomplete, its fluid,  and it&#39;s that simple. Cognitive dissonance is a thing whether you consider what I said to be a concise zinger or not.</p>	0.863

That didn’t happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies.

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	<p>Notice how many vaccines require 3, 4, or 5 shots to work. The tetanus vaccine requires a booster every 10 years. The flu requires a new vaccine every year because it mutates, Covid unfortunately mutates too. Trust me, I’m far from happy that the Covid vaccine requires a booster so soon, and I’m a bit suspicious that that was just Pfizer trying to milk some more money out of us. I’m also wondering if they’ll turn it into a yearly thing.</p>	0.845

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.  Nuance breaks this sloppy meme into the shit that it is	In light of current narrative that the jab has basically no side effects (at least that are allowed to be talked about lest it lead to ""vaccine hesitancy""), It's hilarious to watch drug commercials and their inevitable list of horrific side effects that often include death and several other things much worse then the thing they purport to help symptoms of.	0.907

Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government.

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	Regan signed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act and shifted all the  responsibilities of taking care of homelessness and mental illness away from the government because his wife Nancy thought good people and corporations would foot the bill for taking care of other people.

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.	0.895

I will say, none of these were dismissed as conspiracy theories outright by people who actually understand the virus and vaccines. All of the doctors I saw on major media outlets when asked responded with either "we don't know" or "the data doesn't suggest that". Thats how scientist approach any subject. In fact, stating any of these points, or even their counter point as 100% certainty is irresponsible and without nuance. It is rare that anything is ever 100%	<p>The vast majority of people I talk to (like 90%+) have no strong feelings about vaccine mandates (public or private) despite the fact there is no significant externality that exists. They cannot explain how an unvaccinated person poses a significant risk to a vaccinated person yet they are totally ok with vaccine mandates. Logical contradictions are all over the place and most people don&#39;t notice or care, I find it really hard to describe the average person in that case as &quot;reasonable&quot;.

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	<p>A virus is messier because 99.9% of the time people who pass the virus on to someone else are never going to realize they did so. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that refusing vaccines to a virus causing a global pandemic is putting everyone you come in contacts with health at an increased risk. And by now there are almost certainly some immunocpmpromised people, or kids, or just people who just did not have a strong reaction to their vaccine, who have literally died after contracting the virus from some selfish,self-righteous asshat who valued his freedom to be an idiot over the common good.</p>	0.893

The initial claim is that mRNA would totally stop the virus and people who get the shot can’t get or transmit the virus. And no booster would be necessary. And mandates aren’t practical. Practically everything about the virus by the people being paid by Pfizer has been misinformation so far. I’m just asking questions. Made no scientific claims unlike the people who “claim” they know. I ask things like, do heathy kids need this? But the burden of proof is on the people asking questions without long term studies. Fuck off troll.	<p>By you&#39;re own logic, nobody should listen to you anyways, you&#39;re not a doctor. My own doctor told me not to get the vaccine, because I have natural immunity. It&#39;s fairly common for other doctors to give the same advice. But they all must be &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; huh? You know better than them.</p>	0.885
It's so crazy how science and common sense works!	Into an argument about how the scientific method does not allow for much opinion in peer reviewed results is kind of impressive in a horrific way.	0.744
Everyone Omar is ISIS with lips! She’s a joke and in the end she has no power. Everyone is waking up to realizing Islam is a joke! I’ve read the whole Koran and it’s a laughable hilarity of contradiction lol and if we are arguing who holds the ownership of where the Dome sits? It’s not even close. The Jews have had that land for thousands of years before Islam was even an idea…the whole religion is a joke…why is Jesus’s name mentioned more than Mohammed in the Koran? Exactly 25 times when Mohammed’s name is only mentioned 4 times…why is the only woman named in the Koran Mary the mother of Jesus….reading it makes it clear that plagiarism and hypocrisy were the motivations of the writers of the Koran…Mohamed couldn’t even read or write for crying out loud…give it time, Omar will be a cold fart in the wind	<p>The Trinity is a completely man made idea that is nowhere in the Bible. To act like it somehow is gospel because the Nicaean Council deemed it so it silly. It isn&#39;t an idea that showed up until over 150 years after Jesus&#39; death.</p>	0.799
