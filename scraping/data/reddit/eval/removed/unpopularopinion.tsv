Sounds like your just not into work.	Because that's not their job.	0.882
I bet you're an unmarried man. Men generally start complaining about this in their 30s and 40s unless they have wives who take on the entire mental burden of planning their social/vacation lives (a task which men rarely appreciate, nor thank their wives for). So my unasked for advice which you will never take is that you must start doing the social planning for yourself. Throw parties, ask people out to plays and movies, ask people to accompany you for dinner and coffee. Planning social time, you would soon see, is real work. Yet if you neglect it, as surely as your body turns to shit from not exercising, your spirit turns to shit from not socializing. My lived in 2 cents.	My experience is a little different to OP because I have only been with 2 women. My whole kink is getting them off so I also put in the work to make sure they get theirs but my wife&#39;s work friends have all made the statement (to my wife whom later told me) about their sex lives not being as fulfilling because their male partners rarely get them off. In my opinion I agree with OP that the issue would be a lot of laziness on mens side to put in work for their partners pleasure.</p>	0.857

No fkin way your 25!!  And if your this fkin lazy you have to still be living at home.  No one turns down and easy paycheck when they have bills to pay!    I'm guessing your maybe 15 or 16.	<p>If you live in a tiny apartment and work all day, you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to own a dog.</p>	0.784

Not all pedophiles are child rapists and not all child rapists are pedophiles. Pedophilia harms no one, child rape does.	<p>Let‚Äôs be honest. ‚ÄúCancelling‚Äù and accusations do next to nothing even when they‚Äôre real (and false ones are extremely rare‚Äîyou‚Äôre more likely to be rightfully accused and think it was false than to be falsely accused). Fewer than 1% of rape cases end in conviction. And most false accusations aren‚Äôt actually false‚Äîthe majority of rapists and assaulters, even those convicted, genuinely believe the situation was consensual, and it‚Äôs extremely rare to have evidence to prove otherwise.</p>	0.829

The science being by a guy who made two brothers fuck one another and then one of them Killed themselves. Literally nazi level shit glad 3% of the population thinks it‚Äôs okay to be like that.	How about I take the tiny sample of male employees that killed others at their workplaces and use that as why men are, objectively, horrible and dangerous to work with. I'll even throw in how workplace accidents are more common under men due to neglectful and impulsive behaviors. Drug use and DUIs on the job too. The list goes on. But I'm sure those facts will generate an ocean of Ys screaming about ""unfair generalizations about men"".	0.809
I plan on taking out student loans, and then I want the government to forgive my debt. Too easy.	when you go to college and fill out the FAFSA. If you're poor enough you get a refund. It's federal loans on top of whatever scholarships the school may have given you."	0.781
Science is supposed to be challenged, questioned,¬†tested, and scrutinized. ... If that is not permissible and basic lines of enquiry are censored or taboo, then it's not science, but secular dogma	Questioning science is important and it's vital we think critically about things, but that's not what most of these people are doing. Implying they are undertaking an honest examination of their own understanding of things through constructive, evidence-based discourse is disingenuous."	0.833

I love how you bring up slavery as if it‚Äôs only limited to just the two places and not a thing that has been around in every human culture. Countries that reform for the better are great but regressing into degeneracy isn‚Äôt get the idea? Ik you twisted fucks are into that but damn.	One thing that I do find weird however is that, even when we are rooting for Americans, they get oddly defensive about it. Of course i'd rather see them get better healthcare, better workers rights, better social security, etc... Im not here to laught at you because im better off, im here because i wish you all had it as good as us. But when we start talking about this stuff a large majority like to pretend that no healthcare is better for x, y, z reasons, that capitalism pushed to it's limit is the best thing in the world, that workers rights are for dirty commies and whatnot. Honestly it just makes me sad. I want to see them thrive, not read horror stories upon horror stories about things that could be easily prevented"	0.838

Yeah and before money they actually got damn help not people feeding them making things worse for society.	Honestly, we're at a point (and have been for some time) where ANY voice that gets through is a good thing. The people who can't look past her disorder or school attendance were never going to get the message anyway - they are not the target audience of this message. They're too dumb to process it. But little do they realise that they've inadvertantly carried the message to those who are."	0.824
I agree to a degree, but here is a counter point/ question. How many lives does it have to affect before we're allowed to care about it?	But the real question is, if money were freed up from these costs and given back to the people would their spending change. And theres no good way of proving that. I think if it was different to begin with, we might spend differently. But I think that if you give people or free up more disposable income they aren't used to suddenly, they will just spend it like you said."	0.768
I posted something ages ago about some racists getting jailed for being racists... had two solid weeks of people "referring" me to reddit suicide support services  The private messages were an eye-opening experience	I was in a very abusive relationship for 6 years. I have an ex that still text me with her problems and throws the past in my face. The past I'm in therapy for right now. She hit me, cut me, threatened me with suicide, sent me photos of her cutting, wrecked her car into mine. So trust me I feel you. It was 6 years of it that sent me into psychosis. I'm not going to lie and say my illness didn't make me toxic because yes I became very toxic.	0.828
Affirmation hasn‚Äôt proved the sort considering that those that do transition have shown to regret the choice and commit suicide at higher rate then any other group of people on this planet. If the best treatment is to push them to suicide congrats your doing it.	Except it doesn't. People are still dying and if we see those deaths start to increase again, especially returning to levels they were at previous peaks, it is absolutely justified to return to previous restrictions. That's an incredibly stupid thing to say and using all the fancy words you want doesn't make it less stupid	0.852

Yeah well 3 years ago you said ‚Äúf*** your mom‚Äù so therefore your argument is invalid	<p>You talk like you are your mom, and you brought the adhd into this when I was using it as a way of saying your ‚ÄúOver Reacting‚Äù to people who Clearly don‚Äôt understand what it is, I never claimed to understand adhd, I said I understand people not understanding medical conditions.

weekly reminder week 2: a lot of people have gone through and disputed that defense, and using buzzwords as a disclaimer for self defense makes you no better than someone who screams during a debate.  here is just one example.  "Hello! Looking at your sources, I can identify a few potential universal flaws within your studies. This is a general summary, so feel free to point out any studies of yours that contradict or don‚Äôt contain these flaws.   1. Explicit pro-trans biases -   A significant portion of your studies rely on, are supported by, or influenced by explicitly pro-trans organizations - creating a distinct conflict of interest, such as this one . I‚Äôm sure that it‚Äôs just a coincidence that studies with significant influence by pro-trans activist groups end up with the results that are most favorable towards trans people/ exactly the results that line up with the activist groups‚Äô beliefs.   1. As for Flaws within the studies themselves, found within most of not all of your linked studies that I‚Äôve looked at: Selection bias  The main method of finding subjects in most of your linked studies is finding and using openly trans people, often by using pro-lgbt forums or with the help of the aforementioned organizations.   This creates a problem - if someone is openly trans or active in mainstream lgbt forums, then there‚Äôs a significantly higher chance that person will be pro-trans. However, is someone has detransitioned or regretted transitioning, he or she will likely no longer identify as trans. Thus, only interviewing openly trans people may lead to a disproportionate number of people supporting pro-trans claims. Have your studies attempted to account for this?   It‚Äôs also worth noting that the main, if not only, way that your studies find results is by interviewing trans people themselves - and no one else.   Surveying only trans people themselves may not get a complete picture of their lives. For example, a depressed person may say ‚Äúfine‚Äù when asked how he‚Äôs doing, but his parents are concerned and share a different story. Someone with narcissistic personality disorder may not think he has a problem, but looking from other perspectives may say something different.   To help show how this may be flawed, substitute trans people for pedophilia: say a study was conducted with the help of a pro-pedophile organization, that went to a pro-pedophile forum and interviewed pedophiles there. They found that the vast majority of pedophiles said they would feel happier if pedophilia was normalized.   Would you trust this study? Is it trustworthy? Would it paint an accurate picture of the pedophilia issue?   confirmation bias  Summed up a bit by my first concern - pro-trans organizations and groups experiencing confirmation bias when conducting these studies. Like I‚Äôve said above, it sure is a coincidence that the results of these studies are exactly the results that the groups doing them want.   1. None of your studies address the idea of ‚Äúgender‚Äù or why it‚Äôs a legitimate scientific concept - they only address sex.  Assuming what you‚Äôve said about sex is true - that doesn‚Äôt mean you can just change your sex or that a biological man can become a woman.   I hope this helps!"
