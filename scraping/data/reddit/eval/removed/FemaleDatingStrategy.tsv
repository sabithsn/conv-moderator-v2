That takes the cake! NYE first time date?GTFOH that only happens in cheesy rom com movies lol. These new OLD dudes be getting lamer and lamer, trying to mack hard without running coins (because we all know there are hella "free" events to do on NYE).	We don't even have time to let them exploit our vulnerabilities! Because we laugh at their face at the idea of drink dates so fast haha  May FDS continue to bless more women and cast the light on pickmeishas for forever to come. I used to be pickme too, and I'm so grateful to be here.	0.804
Omg this is giving me flashbacks to age 22. Good for this girl! I wish I‚Äôd had the guts to stick up for myself at her age.   Back then I was with my ex that would rest his head on my stomach while fingering me, acting like he was bored so I‚Äôd say forget it. 4+ years together and he made me cum less than 10 times lol. The same guy also couldn‚Äôt understand how not all women cum from penetrative sex‚Ä¶ he said to me ‚Äúit worked for all my ex‚Äôs, so I‚Äôm not the problem‚Äù üò≠üò©üò§	Yeah it‚Äôs more like monkey branching, I knew of a guy who was separated from his wife for 15(!) years - don‚Äôt know how many girls he got with that ‚Äòseparation‚Äô clause, he got his divorce finalized after meeting me- but I kind of lost my respect for him with the idea of only finalizing divorce when you get another person to hop on right away. A good example I saw ( but in a series, Good Girls Revolt), that the HVM hubby gets attracted to another girl, also the lifestyle he was leading was frustrating his wife, he does not say anything to that girl he is attracted to, but he goes to his wife and mentions he would like to get a divorce , it clearly shows he identified their marriage was not working for them anymore, he would like to close this chapter and only then bring forward a new commitment. It clearly showed how respectful he was to himself, his choices and also to the people who are and will be in his life.	0.874
As an Israeli-American woman, I'm torn tbh. If he owes the money, he should pay up. As would the woman were she the higher earner. But to bar him from ever leaving the country? Seems extreme unless some major details have been left out from mainstream press.	Oh yeah, 100%! We should have higher standards than the bare minimum I outlined, it‚Äôs just that they can‚Äôt even meet the bare minimum hence why we need to employ so many vetting strategies. It‚Äôs absolute BS. If they just stopped being so selfish, they would even have nice lives and relationships. Instead, they would rather use and abuse women, suffer shallow lives and then blame women for it. It‚Äôs insane. And so sad.	0.787
Eww he probably does. I know a couple like that actually. The dude pays attention to everything she eats, how fast or slow she eats, and if she finishes her plate or not. He is obsessed with her losing weight.. and yea maybe she could, but he goes about it all wrong and isn't supportive.  Anyway.... the couple in the post just sound so bizarre..	In the time he took to type all that he could literally have looked up a restaurant and called to make dinner reservations.  They're doubling down on this nonsense out of pure stubbornness because it's actually taking *more* effort for him to be a cheap scrote than to just... plan a date.   Imagine taking all that time to match with a woman then spend all your energy arguing with her why she's not worth a proper date. Way to cockblock yourself, my dude, but you do you, I guess.	0.83
