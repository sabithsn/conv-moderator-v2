Would you mind perusing my conflict with the highly downvoted feminist who replied to me? You do not have to weigh in at all, I’m just hitting a rock wall, and would like to know if I’m crazy. Well, about this topic lol.  I totally understand it’s a lot of reading, so if you don’t want to it don’t have time, I completely understand. But if you wouldn’t mind, could you just tell me if I’m completely unreasonable?	<p>But like it&#39;s seems to be a unrealeastic to assume that feminism can resolve every issue, Like thats why we can alternate between different thoughts and beliefs. This is why I don&#39;t really go major Ham at Feminists generally although FUCK ME TERFS i fucking crinnnnnnnnge, but even then there is still utility from feminist thought and discussions which I assume you would agree with as well. </p>	0.853
OK, let's be frank: men - not women - are the "weaker sex". They have subjected women which has taken a toll on their psyche - and women are not to blame for it ....	<p>Women have a right to be scared of men. And men have a right to be scared of women. Women just don&#39;t get so uptight about it. I think the fact that the subreddit &#39;feminism&#39; has less members than this one shows its not as big a problem as you think.</p>	0.889
Come on what? I am simply stating things as they are, nothing more and nothing less. Men typically operate with logic, women normally operate with their emotions.	It takes some stoicism to be able to calmly say ""i am angry"", instead of screaming it.  But it is absolutely a standard men and women alike should absolutely be held to.	0.781
I feel like you dont know what a simp is and that you have a hostility towards the word "feel" because you are a loser who would take issue with someone saying "I feel".	despise. Mimicking the worst of your opposition's shitty behavior is an incredibly poor strategy to win friends and influence.	0.896
Hyper dramatic bulshit. Lots of men are circumcised and have no issues with sensation whatsoever. Get a motherfuking life.	> infinite amount of films and shows where the men are always the heroes and the strong stoic good guys that define masculinity. They don’t need to show emotion, can sexually harass people and must look a certain way.	0.819
