Wild animals shoot at police and get shot?	People kill people. People shoot people. People hurt people. People harm kids. Shutdowns harm people the same way guns do.	0.746

you retarded monkeys really thought she went to Florida to "escape Florida" and not because Florida has beautiful weather in the winter. i mean shit, almost every new yorker who can, goes south during winter break. she's not escaping covid, she's enjoying some Florida weather on the beach. this is such a reach.	I don't know, seems like a stretch. The tweet specifically calls her out for being hypocritical of "masks and mandates." Maskless outdoor dining with your significant other is allowed pretty much everywhere as far as I know.  I think there's room to be critical of Florida's covid mandates and also believe that you won't literally drop dead the second you cross into the state.  If she was in some crowded night club taking advantage of the no mandates that would be one thing, this just seems like forced outrage over a total non issue.	0.74
Asexuals are more authcenter to authleft. Plans to invade Denmark to create a asexual nation that will redistribute the garlic bread and cake.	Actually they would just grab him by the shoulders and guide him back into the crowd. Knocking people over seems like a very Monarchy thing to do. If it was a kid they DEFINITELY would mot knock him over, the whole point of going on campaign is to kiss babies and look good.	0.686
**Damn fucking right.**  I love your comment, because it’s so true.  That’s all racism is; Seeing patterns. Sure, there absolutely are people out there who literally just hate people for how they look no matter what, but ”racism” being bad is just something horrible groups of people came up with so they could keep being horrible while shaming anyone who pointed it out.  Black being more violent and savage than other races? RACIST, aka truth.  Asians being generally smarter and more hardworking than other races? RACIST, aka truth...  If ”certain groups” wanted to stop being ”opressed”, then all they’d have to do is prove the stereotype wrong... That’s the problem though, since they cannot do that...	Ah yes the people that call out racism are the real bad people. Not the people who instantly hate others and call them names when you know nothing about them	0.884

We only blame you for not killing them all.	I mean neither have you. Aside from needing to be told what to think.  My point  Einstein  Is that the only reason to require Gladius are people here are too stupid to know what to think. You need to see my auth right flair to know what to say to me.  I'm not agitated. I'm advocating for the end to a policy that only makes every one here dumber.	0.801
Go to the subreddit home page, press the 3 dots in the upper right corner, press "Change User Flair" and select a flair based on which one looks coolest.  Or I guess you can choose one based on your political beliefs if you are a beta male soy cuck [removed] lover	Everybody fits in somewhere.   You take a political compass test and determine what quadrant you're in. politicalcompass.org is the standard but is kinda sucky, I prefer the SapplyValues one.   Then you go to PCM homepage, hit the 3 dots in the upper right, "change user flair", select your quadrant, hit apply, & you're done. No longer unfl*ired.	0.819
Well most subs are (opinion) and [opinion] and then [removed]	No, I think most people have moved on to the, "TikTok *very* bad" stage.	0.795
CPC has 90 million officials that represent every workplace in every industry- kinda like one big union. How is that not more democratic than the US where people with Cancer and can't afford their healthcare	*yawn* Show me where to pick up the check.   I **am** passionate about healthcare. And why shouldn't I be? We spend literally hundreds of thousands of dollars more per person for a lifetime of healthcare, while large percentages go without needed care or suffer from the costs, while receiving worse care than our peers. I've seen it have a horrible impact on far too many people I care about. For example my girlfriend, who has over $100,000 in medical debt from her son getting leukemia, after what her "good" insurance covered.   >You’re very clearly a paid shill.  I'm not, but you're clearly the kind of person that feels the need to waste everybody's time continuing to run your mouth even when you have absolutely nothing of value to add to the conversation. All you're capable of is regurgitating propaganda you can't support and attacking others.   Fuck off.	0.801
The whole the right wing trap internet fallacy is a lie and a fetish pushed by actual sodomites that wish it was the case. When there is overwhelmingly more of them in every other political alignment.	Articles like that make me think a oligarchy are trying to cause the U.S to fall into misery and violence. Then I remember every fucking retard with a website can post articles and then I think capitalism mixed with journalism is a huge mistake. I'm so confused....	0.869
I support femboys because they make themselves easy targets for bullying and also shooting	I love this subreddit. I love moderating and I want to help moderate and help out any way I can to be sure I can help keep this place a great place for memes.	0.796
