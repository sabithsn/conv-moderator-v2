I don‚Äôt take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being ‚Äúretarded‚Äù ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I‚Äôm proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity. I do wish you the best in life.	You should always take an active role in your child's education. It's some of the most important shit growing up but everyone treated it as 'their little break from their kids' for so long we weren't considering the damage it could do. I'm hoping that we can really get to the bottom of our shit school system as a whole with this divide but I digress.	0.526

It‚Äôs difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense. If you actually have a shit about children and their welfare you‚Äôd look beyond trying to control what an individual does in response to an unwanted pregnancy.	What you are taking about is using abortion as birth control. I am against that part. I can not morally and ethically object to someone getting an abortion because of medical reasons or if it was a rape.

Careful the 2 braincells in your skull almost ran into each other for a moment there.  You clearly don't understand the most basic principles of freedom and rights.  If I trespass in your house I lose a lot of protections, freedoms,, and rights because again, it's your house.

Why do you think parents should have the right to harm kids?  You're clearly a few seconds away from being pro-abortion at this point.  You're absolutely NOT a conservative.	<p>As for the political side of this, if you&#39;re going to argue that conservatives are working against the rights of businesses then you haven&#39;t been watching the news. Ron DeSantis is pushing laws that don&#39;t allow private companies to require vaccines while getting widespread conservative support.

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	<p>My main point was to the dude saying Covid is only the sniffles. My hospital has 550 rooms and the census was 607 the other day and it&#39;s all Covid patients. I dont think the sniffles would cause that. Again, fuck mandates, and fuck government encroachment, but let&#39;s not pretend this thing is totally benign because it isn&#39;t.

It‚Äôs meaning has changed considerably over time.  Now it‚Äôs just a flag of the south.  Something something southern heritage and defiance.  From the people I‚Äôve asked it has nothing to do with being pro confederacy and everything to do with being pro south.

I work with people from central and south America.. Tell you right now. They aren't stealing jobs anyone wants. They're doing the jobs no one will do..   Some of the toughest, kindest family oriented people.  One woman legally got into the United States left her children in Honduras and for the next 8 years saved every fucking penny she could raising 60k and getting her children into the states just so they could work in motels cleaning up after people that have no respect, accuse them of being illegal.   I've been listening to my grandfather rant about dems and libs trying to take away our guns and Mexicans coming into America illegally, raping and stealing our jobs. No one has taken anyone's guns.. Ever.   What jobs? Not high paying jobs.. Maybe doing roofing, painting and landscaping.. Busting they're asses to make sure Americans are comfortable.   Trump... Is a criminal that has admitted multiple times he wants to fuck his daughter, he lies, he belittles everyone, he doesn't pay his taxes, he's stuck up... Does that man look like someone who's bled red for his country... This is the mother fucker who built a casino called it the Taj Mahal Trump and went bankrupt his daddy had to bail him out. He has terrible ideas when it comes to investment. Remember this.. He's doesn't give a fuck about anyone. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE A BUSINESS TRANSACTION... HE LIKES YOUR FUCKING MONEY.   Wake up.

The "60 years" was referring back to the late 1950's. Not the war that ended up, also, ending slavery.  "girl" .... if used in the friendly "how are you my gay pal" kinda way, sure. Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb üòÅüòÅüòÅ  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am üòà Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.

It is going into a few pockets mainly. This is the problem with how our system works. We permit companies to bid on projects and then the government selects a winner and pays them the agreed contract rate. We end up with companies charging millions of dollars to do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work, and then, we run out of money before we can possibly maintain everything properly.	And because a system such as this incentivizes the employees of the target project to request more funds the longer the project goes on, ie: road construction or climate panels or welfare, generally the initial costs estimated are a small fraction of what the entire project ended up costing, whether or not it met its intended goals.	0.51

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	<p>Now let me address you second argument. Yes, doctors and nurses have been tackling covid-19 for over a year now with a vaccine and have gotten by. They didn‚Äôt have a choice. Whether for better or worse, they were forced to treat patients  infected with a deadly virus, risking bringing it home with them or spreading it to others in public (becuase PPE‚Äôs are not 100% perfect). Now that they have the option to take the vaccine, they have the opportunity to continue delivering patient care in a manner that is SAFER for themselves, their family, other non-covid-19 patients they also see in the hospital. Not taking the vaccine presents an inherent risk to spreading the virus to other people that might not be able to get fully vaccinated or cannot reap the benefits of the vaccine (immunocompromised, cofactors with lung health, age). So with doctors and nurses who are refusing to get the vaccine, not only are they refuting the very science they spent years studying, but they are now also putting others at risk. That is a direct conflict with their responsibilities as health care providers. If you can avoid putting other people at risk but you choose not to for personal reasons, goodbye. Go find another hospital to work at.</p>	0.651

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor. That&#39;s why the left can so easily spin the narrative that they do, by not out right fully lying (as they normally do) but by omitting some information.</p>	0.635

The Civil war was started by angry democrats who were scared of a Republican President-Elect. The civil war was won by a republican president. The only president of the confederacy was a Democrat. How the **fuck** can you be this negligent	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor. That&#39;s why the left can so easily spin the narrative that they do, by not out right fully lying (as they normally do) but by omitting some information.</p>	0.62

You seem like you would fit well in my new sub r/ComplexPeople. I hope plugging subreddits are allowed in this sub‚Ä¶   Anyway, I noticed that you may be conservative leaning since you lurk on this sub, yet aren‚Äôt afraid to question the legitimacy of particular things. Not everyone has to agree with everything a political affiliation just says, and it is very important for us to freely state opinions or ask questions regarding particular worldly topics.  r/ComplexPeople promotes the idea that people are complex and are able to share viewpoints from multiple political parties. It promotes free thought and respectful debate or discussion between those who may agree with you and those who do not. Being condescending is not allowed, and members must conduct themselves professionally. The sub is aimed to help rational minded people effectively learn of each others viewpoints and live harmoniously regardless if viewpoints are opposed. If you‚Äôre interested in these sentiments, I would love for you to join to help make Reddit and this world a better place!  PS: I apologize for the shameless copy and pasting. I just really do think this new sub can be beneficial for the reddit community.	<p>I have really not been impressed by the divisive and derisive language toward non-liberal views on a vast majority of subreddits and websites. There&#39;s a huge lack of informed discourse on topics, and a lot of emotional bullying.</p>	0.594

I mean every single person I have ever seen in my entire life wave a Confederate flag was a Conservative. I have never even once seen a Liberal waving a Confederate flag and I've seen a lot of Confederate flags. How do you explain that? Unless you're claiming that the Confederacy wasn't the pro-slavery side, which would be pretty ridiculous.	The confederate flag isn‚Äôt flown as a signal to the original intent of the flag.  It‚Äôs meaning has changed considerably over time.  Now it‚Äôs just a flag of the south.  Something something southern heritage and defiance.  From the people I‚Äôve asked it has nothing to do with being pro confederacy and everything to do with being pro south.

I don't make money from the vaccine in any capacity. My concern about this is a pharmacist for my patients and my pay doesn't go up or down a single cent with sales from medication.  It's honestly insulting that you think my concern for people suffering from the vaccine is from monetary gain and not from genuine concern.	So in shirt of an ultimately way too long response, you should get the vaccine regardless of whether or not you have ""natural immunity"". (Un/)forunately, the freedoms granted to us by this country allow the individual to decide. Now are there restrictions, well yes, but ultimately if you don't want the vaccine, no one is putting a gun to your head like *other* countries. However, the free market also dictates that companies are allowed to require you to have the vaccine as a term of employment (for the reasons above, but mostly due to cost and liability). As a result, the market *has* dictated that requiring the vaccine is the best financial move. If you don't agree with that, you're more than welcome to form a competitor.	0.693

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).    But we're not allowed.  It's either or.  Those who have the time to adhere to ideologically pure positions (ie the unemployable or young) will dominate the discourse without wisdom to intervene and put its foot down and say to each side "you're wrong on this but right on this" and the "you're right on this but wrong on this".	<p>The second is the vaccine itself. It is under emergency distribution authorization and has yet to have final approval from the FDA. Some people want to see what the long term effects, if any, there are from anything they take. These people are not anti vax, but get labeled as such just because they&#39;re even the slightest bit skeptical about something that was rushed. Likely, it&#39;ll be fine, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to wait until the final authorization. Especially if the government wants to mandate it.</p>	0.706

Something that has bothered me since becoming a parent is this:  Gotta watch everything you but on the baby from sunscreen to fabrics because they're system is so new and sensitive they could have reactions. Same with medicine. There are stuff like all natural drops and Tylenol that isn't recommended until so many months in.  But, let me shot em up 32 (I can't remember the actual number but I'm probably not far off) times in their first year with a chemical cocktail.  All my kids are fully immunized but I just think it's odd the level of inconsistency. Couldn't we wait a bit? Maybe a year or two? We already have herd immunity and likelihood of infection at their age is so low.  I dunno, it just smells like a dock in here.	<li><p>Children need to be exposed to germs and common  illnesses around them to help build up their immune systems.

First of all, it was the Capitol they bombed, not the White House ( I know, facts are hard). But what i am really curious about is since that group was rightly labeled a terrorist group for that bombing, then I assume you agree with calling Jan 6th rioters terrorists as well, right?	<p>According to <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/doj-capitol-rioters-charges-debate/2021/01/23/3b0cf112-5d97-11eb-8bcf-3877871c819d_story.html"">this article</a> an estimated 800 people stormed the Capitol on Jan 6. Those are rioters, and that is a riot. A riot is defined as &quot; a violent disturbance of the peace by a crowd. &quot; I&#39;d say that the murder of a police officer constitutes violent, 800 folks constitutes a crowd, and as you said, there was a &quot;peaceful protest&quot; that was marred by these rioters.

You DO realize that eventually that will be the only option left,  don't you?

Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible. The call is coming from inside the house. The saboteur is American.	<p>This is the space democrats have occupied since the late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s. Anyone who disagreed with them about anything was a racist. And they did it because as a tactic, it worked.

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...

Yes, and it was accurate at the time, with the original covid strain. You can blame anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers for the fact that they do not work as well against the newer variants, because they gave the virus a breeding ground to mutate in.	You say that, but is it really the case? Of the data that I have seen presented to me over the past months since the ""vaccine was released, I have been shown absolutely no evidence from credible sources that the ""vaccine"" does *anything* to prevent Covid from infecting a host, decreasing the duration or severity of the infection, and decreasing the spread of the virus.	0.564

So what I don't understand is why is it always the males thinking they are women and compete against real women yet you don't (or rarely) see it the other way around?	<p>Case in point. You argue that men have always competed against men. If you switch from sport to acting you see a completely different dichotomy. In ancient Greece women were forbidden from acting and only males could play the role of women?  This continued throughout Europe during Elizabethan times. There was no competition. You can argue that a man can act as a female better than a female acting as a female.  But he could never act as an XY because he would fail the basic test required to pass in the first place.</p>	0.623
He will never bring it. He doesn't even bring it to his SO. That's his SO's boyfriend's job.

It's like that spoiled little brat at the playground who goes around bullying others because his 3 year older brother is there with him. The second the brother stops going, he's getting a long awaited whooping.	What he ignores is the threat he may possess to others. At this point, he is basically willing to commit manslaughter, despite having the means to reduce that significantly.	0.5

I haven't looked into that literature, but I'm very familiar with and greatly admire Michael Oakeshotte's work on conservatism. He is ideal in my mind, at least, when it comes to my framework of how to govern:   Mitigate disasters. Pass policies proven to work.  That is Oakeshotte's ideals in a nutshell. And I completely agree, that's what conservatism should be. In terms of mitigating disaster, switching government types is probably pretty high on the list of probable disasters. Small, incremental changes are probably better.  Anyway, I've got my own mindset of conservatism, and I know for a fact that switching government styles is probably pretty fucking stupid and anti-conservative.

i have a theory that all this school shooting stuff is happening because of the school's own Zero tolerance policy on violence. If you are being bullied and stand up for yourself , you get in trouble. If you get bullied and ask the school for help, their response is you need to learn to deal with it-no support, no trouble for the bully, nothing. So they create an incubator for pain and suffering with zero way out (if you were treated this badly at work you would quit, but it's not legal to do that with school). Then they're all surprised that the kid freaks out and shoots the place up.	I don't believe school shootings are over exaggerated in the media, but even if they are, kids don't have the capacity to calculate risk levels and many are afraid	0.673

You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country. You are making up lies about a massive movement just like the democrats are doing about the truckers.	<p>I get where people are coming from, but i think it&#39;s only because it wasn&#39;t successful. People tend to think &quot;well those idiots wouldn&#39;t win anyway&quot; which is probably the majority of level headed republican/conservatives.

Ohhhh look, some idiot comparing a naturally Occurring event such as the incredibly tragic miscarriage, TO ACTIVELY SEEKING OUT A DOCTOR TO CAUSE THE MISCARRIAGE	<p>I also have a story about the state of the baby the other way though. I knew a woman whose son&#39;s wife was pregnant. The doctor found that both of them had some disorder in their family history, tested them and found that they both had the gene. So suggested that they test the baby&#39;s DNA in utero. That baby died <em>because of the test</em>. Let me be clear, the test was not positive, and they chose to terminate, the test killed the baby. Some years later they were pregnant again and did not do the test and the baby did not have the disorder, but they would have loved the baby all the same if it had.</p>	0.559
Defcon guys have gamefied hacking those voting machines.	<p>Third, the issue with Trump&#39;s claims that votes randomly appeared was explained by the machines having issues which were corrected. Votes were updated in clusters. Trump had bumps of votes, too. It wasn&#39;t just Biden that had 90,000 random votes found for him. More people just happened to vote for Biden in a democratic county. Why didn&#39;t they challenge red counties which used the same machines? Why didn&#39;t they challenge red states which swung for Trump which used the same machines?

A little off topic but governments of the world have literally murdered millions. Why suddenly do they care about saving EVERY single person with a vaccine that does literally nothing.

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics. This ended up being quite electorally advantageous for him as no one on either side of the political spectrum had preexisting negative perceptions of him to burden his candidacy.   While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband‚Äôs current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She couldn‚Äôt still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of preconceptions of her. Especially since a plurality of the left and many independents still hold her husband‚Äôs tenure as president in a delusionally nostalgic amount of high esteem relative to the other possible democratic candidates.

Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.

Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th¬†week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.	<p>Outside of those groups, COVID-19, is not that serious for the individual. It can still be serious for young people, but the numbers don‚Äôt suggest that, and the way the virus works does not suggest that. The number of reported cases is likely higher due to asymptomatic cases and people who experienced low symptoms that they probably wouldn‚Äôt have considered COVID and never got tested, because it wasn‚Äôt serious for them.</p>	0.667

This is why the Chinese call us baizuo. It‚Äôs more than just a sense of moral superiority that defines a baizuo; it‚Äôs also a willingness to accept ideologies that require the undermining of existing social progress in the name of appearing inclusive. Here we see a triumph of second-wave feminism, the maintenance of female sports leagues at the college and professional levels, being supplanted by the new illogical trans-acceptance regime. All that hard work to make women‚Äôs sports viable gone down the tubes in the name of insisting that transwomen are really truly women.	The Olympic Committees' decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn't disqualify athletes from competing in female sports.

I thought it was pretty obvious that the South was run by slavery loving Democrats. Is this not basic knowledge in America? It continues with those who think Lincoln was a Democrat. Just a bunch of idiots.	<p>When in reality, the Civil war had practically nothing to do with slavery until Lincoln was voted into office and brought about his Emancipation Proclamation. What really started the Civil war was the Federal Governments over reach and attempts to control and restrict certain fields of industry, and the growing differences in culture and social structures between the North and South. The Government tried to control and restrict multiple fields of industry, but was particularly harsh on the three biggest at the time: Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugarcane. All industries almost exclusively located in the south, and industries that all almost exclusively used slaves for labor.

It‚Äôs just become the American way to demonize and blame others for our own problems, rather than constructively work together.   Both parties have been running on the same issues for decades now. They‚Äôre in no hurry to solve them, because then what would they scream and yell about?	This notion from the left or the right, that ‚Äúonly my people work hard‚Äù is completely ridiculous. We all know that white trash family that complains about immigrants but will not move a finger to get educated, work and save in order to move up the socioeconomic ladder.	0.559

So she was charged FOR assaulting police, not charged WITH assaulting police.   Words make a difference to people who know what they mean. Real good example of Dunning Kruger here, thinking other people are stupid because they actually attribute a higher level of literacy to you than you actually possess.	She was protecting herself.  People will say whatever is necessary to do so in court.	0.561

College student here. In my second semester I was required to take ‚Äúglobal perspectives,‚Äù which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who‚Äôs a minority or has a ‚Äúunique world view‚Äù (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I‚Äôm mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn‚Äôt speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it‚Äôs a threat - including stuff like ‚Äúglobal perspectives‚Äù classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn‚Äôt have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn‚Äôt need any video/audio evidence of it and I‚Äôm a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	<p>If you want to talk about real policy that harms Asian-Americans, then let&#39;s talk about affirmative action, and how that leftist policy discriminates against Asians when it comes to acceptance into universities.</p>	0.486
The Biden administration has sunk to Trumpian lows on this topic. True, elections often have elements of unethical, even if legal, features.  But it‚Äôs the legal that matters.  2016, 2020 were legal outcomes.	<p>This is not the legal or ethical standard for incitement. Disputing elections is part of the game now. Stacey Abrams has somehow made a career out of it.</p>	0.588
Thats total bs. They were few riots, and alot of peaceful demonstrations broken up by force. Both happen and yall celebrated vids of cracking down on non riots and riots alike.	<p>The problem with a lot of the riots in question is the Democrats in power had their police stand down instead of keeping the peace.</p>	0.707
Cons are so up their own asses it's laughable. Everyone is a hErO AnD A PaTrIoT. A few months ago the right was largely in support of running over protestors who block roads. Now these empty heads have forgotten about that.	<p>I am done talking with you guys.  There have been less than 5 violent protests from the right over the last 2 years.  Less than 5.  In comparison there have been a hundred from the left, dozens killed, hundreds injured, billions worth of prop damage and lost businesses.  Mix in CRT, the woke mob, and the rabid fanatical trans activists and I am 100% over it.   </p>	0.519
interesting, could you please give me a good source that Sanger was pro death? I've always been told that she refused abortions exept I think for life threatening conditions. Would love to have something to use in debates.	<p>Pro-abortionists do not view abortion as murder, they generally believe that because the fetus relies on the mother‚Äôs care, that the fetus is not ‚Äúa life‚Äù because it couldn‚Äôt live without being in the womb. </p>	0.512
Female to males wouldn't make the cut against male athletes	The Olympic Committees' decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition. Our leaders in politics, media, and big tech have decided that having a penis shouldn't disqualify athletes from competing in female sports. If you attempt to argue with them they'll call you transphobic, biggoted, and attempt to get you fired.	0.667
> The more astute and sensible observation is to say ‚Äúif he was broke and ain‚Äôt shit when you fucked him, he probably gonna be broke and ain‚Äôt shit when it comes to paying child support.‚Äù   Or if u broke and ain't shit don't cum in her because you can't afford a kid.

I agree and I'm currently in the military. The individual you're responding to has big opinions, but I can bet you they're not willing to personally get sent there to avoid sending the wrong "message."	<p>Another question is, who is complaining about this?

If you want to debate material causes of the direct war you can point to slavery or tariffs. I'm making a deeper point though. The divisions between the British folkways into America fundamentally set the stage for a death struggle. It wasn't about black people, they just got caught in the middle between two ancient English tradtions. Read Albion's Seed.

You‚Äôre implying that being ‚Äúfairly intelligent‚Äù and @pushing a leftist agend are at odds. I don‚Äôt see it that way at all.
