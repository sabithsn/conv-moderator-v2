Fighting people deserve rights to not be held responsible for any damage they cause to other people when they say stupid shit.	The point of this saying is to warn us against these types of overreactions, I think. When we lash out in response to someone who wronged us, we run the risk of behaving in an unacceptable manner regardless of what the other person did to provoke us, and we are not exonerated from any ethical or legal consequences as a result of our own choices."	0.888

Sadly Hate Speech against men is normalized in USA 2022, as Hate Speech against Minorities was in 1922.  Common phrases like "men are trash" and "kill all men" indicate that many people view men as morally inferior people.  Discrimination against men is also accepted in Modern Western Society.  I have read very many stories of male victims of Domestic Violence being arrested rather then helped.  Male offenders get [60% more time](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144002) for the same crime.	What I see now as opposed to growing up in the 60s n 70s is redefining terms with what seems to be intended results. We talked about racism in the past as hatred based on skin color. It&#39;s easy to see that that&#39;s ridiculous especially since the men who fought and died in ww2 were of every race. It was a beautiful thing even. All peoples came together with others to defeat the philosophy of a master race. A proud moment in american history only to be muddied upon the end of actions and return to civilian life. A very sad moment. Racism still existed we didnt learn our lesson.	0.867

I‚Äôm sorry you went through that. No jokes here - sexual abuse impacts on men, and enforced penetration is as serious as rape.   I hope you get some closure, therapy, and justice.	Next comes the issue of culture.  It's very clear that there is a culture of rape.  Similar to what I wrote in that other response, we normalize rapist behavior (that is, behavior that isn't rape but if not addressed and singled out as bad, can lead to rape).  We bend over backwards to excuse rapists, and rely on almost a ""boys will be boys"" mindset if it's male rapists, (or outright say it's just not possible if it's a female rapist).  The thing is, if it's true that men are simply naturally inclined to rape, *then men shouldn't be allowed outside without supervision*, and if they aren't naturally inclined to rape, *then we should be focusing on what social factors create such a gender disparity in rape*.  When we look at burglaries, they are most often tied to economics.  That is, the more income inequality that exists, the more economic uncertainty a community faces, the more likely people are to turn to burglary.  To be frank, the people who say that ""watch your drink"" and ""use a buddy system"" are victim blaming are the same kinds of people who want to eliminate economic inequality, to get at the core issues of burglaries.	0.883

Thank you for taking the time and effort to explain in great detail why his position falls apart.  Like you, I do know the answer to who holds the record you mention and where her performance falls in the range of cis women performances, the record for the next older age bracket is faster than hers and was set by a cis woman. Like you, I'm not exactly worried about trans women dominating sports. I'm worried about all the voices like the individual you were replying to causing trans women to be subjected to hyper scrutiny in an attempt to tear down our validity.	The panic of trans women in right wing media is a solution in search of a problem. You almost never hear them share such *profound concern* over women's sports when they ask for more pay, or are threatened by cut funding or institutional sexism, but when *hypothetical* trans villains are at play, all of a sudden it's priority number 1.

When I was on vacation in the summertime visiting my nana and pop, various other family members in the uK as a adolescent - the sun Page 3 girl was quite the story to tell my friends when I got home.	It‚Äôs much easier to go calling everyone else racist then to actually do something. I raised money for the Equal Justice Initiative last summer in the wake of George Floyd. I didn‚Äôt just post a black square and pat myself of the back for being woke. I, like one of my favorite women in history (Elizabeth Pankhurst) believe in deeds not words. I do a lot of volunteer work, at my local homeless shelter, animal shelter, food pantry, women‚Äôs shelter, and other organizations. I play with the kids at a disadvantaged school in my city while their parents are taking English classes. I also enjoy working at this community farm located in the middle of a food desert (about 30 minutes south of where I live.) And yet, some woman on tiktok who doesn‚Äôt even know me attacked me for listening to jazz music. She said I am stealing from black culture. And she‚Äôs not even black. She‚Äôs also in her late twenties, whereas I‚Äôm only 17, so it was a little scary to be canceled by her. I blocked her and somehow she found my Instagram, and I blocked her again.	0.713

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it‚Äôs not fair due to ‚Äúbiological differences‚Äù we‚Äôd have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	-You‚Äôre talking of ‚Äúbias,‚Äù but you‚Äôre attempting to discredit ‚Äúme‚Äù based on my education background and not my ‚Äúpoints?‚Äù Come on‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre not ‚Äúfinding any evidence‚Äù here. Everything we‚Äôve been talking about is textbook biology for 40-100 years.  It‚Äôs fairly obvious that this attempt to redefine biological sex isn‚Äôt native to biology, but it‚Äôs a larger social push for inclusion of marginalized minorities. Whether that is a good thing or not (and my view is that it is), that is TRUE bias encroaching on a field that demands absolute objectivity. And just because this redefinition is a good thing, doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs the right or correct thing to do. We depend on science to solve all types of issues, and we need it to remain objective and free of social biases no matter how good the cause is.	0.843

Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.   To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	The difference is that the greater fool isn't necessarily the Redditor. GME was shorted over 100% of its shares. That means that those short sellers increased the supply of GME stocks, and when their options expire, they are required to buy the shares back from the market to ""reset"". So, people are buying up all the shares, counting on the fact that there is a guaranteed ""greater fool"" because the hedge funds are required to take that position. This is only this much of an issue because of the fact that hedge funds took a huge risk shorting this stock this much.	0.888

I think that the people who are offended by the use of the word cracker are frail. But the word cracker is self-evidently a racial slur. And if a service is banning people for the use of racial slurs, then a person should be banned for using the word cracker.   I see no ideological framework where the use of the word cracker is acceptable whereas the use of other racial slurs are not.	I would be on your side that we tend to label a lot of things as racist when they shouldn't, though I do not believe this has has any impact on the very real racism, and if it has any, it would be negative as it would make closet racists less able to dogwhistle to other closet racists. I don't see how it would help in any way racism.	0.887
See what I mean? You don't even consider what I have to say, You aren't engaging with any points, you're just attacking me. I'm trying my best to have an actual conversation with you and you refuse.	<p>Yet you still refuse to answer any of my questions or clarify your argument even when I point it out to you.</p>	0.9
Once again, asserting it does not make it a true statement.	Because right now its title doesn't seem to accurately reflect your views."	0.945
They‚Äôre weak AF and grew up in a timeline with low interests rates.  By the time they‚Äôre in the mid to late 20s we might have double interest rates on mortgage for people with bad/ low credit.  Automation should be advanced enough to replace all the menial repetitive jobs.  Social media has created this illusion that everyone is living their best life‚Ä¶.   Covid 19 called BULLSHIT on everyone !! If it wasn‚Äôt for the government welfare programs many people would have lost everything.	<p>Now stimulus checks don&#39;t actually do anything besides give free money. They are extremely poorly targeted and most people who have received the covid checks have not needed the money. In general you&#39;d be better off spending more on enhanced unemployment benefits, healthcare, food, and housing. Comparatively some debt forgiveness is good because a lot of people are really deeply indebted which can weigh them down for years. I agree a huge issue with these large forgiveness plans is the doctor, lawyer, mba debt. It&#39;s kind of ridiculous when these folks complain about their 100k+ debt expecting the government to pay. However average undergraduate debt is over 30k and there are millions of people with college debt who never graduated and have no way to pay their debt. That&#39;s why targeted programs in the 10-30k debt forgiveness make a lot of sense.</p>	0.879
Of course it is. But racism is perfectly acceptable if your skin isn't white.	<p>And if kink and fetish is a difference of degree, and dependence makes it an issue, racial preferences in moderation is perfectly fine?</p>	0.824
This is obvious to me. Everyone here who disagrees is living in a fantasy world. When all the female records are taken by trans women another tune will sound.	These bannings include entire subs made for females and lesbians, exclusively. The subs that aren't banned have become trans roleplaying. r/twoxchromosomes, you will see a prime example.	0.847
No, you ignore 90% of it and strawman the rest.	You are deliberately ignoring >>>90% of the data."	0.857
