I'm confused on why you're still messaging me, did you miss my reply to your earlier comment to me where i said that i don't debate with white females who post the N-word ?    https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/s6qx4p/cmv_that_feeling_you_get_when_you_start_to_sneeze/ht8ef8b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3   I'm pretty sure it's against the subs rules to harass someone who's said they don't wish to continue debating with you, I'd be careful so you're not banned if i were you.    don't worry no need to reply, just a friendly reminder. be better	If you agreed with this, I would have assumed a rational person would say ""yes, of course, I wear them when people like the OP ask me to"".

\> Politics is far more tribal than it should be and it's damaging to progression and coherent conversation     You hit the nail on the head. At the end of the day, your neighbor is still your neighbor and you have more in common then you don't. This us vs them mentality is detrimental to society.	<p>However, since you ARE seeing disparate outcomes, that actually shows that the current system IS still patriarchal, since it means that men are more involved in the competitive environment to become both winners and losers in it. The women are still excluded more from this environment, and are therefore underrepresented at both extremes. So, you&#39;re disproving your own claim again. :-)</p>	0.843

I've been arguing this since Richard Spencer was sucker-punched in the head live on television on inauguration day 2017, while calmly speaking with a reporter.  People were all 'hell yeah!' at the time, too.  No one wants to listen, or have even the slightest bit of imagination about how normalizing it could come back to bite you.	But the first time I saw a TV show with an actual male-male romantic subplot that wasn't played for laughs or a ""one special episode"", I spent hours watching and re-watching those scenes online. When I heard that the teacher on Arthur (my favorite show as a little kid) had been shown on-screen marrying another guy, I immediately started happy crying right in the middle of a group of my straight guy friends, something I never do. Even I was shocked at my reaction and couldn't explain why it mattered so deeply to me.	0.844

Your arguments are bad faith. Vaccination mandates are for the public health and safety. They are constitutional, and right now those who are unvaccinated should be forced	You ignore the purpose of government, and the social contract which makes society work. Governments make and enforce rules, and perform actions for the benefit of the GROUP, that we cannot do alone. Defence was of course the first of these, and is clearly still important. Justice and policing is another. Public health is a third. It’s not only the government’s RIGHT, but their RESPONSIBILITY to make and enforce rules that protect the health of our population. Those rules should be made with consideration for the members views and beliefs, but setting a minimum standard to achieve the required result is fair and reasonable. The imprisonment of Typhoid Mary was an example of this. She carried Typhus, but was unaffected by it. She passed it to 53 people and 3 died. Since she could not be cured, and insisted on working as a cook, she was quarantined for over 30 years. Was she happy? No. Was it necessary to protect the lives of others? Yes.	0.863
I think you need to read up on child development and brain development before you say stuff like this because you just sound stupid. Yeah kids are annoying, but they are small people processing the world around them and parents can only do so much to control their feelings and actions. If you really hate children so much, stay home, thats what I do.	I feel OP is upset by the sight of children realizing that the world is in a bad way at the moment with several long term problems that need to be addressed, and their solution is not ""we desperately need to fix the world so children will feel safe again"" but instead ""we should lie more to children so they don't realize how bad the world is..."""	0.867
Well, now I'm offended.  Because your accusation is 100% false.  I have never, at any point in our conversation, said the above quote that you are attributing to me.

That Bills/KC game was amazing. Two evenly matched teams giving their all with spectacular plays on both sides. The winner came down to a coin flip.

You're sounding like a whiny kid that got woken up from their nap too soon and now they're banging on the wall, trying to annoy their parents.  Grow up and either knock on their door and tell them to shut the fuck up or call the cops to come and do it for you. This whole being petty for revenge is so 16. This isn't some passive aggressive sibling fight. You are an adult, act like one.  Sorry your building management is so shitty. I would be emailing them and calling their after-hours line every time your neighbours are loud. Annoy them into helping you.	<p>My landlord had my neighbors harass me by banging on my door, and then flash lights in my windows at random times of the night, so I called the cops while it was happening. Even though I called, when the officers arrived they  interviewed the landlord for about 15 minutes then came over and said &quot; He has the right to be here at anytime if hes working on air conditions or checking on the property&quot;. I followed up by explaining the harassment, and the officer along with 2 other officers standing by shrugged. The landlord then had my brother attacked the next day, to which he defended himself by pulling his firearm, which ended in his arrest because the neighbor gave a false testimoney, saying he see my brother supposedly waiving a &quot;silver gun&quot; unwarranted ,when 1) he didnt have a silver gun and 2) he was attacked by the landlord and an associate. Police came and interviewed landlord again and then he was arrested. Moral of the story, fuck the police.</p>	0.845

We will never get rid of the “virus” because the media will keep pushing it out. With a survival rate of 99.89%, and no symptoms. Confusing on why a human would inject themselves with a experimental liquid, especially after all the vaccine deaths. “Covid” will never go away as long as the media keeps pushing false information. I can’t blame everybody though, most people just turn on the news in the morning and don’t even think to question anything they hear. The competent will survive this fake pandemic, because we just ignore the communist rules.	That's a fantastic leap in logic. No one has to treat this seriously because it's patently different and does not follow logically from requiring vaccination for a virus that has caused one of the most infectious pandemics in history. One literally involves killing a human, could incur serious psychological trauma, and does not clearly prevent any potential harm to others.

"Children are like poems... they're only beautiful to their creators."	Well, I tried to change your mind and I don't think I did. So I'm off.

To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.  An "all powerful" God would have the power to keep people from unnecessary suffering, and yet millions of children still die per year needlessly, and Earth itself is on a massive decline that God isn't helping with in any way. Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	<p>Why should anti-vaxxers be a protected class?

> It is happening, man  Solid rebuttal.  I'd argue you have your head in the sand because you're unable to comprehend a very simple series of events. It's not worth my time continuing a discussion with someone unable to grasp a simple concept.  X number of animals were killed as of today to provide meat in the grocery stores. There is a deer in the woods still alive, if I go decide to kill that deer it's now dead... It wasn't dead this morning, but it is dead now that I shot it. Again, it's really not hard to follow along.   The meat in your grocery store was dead already, the animals in the woods are alive until you decide to go kill one. It really boils down to you being able to wrap your head around this concept. Given this situation, it is immoral to go out and kill another animal when you didn't need to. That's literally all I'm arguing at the end of the day - a hunter doesn't wake up and NEED to kill an animal, but they do anyway.  More death is unacceptable, I don't care if it makes you feel better about yourself. From the animal's perspective, you just killed me even though there's 1000s of pounds of meat in the grocery store down the road.	If you cant afford it, chances are you cant afford to not buy mass produced corn products which are extremely detrimental to everyone and especially the environment. Its a complicated issue is my point, and to think that not eating animals means you are helping them can often be backwards. People need to start researching and thinking deeper than that. There are too many deer, and most die very painful uncomfortable deaths do to overpopulation and starvation. Maybe we should try to find a win win solution for this instead of spreading propaganda like ""meat is murder"" (not accusing you of this, but its a common thing).	0.873

That’s the bandwagoning fallacy - “everyone agrees with me, so I must be right”.    Science isn’t based on majority opinion. Objective facts don’t change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You’re as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the “scientific consensus” by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever’s in power?    After all, it costs nothing to do the Hitler salute and look the other way during the genocides of millions.	<p>If they shudder at the thought then why did they openly support it? Pleading ignorance isn&#39;t valid here. Hitler was a special kind of evil, fascists are only marginally better, in that most of them simply fall in line as opposed to being driven by their hate. Its not a matter of me inviting upon them being bad (in a way like Hitler, they are by definition. If they don&#39;t like it then tough. I literally have no empathy for such people.</p>	0.898
That's non sequitur. I'm not talking about music reviews or opinion. I'm talking about white nationalists espousing debunked "race science" to push white supremacist policies. But yes, any media program should vet its guests to make sure they're not absolute cranks who spread racist bullshit.   And yes, I am saying we shouldn't let white supremacists speak in public to spread their message. You seem to be running head first into the [paradox of tolerance.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) One of the ways around it is to simply not tolerate bigotry. Again, I recommend doing the reading here. Why are you so adamant that they be able to share their hate?   Frankly, your second paragraph didn't even make grammatical sense. But yes, as stated above I do want to censor bigots. I do support "science facts" as you put it. I'd love for you to provide an example of "experiential designs" that were rapidly disproven. Do you mean phlebotomy and the other "race science" fields? Because yeah, we threw those out when they were disproven.   And no, not everything had scientific consensus* (you can't spell) but everything we've discussed today does. The only people disagreeing are bigots. You've thoroughly shown us here where you stand on this.	<p>Yeah because they&#39;re not already doing this! I&#39;m not particularly interested in where this discussion is going. I don&#39;t have a low opinion on you but I already know you&#39;re going to try to hit me with the &quot;white people are victims of white supremacy too and they don&#39;t know it!&quot; And I just don&#39;t agree and don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get you to agree white people have purposely tanked the social safety net in America of their own free will and not because billionaires brainwashed them. I&#39;ve been in America my whole life and I&#39;ve seen where the racism comes from. It&#39;s not just something flowing from the bottom up, and most white people flat out don&#39;t even realize how good they have it compared to other people not only globally but in America itself. We have this thing where we make all problems broad to seem as if they primarily affect white people, then the government primarily only helps white people. Happened with affirmative action, happens every year with various types of welfare (look up welfare spending in white areas vs black areas - it&#39;s a doozy).

They should invite skittles to a party. They don't  care about inequality or inclusiveness. They can see the trend and want to sell candy.	But brands still want to sell their stuff and kids still want toys and junk food, so brands will just subvert the ban. You think kids are too vulnerable to blatant advertising? They have no hope of distinguishing a fake prop soda from a soda product placement. When their favourite disney show character gets a happy meal, they arent going to be able to filter that out as an advertisement, separate from everything else the character likes and is interested in. And wait until, like, their playground is brought to them by Barbie and their Candy Land Game is skittles-themed.	0.813
I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	<li><p>even if they did do it the way they did to help small states, there&#39;s a big difference between that, and saying this was a big part of the electoral college&#39;s design.  People talk about this like the whole point of the electoral college is to help the small states; but even if you think the founders thought about that, they clearly had bigger fish to fry in designing the system.</p></li>	0.81

I wanted to argue with you because I believed this was a place where people sincerely changed their views.  However after scrolling through the last few posts, I have to admit you are right. Even anonymously, reddit users care more about appearing right then finding truth. !delta	This is a topic that has prompted a ton of discussion, both internal and external. It's a little bit of an [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) issue, where the regulars are sick to death of seeing these anti-trans threads, but the people posting them are posting them for the first time. And they do lead to people being educated and changing their minds. So how do we balance the potential good of giving people opportunities to overcome their biases and misconceptions against the potential harm of giving people with no intention of changing their views chances to soapbox?	0.88

>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat. So way to win an argument by not even playing by the rules of this sub. Are you proud??	<p>As well I&#39;m really a lot less proud to be Canadian after hearing about these graves and IRS&#39;s than I was before hearing about them. Like that&#39;s really fucked up that MY country did this. I&#39;m not proud of my country for doing that. When I think about IRSs and the graves of innocent children, I am NOT proud of my country. Should I be? Should I look at this information and just maintain the same feelings of national pride I had before learning about this? I don&#39;t think so. </p>	0.857

Reality has a Liberal bias. When people complain about being forced to watch Liberal media, what they mean is that there aren't enough outlets producing fascist propaganda for them to consume.	<p>Jokes aside, the reason for this is that liberal politics tends (but does not always) err towards scientific consensus, which means you end up with a bit of a feedback loop where more and more of those involved in the field tend toward liberal political leanings, simply because the right rejects them outright, which they find untenable.</p>	0.904

We already have affirmative action programs in place, what do you want us to do, have white people walk in the streets and whip themselves with flagella while saying shame lol. Bro you are being brainwashed by some elite nasty people, you need to wake up sir.	So let’s take the starting assumptions of these two theories, white privilege exists & there is systemic bias against people of color. I think this a fair starting place.

> If you managed to achieve that, you would already be a statistical unicorn.  Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns. You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense.

That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.

I don’t see a single attempt to change your mind that isn’t clearly a case of “no, I got fucked over, other people should, too” or “this world is tough and cruel [the one they didn’t choose to be born into], they gotta learn that.”  OP, I agree with you. No child chose to be born. In that way, every single hurdle they face is, at heart, the parents’ fault. There are plenty of problems that bad parenting specifically creates, to boot. In the end, unless you can be 100% sure that some obstacle or problem a child of yours faces is PURELY their own fault, and not contributed to by you or the world YOU CHOSE to bring them into, you ought to help them to the best of your ability, until the day you die.  FTR, I have a 21 and 18 year old, so please don’t try to claim I don’t have experience.	<p>I mean I hate to break it to you, but as a parent, someday you&#39;re going to screw up. No parent is perfect and most are quite far from it. And believe me, nothing is more effective at making you question authority than seeing your own parents screw up.</p>	0.906
Your sealioning is really evident, and your refusal to Google these things or accept the mountains of data provided is extremely telling.

To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.  You are chamging the premise previously agreed upon to win the debate, ie false premise fallacy.	<p>This doesn&#39;t stop it from being racist. Instead, it justifies certain types of racism. Since the term &quot;racism&quot; has a negative connotation, a lot of people feel it&#39;s easier to refer to such policies as not being racist - instead of trying to argue how some forms of racism are justified. The latter is more honest. I&#39;m not even going to go into how affirmative action harms minorities (who are only accepted into universities due to affirmative action).</p>	0.873

Stop trying to pawn your shitty rehtoric off on "society" or what ever.  Reality isn't changing. You are not in anyway being forced or obligated to "pull down" anyone from history. If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here? Cause a "realist" would clearly see that your engagement in the discussion is 100% ideological motivated.	The problem is that it's not anti-discrimination legislation that segments populations by groups. It's society itself that does that through its biases and the discrimination. Repealing all anti-discrimination legislation tomorrow isn't going to change the fact that people will be seen as part of an identity and a community based on their characteristics. All it will do is allow for the majority to mistreat them based on the characteristics it does or doesn't like.	0.895

>Programmers do, those go more into machine code or very low level programming languages.  The meaning of the bytes is determined by the program. There may be some assembly language that map those bytes to a specific CPU instruction, but that's true of any integer, there's no reason to avoid those code points for that reason.  So you can load a number into the CPU as an instruction, but you can also load it as data, and computers are good at not getting mixed up as they work.	<p>Let us consider some really advanced AI that has the incredible power of differentiating between objects, ideas, concepts and other things.

We understand what you mean , we just disagree .  I've read up and understand how these ideas were formed.  I just think they are bad and make errors.

So I use pronouns for what people are   not what they think they are.	Getting a little more personal, its worth mentioning that its an uncomfortable and slightly sad idea for me that my existence as a trangender person ""undermines"" pre-existing understandings of gender, because we simply don't have the answer to this.

The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don’t hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.  I’m lucky enough to live in a state where euthanasia is legal. Having seen the horror of final stage cancer looks like, it’s very comforting to know I have an option.	<p>It is wrong to encourage suicide because you discourage people from trying to fix their life. You discourage hope. You discourage healing. You encourage people to be cowards and give up. That&#39;s the opposite of helpful. Suicidal people often feel helpless or like they have no way to make their situation better, but they&#39;re wrong. We just have to make them see it. Also, if you were to encourage someone and they completed suicide, that would be immediately harmful to their family, friends, coworkers, etc who would have to deal with the grief and readjustment of their lives. Suicide is selfish because it bastardizes the effort of people who have given their blood, sweat, and tears trying to help, and then they traumatize them by dying. Suicide hurts everyone, not just the person who dies. If you encourage suicide, you force grief, and that is very wrong.</p>	0.895

I said prescription drugs after you edited your comment to narrow down to a specific decade. All of those things have been used to treat hysteria, factually.  You didn't correct a mistake, you literally changed the argument from a factual matter (this is the only treatment) to a subjective one (this is the best treatment).

Six times this has been explained, and you're still arguing something irrelevant to the comment you first replied to. Stupid people are so tiring.

So in your case you don't live on a very well thought out or diverse farm. You specifically farm livestock and nothing else, it also sounds as though you have no access to pasture or large grasslands, otherwise your opinions are just opinion, and based on imagination.   There is no future for the meat industry.  You are suggesting that farmers would simply pay to destroy their only assets, destroying their business and choosing bankruptcy in one fell move? Instead of making a significantly more passive income from supplying to the organic fertilizer industry and local arable, fruit and etc farmers which would boom in response to the massive increase in demand.   Forgive me for calling BS, you come off as either a fantasists, delusional, or just intentionally feigning ignorance in an attempt to justify the continuation of what you have always considered the norm.  Yes I'm alright but I'm getting tired of obtuse poorly thought out opinions and having to hear them come out of what I would hope are usually intelligent people, it's extremely wearing.	<p>Except we haven&#39;t stopped breeding dogs, we just control their population. And we continue to breed them because there is a massive demand for them as pets. By eliminating the meat trade you would eliminate all demand for animals such as chickens. If no one buys chickens for food or eggs, then no one will keep chickens around. You&#39;re right that this probably wont result in their killing, as that takes time and resources. Rather farmers would probably just release them all into the wild where they&#39;ll die from starvation, unable to acquire food for themselves, or be mercilessly devoured by local predators.</p>	0.883

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‘debate’ (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I’m going to guess that you’re in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you’re willing to let me know your state, I’m happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I’m critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.	<p>You listen to them because that truth is the most cosiest one. People only consum the media that strengthens they own few.

I wonder why?  I wonder what ur group is trying to cover up?	<p>That’s why if you read between the lines: we aren’t about race but about oppressive systems and the white race happens to sit atop because of history.

If you eliminate rental properties, then demand for decent property to own would go WAY up. Then home prices would skyrocket along with the number of trailer parks.  That's how economics works. Landlords make it possible for young people with limited resources to have a safe place to live.  I rented for 16 years before buying a house.	<p>When we had our first child we knew we wanted to move out of that neighborhood to a better one by the time they reach school age. We scrimped and saved every penny. When we finally got to the point we could afford to buy a new house (took about 4 years of saving). We decided to rent our duplex since the housing market was cheap at the time. That&#39;s when we found out how difficult it can be to be a landlord. The local municipalities have all kinds of expensive regulations to adhere to, to protect renters. Now, we had two properties to maintain. Also, the process of weeding through potential tenants can be very daunting. Our hard work paid off. Over the 5 years we rented we had wonderful tenants and we never raised the rent regardless of the prevailing rent prices around us. When the housing market came back we sold at a modest profit. </p>	0.831
Logically you are correct  if it's offensive to do it to one culture its offensive to do it to all cultures. But the die hard sjws only care about nonwhite cultures being appropriated.

The joke when it comes to health care in the state is that we currently pay the most for it and get some of the worst bang for the buck.   If I'm a citizen making 20 k a year health care is free.   I would much rather have a free service from the government in which where I'm guaranteed health care than the piecemeal system we currently have.	Add in the facts that controlling costs with Medicaid and Medicare forces companies to charge its paying customers more to cover bottom line and profits. The end customer doesn't really see costs since insurance obfuscates the price. American demographics are also highly skewed towards higher cost per individual plus more individuals in the system that anywhere else, 300 million. Also, the American medical system is one of the most regulated markets in the world. It's a perfect storm of half measures.

Secondly, saying someone is lying when they misspeak is disingenuous and toxic, and am *actual example of gaslighting.* How could you possibly know my intent better than me?	<p>How is that a misinformed position? Its still a lie, you said so yourself: He knew the effectiveness of masks, and he decided to tell the public otherwise.

Personally, now I know that the CDC has no problem misrepresenting things if it thinks it will cause major undesirable problems if there is a truth they know but don&#39;t want revealed to the public. This makes me have to think twice when I hear something from them that sounds counter-intuitive to me, if I think there&#39;s a reason they&#39;d prefer people to think that than to know what they know.

Firstly. Didn't say ban renting. I said give it over to the local authority.  And secondly the fact you don't realise that in the UK the local authority (council) were in charge of building houses from 45-79 and you think it's somehow some communist utopia shit. Or are you saying the country which every other country has based it's housing regulations on for how good they are is communist?  I didn't even advocate anything socialist you moron. This is just social democracy in a capitalist state.	And, specifically, in our democratic socialist society in our capitalist economy, taxes help balance these things. We don't let people show up at the ER and die just because they don't have insurance. We, as a society through Congress, decided in the 1940s that we wouldnt let workers have to work until they died, or become disabled, widowed, or children just starve.	0.818

I agree with you completely, but as a white guy when I get asked about race on an application that spends more time talking about efforts at diversity than the job requirements… it’s clear I’m not the type of applicant they’re looking for.  Honestly though this is just a symptom of a bigger problem. As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.  The sooner we start focusing on giving everybody an equal opportunity in life instead of measuring equality by outcomes, the better.	<p>Then write this to the OP of the CMV article? I don&#39;t think creating a space for white people to feel valued and appreciated equals marginalized groups bargaining with the resentment of white supremacists. Creating that space can simply involve treating people equally i.e. not giving things to people of color because they are people of color at the expense of white people, not making excuses for the incompetency or violence of black people that wouldn&#39;t be given for white people, and not attacking white people for their whiteness, examples include telling people to be less white, asserting that white people are racist by default and always will be, asserting that black people can&#39;t even be racist to white people, dismissing contrary arguments from white people as white fragility, dismissing the achievements of white people as beneficiaries of white privilege/ slavery, asserting that the white man is uniquely evil, asserting that voting for a Republican candidate is an act of racism, dismissing concerns about immigration and illegal immigration as racist, asserting that white people should be removed from power because they are white, etc.</p>	0.911
I know what you're intentions are posting here. You are trying to make it come across like what I've said is confusing when you know fully well you are the one trying to confuse and dilute the conversation. How about answering what your thoughts were on the article about Covid vaccine passport chips being created in Sweden? Like are you really going to try to discredit me by saying key terms you think will help label me as a deranged person, when the topic you bring up is a literal thing being implemented in real life. Are you going to pretend like the world economy isn't on the brink of collapse because of the pieces of shit in global power who failed to respond an international pandemic with a sense of duty, and instead chose to find ways to profit off of it at the sake of millions of deaths? Are you really just going to accept tyranny and oppression as okay staples in society, without looking deeper into the issues because you are so afraid of being ostracized for accepting what is on the news is fake? Are you really going to try to claim that people shouldn't be skeptical and speak out about a coalition of conglomerates, that have histories of seeking profits by using unethical sweat shops and slave and child labor for cheaper production costs of their products, trying to control the decision making process of every country in the world?   If the answers to those questions are yes, then I want you to know I truly think you are a pathetic person who brings no value to society, and you should shut your fucking mouth when others are trying to have grown up conversations about crime and corruption.	As to the part about the government having confusing messaging, I would encourage you to try and separate the guidance on vaccines, which has largely been consistent and is in line with the guidance the rest of the world is getting, and messaging regarding other of health practices like mask, social distancing, isolation, etc. I could go into detail as to why the messaging wasn't consistent but long story, short, messaging regarding mitigation steps will always evolve when dealing with a novel virus, and things like shutdowns have an added economic and policital element to them that vaccines don't have."	0.832

CMV: Student debt shouldn't be cancelled. I was making 60k a year out of school with 50k of loan. I lived very frugally for 3 years ( shared accommodation, no car, barely eating out, no vacations) to get rid of that debt. I don't fucking want to pay more taxes for other people to get rid of their debt.	<p>I decided to rent out my house when I was living overseas, and decided I wasn&#39;t going to go back to the states.  Instead of maintaining a house that I only occupied for at most 45 days per year, I decided to rent it out. Rent is set to market rate, not to how much you pay in mortgage.  I have friends that the rent doesn&#39;t even cover their mortgage.  In my case, my house had been paid off for 2 years before I decided to rent it out , so I was fine. </p>	0.858
>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having racial biases can and do exist but making it illegal to make laws that discriminate did end systematic racism. Now a system showing racial bias can exist but that is a separate concept even if that concept is called systematic racism. The CRT use of systematic racism simply reflects that there is a correlation of race and outcome. The reasons for this are not part of the CRT evaluation bc CRT assumes it's bc of racism and not factors such as individual choice. Point is it is illegal for any system to discriminate racially so the system is actively against racism. Society also completely demonizes anyone who judges people based on race so society itself is actively against racism. What system with any power is actively FOR racism as in encouraging people to discriminate based on race? Literally the only systems pushing for racism is the democrats, the CRT praxis supporters, and the neo Nazis/white supremacists.   >The system is like a vehicle. Ask yourself who's driving it. Historically its the white male elite.  So all white males are intrinsically racist and think exactly alike? Or do you mean that minorities are so different to white males that they cannot compete in the same meritocracy? Either way that's a really racist statement.   >And it is still based on merit, although I don't think we are living in this ideal meritocracy you think we do, it's just merit that would've been passed up on because they have a black name.  You literally are more likely to get into college, get promoted, or get hired with a black name. Being white is literally detrimental to your career in today's society. A white person would need to score 150 points higher on the SATs than a non Asian minority and Asians would need to score 200+ higher. This discrimination you state just doesn't exist in reality, it's a false narrative based on outcomes not on actions.   >Affirmative action notwithstanding because I agree with that policy and see the merit in it.  Sure but it's still racist policy regardless if you see the merit in it.   >From the right it happens that its a kind of fearmongering to white nationalists that's been going on a while.  I wasn't aware the 1300 white nationalists in the states (the prison gangs can't vote) was such a big lobby. As far as fearnongering goes, when policy literally discriminates against white people is it fear mongering or just calling out unconstitutional racial discrimination?  >Charles Darwin was no genius, neither was Einstein. They were specialized in their field and at the right place at the right time. Their work benefited greatly from names you've never heard of.   They literally had 150+ IQs. To claim they weren't genius level intellects is complete idiocy. That's literally the dumbest statement I've ever heard. Everyone's work benefitted from other people and that in no way invalidates genius. I'm really struggling to justify even responding to someone idiotic enough to think this bc it shows your complete ignorance to not only basic complexity but also the complete lack of understanding the difference in ability. Oh yea anyone could come up with relativity or evolution it's no big deal. E=mc2 is a simple equation if you don't understand the gravity of what it actually means. Pun intended.   >The only problem with that sentiment is that we've built our systems in a way that makes each person a cost to their environment. It doesn't have to be that way.  You have established you know nothing about systems so your opinion is useless.   >Also, right libertarianism is just the hunger games, and the IO games we have today.  The hunger games had an authoritarian government that killed dissenters so no that's facism or authoritarian left bc they redistributed wealth...mainly to capital city bc that's what the authoritarian redistribution system traditionally does.   >And without physical violence or professional gatekeeping at play, people would be invested in maintaining that central structure because it's based on finding and distributing knowledge everyone can use to make their lives better, rather than an imaginary fear of the other that demands you give up your rights for your own good.  Dumbest statement ever. I'm a libertarian. I'm for individual rights even if they counteract the will of the majority. So your whole system required that humankind be reasonable, rational, selfless, and put the benefit of others over themselves to work? That's your system? That's retarded. That has never worked and will never work bc that is not humanity. What kind of privileged upbringing did you have to think that is in any way not complete idiocy? Your whole system requires perfect people or else it fails so it will fail and then the people will authorize force to save it from failure which is exactly what happens in every attempt at socialism. You can't redesign humanity, you have to redesign a system to work with the reality of humanity aka humans are greedy so base a system on that aka capitalism.    I'd love to continue this but you want to preach not have your mind changed. That's fine but the more I hear the more idiotic and clueless you sound. Half the stuff you say is in direct opposition to the other half. It's completely obvious you have zero real world experience and read a few socialist books and think you understand the world and all it's problems when literally you just succumbed to propaganda. I hate resorting to name calling but the level of both ignorance, hubris, and confirmation bias in your rational is mind blowing. I like libertarianism but I am aware of it's flaws. I am not ignorant enough to think it is perfect, I simply think that the cost benefit analysis for it is better than other systems. You, on the other hand, think your system is flawless even though your system requires human perfection to be realized. I can only hope that you can scrape together enough sanity to understand the gravity of that analysis. Quite frankly you are also a racist and an advocate of systematic racism but in complete denial of that fact. Sorry but not sorry.	""Racism"" has evolved as well. It used to be a catch-all for anybody experiencing degradation from another race, but now it's evolved to the use of degradation to keep a minority/marginalized group ""down"". That's why white people (in America) can't experience ""racism"", because it's not a tactic used by people in positions of power to keep the white race from advancing its standing in America. This is why you'll often hear ""systemic racism"". So while white people can still experience ""prejudice"", they can't experience ""racism.""	0.898
>Most people are not jewish. Expand your social circle.  What? Seriously, did your logic train jump the tracks there or something? Not sure what you are trying to say here.  >There are over 11 million small businesses. Meaning 11 million small business owners. Do you really think 11 million is a small number?  Again, we are talking about means of production. Being a self employed accountant isn't it pal. I have no idea why you think the number matters anyways, but fyi, it is a pretty small number compared to the number of employees. Really small.  >Far more died of hunger under communism.  Ok so you're not even going to try to speak honestly? You're just going to blatantly lie? Ok, nothing more to say then. Pretty pathetic. If you believe in something you should be able to defend it honestly. The fact that you have to lie should tell yourself that you are on the wrong side.  I hope you can grow from this.	As a bit of trivia:  re: redistribution of high level employees wages — this would generally have very little effect.  The number of low-wage employees is so huge that you can, for example, divide a CEO’s entire wage amongst them and you’ll get something like $5 - $10 *month* difference for even smallish businesses.  And just a few cents for huge places like Walmart with millions of employees.   — The human mind like to compare exemplars (example individuals) to each other and neglects scale.  Things like CEO and related salaries are usually a very, very tiny % of a businesses operating costs."	0.872

The US and Canada arnt most developed nations. There's a quite a few beyond that I think.  Regardless, it seems your unwilling or unable to complete the thought exercise.

It is <em>wildly</em> more difficult to immigrate to Canada than the US. If you don&#39;t have a skill or education that makes you uniquely employable, you&#39;re probably not getting in. If you don&#39;t speak the language (in Quebec, that&#39;s English AND French), you&#39;re probably not getting in. If you&#39;re not the right age, you&#39;re probably not getting in.
