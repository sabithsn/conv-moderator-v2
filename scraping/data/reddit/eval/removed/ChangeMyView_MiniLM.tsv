>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.	<p>But if those factors aren&#39;t involved, you can willingly drive drunk.

What do you think antibodies do? They fight virus ALREADY IN your system. You've already caught the virus. Vaccine generated antibodies or t cells are preventing you from getting seriously ill from it, dumbass. It gives your immune system a head start. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult...     I've heard several other idiots make this argument before. "If someone who was vaccinated tests positive, the vaccine didn't work."      Antigen and PCR tests test for the presence of the virus in your system, which nothing can prevent (except maybe wearing a mask, but i'm pretty sure I know where you stand on that too). Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.      It's incredible to me that it's been public knowledge for over a year that 90+% of people in the hospital with covid are unvaccinated and people like you still can't put two and two together.	The vaccine doesn't make you ""immune"", like in a videogame you're immune to a certain kind of damage. Even if you have the vaccine, the virus can still enter your body and live for a while. What the vaccine does is teach your body how to fight the virus, so that it can combat it more quickly and effectively. But the virus can still enter, you just won't feel a lot of symptoms. And that can be dangerous for other people who still don't have the vaccine - you can contaminate them. So for a while longer, even those who are vaccinated still need to practice social distancing, because while they don't get sick, they can make other people sick."	0.714

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.	The increasing ""civilization"" in developed nations also coincides with a decrease in devout religious faith.	0.605

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids. I'm ready to bet, you not gonna help him, you not gonna network with him, you will tell him to fuck off.  One of my best friends turned out to be a pedophile just a couple years ago. I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.	<p>You&#39;re starting from &quot;rape fantasies are bad and cause rape and other negative results (and by extension porn is bad and causes X bad things to happen),&quot; and you&#39;re trying to shoehorn anything you can anywhere you can in order to justify that claim being true.

If transwomen are really &#39;dominating&#39; women sports, then even a couple of them should have already done so. You can&#39;t claim something is real and simultaneously give excuses for why it isn&#39;t working out. That&#39;s just rubbish.</p>	0.604
I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I‚Äôd go further and say that anime‚Äôs art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They‚Äôre blonde and brown and red haired, they‚Äôve got big eyes and pale skin‚Ä¶at bare minimum they‚Äôre drawn in a way that would not make one assume they‚Äôre Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They‚Äôre based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look ‚Äúwestern‚Äù.   I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs up with that. But cmon, you can‚Äôt blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different	>I'll like to point out that cultural appropriation is also a big double standard, while white Americans are punished for wearing dreadlocks, no one is criticising European anime lovers for using Asian culture elements. Or the movie Thor, or Coco. It's is wrong just in some moments.	0.624

That‚Äôs the bandwagoning fallacy - ‚Äúeveryone agrees with me, so I must be right‚Äù.    Science isn‚Äôt based on majority opinion. Objective facts don‚Äôt change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You‚Äôre as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the ‚Äúscientific consensus‚Äù by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever‚Äôs in power?    After all, it costs nothing to do the Hitler salute and look the other way during the genocides of millions.	In recent years, a lot of popular ideas have made us forget that. There's a lot of use of named fallacies as the road best road to logical thinking. But something being fallacious just means it's not NECESSARILY true. So people love to throw out ""Argument from Authority!"" to terminate a line of thought. But when we're talking about the kind of science we might argue about, very few of the big picture conclusions are NECESSARILY true, especially in the ways laypeople can discuss them. When we're talking about what's LIKELY to be true from our limited knowledge, recognizing expertise is important.	0.644

Similarly, it's perfectly possible for a bunch of doctors to write a definition of autism or anxiety or gender dysphoria in the DSM-V and get that wrong.

Anyone who lies about being rape should be prosecuted.                They should get the same amount of time the person they accused would have gotten.

Now, as a counselor I'm fortunate in that most of the time the situation isn't as serious as sexual assault, and I'm not in the business of reaching a verdict. When the accusation carries legal weight, the situation gets a lot harder. You're definitely right that we shouldn't convict on a whim. But that's not what ""believe the victim"" is about.

> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion? I had to take a stance, and rather, I had to be on the opposite extreme of the other if you will.   Seems like text book reactionary thinking and argumentation. "I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.  That is not obvious at all. You are literally here, *in this post*, doing exactly that.	<p>This is offensive to you, because you believe you are depressed beyond your control... And so you are. That is exactly the point. That is the belief. I had this belief too -  I did not believe these kinds of ideas and opinions. Then I noticed, that they are true... And I dont have depression anymore. This is a self-fulfiling logical concept. If you dont believe me so much to the point of being offended by this notion, you logically have to stay depressed. If you are not offended by this notion, there is a chance you can start to believe me. If you believe me, you will not be depressed.</p>	0.637

First, I said "perhaps you believe"? I didn't accuse you of anything.      I'll answer your silly question with another silly question:   Why don't lions kill other lions all the time if they DONT have the same morality that humans have?     Why don't dogs? Why don't parrots?     Is it because they fear an eternal punishment in Hell? Is it because they were bestowed with gift of morality?  No no, that's silly. Then why would humans not killing eachother be any measure of us being "special"?   You want to talk about non sequiturs?     Riddle me that.      And don't blame your inability to CMW as my fault?	2) You are different from a lion because a lion cannot be held morally accountable.

Only the biggest lawsuits in history follow these companies get your head out of your ass.   Bet you believe that the flu took a year off too. You just keep repeating "safe and effective" and don't pay any attention to the fact that you were told you won't catch covid if you get the vaccine. Science isn't guessing what will happen it's experimenting until a result is consistent. Yes experimenting.  If you don't see a problem with medical professionals being censored and deleted off social platforms for simply offering a second opinion then you are too far gone.  No issues with not discussing the possible side effects like every other drug in history? Or the adverse reactions totalling more than all vaccines combined? Don't you think it's worth at least a discussion to make people aware of what they put in their body? Or are you okay with an outside source telling you and everyone else what to put in their body.

If it was entirely apolitical I would expect that people would feel a similar way about mandating the flu vaccine. Maybe to a lesser degree given the reduced severity, but there should be <em>something.</em> Mostly what I&#39;ve seen - including this thread - is people supporting it for COVID vaccines but brushing off the flu because it kills fewer people. On a personal level I feel like, I dunno, if you&#39;re <em>that</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 600k people, you should be at least a <em>little</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 60k people.</p>	0.67

The fact that male erotica and prostitution are more popular among gay men than among women (despite the fact that there are far more heterosexual women than gay men) suggests otherwise.Women's erotica and porn  - erotic novels, series about relationships, etc.	Thirdly, the reason I imagine there's the double standard between men and women watching gay and lesbian porn is because heterosexual mainstream porn can fully cater for men. You could easily find almost any sex act involving a man and a woman catering for the man. So the only extra bit in gay porn is the gay sex. Conversely, as I already mentioned, mainstream heterosexual porn doesn't easily cater for what the women want to see unless they want the ""rough and male orientated"" sex. So then the lesbian porn is the easier to find, more sensual and female orientated option."	0.64

The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis‚Äôs could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don‚Äôt hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.  I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in a state where euthanasia is legal. Having seen the horror of final stage cancer looks like, it‚Äôs very comforting to know I have an option.	2) If euthanasia is legal to some extent, people can still choose not to do it for themselves because of their own beliefs, but if it's completely illegal, people won't be free to make that choice for themself, no matter what they believe.	0.713

Ultimately, we need to accept that automation is coming to replace some, probably even many, jobs. There's no getting around that. It's going to happen no matter what we do. We need to accept that and find ways to structure society to still allow everyone to get their needs met without forcing them to take poverty wages.

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‚Äòdebate‚Äô (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I‚Äôm going to guess that you‚Äôre in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you‚Äôre willing to let me know your state, I‚Äôm happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I‚Äôm critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you‚Äôve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn‚Äôt deserve it, you shouldn‚Äôt have been subject to it, and it shouldn‚Äôt have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you‚Äôve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.	There is evidence to back up men performing better in many physically based sports than woman however there are not real studies as to WHY. We assume it is increased muscle etc and that is a reasonable assumption however when we close that gap significantly with hormones people still want to argue the other physical differences. My issue with this argument is there is currently no evidence one way or the other and literally every human is physically different in some way."	0.77

I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	<p>I hate the switch controllers. The Playstation 2 dual shock controller is the greatest controller ever made. It fits nicely in my hand and all the buttons are in convenient locations. There&#39;s a reason why USB controllers nowadays typically copy the PS2 controller&#39;s design, and the later generations of Playstation controllers saw minimal change.</p>	0.662

The phrase "gender identity" might be somewhat recent, but we have data about people identifying with various genders that dates well over a thousand years.  By the way, the term "constructive conversation" doesn't mean just lying down and accepting whatever factually false bullshit some random bigot on the internet throws at you. It is reasonable to continue the conversation without pretending as if the wrong transphobic bullshit you write was true.

I‚Äôm not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it ‚Äúthe problem of evil‚Äù, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world. Therefore, since there is undeniably evil in this world, god can‚Äôt exist as defined by the major monotheistic religions. It‚Äôs an interesting debate!	Maybe you can't believe in an omnipotent god, but maybe god isn't omnipotent and is only being described as omnipotent because the people who believe the stories of god use that word to describe him. Have we seen him try to make a stone he can't lift? Why does he have to be omnipotent according to our flawed language system that would make that paradoxical on purpose just to prove he doesn't exist? This entire argument that you need human words to describe superhuman entities and concepts in order for it to exist and make sense in your brain doesn't hold much water. Things can exist regardless of our words for them.	0.655

Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....  There's a lot to bitch about, but diversity in the inner circle does not appear to be valid?  https://www.facebook.com/POTUS/photos/a-cabinet-that-looks-like-america/171170408292829/  1	<p>So you honestly think that CNN, MSNBC, NBC, etc. are center or unbiased? Maybe this was the case 20 years ago, but it&#39;s not anymore. If you think that the above are not left-wing, you&#39;re being either willfully ignorant or are behind the times. </p>	0.483

No. That's still being a selfish piece of shit. These aren't imaginary people. Those are real people that assholes like you are killing. And believe it or not, plenty of folks can give a shit about strangers. That's just you and people like that only care about people you know. That's kind of a staple for conservatives and libertarians. You don't give a fuck unless it's at your door.	Several times now, I've encountered strangers on the internet making flip passing jokey comments about killing themselves ‚Äì which seems to be exactly the thing and the sort of people you are dismissing ‚Äì and reached out to them privately, only to discover they were, actually, acutely suicidal and not under any sort of psychiatric care whatsoever, and, yeah, actually did need someone to rescue them.  Sometimes I've done this, and found out, they did have mental health care, and it was being dealt with ‚Äì but they were grateful to find out someone noticed and was looking out for them.	0.538
This is objectively the worst answer of all.    Saying you haven't done your research so you can't be at blame for making bad decisions is just awful, really bottom of the barrel mentality.  Everyone is accountable for their choices in life, being uninformed is no excuse.	The problem we have is people enjoying looking at situations with hindsight, having looked at all facts and spent many hours considering what the correct actions should have been. Rarely do they ever consider what information was available in the moment or what the instinctive reaction is to the situation, and even fewer seem to care about what the potential ramifications are for making the wrong call."	0.59

I'll take this even further. It shouldn't be an option at all. Anyone who dies should have their organs available to someone in need, period. Why does anyone care? Just remove the entire thing from the driver's license and make everyone an organ donor. Done. Lives saved.	If someone wishes to mitigate that risk by not being an organ donor, that should be their choice."	0.735
Failures in human memory are one thing, intentional malice is another. She lied about him being 100% the one responsible. She lied about him in her book. She lied about him having a record. She lied about him greeting her. What many of you believe about the police could be a lie as well. She has some mental illness issues going on and trying to downplay her vile acts call into question the quality of your character.	You witnessed a fairly serious crime.  Even without the cooperation of the victim, the police could move forward with a case against the guy based on the evidence of injury and your testimony and getting her out of that situation."	0.625
Do me a favor. Pull up google maps and tell me where Ukraine is located relative to Russia. Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?  America is overreaching and attempting to extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, all the way to Russia's border, trying to drink Russia's milkshake, and retards like you think everything is going to be kumbaya and Putin is just going to let this fly.	Okay. Russia turns their attention to financing and building a working political relationship with Mexican cartels. They fund them so well that these cartels take over both de-facto and de-jure control of parts of Mexico. Russian forces legitimately and legally move into Mexico at the invitation of a Mexican state and given the green light by the Mexican federal government.	0.551

Logically you are correct  if it's offensive to do it to one culture its offensive to do it to all cultures. But the die hard sjws only care about nonwhite cultures being appropriated. Because cultural appropriation is racist and you can't be racist against white people because they have all the power. At least that's how my former liberal friends screamsplained it at me when I made tacos for my superbowl party.	<p>And even then, these SJWs usually don‚Äôt listen when people from the actual culture they are getting offended for tells them that it‚Äôs not offensive, since of course they all know better. </p>	0.698

Adding to what you said, I think it's pretty sad that nowadays people still consider good & evil in politics as being a thing.  &#x200B;  People still treat those conflicts as if they weren't just different empires trying to acquire more influence and territory over different regions.

As someone who has been using a flip phone for the past 5 years, I can honestly say I'm not missing anything. I deleted my Facebook bought a flip phone and a Garmin gps. I can honestly say that I'm in a much better place mentally and I've been way more productive.	<p>The twist is that we&#39;ve hit the phone where smartphones don&#39;t improve that much from year to year. It used to be every year added a new crazy feature. Now the pace is slower. So no phone is <em>much</em> better then the competing or previous one. For example, the much hyped 5G functionality is useless for most people around the world (and definitely in the US) since there is so little 5G coverage right now.</p>	0.544

To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.  You are chamging the premise previously agreed upon to win the debate, ie false premise fallacy.	I in no way deny systemic racism, just you're analysis of it. Systemic racism is the product of a class based society where inequality is baked into the social structure.	0.725

"Google exists" Ok lets say a new reddit user wants to hide a post and sees the "hide" button. What is the most rational thing to do? 1. Press hide, sees post is hidden, thinks post is hidden or 2. Use Google. 90% of people will choose option 1. What is there to argue about? No offence but are you autistic? I have a sorta friend who has autism and he argues with me over every single little details.	<p>Google could actually do something useful for once and make it so that you can create a Google account at whatever age you want, but restringing what content you can access while being logged in (and instead of banning comments, just don&#39;t show them to kids ffs). And yeah, I know you could just use incognito... But at that point there&#39;s nothing you could do stop those who use it xd. I mean, obviously there would be ways around it. It&#39;s a matter of making it less accessible, because yeah, nowadays an actual toddler could by pure accident end up watching a bunch of NSFW content. If you just make it less accessible to minor, they would have to be actively trying to access that content. And at that point the damage is already been done. You can&#39;t do nothing against that, really.</p>	0.525
