Yeah, just got back from a party celebrating the annual renewal of treason with my spineless cohorts.  Anything about standing up for decency In your new confederate asssociation, remember that? Where when you ran scared carrying your treason rag , bleached white with cowardice? Then cut eye holes in it so no one could see your cowardly spineless faces?  Run back and celebrate your wedding anniversary with your sister.	<p>Bernie told his followers for months that if he didn&#39;t win it was obviously bc there was fraud. Election happened and he lost and told everyone the election was stolen from him and true patriots would stand up and not let the Conservatives steal what should be his presidency. On the day of certifying the election, Bernie tells his crowd of Bernie bros that they&#39;re stealing the election and should go to the Capitol. The Bernie bros do just that, are hostile to the boys in blue, place pipe bombs, call for McCarthy to come out and threaten to hang Warren.</p>	0.82
And you seem to have a issue answering any of my questions with direct answers, instead your moving the goal posts. Took a quick look at your profile, you only have been active in conservative subreddits with no posts. Gonna go ahead and cut this conversation now since you are either A. A troll or B. A close minded bigot who makes quick assumptions about other people while constantly avoiding giving any answers to direct questions. You only stay in your group of other conservatives, feeding off each other's biased views until ultimately you are unable to have a basic conversation with someone who's views don't aline with yours. Try to enjoy your life man.	<p>The linked article missed way too much that watching the video gives...if you even read the article, and I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t. You saw the name, saw the post title, and figures it all out for us and that we&#39;d care what you think. Since you haven&#39;t done any of the assignments to remain with the conservative movement someone will be along shortly to ask the return of the membership card.</p>	0.886

Interesting article, thank you for sharing. I agree that people in Federal government should not be interfering in state elections like when Trump tried to convince Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the vote count. This is a clear violation of our constitution and should be stopped.	<p>But to me, there are no qualities or stances of Biden that I voted *for*. I think anyone who voted for the Iraq war should be ousted from American politics forever. But what I think is not the world we live in. And I was at a place where I wanted to express my outward disapproval of Trump, more so than an affirmative vote for anyone else.</p>	0.861
it‚Äôs amazing how many of them think the majority of conservatives are dying out because we are against mandates (not even knowing that a lot of us are vaccinated, just don‚Äôt want to force it on others).	Of course, denying the opportunity to answer the question caused everyone to believe he would do it; that is, except the ones who voted for him because he wasn't Trump. Those same people also told me that I was ridiculous to assume his administration would force vaccinations for COVID and look where we are now.	0.866

So you just read the title but not the article? It's all about fighting Trump's attempts to steal the election,  which he told us he was going to do.	<p>The reality is, former President Donald J.

Your entire comment is a nonsensical. No, I'm not a fucking liberal you twat. No I didn't support BLM or their stupid actions.  But I'm also not going to pretend anything you said is true. If you think that the "truckers" are not lowering themselves to their level, you're blind.  Clearly you're a member of the occupy movement, enjoy your tent hippy.	I'm not a diehard Trumper, I think overall he was great, but I absolutely hate what he did with executive orders to ban 2A paraphernalia outside the bounds of the law.

First of all, it was the Capitol they bombed, not the White House ( I know, facts are hard). But what i am really curious about is since that group was rightly labeled a terrorist group for that bombing, then I assume you agree with calling Jan 6th rioters terrorists as well, right?	<p>So let‚Äôs return to the intent of the original comment, the one I made an intentionally provocative response to.  My issue with your comment is that it seems to be intended, like the article itself, to make light of, and to trivialize, the violent attack on the US Capitol Building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of a presidential election.  An attack that was egged on by blatant disinformation spread by the sitting president himself and his clique of loyalists within the Republican Party, such as Ted Cruz.  An attack which resulted in the loss of several human lives, for those brain dead enough to think it was some big fucking joke.</p>	0.86

Fortunately in America, we have the right to freedom from religion, and companies can‚Äôt discriminate based on sexuality.

It‚Äôs year 2 of the pandemic and y‚Äôall are still talking about the masks‚Ä¶  Even prior to COVID, in Asian countries, it was totally normal to wear masks whenever one gets sick (called ‚Äúcaring for others‚Äù, look it up). Y‚Äôall bunch of pussies complaining about trivial shit like masks in the middle of pandemic.  COVID really shows where your priorities are. If something is not impacting YOU directly you don‚Äôt give a fuck, even if it‚Äôs such a minor inconvenience‚Ä¶. To such an aggressively dumb extent that it became your political identification.

Health experts already are saying this virus is going to become endemic like the flu, and nobody bats an eye about the flu even though iirc the flu is deadlier.

Medical ethics:    1) Informed consent -- the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    3) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    4) Beneficence -- do good.  The reason this is #4 on the list (and there are more than 4 ethics) is so that we DO NOT have what is happening now which is paternalism where someone else is telling you what they believe is good for you!

That‚Äôs literally NOT HOW JOURNALISM WORKS.  You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.  A correction is not an admission of lying.  A correction is THE OPPOSITE OF LYING.  It‚Äôs coming out and saying that atleast 2 of the 3 corroborated sources for any story to be verified were wrong.  It happens with every single news outlet many times a year.	<p>I know the mantra is that almost everyone dying of covid today is unvaccinated, but I&#39;m incredibly skeptical of those stats. I understand that anecdote is not a substitute for data, but anecdotes are much closer to my lived experience than the abstract population-wide statistics being pushed by the media. Up until August of this year, I only knew of a handful of people who even <em>had</em> covid... and all of them basically had a moderate cold for 3-4 days. In the past month, I know of 4 people, specifically, who have died of covid. I don&#39;t know them personally, but I know who they are and I know them via relationships with people in my community. Two of those people were fully vaccinated. One was unvaccinated. And the fourth, I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d assume she was unvaccinated. So that&#39;s 50/50... one thing they have in common is they were all very unhealthy and 3/4 were over 50. </p>	0.81
It used to be extremely anti job, then people started posting about how they actually wanted fair compensation for working, like actually getting a livable wage among many other things like having a safe work environment, which would increase staff happiness and productivity. So the sub transformed into that. Since the mod that did the interview was one of the original creators, they represented the anti job part, not fair compensation part, which is only a very small percentage of the community, and made 1.6 million people who actually just want unions in their workplaces look like lazy assholes who want do nothing but laze around.   On a side note, the interviewer was pretty demeaning, laughing during an interview is... not very professional.	<p>Minimum wage, like welfare, does not help people escape poverty. It just shackles them to it. Despite all the bad businesses that would screw over their employees, there are plenty (an abundance of small to medium businesses) that actually value employees as an investment that grows over time, as they train them internally and promote from within.

Lol, don‚Äôt worry, 81 million people didn‚Äôt vote for Biden he just got 81 million ‚Äúvotes‚Äù from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you‚Äôll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they‚Äôll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don‚Äôt see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the ‚Äúworst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics‚Äù even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you‚Äôre a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you‚Äôre constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	You make it illegal for them to be as you would like to say gifted these huge amounts of cash and my bet is the politicians would lose their minds and weed out plenty of crooked politicians but if we also make it law that politicians had to be audited &amp; provide clarity of income before taking office and every year in office, my bet is very few crooked politicians would run for political office &amp; the crooks already in office would abdicate office before an audit of their finances which would put them in jail.	0.836

Why can't you have an actual conversation about the topic at hand? I'm not here to reduce people to a single attribute and act like it's a valid reason to dismiss them. I asked a question. Someone asked for clarification, and stated a fact about themselves that explained why they asked. I responded with factual, verifiable right from the politicians who are writing the bills information.  I'm not trying to put a spin on it. I'm not vilifying the people writing or supporting the bills. I'm trying to understand how people reconcile the similarities and differences between these situations.	<p>Edit: Maybe I should add, I‚Äôm not defending the hypocritical actions of politicians with the party stuff you mention. That stuff ticks me off too.</p>	0.828
>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead. You endorse slavery with you purchases, tell me otherwise.	<p>But now we&#39;re going back to Democrat methods. Increase taxes in businesses, make them harder to run, make them less profitable and invest the money from increased taxes in minority communities because minorities are too stupid to start a business  (even though Trump proved otherwise). Get rid of IDs  for voting because minorities are too stupid and poor to get an ID and etc. Democrat policies are always supported by &quot;minorities are stupid and poor.&quot; And somehow their the anti racists.</p>	0.88

"concerns about election security"  We can all go back and listen to the claims made by Trump and his legal team. These weren't just concerns.  They were alleging the election had definitively been stolen without any evidence to back it up.   If Trump had simply claimed "I have concerns about the legitimacy of the election", I would have no issue.	<p>The context is obvious from the flow of the conversation. DoJ says they can&#39;t just overturn an election and Trump says he isn&#39;t asking for that.  He just wants a public statement to be made.  Right after discussing one of the voter fraud allegations that the DoJ said was possible.  The DoJ didn&#39;t just tell Trump that there was zero evidence of voter fraud.</p>	0.885

I think 1 or 2 others also. And usually they don't even bother telling me how I broke any rule.	<p>I‚Äôll agree that the virus was lied about and politicized from the start. Trump lied about the severity of the virus and said it would magically go away, he peddled ineffective drugs and harmful home remedies, and blamed everyone else he could. He could have taken charge and led our response as the leader of the country should have, but instead, he left it up to the state and local governments, creating a patchwork of mandates and lockdowns that meant that none of them were ever truly effective since they could be avoided by crossing state or county lines. Everyone here says that the reason the US had so much trouble containing the outbreak is because of our land borders, and this is 100x more of an issue with state borders, except those can‚Äôt be locked down</p>	0.885

So with all that being said, I do think that the 5% would make a difference, even if everyone in the US was making a wholehearted attempt to follow guidelines, which we know isn‚Äôt true even with the fully vaccinated and boosted people.	<p>Population under 19 per wiki is ~3.5 million and this was beer math so pardon if I misspoke, but 5 out of 3.5mil is the 0.00014 number, we can make the arguement that not all of this population has been infected, but unless only 1% of those under the age of 18 have been exposed, then you are still more likely to go to the hospital with a heart condition due to the vaccine than die of covid.</p>	0.863

increased co2 levels typically won't affect you adversely in any way, co2 is actually present in everyone anyway, its why hyperventilation is such an issue, you go into a state of respiratory alkalosis from the rapid breaths outputting co2. as long as your body can output co2 you're fine unless there's some other issue and if you're inhaling too much co2 it will be readily apparent. as far as working from home its just temp because nursing home won't hire new people due to covid currently	6. There is no reason to expect that either the Moderna or Janssen vaccines will not be approved. Both have been shown to be very safe and effective. Pulling them off the market until full approval is reached would only result in increased distrust of those vaccines (""they were pulled from the market!"") and decreased access to patients. The FDA has significant reason to want to keep them going until full approval (see above) and pulling them off can only be negative, and they don't have to pull them off. They have wide authority to continue them in a crisis, which this definitely is, and it's only a net benefit for everyone.	0.852

Let‚Äôs not forget many poor single mothers that seek abortions can‚Äôt see a way to afford the pregnancy itself. Doctors visits with no insurance or bad insurance are very high priced, vitamins, baby supplies etc even on the cheapest most generic you can find adds up to a lot of money. The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child. Pregnancy care is child care and only having a man pay child support after a birth still ends up putting a woman in financial trouble.	Yep.

Answer:üëá  Sadly, it‚Äôs the West that‚Äôs been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia‚Äôs doorstep.  Putin hasn‚Äôt been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It‚Äôs been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What‚Äôs happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‚ÄòRESPONDED‚Äô by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets‚Äô military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America‚Äôs nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn‚Äôt having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn‚Äôt fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we‚Äôre a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.üëá  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	<p>Europe would not be invaded. Do you think if US withdrew then Russia with it&#39;s janky army would launch an attack on Europe with UK and France being nuclear powers? Or even how would they win a conventional war; Europe is shitty when it comes to US if you compare force projection but it is not like there is no army at all for a defensive war.</p>	0.789

The current Republicans are more likely to be supported by voters who don't know the history of the Civil War (hint:  the Southern states seceded over wanting to continue slavery).

More concerning is why any elected official, of any party, would think it acceptable to proclaim registered American citizens not be allowed to vote because of what state they lived in previously?  That's the part to focus on  because it's unAmerican.	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons.

They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge.

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they‚Äôve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don‚Äôt have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it‚Äôs effects, then make another choice and see it‚Äôs effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can‚Äôt sue companies for vaccine injuries, you‚Äôre asking for Foul Play.	There's been a narrative about how ""almost every positive test is attributable to the unvaccinated"" which is meant to imply that if you're unvaccinated you get covid, if you're vaccinated then you don't get covid.	0.895

How is this rejecting history?

DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.

Conservative "blue dog" Democrats (which I was back in the 90s/early 00s) basically are incompatible with the modern Democratic party because we can't support their current brand of blatant anti-Liberalism.

You're woefully misinformed (yet again) so I'm going to help you here:  Did the jab stop people from getting the virus 100%?  Clearly not hill person. Great work. I'm proud of you.  The problem that you're too fucking stupid to realize is that it absolutely diminished a person's ability to get it by a significant factor.  So when you ask questions like that, the answer is YES. IT STOPPED A TON OF PEOPLE FROM GETTING IT. No, not everyone, but many many people. Regardless of what you think.  I know I know, in your small mind everything is black and white. Did it work or didn't it!?   Things can be in the gray area, hill person. The vaccine can prevent a ton of people from getting it all but not everyone and still be a great vaccine.  Does that make it perfect? No Hill person it does not.  If you want a perfect vaccine go ahead and make it yourself - I encourage you!  Nobody ignored your point because you didn't have a point to make.	First one shows a small protection from contracting but zero benefit if you do get the virus. Second is more meaningless because it means everyone in the smaller pop got it. Both suffer from the same issue because you aren&#39;t accounting for how infectious the virus is in general. If it normally spreads to 10% of people and the vaccine stops 2% your numbers don&#39;t make sense. You&#39;re over weighting one side giving you meaningless results</p>	0.87

His claim is in response to republicans changing local election laws in certain places. Whether you agree with him or not, he is saying that the election will be different because some laws have changed since 2020.   Also- nobody has ever suggested there was 0 voter fraud from either side of the aisle. There has been many cases of voter fraud that were identified and prosecuted, but not anything close to enough to change the outcome of even a small local election.	<p>The problem is that election laws <em>were not</em> legally modified in 2020.  In 2020, many state and local officials <em>ignored</em> election laws to accommodate covid.  This is the key point where the Republican argument wins.  For example, Texas law is explicit in disallowing drive-through voting for most people.  Some Texas counties did it anyway.</p>	0.882
‚ÄúObvious sings of voter fraud and irregularities‚Äù  Ok mr. Trump. Where is the proof?   Trump needs to get out of politics.

No I will not vote for him again.	<p>&quot;I told you so&quot; aside, this is a serious issue and the reason he skipped around the subject before the election is because the left and the right <em>both</em> would feel concern by the idea.

You DO realize that eventually that will be the only option left,  don't you? Don't be niave, over the better part of the last century the left has been corrupting every level of our society,  and they're for damn sure not going to show their rules to be voted away.    And violence most definitely IS the answer sometimes. Our rights and freedoms are worth killing to defend, otherwise there never would have been an American revolution. I refuse to lose America as its meant to be because some people are too cowardly to fight for what's worth fighting for. I'll die for those ideals. I swore an oath to the constitution(not to the government) and I still take it seriously. Wise up, evil is real and our enemies are among us.	<p>That being said, the current left is a party that is absolutely a threat to our freedoms and our rights. The major problem with the left is that their platform is all about influence your life more (and the further left it goes it will always digress into authoritarianism), and that is not what America is, or what we stand for, or our culture; we want to be left the fuck alone. And the left wants to change that, which is anti-American, because the more you just keep chipping away eventually there will be no rights or individualism left. Go back 50-60 years ago, the left was nothing like it is today, so maybe those would be some democrats I could agree with.

To them, no life is sanctified at any point even post-birth because the arguments are often the same.

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here‚Äôs my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women‚Äôs bathroom.‚Äù It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women‚Äôs bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms. Turns out if you run a coordinated 4 year propaganda campaign to make someone into Hitler 2.0 and have all intelligence agencies feeding disinfo to fuel the flames the enthusiasm can be outsourced. Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes. Now they just have to hope nobody notices 500,000 people have died over the same time span under their "leadership"	That's the major difference. What I saw on TV with the Capitol riots were 40,000 (not a couple hundred, there were tens of thousands you can count them one by one since we live in a time of HD video) rioters and half of them breached the Capitol. They were chanting to hang the vp in the hundreds. They were hunting for members of congress. That's not a protest. That's not the same as the people standing on that bridge. That's similar to the dozen or so anarchists from last summer, but even they didn't almost decapitate the US government. Plus there was only a couple dozen of them vs tens of thousands of Trump rioters at the Capitol.	0.864
> expert  *J. Alex Halderman professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where he is also director of the Center for Computer Security & Society.*  *After the 2016 United States presidential election, computer scientists, including Halderman, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly, while Clinton won New Hampshire and Maine narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome.*  *On 21 June 2017, Halderman testified before the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.The hearing, titled "Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election" focused on the federal government's role in safeguarding U.S. elections from outside interference.*  *Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Halderman stated that a software glitch during the unofficial vote tally was not caused by fraud, but rather by human error...*  ...*and said the conspiracy theory that a supercomputer was used to switch votes from Trump to Biden was "nonsense".*	We also know that the FBI was aware in 2016 that the entire Russia narrative originated inside the Clinton campaign.  This wasn't even ""oppo research"".  This was literally the campaign ""conjuring up"" the story.  I put that term in quotes because that's how John Brennan characterized it in his notes that he used to brief Obama and Comey.	0.775

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There‚Äôs small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it‚Äôs just so important for us to remember that we‚Äôre protecting ourselves, but we‚Äôre also protecting those little ones who aren‚Äôt yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing:¬†US pediatric hospital admissions for¬†Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334¬†children¬†have been admitted to the hospital with¬†Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services.¬†	<p>Israeli breakthrough has also substantially changed especially when they actually study the population as a hole and not just healthcare workers.  Jerusalems hospital had a caseload of 72 patients - not a lot, but 72 hospitalization 85% of them were vaccinated and they have continued to see this trend.  4 days ago - of all the severe cases in Israel 324 total, 209 were fully vaccinated. So you are telling me they are not the ones spreading it - but are the cohort that is getting the worst symptoms at this time. The situation is fluid, just like this virus - which is why the statistics, Israel&#39;s game plan, and CDC changes its mind with the wind. Months ago they said Pfizer dropped transmission rate by 90% last week the CDC said it&#39;s as likely to spread and is showing the same viral load. The data is incomplete, its fluid,  and it&#39;s that simple. Cognitive dissonance is a thing whether you consider what I said to be a concise zinger or not.</p>	0.863

But also many democrats are making the change to saying it may be time to just get it over with, since Omicron doesn‚Äôt seem like the biggest problem once you have it.	<p>Honestly, a few things I see here.  I think there are some conservatives who are going to stand up and say, my individual rights override your unconstitutional mandate.  There&#39;s also a large chunk of African Americans who are not getting vax&#39;ed.  You never hear about the latter.  You hear Biden blaming Trump supporters for not getting vax&#39;ed.  I believe the vax is highly effective at reducing the symptoms and severity of infection and very so-so at best at controlling the spread.  I also think overall, we have like 70% or so vax&#39;ed.

Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with an adult male having sex with a 13 year old female. *If the female is of reproductive age, and is willing, its just nature.*   Chimps, our closest relative, often give birth to their first baby at the age of 13-14, orangutans are generally 13-15. They have a similar life expectancy to us, if we ignore modern medicine. We have decided as a culture that this is not allowed, and there are good reasons for it, and I am in no way advocating for sex with minors. To say however that it is fundamentally wrong is just incorrect.	<p>The current, and somewhat recent, veneration of abortion as a moral virtue and the outright denial of the humanity of the baby has erased the ability to have an actual conversation on the subject, intentionally so. Our understanding of fetal development allows babies born as early as 22 weeks to be fully viable. We can now literally see into the womb and see a tiny human with its own digestive system, with eyes that move, its gender, or it reacting to the sound of the parents voice. Advancements in technology allow us to see that a baby in the 2nd trimester isn&#39;t &quot;just a clump of cells&quot;.</p>	0.822

Trump made repeated swipes at DeSantis in his interview with OANN(which is propagandist garbage, but the video interviews are at least useful).   He's basically backtracking and gaslighting people on the subject now.   After his repeated flip-flopping and backpeddling, let's not beat around the bush here,   Trump is a coward and doesn't want to make waves when it's politically inconvenient *for him*, especially since DeSantis has broad support among his base as well as actual conservatives who do not support Trump anymore or never did in the first place.   Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	<p>Biden might not be Trump in his mannerisms, but he also gets a lot of help from the media to ignore the fact that he&#39;s really NOT a nice person. I mean for goodness sake there are plenty of times where he blew up on reporters and voters for asking questions he didn&#39;t like, where he said he wished he could punch Trump in the face, &quot;race shamed&quot; black people for even thinking about not voting for him, etc... the guy is no peach either.	0.93

But the entire bulk of the state is overwhelming red and struggling just as much.

It's not about the children it's about who they interact with in their lives.	<p>Also, to answer your question: we don&#39;t mandate diets and exercise because a) that&#39;s authoritarian and ridiculous and b) being fat isn&#39;t contagious and has 0 effect on other people around you.

I will note that it follows that such an individual, or group of individuals, may lack the requisite ability to perceive said social critiques, and therefore may further misinterpret consternation as groundless persecution... Further, the social ineptness of this demographic might be associated with an increased likelihood of reading, following and believing, strange and hyper-specific conspiracy theories</p>	0.82

Not nearly as disturbing as the real killer of police.   From the LEOKA: "257 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty from illnesses related to COVID-19"  Nearly another 250 in 2020.   For perspective, 73 cops were feloniously killed in 2021, and 46 in 2020.  Feel free to keep crying about how this is somehow a democratic president's fault (I couldn't care less about Biden but blaming him is such a stupid stretch). Meanwhile, all you anti-vaxxers are actually the cop killers.  If only you rectal thermometers actually cared about real things.	<p>In this case, Arbery probably wasn‚Äôt an angel, but considering he was murdered by 3 people that the media are trying to paint as typical conservatives with the right‚Äôs full support, it‚Äôs a good thing to state support for Arbery. Hell there are plenty of republican politicians that have committed a crime in the past and then had conservative support when running against a democrat in an election (same goes for dems supporting criminals sometimes).

No blame, exactly, since this is a ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù thing. But literally all of the anti-gerrymandering legislation and lawsuits have been created by Democrats and fought against by Republicans. So this must be what Republicans gambled on and wanted.

True. Mitch does not represent the party but trump doesnt either. Vast majority doesn't like trump after the stunt he pulled on Jan. 6 and numerous investigations he has incurred over the years.	<p>Trump was depicted very badly by the media which was partially why he lost. However, he did himself no favor tweeting garbage and saying nonsense. I still remember that first debate with Biden. That turned off a lot of independents voter right off the bat, and him being sick with Covid allowed Biden to opt out of one of the three debates.

In order to get an unfair edge in a competitive market, corporations can attempt to coerce the state into acting in their interest. Government officials are also not immune to corruption. This is the result of the confluence of these two facts.  There is no lack of a free market here, and there is no lack of private ownership. This corporation is working *within* the system here. This is capitalism*- you just don't like it.*	<p>However, I agree with you that corporations should not have the same constitutional rights as real people. Given the loss of individual share-holders and their replacement by mutual funds (to say nothing of the institutional investors--banks, BlackRock, etc.) they are more able to do as they please because most retail investors have lost their voices because it is the fund managers that have the right to speak.

Because male Circumcision has none of the negative bodily effects that female circumcision does AND has long term health benefits especially around STD transmission.   Comparing that and hacking women apart for Allah is absurd.	In light of current narrative that the jab has basically no side effects (at least that are allowed to be talked about lest it lead to ""vaccine hesitancy""), It's hilarious to watch drug commercials and their inevitable list of horrific side effects that often include death and several other things much worse then the thing they purport to help symptoms of.	0.852

I've been listening to my grandfather rant about dems and libs trying to take away our guns and Mexicans coming into America illegally, raping and stealing our jobs. No one has taken anyone's guns.. Ever.   What jobs? Not high paying jobs.. Maybe doing roofing, painting and landscaping.. Busting they're asses to make sure Americans are comfortable.   Trump...

The CDC says the Covid survival rate of the vaccinated is 99.99%. They also say the death rate of the unvaccinated is 25x higher. What‚Äôs 25x.01. So the unvaccinated survival rate is 99.75%. If we look at total cases and do the math from the Covid deaths.  It comes out to a death rate of 1.6%. Israel the country with the highest vaccination rate in the world is hitting record numbers of Covid. 80% of hospitalized cases of Covid have been obese people. 86% of Covid deaths had underlying health issues such as cancer,pneumonia, respiratory problems. If you‚Äôre young and healthy there is no point.   So let‚Äôs take away 86% of people who died with serious underlying health issues you‚Äôll  end with 561,218 so 652,480 a 561,218 you get 91,262 as total deaths.

For players whose teams don‚Äôt really have a chance at a medal (USA, Canada, Russia, and maybe Finland and Sweden), that‚Äôs a huge risk (plus the risk of injury) for very little gain. The NHL is trying to further dissuade participation by not paying players quarantined in China. It would be spectacular if a US/Canada-based group organized a competing hockey tournament here to avoid those restrictions and got the monopoly on NHL talent, which would drive people towards that and legitimize it while giving China and the IOC the farce of an Olympics they deserve.</p>	0.785

Right, so by you‚Äôre logic you‚Äôre quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can‚Äôt support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it‚Äôs acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It‚Äôs the ‚Äòparents responsibility‚Äô to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they‚Äôll suddenly ‚Äòget it‚Äô and do a good job‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	<p>All it comes down to is does someone think developing humans deserve the same rights as birthed humans.

You're fine with us going back on our promises to protect a country that had the means to protect itself until we took it away? How does that look to all our allies?  Look up the Budapest Memorandum	Trump warned Putin that he was going to bomb Assad's army cause he wouldn't quit gassing his people. He made it clear that it didn't matter to him that Putin was supporting Assad. He just understandably warned Russia since they had some of their army there and Trump didn't want to start a war with Russia over it.	0.863
The oil companies had the ability to make enough gas for everyone. It‚Äôs not like over the pandemic everyone doubled how many cars they had. We stopped driving over the pandemic and so companies stopped production because less demand. Now that restrictions have been lessening, people are driving like they used to, and so prices are going up. But companies are still running on their reduced production, which is driving prices up.   This is so simple, and the article (a professional in the industry, with more knowledge than you or me) has said that it‚Äôs not a political problem. Get over yourself.	<p>Meanwhile California goes through rolling blackouts on a yearly basis which is somehow still republicans fault because &quot;climate change&quot; even though we have continued to reduce emissions both total and per capita as a country while watching world wide emissions rise from &quot;developing countries&quot; immune to all the of regulations we place on ourselves, essentially we NIMBY pollution to 3rd world countries and accomplish almost nothing for the environment other than making people feel good about &quot;doing something&quot;.</p>	0.844

I don't get why more don't see this.  Collapse the economy, who are the vast majority going to turn to?  None of all that pussy footing around / slow steady climb towards socialist / communist state.  It's what most of them want at this point.  Hell, the majority of Reddit would absolutely, *happily* vote towards that end.	<p>As for most dems wanting a blend - at least in the internet arguments I see and pushes from the media, I don‚Äôt see that being the case at all. I‚Äôm sure the common democrat is that way, but that‚Äôs not how the party is skewing. You can‚Äôt have the best aspects of capitalism when there‚Äôs a constant push for ‚Äúequity‚Äù the way that it is defined today. The current narrative that I see is all about bringing down the rich man to prop up the poor man. Throw race in there and it gets even messier.</p>	0.838
Democrat here - we do not claim rioters and looters as our own, and they are ‚Äúself-confessed‚Äù as one. In reality they‚Äôre a part of an anarchist party, that just doesn‚Äôt believe any politics unless it benefits themselves - not even people in similar situations.	Leftists shouldn't be showing up at people's houses using human amplifier chains to cause a disturbance. Leftists should respect basic needs for privacy. Leftists should not push to cancel people for having diversity of political thought. Leftists should not de-platform, shun, misreport, ostracize, demonize and malign those who do not share their view. None of these practices work in the long haul. In the long haul your cause is cheapened by these thuggish tactics that seek to sway by threat and coercion rather than sway by the strength of reasoned argument.	0.817

1. It doesn't exist, meaning it's just socialism. That's my point.  2. Learn some reading comprehension. You failed to actually understand my comment and brought up something I never claimed. And fyi if you can't be democrat and socialist at the same time you can't have Democratic socialism. 3. Lol "it's a whole other thing" just admit you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Also stop projecting, it's annoying as fuck. I listed 4 things with taxation being one of them. We have one of THE most progressive tax systems in the world which by definition is socialist (taking more from some to provide benefits to all). If you want to talk about implementing a non socialist flat tax system I'm al ears. Otherwise I think I'm done chatting since you obviously don't even know what they thing you're promoting is  Edit: and no that is not the only form of socialism. It's redistribution of wealth. Not shared ownership (which is either socialism or communism)	<p>And the interesting thing, given that this is a Conservative subreddit, is that it&#39;s a socialist idea. That people aren&#39;t allowed to vote with their money, or decide for themselves, but that the government is to tell me that I&#39;m not even allowed to choose a business which requires vaccination. That is far from the land of the free, and it&#39;s scary how fast people tout socialist ideas as soon as it&#39;s even remotely near what they want in that specific question.</p>	0.847

Let‚Äôs be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what ‚Äúside‚Äù they‚Äôre on. So don‚Äôt try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I‚Äôm not.   But you‚Äôre trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn‚Äôt be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn‚Äôt clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to ‚Äúprotest‚Äù a ‚Äústolen‚Äù election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	I would say though that both sides would benefit from shunning their extremists. The right should be disgusted with the neo nazis and the anti democracy factions that appear. The left should be disgusted with the property destroying and hate fuelled ""protesters"" on their side. I think we fall victim to understanding where those extremes came from, and start to defend them, but we shouldn't defend disgusting behavior.	0.9

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you‚Äôve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	If the vaccine prevents you from being hospitalized because it lessens symptoms, but affords minor protection against infection... what is the point? The entire argument for universal masking for the past year has been to prevent asymptomatic spread. If you still have a high likelihood of catching covid, but a lower propensity to have severe symptoms, the vaccine *encourages* asymptomatic spread.	0.906

Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.

Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket. If Boebert and MTG are the future of the party, then Alex Jones deserves to be the chairman.	<p>And all that being said -  twitter is essentially a monopoly to a politician getting their message out.

Nope. Are you claiming all those 5 million were from unvaccinated? How about the fact that there have been more deaths since Biden took over as there was when Trump was President, and Biden has had the vaccine with over half the United States  vaccinated? The vaccine is really having an effect isn‚Äôt it?	<p>Now let‚Äôs say the cases have fallen to 500 per day due to vaccinations. Let‚Äôs say ANOTHER 250 people test positive. This gives a 50% breakthrough rate. However, we‚Äôve <strong>already</strong> had a 99.5% reduction in cases due to vaccines (100,000 down to 250).

Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   ‚ÄúYou only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.‚Äù Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let‚Äôs be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao‚Äôs China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	<p>And well, the way I see it, &quot;The government is not stifling your speech, Twitter is.&quot; is a clear cut argument against capitalism.

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	cancel culture is forced on us, by using measures to manipulate emotion regardless of ideology. considering personalized advertisements and posts in general on online posts, at best i would have seen maybe two articles from smaller news sources, within a span of a day for most topics of such nature that lean towards my political views. i couldn‚Äôt give a damn less about cancel culture yet for whatever reason, they find any which way to push their narrative whether it be a movie scene/ad or a video game collab. the difference is that this isn‚Äôt forced into your normal day to day life, meaning you‚Äôd never see politics in a child‚Äôs video game, and yes that has happened.	0.846

Regardless, the double standard is ludicrous. The overcorrection of legitimate social issues has turned into a witch hunt against straight white men. It‚Äôs almost laughable tbh, it‚Äôs like yeah, there are social issues that stem from the system as a whole, but people fail to realize that it‚Äôs a rich vs poor issue, because of the emotional attachment that the media takes and spins, which captivates the infatuation of self pity by these types of people, and instead of bettering themselves, it‚Äôs easier to create a scapegoat and blame someone else for their short comings in life.	0.851

So, you understand that a Gallup poll regarding a presidential election three years before a presidential election doesn't matter. I think the smart ones realize that these politicians aren't your friends. Trump never cared about you. Ted Cruz doesn't care about Americans.  Biden's approval ratings have been low, but still not as low as Trump's approval ratings. Let's just focus on facts because saying the left is scared doesn't make sense when Trump managed to lose the House, Senate, and White House in one term.	The more wiser portion of the base along with independents/dems do not buy this trumpian nonsense about the Kraken or whatever b/s being peddled by these grifters. There is no fucking ""ballot trafficking"" that is going to be exposed. There wasn't any to begin with (on a massive scale)! Focusing any calories on the past is not helpful.

It was trump's nonsensical drum beating about voter fraud in georgia that cause decreased turnout in the bumpkin portion of the state.

Well when they tried the vaccine for swine flu it killed more than the allowable amount of people in the trials so they stopped the trials and never released the vax.

Early on the polio vax messed up a lot of people.	<p>I do however think Covid is a terrible disease and I have actually had 12 people I know die from it in Vietnam (aged 35 to 70, all living rather unhealthy life styles as is the norm there).  7 of those 12 were fully vaxed, then another 2 I know died directly from the vaccine.  The vaccines are currently delaying for a few months the next (and thanks to vaccines stronger) wave while adding a whole bunch more problems to the mix.

I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.  True conservatives love thy neighbor, and if you're getting your neighbors sick then you aren't practicing that tenant.	<p>I completely understand the argument that the government shouldn‚Äôt tell you what to do with your body when it concerns your body, for example eating healthily, regularly seeing a doctor, or working out. However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn‚Äôt you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous. Interested to hear your thoughts assuming anyone actually replies.</p>	0.871

A little off topic but governments of the world have literally murdered millions. Why suddenly do they care about saving EVERY single person with a vaccine that does literally nothing. Remember flint michigan? remember all the lives they could have saved for in comparison terms was a drop in the bucket as far as what they spend now on covid? Now suddenly they care oh sooooo much about you. Get real.	Picture this scenario. An alien overlord looks down on Earth and finds that he really likes pennies, but hates humans. He will kill 2,000 people per day, but for every 2% of the human population who carries a penny in their pocket at all times in public, he will reduce the number of people he kills by 1%. So if everyone keeps a penny on them in public, 1,000 people per day will still die, but 1,000 people per day will be spared.	0.851
So‚Ä¶ the democratic presidents did better than the republicans is what you‚Äôre saying?

I believe there‚Äôs a much better chance for the Republicans to win in 2024 if the candidate isn‚Äôt Trump, because then the Democrats have less ammo.</p>	0.837
