Congratulations on getting rid of that whole person.  NTA, diets are problematic at the best of times and a night off every now and then is fine, you should be enjoying what you eat whether it is ‘healthy’ food or not.  Also, you don’t need another person to police what you put in your mouth, you are quite capable of doing that for yourself.  Alan seems to have mistaken boyfriend for prison guard, how dare he interfere with your food like that, and make humiliating comments in front of other people, not only is that incredibly rude it is also disrespectful and dismissive of you and your bodily autonomy.  He also doesn’t get to then expect you to pay for the food he stole from you, or the food he ordered to replace it.  At $10.00 that’s the cheapest couples etiquette lesson he’ll ever get, always supposing he actually learns from it.  By the way that doesn’t make you a gold digger, it makes him a jerk, although I suspect he was that long before the dinner.  P.s.  There is nothing wrong with being ‘on the heavier side’, if you are comfortable in your skin and healthy then it’s up to you whether or not you diet or splurge a little.	The reality is there are NAH. OP should be able to eat and cook the foods they enjoy and the BF should be able to live in an environment free from things he finds repulsive. The problem only comes in when one is forcing the other. They boyfriend is an asshole if he forbids the OP from doing it, the OP is an asshole if they do things they know make the BF repulsed (regardless if the rest of us feel those things are normal).	0.884
NTA. OP, just about everybody poops when they’re giving birth. It’s embarrassing, but it is 100% normal. I guarantee you his mother pooped when she gave birth to him. I’m sorry he’s being so insensitive, he deserved to be snapped at. If he’s okay with embarrassing you in front of everyone, he shouldn’t have a problem with you embarrassing him right back. He’s a jerk.	You are 100% not overreacting about it. You are just being a parent, who is rightfully upset that this person cut your child's hair. You're correct, this is sick and toxic behaviour. Absolutely disgusting that an adult would do this to a child, especially in order to fit fucking gender-norms out of everything. Fuck that shit.	0.879
NTA. You don't buy plane tickets on a vague invitation. You even specified "We will be glad to have them over Spring Break", explicitly NOT during the winter vacation.	<p>But the next time you go on holiday with them don&#39;t do anything for bro and gf. <em>Do nothing for them</em>. Nothing!</p>	0.833
NO. WHAT A DICK. I hope he matures before your daughter becomes " of age".  He knew it wasnt funny bc he already tried this with your family. Unfortunately, his family CLEARLY taught him his ways. Sorry. I think i would have lost it on my boys if they did that. What an ungrateful childish boy. To intentionally humiliate you is a huge"flashing neon RED flag" . Honestly if he keeps it up, I would be done.	<p>Your brother agreed to the &quot;adults only&quot; invitation, then disregarded it. This is unethical. It&#39;s unethical of the rest of the family to support this. Your dad shouldn&#39;t be angry with you, he should be upset with himself for not teaching your brother to keep his word. Raising a son who will be dishonest and manipulative towards his brother is a shameful thing.</p>	0.917
>I don’t think u can call it a punishment-that indicates OP or someone is dishing it out.  but it very much is. we understand cause and effect...    >. Life isn’t fair, kid can blame OP all she wants for not getting what her siblings got but it’s not their fault at all.  I never said it was their fault... but you have to understand the situation...   This is exactly the argument the sister made about the bullies... it's not her fault, she can't control what they do.   Her parents said tough luck we're in control this is how we're punishing you.   then something happened because of that punishment that was out of the parents control and they want to go "it's not our fault! we can't control this!"   what message does that send exactly? they took control and cancelled the party without a care or a thought to any other potential ramifications when there could have been a different punishment and because of that they lost control of the situation and irreparably damaged their child's start in life.   they have to own up to losing control of everything because they were the ones who imposed the control in the first place.   it's not even necessarily about fault... it's about being the bigger person than your 17 year old kid...   >It was extra crappy of her to allow it to happen to anyone, let alone a family member.  that does not in any way justify the result...	<p>Let ex know his daughter is not entitled to an invitation anywhere. Especially when she is a bully. Your daughter invited her friends and his daughter is not one of them. It&#39;s clear she learned to be a bullly from her mom, since she tried to bully you and your older daughter into spending more time.</p>	0.928
I'm going to ignore this.	<p>I don’t want to.</p>	0.888
NTA good for you on starting the new year by shedding over 100lbs of boyfriend right at the start. He is an AH, and the moment I read he commented on your dinner choice I wanted to chew him out for you. You keep being you.	My husband loves food. He will happily eat anything I leave once we’re both finished. But here’s the kicker; he waits for me to be finished. He checks that I don’t want it for lunch the next day and then he eats it.	0.83
I think NAH.  You definitely did the right thing. Becoming homeless just so one day your sister can have a house is not practical.  However I kind of get how your sister feels? It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	<p>The solution is very delicate. It&#39;s very bad for you to give her even $1 in this way, it should be because you want to, not bcs she forces you to. It impacts your growing-up process. Second, she&#39;s still your mother and you should understand her wrong way of thinking. I cannot tell you do this or this because i don&#39;t know your mother and reasons and bg etc. I hope you got my point and good luck with her!</p>	0.871
It doesn’t suck. It just doesn’t exist.	IT STILL DOESN’T MATTER!	0.926
Well that was one of your shorter dances but a dancing troll is still a dancing troll! I give it a 4/10, as there is definitely room for improvement and you’re relying on repetitive moves when you could be doing new ones	<p>Good thing is, if all these have plopped up later in life they&#39;re usually almost completely reversible! It&#39;s just a very stressful journey to find &amp; fix the trigger.  I&#39;m only having the normal amount of lactose issues now and mild histamine problems,  rest is completely gone. Well, maybe if I eat an entire pack of cream cheese I get constipated, but nowhere near as bad - and I have a genetic predisposition.  So it&#39;s definitely able to improve <em>some</em> in your case</p>	0.762
It's obviously a made up story, but in case it isn't : Esh.  1.Your daughters behaviour is the result of the treatment they got from you and your mistress/wife. None of you cared about how your relationship would affect their lives 2.You didn't cared that you ruined their life, brought a stranger into their lives and forced them to love her otherwise they were punished.  3.I don't blame your ex wife for hating you or sara.  4. Sara had no qualms in having an affair to a married man and ruining a marriage, while at the same time crying that your daughters didn't love her. I have no respect for women who have affairs with married men.	<p>You are not the asshole for enacting boundaries. You love your parents, you love your family and she’s trashing them because she didn’t get wedding money. How petty! Now she’s poised to retaliate against you for not blindly taking her side! She’s willing to torpedo your relationship and has damaged her standing with her future in-laws over her bad behavior.</p>	0.922
They aren't mentally disabled. They just walk out the bathroom until I catch them and tell them to go back. Plus the cases in Maryland are high and my daughters actually go into school/ university. I'm not taking that risk.	Have a clear, understandable end to the sleepovers, such as starting high school. Don't make it a big thing, or tie it to trust, just have it as an inevitable ""you're older now"" Just like how it'd be fine to have baths together if they were 4, but not now.	0.768
The people who think luck determines these things are the people who don’t make the right choices that lead to success. You have the choice to put yourself in a good position. You have the choice to choose a high-paying field and educate yourself in that field. You have the choice to network. Your position at the end of college is a result of your choices. And thank you for calling me successful. Sit down.	<p>I do think you&#39;re being a bit of an asshole by whining about the possibility of having your speech taken away, though. Your position is due to popularity, sure, but the speech is a privilege, not a right. They want a student who is a good role model to give that speech. And remember, if you want to do well at college, slacking off isn&#39;t going to help you at all.</p>	0.831
Don't listen to these  snowflakes..Your  grandpa is a great man!...learn all you can about business...Most of his life is in the rear view and he has decades of knowledge he will take with him.	Hi I’m new to this thread. Background: I (19m) collect and restore vintage snowmobiles as a hobby. My grandfather owns a small sized machine that I rode as a kid and he asked me to fix it up as my cousins were flying in to visit. I did a stellar job on everything and my grandfather held me to a very high standard (made me repaint the hood twice to make it perfect). the whole operation including paint cost me around 80 hours and $300 in paint and hardware, and my grandfather bought $200 original decals.	0.788
Um 1. Unsolicited rude comments about your weight and diet 2. Grabbing your food like some middle school bully 3. Expecting you to pay for food that you ate but did not order 4. Calling you a gold digger and an asshole for standing up for yourself 5. Embarrassing you in front of your friends. Obviously you’re NTA and Alan rearranges to anal cuz he’s an asshole.	<p>I&#39;m sorry but FUCK YOUR FRIEND WITH A GIANT CHAIN SAW FOR BEING A STUCK UP ASSHOLE! People that think it&#39;s &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; or whatever to make foods from other countries are dumber then a box of rocks.</p>	0.874
no. I'm not.	You are not it.	0.97
Are you stupid? You're saying no one EVER had nightmares after watching sobering scary?  What the actual fuck is going on in this post? No one is using their brains	After this whole episode I never had any contact with Rebecca, and the reason I am making this post now is the following:	0.835
Was your boyfriend rase in pig stall?  he total pig that been nice to him tell him lean some etiquette if need help know what that google basic table etiquette. you are not asshole	<p>TA or not, it would be a right &amp; nice thing for OP to go to sister &amp; be like &quot;Listen, I&#39;m sorry that whole thing screwed up your evening, I ordered the darn thing b/c I didn&#39;t have any food downstairs and I asked the guy to bring it to the side door so the kids wouldn&#39;t see but he screwed it up. Sorry that happened. And listen, I really like your cooking, I just have a thing about eggplant, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>	0.824
I am not trolling, I feel what I did was justified by Kate ignoring me and betraying our friendship. You have the mental issues if you can't understand friendship.	<p>Then you would get a diff verdict from me.  Because that would have been honest and the real reason you’re upset.  Bringing up the gifts isn’t useful and was done as a way to be nasty only.  No one said you had to get anything.  It wasn’t part of the real issue.</p>	0.877
nobody is saying they stole it... that's gonna be a texas sized woosh from me dawg.	You didn&#39;t let him eat anything he was allergic to and the food was 100% vegan. I don&#39;t see the problem...	0.739
yeah you're right. the teenaged girl made a mistake... why are you making her out to be the fucking devil?   >She could have trauma till the day she dies because her stepsister didn't defend her and make her "friends" stop,  and what do you think being saddled with an extra 40k in debt all of a sudden will do to her? it's not an appropriate punishment and she's owed an apology for how things worked out.     > She's not entitled to Money she didn't "earn"  I would not let that be how my kid starts their journey in the world... It goes against everything I stand for personally. sorry you disagree. sorry you think it's worth sticking it to your own kid like that over a punishment you made that went sideways.   I can only hope they'd forgive you eventually but if it was me I don't think I ever would.	-Went ""off the rails"" on his wife because she said she thought it was a bit too much money & didn't want to give monthly payments to his 35 year old sister with an employed husband, none of whom appear to be anywhere near food insecurity or the level of ""kid will steal toys because his parents can't afford any""	0.92
She cheated on his son multiple times that makes her guaranteed untrustworthy.	Her behaviour is very, very weird and she seems to have an almost unhealthy relationship with her brother that she has to destroy any relationship he's in. Has she accused any of his other partners of being abusive?	0.88

Yeah you do if its a family member	For your family:	0.868
NTA. Wow!! You should report her to management. Her behaviour is shocking. Firstly why on earth would she assume you are single. I'm a dad, and sometimes we all shop together, sometimes just my wife and kids, sometimes just me and the kids. Secondly, her reaction makes no sense, what you did is in no way disrespectful.	<p>You know, all we have is her version of what her husband does, and we have to take that at face value.  I&#39;ve never been a fan of the trope where the husband let&#39;s the wife do all the shopping and presents and holiday-stuff, that&#39;s not what teamwork looks like to me, you know, at this point is just sexist enough to count as misogyny.  My partner and I don&#39;t really do Christmas or Birthdays, but if we did, we&#39;d shop together, we&#39;d buy that stuff together.</p>	0.883
TIL you're a moron	<p>Move out thats advanced stupid right there</p>	0.85
lmao. Because the only reason to respect women is to fuck them right? You sound dumb.	<p>There’s still a chance to not turn this into “wow that girl is a self absorbed asshole with no manners, what a fucking bitch... if she were a dude...” 🥱</p>	0.851
You sound like a bitter ex wife yourself lol...  His phones only blowing up because his bitter ass ex is concerned only about money. Instead of reprimanding the children for doing something that would be considered wrong no matter what the situation, her main concern is keeping that vital cashflow intact.   Also, nowhere in here does it say affair. People are allowed to fall out of love and move on with their lives. Affair or not, kids would've felt some type of way regardless. That doesn't justify them bullying the new girl then expecting things to carry on as usual	And parents paying or not is up to them. Op didn&#39;t ask them to not pay. Yes op laughed about her Sil wanting the money still and that is wrong but why are you disregarding everything else because of that lol? And op didn&#39;t ask if she was TA for that lol.	0.914
omg nice I’m also in eu, pls send me ur uid :). And it depends what your looking for yujin is a support that increases normal attack damage while yanfei is a dps. Or you could just go for the character u like more :D	<p>Hope you can bail once you&#39;re 18. Life get so much more serene once you can cut out toxic parents.

YTA. But more importantly what the actual f is wrong with you? You throw a sentient living being that you supposedly cared for in the trash? You’re a sad, sad person. Shame on you for not have the mental acumen to deal with a tough conversation with your kids that is going to happen no matter what, so you just throw your dog away with the rest of your trash. You’re pathetic.	<p>This makes me so mad!  Idiots who think their kids should be allowed to pet any dog even though the owner says no. The real loser in all of this is the poor dog.</p>	0.902
It’s hilarious that you think any of us want trains when we have cars and actual personal autonomy to go anywhere.	<p>The sheer audacity of this particular favor....I’d tell them to F off if they asked to borrow your car...but a wedding venue of ALL things.</p>	0.739

time to start saving...   they put their kid in debt over a petty punishment that no longer fits the crime.... they have a few years before that debt starts accruing interest to save to pay it off... I haven't seen anyone, op or otherwise even mention this that they can fully help their kid not be trapped under the mountain of debt they saddled on them. they don't seem to care though and if I was the daughter I would notice that.  either make amends. do your best to make your kid whole... or respect that they are going to want nothing to do with you in the future.	<p>And yes, OP, YTA, if only because of the way you talk about your daughter and let your husband speak about the situation.  You may not have the money to help her out, and you are no longer legally required too support her.  I understand that.  However, you don&#39;t even seem sympathetic toward the situation; you seem incredibly cold.   She is your child, and she has a major disability.  Did you not give any thought to her future?  Make any plans to help her into adulthood?  Sounds like your husband and possibly also you just see her as a financial burden, not a person.</p>	0.89

He did it with the thinking his son wasn't going to get the test. It is very possible his girlfriend would try to make him raise another man's bio kid since she is a known cheater. He is son is clearly a moron with no backbone who blindly trusts his girlfriend despite knowing she doesn't respect him hence the cheating. If he found out the kid wasn't his he could at least warn his son of the fact and maybe that would make him wake up.	Your dad is acting very egocentric for not considering your complaints about the bully (stepsister, well maybe step-bully). He dismissed your feelings entirely and married the bully's mother because he was focused on nothing but his own feelings.
