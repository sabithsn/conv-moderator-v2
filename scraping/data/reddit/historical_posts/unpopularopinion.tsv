0,t3_rw1jb1,Recasting should be used 100% more in TV and Movies,"For some reason the general public finds it disrespectful to the actor if a role is recast, but in my opinion real life issues that make an actor not able to play a role anymore typically just leads to bad writing and a is a detriment to the project. I do admire actors, and I think some roles are iconic but if we as a audience got used to recasting I think it would be a net positive. I got to thinking about this while talking to a friend about Black Panther 2, obviously Chadwick Boseman was amazing in the role of T'Challa but with his unfortunate passing I feel like it only makes sense to recast. If Chadwick were still alive no one would think it would make sense to have T'Challa die offscreen (or however else Marvel would explain his absence) so doing it because he died in real life doesn't make any sense to me. We can respect the performance and impact of Chadwick Boseman the actor while not ruining the character of T'Challa the two are not mutually exclusive. This take isn't just for Black Panther I really think it applies anytime an essential character's actor can't be in the role anymore.
I remember Spartacus on Starz, the lead actor passed away after season one, so season two was a prequel and season three he had been recasted, I didn't love the new actor as much at first, and the show wasn't great really anyway, but I eventually got around to liking him and the show until it ended.
Moral of the story, I don't think it's disrespectful to recast. If there is a real world reason for an actor to be out of a role that is still needed for the storytelling, they should be recast and we as an audience should try and adjust to the change. I'm sure not every recast would be good, and I'm sure some shows and movies would bomb if they chose wrong but for me adjusting to a recast is better than bad writing to get rid of an essential character.",1.0

2,t3_rw1dmw,It doesn’t matter what version or variation of “thank you” people say only how you take it.,"Basically occasionally people get in little debates about the proper thank you. Whether someone should say thank you, no problem, you’re welcome, nod, say don’t worry about. Even English teachers teaching people they shouldn’t say certain phrases like they’re wrong (as a native English speaker none of them are wrong cuz they achieve the goal of accepting the gratitude). People talk about how they take it and what seems more polite but ultimately they’re all fine and should be taken as fine. The only people who suck are those who actually take it personally or even worse twist it to being rude. At the end of the day, if someone acknowledges your thank you with any response it should be taken as enough and move on. Trying to make one ruder or the proper way to say “thank you” is just exhaustive and unnecessary. They acknowledged it and attempted in their way to be polite that should be enough. If you’re upset or offended someone said “no problem” instead of “you’re welcome” the problem isn’t their use of the language, it’s you.",2.0

However, getting suddenly ghosted or left behind *too* often could definitely indicate a much bigger problem. How is it so that almost every single person you meet does not build a lasting acquaintanceship with you? They can't all be secretly conspiring against you, so what is the common denominator? 
 
Hint: it's the man in the mirror.


I've seen this in my own life. I used to be an individual that people avoided and didn't like to be around with after too long. Instead of taking a good, hard look at myself, I began to blame others and say that everyone is fake, bad, horrible and so on. It was so much easier to pretend that everyone else was the problem. After some self-evaluation, I began to see certain aspects of myself that made me difficult to become acquainted with. Eventually, I had to decide if I loved my attitude more, or the companionship of others. Upon choosing the latter, I then saw what needed to be changed within myself. I started to build more lasting relationships, with the exception of a few bad ones here and there.",6.0

The only reason this is perceived as “weak” is because the vast majority of people either don’t care about the state of the other party or are incapable of picking up on it. I still think saying it all the time may be an indicator that the surrounding people are not very compatible, as they are not reassuring enough on their own that they are not annoyed with the actions of the person that is saying sorry, and therefor there are other, more compatible people out there that the sorry-sayer may not need to say sorry “all the time” around, and they should seek those people if the sorry-saying is too much for them.

20,t3_rw0eqf,i like james cameron`s avatar and i really don`t get why so many people hate it,"there are many movies out there that are extremely divisive. noah, the village, the hobbit trilogy, pretty much zack snyder\`s entire filmography, and many others. however, one movie that i really don\`t get why it\`s so divisive is james cameron\`s avatar. now, obviously not everyone is gonna like the same movies. however, the people who don\`t like avatar don\`t just not like it. THEY FUCKING HATE IT! and honestly, i really don\`t get why because it\`s actually a really good movie.

of course, i may be a bit biased here because, when i was a little tike, i saw avatar in theaters and it blew my tiny elementary school aged mind. the experience was so awesome that, years later as an adult, it is still one of my most vivid memories of going to the movies. and i was not alone because, back when it was originally released, it was the toast of hollywood. it became the highest grossing movie of all time, a record that it held for a decade. and at the academy awards, it was nominated for 9 academy awards including best picture. this movie was really beloved.

however, in recent years, the film community has done a complete 180 in regards to it\`s opinion on this movie. seemingly overnight, avatar has gone from one of the most loved movies of this century to one of the most hated. the hatred for avatar is so big that, when avengers endgame came out in theaters, there was a running joke that people should buy tickets to it for the soul purpose of dethroning avatar as the highest grossing movie. call me old fashioned but the idea of going to see a movie for the soul purpose of dethroning another movie just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.

after all these years, my opinion towards avatar still has not changed. it\`s still the technical marvel that i saw when i was a little tike. of course, i\`m not saying that the movie is perfect. it is a bit cliche. however, i do feel that this is one case where the good stuff about it definitely outweighs the bad.

there\`s actually one specific complaint about avatar that i want to address. many people have criticized avatar due to it\`s similarities to Pocahontas and dances with wolves. do you know how many movies are released every year? not just in america mind you! the whole world! there have been many movies released over the decades and there will probably be many more. with how many movies there are, some of them are going to be similar. not every movie can be parasite and be 100% original. 

bottom line, despite the negative reception it\`s gotten over the years, i still stand firm in my belief that avatar is a really solid movie. i cannot wait for the sequels to come out(whenever that might be. serious james cameron. we\`ve been waiting for a decade. just release them already).",0.0

""Don't forget about this guy, he's the world's strongest, You thought those guys were strong, well he's stronger times infinity! Hold on a sec, let me grab some at this point meaningless feats to show you how strong he is""

Honestly believe the story would be infinity times stronger without that pace breaker of a character even being in the series.

Without trophy hunters being willing to pay big money to hunt these older animals, it is almost certain animals with declining numbers would continue to decline due to lack of protection from poachers, from aggressive pack mates, and lack of protection to lands they live in.

I feel like restaurants have started focusing on making their plates really pretty but as a result don't pat as much attention to just making really delicious food. This is especially true for regular foods, like tacos and sandwiches, which can be really goddamn good even if they aren't very pretty to look at. Why make tacos and sandwiches super pretty for photos when they're meant to be eaten, not photographed?

It's also true for higher end places, like the Michelin starred places where they do all kinds of molecular gastronomy shit and everything is a turned into a foam or caramelized with a blowtorch or frozen with liquid nitrogen.

70,t3_rvt59x,The Last Jedi was a great film,"Before I make my case I'll say I'm a Star Wars fan but not a megafan. I've seen the original trilogy numerous times and have all the films including the prequels and sequels on Blu ray. I'm not old enough  to have seen the first films at the cinema but saw the re-releases in 1997.

People like to dump on TLJ but IMO it's the best of the trilogy and the best film since the original trilogy. It's far better than the Rise of Skywalker which just goes to show you can't make a film based on fan service. 

Fans complained that the Force Awakens was just a remake of a New Hope but when TLJ dared to be different it seemed fans just wanted a retread of The Empire Strikes Back. We have the original trilogy it isn't going to be bettered. Why shouldn't they try something different? Some of the complaints don't hold weight for me. For example it makes sense that Luke had changed since the events of Return of the Jedi. He thought he'd saved the Galaxy and yet things were as bad as ever. Why wouldn't this make him feel bitter and lose faith? Characters should evolve and change over time. This makes them more interesting and beliveable. Luke's story makes sense to me. Him being the same Luke as Return as the Jedi wouldn't work. 

The film wasn't perfect, the Leia force thing was daft and the casino bits felt out of place but overall there was much to enjoy. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren I felt worked and relationship between them  was the best thing about the film for me. I don't really care that they killed off Snoke. For me Kylo Ren was a far more complex and nuanced villain. 

TLJ dared to take the Star Wars franchise I to new areas of possibility but it seems fans just want to churn out remakes of the first trilogy. It had some amazing visuals. The throne room, the dreadnought, the battle at the end of the film. The Rise of Skywalker is proof that the backlash against the film was wrong. Disney should have backed Rian Johnson and we might have got a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy but instead we got a disappointing hot mess instead.",0.0

Guess what, everyone gains energy when they're alone reading a book, listening to music, just relaxing etc. You get drained socializing because you are socially inept.
Likewise, theres no such thing as a person that gains ""energy"" by being social all the time, even the most hardcore social person will get drained eventually and would prefer alone time.

If we survey for introversion or extroversion, it will result in a bell curve. The point is, you are not born an introvert or an extrovert, there is no such thing as an introverted or extroverted identity, no such thing as a naturally introverted or extroverted person, and no such thing as a naturally introverted but capable of extroverted activities kind of person or vice versa,  you are a normal person that are affected by many factors that turn you into becoming more of an introvert or an extrovert in any given moment and in general, factors such as social ineptitude and low self esteem, or factors such as social adeptness and narcissism.

Edit: introversion and extroversion are just good shorthands for other factors, its not an innate identity.",0.0

2. I’m gay. Same as before.
3. Nothing around for miles. Nothing to do nowhere to go just boring small town things. There’s no malls no hot topic or box lunch or salons or spas just a general store.  I’m a city guy. So there’s no variety. Everything is quiet still and passive aggressive. I walk around and I just can’t do anything. The diners are all the same. The most ethnic food is Taco Bell and Panda Express. It’s like really dark. Uber eats just isn’t an option. There’s nothing fun to do besides like hunting or whatever. You’re shunned for hiring a repair man. Everything is like one giant diy. I don’t like driving and just take the bus ubers or just get a ride. I know how to I just don’t want to.

5. Everyone is in your business. Like “oh what are you using it for.” “If you’re doing that then there’s this here more expensive yet better model because of obscure reason 457” like damn homie I’m here to buy rope.

95,t3_rvoeag,"So called ‘Social Experiment’ TV Shows such as “Rich Kids Go Skint” “Rich House, Poor House” “Can’t Pay, We’ll Take It Away” and many more glamourises poverty and financial struggles, it is essentially poverty porn. They should not be aired.","Title says it all really. 

Here in the UK stations such as the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5 (Also, MTV). Have all played a part in this. 

I’ll start with Channel 5, they air so many of these kind of shows. The end conclusion is always the same, you get some spoilt kid, staring into the camera coming to the ‘sudden realisation’ that this “experience has changed their life” and then show said person driving off in a Rolls Royce and catching up with them a few months later. They’ve completely forgotten about the family. 

It’s fucking embarrassing. These people spend X-amount of time with a financially poor or struggling working class family, live in their home or spending a day or so with the family to “really connect to their struggle”. I know some will say well both sides are getting paid. So what’s the harm? I bet you that the poorer side is getting very little money for the “social experiment”. Also, put yourself in their shoes, someone offers you some cash and you’re already financially struggling, are you really going to say, no?. The way these tv execs go on too, say one thing and do a other. 

The TV execs who finances all this probably sits there belly laughing as he untugs his shrivelled ball sack from his inner thigh at the idea of using people with lack of income to gain TV traffic. If I recall correctly there was a report that came out some years ago which showed the tv crew on one of these shows, literally after every recording the main “rich” woman involved was rushed straight back to a Hilton hotel to “cleanse” after shooting finished. They even did a follow up.. of the woman. Not the financially struggling family. 

Noticeably Channel 4 made a huge stir some years ago when the show “Benefits Street” was aired, it wasn’t the same TV model as what I mentioned up there ^ but it portrayed families whom were on welfare, struggled with drug/alcohol addiction in both a very stereotypical negative light. It got a massive conversation going, tons of complaints. 

**The BBC** 

The station that swears they had absolutely **no idea** for 20+ years of the goings on of that disgusting filthy prick Jimmy Saville. Steering away from that...

BBC does do some good for charity, not denying it. But they’ve also done similar shit too, I recall when they got millionaires Theo Paphitis, Jamie Laing, Rachel Johnson and more to live with struggling poor families for a week. _Part of an experiment_. Honestly, at the end of it was a fucking joke. One of the women (Julia Bradbury, I believe) spent the entire family food budget on making a stew and then mentioned it at the end that she _maybe_ messed the math a little not accounting food per person, Theo Paphitis spent his allowance on a pint of milk, read some of the struggling woman’s bank statements/urgent letters and pretty much stated the fucking obvious about her life.. that she was struggling. When it was all wrapped up these chuffed narcissists assholes stood there, spoke of the struggle and pretty much went back to their lives. That was it. Spend a week with poor families and then stand in front of the camera at the end with a smug grin on their faces and say “It was difficult but now we understand”. 

Poorer people or financially struggling families are just being used as pawns for already “famous” dicks to push their fame or whatever product sponsor they’ve now endorsed. It wouldn’t surprise me if these people had it their way they’d want the homeless people hunting scene in the movie “Hard Target” to be reality. 

These Channels/Studio should not be profiting from the inequality that we face. 

All these shows do is add to the stereotype of people who are struggling the most. If you want to really show the ongoing struggles of poverty, financial struggles then document it properly not with rich kids taking the limelight, or a show about bailiffs evicting single mothers or repossessing goods of a struggling family barely able to afford shopping. These shows are dangerous, 

&gt; In 2017, Shakir Ali and Shahida Aslam awoken to a knock on the door from a bailiff, this in its self is a horrible situation to be placed in as your child is still sleeping, but he was not alone, he was accompanied by a camera crew who recorded the families home including the child's bedroom and proceeded to air it to 9.6 Million viewers. This then led to the child being bullied in school.

This is disgusting. This is what these channels do, exploit those who have little. 

&gt;The family received £20,000 after a judge ruled Channel 5’s “Can’t Pay We’ll Take Them Away” took it too far. Yet the show is still being renewed and aired. (Article)[https://www.joe.co.uk/entertainment/channel-5-ordered-to-pay-20000-damages-to-cant-pay-well-take-it-away-couple-164797]


With growing inequalities in society being exposed more by what’s going in the world right now, I fear these shows will continue to be aired until we are faced with a situation where someone is to take their own life. The spotlights has already been on “reality tv stars” who have taken their own lives, encouraging more mental health services be available to them. I wonder if there ever was a follow up on the mental health of those families who were poor and struggling and being exploited by BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5 and MTV.

Why these stations continue to make these shit and demoralising shows is beyond me.

They should not be shown in any kind of reality tv show format. If you wanna make a show on poverty then make it a docuseries or some shit, that doesn’t exploit people for shits and giggles and add fuel to stereotyping low income families.

96,t3_rvo4wb,We should replace cheerleaders in major league sports with marching bands,"Inspired by an unpopular opinion that cropped up a few days ago.

I don't have anything against cheerleaders; the stunts are incredible and require tons of skill to pull off. But at major league games? You can barely see or hear them in the stadium or arena. Unless you have floor seats you probably don't even know what they're chanting to the crowd. 

So! Replace them all with marching bands. Gets the crowd going, can actually be heard and seen at all times by everyone attending, and they'll double as pre &amp; post game entertainment.

98,t3_rvnv16,Red Dead Redemption 2 is overrated and a disappointment.,"That being said I love the game. But when i see people call the game a 10/10 masterpiece best game ever, absolute cinematic movie deserving an oscar I can’t help but scratch my head. Let me keep this short and concise. I’ma talk about gameplay, story, and characters and what i think is a big problem for the game.

Gameplay: It’s gta 4 gameplay with a fresh coat of paint. You want a good shooter? Play doom. Want an adventure game? Play uncharted. Want an action game? Play ghost of however that islands name is spelt.

Story: I started this game 5 times before i finished it and four of those play throughs died on chapter 3. You can almost cut out the prologue, chapter 2,3,5 and the epilogue and have the same story. All the important moments are crammed into two chapters. And by the end of the game i liked micah more than most of the gang because whenever hes around atleast it’s interesting.

Characters: i like arthur but lets get one thing straight. No he isn’t a good man. He’s a murderer, a thief, and no he aint humble. It amazes me how hard the game tries to convince you hes a good guy. Trust me, if it was your family member who got introduced to the butt end of a shotgun on that train you’d want to see him dead too. And his story isn’t as fulfilling as john marston’s. John decided on his own he was gonna change. Arthurs gets tb and realizes he needs to change.

I think people love this game simply because of how detailed it is. But details don’t mean much when the core of the game, the gameplay and story isn’t anything new. What did arthur say “all garnish and no meat” sounds about right. I do still enjoy the game but, 10/10 masterpiece it is not.

Until one doesn’t, and hires someone.

That someone, a person you have no ties to, shows up to your home unannounced to stay the night. He puts strange gadgets like cameras and beeping receivers all over and you are obviously at least a little upset.
**Then this stranger, after talking to the air, starts demanding parlor tricks from you.** “Move this, move that, say this into the machine”…
You do your best to comply out of confusion and hoping that by doing so, this home invader will leave.
After a while, they don’t leave, so you give them hints. First it’s whispers… then you start knocking on things…
Nothing helps. This jerk won’t go away.

Now you give him a shove. Instead of taking the hint, he looks around at the walls and starts cursing and demanding you do more! So you throw something off the shelf at him. Still he doesn’t leave. He stays and stays until you make it either too scary or too life threatening, or the sun comes up. What’s worse? He doesn’t have the common courtesy to apologize for the trouble, and was most likely doing this all for the spectacle of thousands, if not millions of people…
Treating you like an invisible circus animal… in your home that you’ve lived in for decades, if not centuries.

**This is narrative explanation details why I believe paranormal investigators to be absolute assholes.** Even if ghosts turn out in the long run to be a figment of human imagination, the very premise of a paranormal investigator’s job is no better than home invasion, if not harassment and in some cases, an attempt at assault.

Be it rent, food, utilities, internet, phone bills or other necessary bills (or even if it's stuff like alcohol or cigarettes). 

The problem is usually people/corporations who are able to spend/save/stash their money where it can't necessarily be taxed. 

Here where I live (Germany) for example we have unemployment pay, who also work. They only recieve those ""unemployment"" cheques because they earn too little with 20 hours of work (let's say you're employed as cleaning personnel and can only work 20hrs a week instead of 40 because you still have to take care of children) and fall under the amount of money per month that they would get if they just don't work at all. In my opinion it's way worse that someone who works still recieves less money, than someone who doesn't work at all. Even if it's ""just"" 20 hours a week (which can be a lot if you have a child or multiple children at home).

I'm really glad that you're not left alone here, although I still don't think that usually people who don't work and recieve some money from the state are the big problem.

143,t3_rvjhij,I think that aliens most likely do not exist," 

Ok, so I hear lots of people talk about aliens as if they are a near certainty in the universe but I'm just not convinced. The argument seems to be that the universe is so unimaginably large that it would be nearly impossible for life not to exist. Admittedly this is a strong argument, the universe is unimaginably large and life was created once so it probably was created many more times across the cosmos.

However, I've been taking lots of organic chemistry and microbiology courses over the past few years in college and I've come to appreciate just how complex life is. Even the most simplistic single cell organisms are, on an atomic level, incredibly complex and intricate.

We have no understanding of the mechanisms that could be responsible for abiogenesis (the process of creating living organisms from inanimate structures) other than complete dumb luck. If the only way that life can be created is truly just getting insanely lucky and aligning like 500 billion atoms in just the right way, I think that the size of the universe is tiny compared to the probability of that happening and the fact that life exists at all is a miracle.

tl:dr The universe is big but the chances of life being created is so small that it doesn't matter",1.0

I will never work in a professional workplace setting ever again. Ever.

I have never met more ""fake"" people, if you'll forgive my use of that term, than I did when I worked in an office. No one, and I mean *no one*, is genuine in that setting. Everyone is putting on a façade that makes them seem like the perfect, most agreeable people to have ever existed, none of which have any negative traits or dark tastes in humor or anything remotely interesting.

His reaction was telling me that I'm used to ""gay games with no skill"" such as Battlefield and that Hell Let Loose is the best gaming community ever.

&amp;#x200B;

I then proceeded to try anyways and it was okay, I just asked a dude for a tank or something at base, and he gave it. I hadn't even gotten a chance up until this point to even look at the controls for the game, so I decided while I was waiting to look at voice options, when I realized you can just type in chat instead. I just told my friend that you can just type to people and not have to use your voice if you're shy and he was like ""NO NO NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT...ETC"". It was very frustrating playing with him and telling him how I felt being told what to do and that I just wasn't having a good time. I waited until he logged off for the night, to play a round by myself, solo. Here's where the everyone-nails-me-to-the-cross part comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

Every. Single. Server. Says in their own rules to not armor-lock units. But I see everyone doing just that, I didn't want to be a rebel at first, so I just went as a foot soldier (forgot my class). Got killed a few times, still noticed there were a few armor-locked units of single soldiers playing, so I said ""screw this"" and just did it as well. Playing solo in an armor-lock unit, if you know how to use the tanks which are very easy and quick to learn, is the best thing ever in Hell Let Loose. I taught myself very quickly, without the ""help"" of my annoying friend taking over. I started the engine, went to the gunner seat, loaded an HE shell, hopped back in the driver seat, and took off, driving very well. And, I did good! I got 17 kills that round and didn't die once, though I did get shot in the tracks, but I communicated to a  teammate near me by TYPING to them if they could kill the guy shooting at me from the side, and they did. That was my first real run and I was in a tank by myself. I didn't have to deal with other people being dumb and not aiming or being able to drive correctly. And I communicated the way I wanted to, without having to use my voice, and it was fine, even better than the first round with my friend. There's always a stipulation with that game where you HAVE to talk to people with your voice and you HAVE to not armor-lock, which hinders the fun and experience for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely feel like this is an unpopular opinion because the servers all say they want nothing to do with armor-lock or non-voiced people. I feel if you feel like you're a better player without talking to people and having them either be rude or not understand them, and not deal with other units messing up the vehicle you're in, then you should be allowed to do so with no issue.",0.0

173,t3_rvgoro,Theme Songs - Orchestral Themes Need to Evolve,"I write this after watching No Way Home and leaving the theater absolutely 100% pleased with the movie, but noticing how I can't remember a single song from the whole adventure.

We attach to music in each and every piece of media it's found. Studious spend millions to perfectly score their films with fitting music for the moment. In recent years, Interstellar might be the most iconic film + track combination.

Superhero movies, however, have been doing very very poorly. Of course, this conversation is somewhat subjective but we do have good ole youtube to tell us what fans really want.

I don't believe that this generation, or most of the older generations, care about large complicated orchestral scores. Especially in a simple superhero film. I think that it's much wiser, and far more effectively memorable for these studios to shell out the cash up front and pay for MODERN SONGS.

I don't think there could be a better example than 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse' movie. I absolutely loved this movie. And no matter where I am, if I hear the main track of that movie, I think of Miles Morales. And judging by the numbers, I'd say I'm correct in my assumptions. For example, let's consider the YouTube view counts for each films theme (not the perfect metric but it's the best we have available):

Black Widow theme: ~ 2 million
Iron Man 1 theme: 3.3 million
Black Panther theme: ~ 4.5 million
Amazing Spider-Man 1: ~ 5 million
Thor Ragnarok: ~ 7 million 
MCU Spider-Man theme: ~ 9 million
Wonder Woman theme: ~ 11 million
(If you absolutely have to do an orchestral score, the Wonder Woman theme is how you do it)
Avengers 1 theme: 13 million
Spider-Man 1 (Sam Raimi): ~ 27 million
Superman (Man of Steel) theme: ~ 30 million
The Dark Knight theme: ~ 40 million
Avengers - End Game theme: ~ 70 million

Now this is where it gets murky. 
Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse 'does' have its own 'theme': ~ 1.5 million views
However, this particular movie spared no expense on ACTUALLY CONNECTING with the audience it sought to present to. It had modern hip-hop/rap/pop songs, some of which exclusively released alongside the film itself. 

The most obvious of these songs is Post Malone - Sunflower. It was attached to the trailer, it was integral to the introduction of the Miles Morales, and it was imprinted in the minds of everyone watching. So I think it's fair to deem Sunflower as Into the Spider-Verse's theme.

That being said....
Into the Spider-Verse (Sunflower): 1.6 BILLION VIEWS
BILLION
BILLION
1.6 BILLION

And guess who's the main focus of the music video holding those 1.6 billion views: Miles Morales - SpiderMan.
Every single person that sees Miles Morales will think of that song. Every single person that hears that song will think of Miles Morales.

I wholeheartedly think studious are wasting at least 'some' of their time making these grand orchestral pieces when they should be appealing to the actual audiences viewing their movies.

They had no structure, making them mass produceable and requiring zero skills in narration. It was like the internet's equivalent to peekaboo, just look at the funny faces. But then for no discernable reason, people suddenly decided that liking 21st century humor makes them ""cool"" or even unique.

I think that sometimes, waiting for people to adapt to you and your shitty behaviours just means that you'll lose them and it often results in this cicle of unwillingness to change. Life is all about change and adaptation and the people who don't realize that are not mature enough to be functioning members of society.

I see it a lot on places like Reddit where someone is so content with their problems that they refuse to change despite their hatred for their own actions. You have to recognise that you have to be the change that you want to see and that people won't just do important things for you.

181,t3_rvg2nz,Background Checks should be free,"It doesn't make any sense why someone should have to pay $20-$50 just to use a background check service. I could understand if the person needs it regularly for their job or something, but just to search someone once? Its bullshit. All these companies are trying to do is capitalize off of us for free public information. Government officials have no issues running free background checks on people so why can't we? 

There's so many instances where background checks are smart, needed or beneficial. Not everyone can pay for them. Not everyone should pay for them. Yeah you're paying for a service but how hard is the service really? It's literally a robotic algorithm that searches through keywords and information. It isn't like a human is doing all this hard investigative work. All the information it gets is free public information, you're just paying for some imaginary convenience of having a robot do it for you. But then searching these things on your own is almost impossible since everything is so separated you don't know where or how to look, and Google only offers so much. 

Remember the days you could just pick up a phone book and find a number? Now it's impossible to find a number unless you pay for it and unless it's some business. You used to be able to just Google someone and find them, now there's too much irrelevancy to be beneficial and productive. 

Everything needs to be capitalized on. Everything needs to be made money with. So when things actually work and are beneficial for all, they take that from us and slap a price tag on it. We're nothing but a price tag to people, just like everything. You already have to pay for literally every single thing on earth, at least let people get some damn information for free. But nope.

More broadly this was just one of many bullshit English grammar “rules” which just distracted from the more important purpose of communicating a coherent thought. Lazy teachers thought it was more important to write an idea out in a specific way than to have something worth communicating in the first place. I’m against that.

Movies, music, games, tv-shows, everything gets either a remake or a spin-off.

Why are y'all buying this shit and making it a success? The Matrix Resurrection is crap but people will go and watch it anyway. The remake of ps3 titles on the ps5 get great reviews and people buy them AGAIN (looking at you Skyrim). 


Everyone is talking about how people are sheep when it comes to politics, but to me the real sheep are the consumers. You are the reason we can't have anything nice. Original IP's are rare, great original shows are cancelled because people only want the same shit in a different package. And with music everyone wants the good old shit, or those fucking useless soundcloud rappers who all copy each other and have the exact same rhythm. 

And it frustrates me soooo much. This is why we can't have nice things, or at the very least companies/artists that dare to do something originals.",8.0

It is not. weird.

- it’s infinitely better for you than potato chips
- it fulfills the same urge to be snacking on something / feeling less hungry 
- you’re getting crucial vitamins and ruffage 
- it doesn’t taste any worse than some of those awful green smoothies people spend $$$ on, and many less empty calories.
- the taste grows on you, or you grow to not mind it - eventually becoming sort of a “white noise” of taste
- you don’t need anything but the bag of spinach - no prep no mess

229,t3_rvbegd,You don’t need one of those rare high paying jobs and “extremely rich” parents to afford real estate as a millenial,"As the title says. I keep seeing people blaming their jobs, their parents’ income, the market or the current state of the world for not being able to afford real estate and are over generalizing what is required to achieve ownership because (and this is my opinion) most people are lazy or afraid of failure.

I went to university, worked part time jobs in retail and service industries to pay for said schooling and kept my grades high to achieve a scholarship that discounted my tuition. I didn’t even qualify for osap and therefore had no loans. I did four years in undergrad which was long enough to be qualified for any entry level professional job and work my way up from there.

My boyfriend and I (who is co-owner to our condo in Toronto with me) both work full time and have been since we graduated uni. Therefore we have joint income which has been our #1 tool to building the wealth required to achieve our goal of home ownership in our mid-twenties.

The market IS crazy right now and I’m not denying that, and it won’t be changing, but if you have a budget and stick to it, you’ll find a place you like and can afford and that doesn’t go 300k over asking.

It’s about discipline first and foremost. Wealth is about how much money you keep not how much you spend. Yes, income is key and the more you have the easier it will be, but it’s about patience too. This also means you need intimate knowledge about your own(and your partners’) finances - this is my opinion and is what worked for us - which I know most people are afraid of because they are comfortable overspending on things they enjoy and living lifestyles well beyond their means. I have friends and family my age that are in this exact boat. 

Instead of the stupid over simplified rules that people reference online (e.g. “don’t buy starbucks or avo toast”) take this with a grain of salt because the people that ARE doing this are usually spending more in other ways too. Do you need to go out to dinner every weekend? Do you need the newest trendiest clothing from terrible companies like shein that you wear once and throw out after because the quality is crap? Think about every transaction and how it aligns with tour goal: if that goal is homeownership, why are you working against it? 

Just because it’s daunting and takes commitment and discipline doesn’t make it okay for people to pretend that failure is the only option.

Racists will often use lies in jest as ""jokes"" to feel out people to see what they can get away with.

Lies in jest are not jokes, they are lies.

245,t3_rv9orn,Your video game habit isn't different from anyone binging TV,"I get it, we're all addicted to our screens in some form or another, but my god, if it isn't just sad as hell, just how much of reddit wants to pretend that it's a totally healthy and/or normal thing to do to spend their life playing video games. 

This is not an indictment of the art, hell, I've had a blast playing through loads of video games here and there, and I get it, they're enticing, and as an art form, they can be (if not should be) appreciated for the experiences they offer. 

But I just cannot concede that it's a normal or healthy, or even reasonable thing for someone to spend all their spare time playing (read living) a video game. 

However, when one points this out, the following defenses invariably follow:

- It's more engaging (intended to be read as *better*) then watching TV - so? spending any major extended amount of time before a screen is unhealthy. What, you think you're better than someone who watches reality TV all day long? How? Because you consider *that* mindless - as opposed to...playing nine hours of a video game that simply repeats itself endlessly, pumping just a bit more endorphins to keep you engaged?

- I use it to unwind/relax - ok, and immoderate amounts are healthy how? You had a rough day of work and want to play some video games? go for it. But if you do it for all of your spare time between working and sleeping, ya'll have a problem.

- It's not hurting anyone - oh but it is, and it's hurting *the player* most of all.  Spending your life before a screen cycling through endless online matches is depriving yourself of living in the real world. (see below)

- I'm still interacting with people and making friends - not really, though. You're not connecting with a person and spending time in their presence, they're just controlling an avatar in a shared space. You're not exploring the world together, you're playing a carefully created simulation designed to keep you hooked (I get the reddit irony).

- Some people dont have the luxury of getting outside - *bullllllllshit* - (this is one of my favorites) - unless your lazy ass is in an active warzone, you can, and should, be outside interacting with real people in the real world. 

- Video games are sports - no, no they are not. A bunch of sad, sad, people may have made some groups, which advertisers have capitalized on to create events reminiscent of standard sporting activities, but those weird folks are just clicking screens, very fast, sure, but they're not playing a sport - oh, and I LOVE the ""what about darts and billiards, *they're* sports right??"" argument. I dont give two shits about darts or billiards. Everyone other than a deluded neckbeard can see the difference between a triathlete and a teenager clicking a mouse furiously. 


The kicker here is that the global consensus outside the bastion of reddit is that spending all your free time playing a video game/staring at a screen is unhealthy. Plain and simple. To squander one's existence, one's *free time* playing, ""competitively"" a video game is fucking tragic.

Yep, and run the risk of getting a scratched disc from a shady GameStop/second hand marketplace. Also, Digital games are ALWAYS on sale. You can get some amazing deals by just looking through the PS, Xbox, Steam sales on a weekly basis.

“I like to hold my collection and have the tangible disc”

Well, unfortunately I don’t have room for shelves to store 300 games. You know what I do have? Space for a 6 inch hard drive with 3TB of storage.

That’s not even to mention things like Gamepass, PSNow, and/or just taking a hard drive to another console rather than transporting discs.",3.0

261,t3_rv8as9,"Presenting John Lennon as a sadistic, wife-beating, hypocritical, talentless, abusive maniac is just as ridiculous as presenting him as an unwavering icon of peace and love.","Only a few years ago it really would've been an unpopular opinion to criticise Lennon, however in recent years it's become impossible to mention the name John Lennon without someone saying ""you know he beat his wives and kids"". Even searching ""Beatles"" on this subreddit and having a scroll through the posts/comments shows how prevalent this viewpoint has become.

The main thing that gets levelled at Lennon is the accusation of physical abuse. It is true that he open-hand hit Cynthia Lennon on one occasion, and of course this is a bad thing to do, but it is hardly as far as the presentation of repeated intense violence that many people now are perpetuating. This one inexcusable incident is the only instance of documented abuse, none towards May Pang or Yoko Ono (as people falsely claim) and crucially *none* towards his first son Julian Lennon, which I'll get onto now.

The other main aspect of the criticism of Lennon is him being a poor father to Julian Lennon. Whilst the relationship between father and son here is clearly complex, and this is the factor I would agree with criticising Lennon on. Custody was awarded to Cynthia Lennon and John financially provided for them, so he wasn't quite as uninvolved as many people paint, but yes, no payment is a replacement for a genuine father figure. It was not all on John though, John Lennon himself complained of not being allowed to see Julian as much as he liked. They had also begun to repair their relationship by the time of Lennon's assassination.

Hypocrisy is levelled at Lennon, these aforementioned things contrasting with his rhetoric of peace and love. But this is comparing the 19 year old John Lennon who hit Cynthia to the Lennon in his 30s singing of peace and love. He did not exist in a vacuum, we allow people to change for the worse, why can we not allow them to change for the better. As Lennon himself said, ""I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace."" These things are not in contrast, rather inextricably linked.

There are other accusations levelled at him which are less prevalent, anti-Semite (which his close relationship with Jewish Brian Epstein and pushing McCartney away in favour of Jewish Phil Spector and Jewish Allen Klein says everything about) or people who gleefully say ""Lennon sung of imagining no possessions from a mansion"" as if they don't know what the word ""Imagine"" means.

None of this is to claim John Lennon was an angel, he was troubled, could be violent, cynical and could be viciously unkind. The sanctified, mythologised version of him is just as ridiculous, he was absolutely acidic and complicated and that is probably why he is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. But there's endless posts here about that, so I just wanted to say that either presentation of him is incorrect and as we live in a world of grey areas, he clearly lies between the two extremes.",3.0

Mentally healthy people do not get worse when they start getting recorded.,"A absolute ton of redditors have been victim blaming people who record lunatics who start attacking them on camera. ""If you didn't record them they wouldn't have freaked out! You caused this!!!!!"". 

Guys, you'd have to be extremely sheltered to think it's common for people to start violating the law when the cameras come out. This is exact opposite of what happens in reality.

People with severe mental issues are the only ones who will start violating the law while knowingly on camera. The vast majority of the time, a camera will make everyone, including the cameraperson, stop violating the law. That's why all kinds of businesses have signs up stating they have cameras. It's a deterrent for crime.

""Then why when in browsing popular videos on social media, I see lots of people freaking out when they see a camera""

You're only watching videos that trend online. How many views and shares will a video get where you pull out a camera on a person acting belligerent, they immediately disengage when they are being filmed. Would you seek out that boring ass video to watch? Would you share that video on Facebook or reddit asking your friends to watch this Karen be calm? Fuck no.

276,t3_rv6d2w,"Corporation puritanism, combined with algorithms like GPT-3 and other image identification systems + all those new radical copyright systems pushed, like the ones from Nintendo and Games workshop, will soon cause a massive internet censorship crisis that will most likely kill horny culture.","As days passes, corporates become more and more aggressive towards ""NSFW Culture"" and all the forms of art produced that involves any cartoon or anime characters, it is a noticeable trend, Nintendo tried to take down the ""Ankha zone"" video, and even Evangelion, universally known for well, its waifu wars and NSFW content culture, recently had an update on their terms of use prohibiting any form of pornography involving the characters of the franchise being done. Games workshop followed a similar route, and is now seeking to hunt down any form of NSFW content.

Well, you may say ""Oh, this is just a localized trend, it isnt going to followed by all companies"" and i say, you're right for now, but its a fact that most, if not all companies dont want their content transformed into smut by NSFW artists, and they just dont go on a virtual hunt to take all NSFW art down because, to put it simple, its a humanly impossible task for now, \*but for now only\*. As AI identification algorithms advance, it becomes more and more likely that in the next decade or soo, it will be possible to identify a character or any form of reference to some Cartoon or Anime chracter in a NSFW artistic production, and take down it as quickly as it detects. This is not only possibly, but just a matter of time for it to happen, and as i said, i'm pretty goddamn sure this is a corporate wet dream accomplished, and one which will bring a brutal end to all horny culture until now in the internet.

Soo yeah, what do i think will happen? Sites like rule34, e621, Pixiv will all be desertified in the best of expectations, being completely emptied due to corporate AIs forcing it to take down, and in the worst cases completely taken down from the internet due too many legal threats, with other social media like twitter banning Hentai and drawn NSFW content as a preemptive action to prevent legal problems. killing most horny culture with it altogether. This, combined with more puritan movements like NoFap and Anti-porn actions will most likely end up causing ""A bronze age"" styled collapse of horny culture on the internet (Due to its abrupt and brutal style), which will cause probably a momentary puritanisation of the internet, with horny behavior being shunned not only in a ironic, humoristic mean, but in an actual sociocultural way, with whole communities banning and promoting anti horny behavior. NSFW artists will be the ones will suffer the most on its fall, along with most hentai consumers, being the first banned from most platforms and threw into the garbage pits of the internet, and the latter filtered to death and having a hard time to even consume anything ""drawn"" in nsfw. Hell, on some worse scenarios i could even see fan art being  also deeply affected by such a ban

You may see ""Oh, this is 20 years away at least"" and id say that it is a decade away at worst, AI algorithms grow quick as fuck, and are having multiple breakthroughs in a short amount of time, i wouldnt be surprised if in 4-8 years an algorithm capable of detecting and classifying cartoon images with almost perfect accuracy would already exist, something that could detect a character is there even if its colors are changed or partially censored like those japanese hentais. And as i said, a ""Collapse of horny culture"" could be extremely quick and abrupt, something that could happen in less than a year after such algorithm is adopted by a significant company like disney, causing the internet to shift massively and return to puritanism in a scaringly short time.

Well, on overall, I dont know, this is probably going to happen sooner than later, i honestly dont like it, as it is some freedom of speech violation, but there are people from nofap that will 100% support it, soo idk if the internet will like this or not.",0.0

I am definitely not happy that those incidents had occurred. But at the same time, I am not really happy about how people say that the Japanese citizens deserve more nuclear strikes.

Or at least that's what I used to think.

I've been coming back to a video by Knowing Better on the topic of how Japan victimize themselves to sort of dodge the accountability of the warcrimes. I definitely don't agree with many of our politicians trying to pretend like the r\*pes and massacres never happened. But during the video, he frequently mentions how the 2 atomic bombings weren't as bad as people make them out to be and suggests that they are just the same as other conventional bombing tactics. *A lot of people seem to be agreeing with this standpoint.*

Which leads me to the unpopular opinion. On one side, people argue that they are weapons of mass destruction and the radiation is still having affect on people to this day. And on the other, people argue that the two bombings are just like any other bombings during the second world war, and proceed to state that the Japanese deserve more.

Thinking about this on a daily basis is taking a toll on my health, and I feel like my soul is getting ripped in half from the forces produced by the two sides. What do you think? What is like, the consensus on this?

This was before the special edition and the Bethesdanet mod platform. Modders could submit their work and set a price, getting a cut of the proceeds.

This was almost instantly killed due to, in my opinion, collective entitlement and selfishness. Modders work their asses off to make incredible content that often surpasses official DLC. I think the idea of giving them an official, safe avenue to monetize their work is fantastic.

It is true that modders can be indirectly paid through direct donations and Patreon. But let’s be real, here. How many people actually do that compared to the entire pool of unique people using the modder’s content? If payment is optional, most people won’t pay.

Did the implementation on steam have problems? Absolutely. But that’s the case for many new releases. The idea is that these things get improved over time, and that would’ve happened if people didn’t instantly kill it because they thought themselves entitled to free mods always and forever regardless of context.",0.0

297,t3_rv1yxp,When you grow up you don't become braver. You just lose your imagination and become desensitized to scary stuff,"Kids are easily scared by things like horror movies, staying home alone, ghosts stories... When they grow up, those things usually don't frighten them anymore. But the reason for this transformation is not that they have become 'braver', what happened instead is that

1. they have become desensitized to stimuli and emotions, so there's less neural activation when having new scary experiences.
2. they have partially lost imagination, and by imagination I mean phantasia, the capability of seeing the things you think about: [the mental image of that scary skeleton you saw on tv](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/local58/images/d/df/Disturbingskeleton.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20210622213433) as an adult won't be as clear in your mind as it would have been if you had seen it as a kid. When kids see a scary pic, they go to bed, they close their eyes and the scary pic is *before* them, they can *see* it vividly. When adults see a scary pic, they go to bed, close their eyes and the scary pic is not as vivid and detailed, but much more fuzzy and dull.

So this is my unpopular opinion: without desensitization and loss of imagination, we would be frightened by scary things just as we were as kids lol",61.0

1- if you're not interested in your partner anymore, just leave.. it's seriously not that hard
2- if you left your partner, it's just really disgusting and immature to drag his whole family in your private problems
3- if you're gonna say ""but he hurt me"".. then deal with him.. don't go insulting everyone cuz you're feeling hurt.. it only just make you the worst person
4- if you're gonna say ""he and his family hurt me"".. then why would you go insulting his friends too?
5- if you're gonna say all these people didn't accept me and kept trying to get him to dump me, then you should start seriously questioning if they're right and if you're actually the problem here.. so many people cannot by any chance or probability be all wrong about someone they met in person.
6- to insult his job, his art? Why? Cuz you don't like him? What about all the people doing the same job as his.. doing the same art as his..

And the list goes on..
This is probably one of the most toxic songs ever and I really hate that lots of people like it.. art should bring people close together.. not make them hate eachother.

That being said, I’ve seen anxiety legitimately weaponized by people who don’t have it in control. I’ve done it once or twice myself, and it took genuine introspection to realize how not okay it was. 

I’ll give an example: your mom who is constantly angry and pestering you about things to the point it makes it hard to function. This might come up in the form of obsessing over how you wear your clothes, do your hair, if you brushed your teeth that day, if she THINKS you brushed your teeth that day. 

It could be your girlfriend who is suspecting you have done something and won’t leave you alone until she finds something on you. 

They can take this and create a habit of badgering you over and over again due to their perception of you and leaving you little room for response. On the chance you do respond, it might send them into a spiral of other reactions. 

I think there’s a significant portion of people with anxiety who do this, but it is by no means all. Many many people try to get control of it for them and their loved ones even if it’s a difficult thing to do.",21.0

i rewatched the first superman movie(one of my all time favorite superhero movies by the way) last night and, during the scene where jor el is delivering the monologue to his infant son just as he\`s about to send him off planet actually got me a bit teary eyed. i know that the monologue is a bit overdramatic and the excellent john williams music that plays during the scene has alot to do with the emotion of the scene but i feel that brando at least deserves some credit for that.

306,t3_rv0sni,Disney Will Ruin Daredevil (along with the other Netflix shows) And It Has Already Begun,"HAWKEYE SPOILER BELOW:

By now most everyone knows that the Netflix shows are coming to the MCU and Kingpin turned out to be the 'big bad' in Hawkeye. Most fans seem to be elated over this news and hopeful for the future but all I can see is Disney watering down (understatement) everything that made the Netflix universe so great all for those easy nostalgia bucks as they do time and time again.

In the Netflix universe Kingpin was a obscenely brutal (almost bloodthirsty), calculating threat who had 10 ways to destroy your life if you crossed him usually with a trail of blood a mile long. He also surrounded himself with the deadliest people so he could stay untouchable both physically and legally. When he gets angry, you know there will be a high body count with crushed skulls and murdered loved ones which is what made him such an imposing threat.

In MCU: he works out of a back room with bead curtains (what?), lets Kate's mom talk down to him then just saunter off (instead of crushing her skull right there), then delivers his cliche 'rEmInD tHiS cItY wHo OwNs iT' line. His master plan? Send his interpreter to fire a gun wildly into a party not even aiming at his target (hitting no one), send his comedically awful goon squad (sans guns) to hope Hawkeye and crew were nice enough to come outside, then show up in person (without backup) on a well lit fairly well trafficed street to kill someone in the open. He then goes up against Kate and just kinda.... tosses her around a bit (at no point inflicting more than a stylish cut). After stepping next to a explosive arrow triggered by a flicked quarter (like a Home Alone villain), he limps off just to be (presumably) shot in a back alley. At no point did he hire a top tier assassin (even Kate's mom hired a Black Widow), he has seemingly no useful contacts to call in, he does his own dirty work in public, and poses about as much of a threat as a 'villain of the week' on any given crime or action show. 

In a little over a full episode, MCU managed to COMPLETELY neuter one of the best villains of the past decade that came gift wrapped (xmas theme, get it? I felt Hawkeye didnt have enough forced xmas theme so I added more) and ready to span multiple stories really introducing a top-tier 'ground level' villain.  If this is their plan moving forward, I cant see how the re-introduced Netflix 'universe' will be anything positive unless all you want is hollowed out husks of characters you once loved just so you can yell 'Hey they are from the OTHER show!' at your screen.",9.0

314,t3_ruz5cn,South America is the better defensible position in Risk compared to Australia.,"Now in just pure 'Hold outs' sure, Australia has the better bottleneck. Throw your whole army in Indonesia if you will and you can delay the inevitable, but if you're fighting against the whole continent of Asia with only Australia as your staging ground you are going to have a tough battle ahead of you.

Now what people always fail to mention is that much like in life, in risk a good offense is as valuable as a good defense.

South America offers 2 avenues of attack from which to build your empire. A crawl up from Mexico to the rest of North America will secure you 5 additional troops per turn and give you a night impregnable fortress from which to invade the rest of the world. Between the two continents there are only 3 avenues of attack.

At this point you will be able to outproduce most other players as it's unlikely they will be able to secure enough territories to match your 11 reinforcements per turn (7 from continent bonuses, 4 from having 12+ territories). 

While some early game players might make a beeline for Australia so they can secure their place, or while others might evenly distribute their troops through Asia in an attempt to obtain that hefty 7 troop reinforcement, you can slowly harass Africa from Brazil while you slowly eat up the Americas.

Once your American Empire is secured the rest of the world will fall. Personally I start by encroaching Iceland and North Africa while leaving a deterring force in Alaska. At this point people will flee trying to secure their little safe space in Australia.

First of all not all movies are shot in widescreen. Some were shot with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This means full-screen is the way it should be shown. A widescreen release would actually have less content.

Second of all for the movies that were shot with a widescreen aspect ratio and have a fullscreen release. Depending on the movie they may have planned this out all along that there would be a widescreen and fullscreen edition. Many video cameras have the option to show safety lines. Videographers will ensure that everything important stays inside of these safety lines.

In cases where safety lines were not used or sometimes even if they were the person working on the pan and scan release will look at each scene and focus on the action. This maximizes the use of a 4:3 television. You have to remember that although today we are blessed with huge inexpressive televisions that was not always the case. Televisions used to be smaller on average and people used to sit farther away from those smaller televisions on average. This means people are going to want their televisions filled without borders.

Some pan and scan releases go through great lengths to provide you with a good experience. A good example of this is the early Harry Potter movies. Yes they did chop off some stuff on the sides that's probably just background blur anyway but actually you got to see stuff that the widescreen people don't get to see because the wide screen release of Harry Potter they actually cropped and. For the full-screen release they backed off the cropping revealing more on the top and bottom of the picture.",0.0

333,t3_ruvt0a,"Instead of saying ""cheating is always bad no excuses"" in a relationship, one should consider the circumstances where it occurred. Sometimes it makes sense.","I used to be a ""no excuses"" person because I was cheated on and it hurt, but my views have changed a bit because I've witnessed a few situations where it makes sense to take that path. Here's two examples... 

1: Person was in an abusive relationship. She also met her new boyfriend around that time. So she safely, slowly, and carefully left her old relationship while transitioning into the new one. Technically constituted cheating because the timelines overlapped. 

2: Older couple where the wife had severe dementia and was in a facility and the husband was of sound mind still living at home. He started dating because, even though he was still caring for her, he was ready to accept his life needed to continue. 

You might disagree and that's okay, but in my mind I understand.

340,t3_ruup4e,Chiropractors are real Doctors and not pseudoscience practitioners,"
I am a student who is studying to be a chiropractor and I hear all the time about how chiropractic doesn’t work or that we aren’t “real” doctors. For starters, our education material is accredited and reviewed constantly to continue giving us an official doctorate degree that is nationally recognized. I get that I am going to be biased on this topic, but we have taken the educational steps to earn our doctorate degree and are trained in how to be a health care provider. Not that we replace a GP, but we can offer advice within our own field that can be advantageous for a patient’s health and well-being. 

For anyone who doesn’t know, a chiropractor is a doctor who is trained to manipulate joints and use noninvasive methods for clearing occluded nerve pathways which then allow the body to properly communicate with itself. While I’m not a “chiropractic puritan” who believes that chiropractic can be used as a substitute for proper medical care and a cure all for everything, I do believe that it is beneficial for people who want to try and alleviate back pain, headaches, and other structural issues. 

Another thing I’ve heard is many people throw out is the research disproving chiropractic care but never talk about the studies that have been done by board certified MDs that show it does work. There are plenty of studies, as with any other practice, that supports and doesn’t support chiropractic practice. Also, many people talk about how chiropractic puts stresses and twists the cervical arteries and how that’s dangerous. While we are completely aware of the anatomy and important structures in the neck, we are trained in safe adjusting techniques to avoid hazardous actions that could harm the arteries of the neck.

Added Edit: I’ve noticed that a lot of people are talking about comparing a DC (doctorate of chiropractic) to an MD (doctorate of medicine). I should have been clearer in this post that I am by no means saying that I am an MD. I recognize how this may be confusing for some, but by me saying “real doctor,” I’m not implying or claiming to be an MD. By “real doctor,” I am meaning that I have a legitimate doctorate degree in my profession and we are taught medical skills on how to detect certain issues involving cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, dermatological pathology, and more so that we can refer patients to a professional who can treat them.",0.0
341,t3_ruunti,We should be quicker to label people who make decisions that hurt others as mentally ill,"I don't get it. If you get depressed or suicidal...it's mental illness.

If I get depressed I eat cheetos on the couch, get a diagnosis and get judged for being lazy.

If I were to become the CEO of a pharmaceutical company and hike the price of insulin I would get a huge bonus.

Which is a worse drain on society? People eating cheetos or people killing diabetics because human lives mean less to them than numbers in a bank account?

We should label that destructive behaviour for what it is. Mental illness that causes world ruining behaviour.

That way, if someone comes up with an idea like ""Hey, let's do a hostile takeover, fire all the old employees and get new ones in on minimum wage.""

344,t3_rutjnp,Studio Ghibli films make me physically uncomfortable.,"So far, I've tried to watch Ponyo, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away, and I *want* to like these movies so badly, but I physically cannot sit through one. My roommates and friends love them, I love the art style and music, but everything from the noises to the visuals to even some of the basic premises of the film make me feel itchy all over. I can barely get through one with friends in the room, and I haven't even tried by myself. 

I don't get it - I love true crime, horror literature, even creepypasta. But something about a young girl's parents being turned into pigs and her trying to save them makes me feel like I'm going to puke. And I read online people saying that it's the type of thing to make them feel many, many emotions, and normally I'm okay with media like that, but I just cannot stomach it. 

I do have some weird, unresolved mental health issues from a less than perfect childhood and sensory overload problems, so maybe that explains it. But, an incomplete list of some of the things to have bothered me to date:

- As a general thing, the characters pretty often just yell sounds that kinda sounds that could definitely be interpreted as moaning. 
- Any old people's faces are a hard no, I have no further explanation to offer. 
- Girl's parents get turned into pigs, and the girl is forced into hard labor (where she could possibly get trapped) to try to get them back?
- The realism of the food is too much for me.
- The gibberish speaking in Ponyo makes my brain physically hurt. 
- Why are there so many terrifying creatures who prey upon literal children?? 
- Why did Sophie have to be a romantic interest to someone? She looks and acts like a literal child.

375,t3_ruq5dp,"Paranoia Agent started off promising, but ended up a disappointing mess"," Paranoia Agent was a 2004 psychological thriller anime created by Satoshi Kon and animated by Madhouse, which ran from February 3, to May 18th. The show was an anthology series focusing on troubled people with problems and being tormented by the serial attacker “Lil Slugger” if you watched the dub and “Shounen Bat” if you watched the sub. 

 I don’t want this to turn into a review, so I’ll skip ahead to the unpopular aspect of this opinion by saying, episodes 1,2,3, and 6 were amazing episodes with captivating story telling, great voice acting, and great characters. Episode 4 was decent, and not as good as the episodes previously mentioned, but still pretty decent. However, I simply cannot say the same for the rest of this series. Paranoia Agent is praised for story by everyone, but the story fell apart for me and became hard to sit through and was nothing short of disappointing.

*Attention- I will now be getting into spoilers- Continue at your own risk*

Where the show starts to show signs of going bad is episode 5. We have the mystery of Shounen Bat and if he actually exists or not, so when episode 4 ends with the guy getting arrested, you know some bullshit is going on. Granted, having this guy be the perpetrator for one of the victims, but just a copycat, is a great red herring. I have problems with the fact they look exactly the same, but it’s more of a nitpick for me. However, this episode overall feels extremely out of place. We have this wacky comedy in the middle of what is essentially a murder mystery, but instead of murder, it’s assault. It basically ruins the mood set up before hand as we get this pointless filler. Episode 6 comes around, and it seems like it’s going back to normal. Nope. We get another filler episode about two assholes and a little girl trying to kill themselves. On paper, this fits in with the show and it’s themes, but the overall presentation completely ruins this. We don’t even get anything with Shounen Bat except for a small cameo. Then we have the next 3 episodes. We have even more filler…why? As far as I know, this show was an anime original, so it’s not like they ran out of content to  adapt. We have an episode dedicated to a bunch of women gossiping about these stories of Shounen Bat that are so obviously fake (which was the point, I’ll give it that), but other than that, the stories once again take me out of it. We have an episode dedicated to this one woman’s life story and what became of the detectives and, worst of all, Shounen Bat is confirmed to be a figment of the imagination in a completely unsatisfactory way. And then we have an episode about an abused worker, which does fit with the themes of the show, but the presentation once again ruins it. After 4 of these episodes in a row, I finally dropped the series. What started off as a masterful piece of storytelling, completely killed whatever interest I had in it. From a brilliant story of a women who wants a normal life with her husband, but is struggling with her Dissociative Identity Disorder and her alter wanting to live her life to completely ridiculous storytelling of a group of women telling ridiculous comedy stories. Paranoia Agent started off fantastic, but ended up a disappointing mess.",0.0

384,t3_rupb6m,"Mercedes lost Lewis Hamilton his 8th World Drivers Championship in F1, not Michael Masi / The FIA.","While there is a ton of controversy around this last year's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, I see a majority of fingers pointing at Michael Masi and the FIA as the culprits of why Lewis Hamilton lost the title deciding race he dominated from nearly start to finish.  While I admit the ending to said race was rather bizarre, and did deserve the investigation it received, I believe Mercedes' overly conservative strategy is what lost them the race in the end.While no one could have seen the scenario that played out coming, after combing through data and lap times for far too long, there were many strategy calls they could have made that would have worked in their favor.



 1. Stretching the 1st stint out longer.  Mercedes responded to Max Verstappen pitting by immediately bringing in Lewis for fresh hard tires.  In the moment they were covering the undercut which is a valid strategy, but at the time Lewis was outpacing Max while on a harder compound of tire.  According to the lap times Max didn't start matching the pace Lewis had on medium tires on his fresh hards for almost 10 laps.  Had they left Lewis out he would have had fresher tires going into the last lap shootout that occurred, and he most likely would have avoided Sergio Perez holding him up for about 6-7 seconds on laps 20 and 21.  Hindsight is 20/20, but had they run their own race instead of letting Redbull decide the flow, they would have ended up in a much more advantageous position.



 2. Pitting under VSC.  Many people said this was a no brainer to stay out and keep track position, but I believe it was the biggest screw up they had all race.  Lewis was absolutely rapid all day to the extent that I don't think track position ment squat.  He squarely beat Max in Stint 1 on a harder tire, and besides Perez slowing Lewis down he dominated Max when they were both on fresh hards.  Looking at lap times the change to a fresh set of hards netted you about 1 extra second per lap at that point in the race.  If Max stays out to take track position, Lewis would have been able sail past him in just a few laps.  If Max comes in with Lewis, then Lewis just continues to dominate Max like he had all race.  Also this gives Lewis better tires for that last lap shootout, and looking at lap times it looks to me like Lewis could have even possibly outpaced Max even while on the much harder tires.



 3. Pitting when the Safety Car came out.  This is by far the riskiest of the 3 strategy options as if the pit crew screws up Lewis loses if the race ends under SC.  At the time the safety car came out, Lewis was a little over 11 seconds ahead of Max and approaching the last few corners.  For those unfamiliar drivers are forced to slow down to a pre designated delta time until they catch the safety car queue, if Mercedes had a good pit stop I believe they could have come back on track in front of Max (even if Max didn't pit) on far fresher tires in a much faster car basically guaranteeing the win.


All in all, with what I have seen data wise and rewatching the grand prix several times I am firmly of the opinion that Mercedes are more at fault for causing Lewis Hamilton to lose the F1 World Drivers Championship than Michael Masi or the FIA.

TL;DR Mercedes were too conservative and let Redbull dictate the pace of the race leading to an advantageous position at the end of the race for Redbull when the race director made a controversial call.",2.0

393,t3_runzmj,Many P.E teachers should be fired for truly traumatizing kids,"Since I was a kid I've had many physical problems, but funny enough that was not what made P.E a living nightmare. I have autism (undiagnosed at the time) and there was no P.E lass I didn't end up crying and hiding in the toilets afterwards. I never understood the exercises we were supposed to do because of processing audio issues and overall needing very specific instructions and sometimes external help to perform an activity. 

I tried explaining to all my teachers (from elementary to high school) that I really struggled with that and asked for help. I told them that P.E had been terrible for me as previous teachers used me as an example of ""how to not do the assignment"" and got the whole class laughing. I wasn't exactly a popular person, so that resulted in bullying many times. However, none of them listened at all and in fact continued to call me to present first (an exercise, dance, whatever) that we had to rehearse and as I always performed badly, because of physical and mental stuff I mentioned, the story repeated again.

All these teachers' actions caused me to develop an unhealthy relationship with sports and physical health in general, as I refuse to even go near a gym or go for a run out of fear of people laughing at me. People always talk about terrible math, english, history teachers and more, but never about P.E teachers. They basically promote bullying by shaming (or allowing them to be shamed) fat kids, neurodivergent kids, girls, unpopular kids, poor kids, disabled kids and I could go on and on. Teachers chose the popular kids to pick teammates and these groups of people always got treated as leftovers and the cool kids complained when they had to be on their team, while the teacher just stood there watching and never intervened.

There's a ""robot"" who is always rational until he pulls a complete 180 with that cloning thing which broke so many legal &amp; moral rules. The cast is generic, flat, unrelatable, idiotic and unmemorable. It feels like they all came from some Disney Channel high-school.

Then there's the action. Explosions and slow-motion blood splatter doesn't make up for mediocre fight scenes. It's always just one overpowered person beating up someone else until they bleed from their skull. It's slightly worse than Falcon &amp; the Winter Soldier and embarrassingly bad compared to ATLA, TLOK, My Hero Academia, Incredibles and Spiderman into the Spider-verse.

Last and most certainly least there is the story, which is so unsatisfying. Omni-man's villain arc takes so long. Which would be fine if the other episodes were interesting, but they aren't. Every episode constantly teases Omni-man's evilness while showcasing the most boring and repetitive bad guys. Then once the plot twist finally arrives, it's about as shocking as Palpatine's reveal in Revenge of the Sith. It is a cool origin story but it's barely shown. Instead, season 1 ends with a montage of the same bad guys getting ready for season 2.

I don't know why the tv show Invincible is so popular or why Forbes calls it the best superhero tv show of the year.

Don't get me wrong, I know that in some cases you really have to defend yourself.

Today I explained at my job that something didn’t make any sense and it was wrong. I then went on a rant about how our employer won’t change how things operate under the excuse of “it’s how we’ve always done it and it’s worked fine”. Well, after I said this and all my coworkers agreed my supervisor pulled me into his office and said “you know, when I first started here new people weren’t allowed to have an opinion like you. You just sucked it up and moved on.” (I’ve been here for two years he’s been here for twelve) And I replied “well I’m sorry your experience here sucked and you were treated bad. You should have spoken up and said ‘this is not ok’”. He replied with “again, new people shouldn’t be allowed to run their mouths like you did today.” 

I looked at him sideways and said “so what’s the time limit on being able to speak up? 5 years? 10 years? I have to suffer for 13 years before I can say something is wrong? You’re apart of the problem here with that attitude. Wrong is wrong and if you see a problem you should be able to speak up and not feel like you’ll be talked to by your boss and told to suffer.” This stemmed an argument between us and finally I just said “if something is wrong I will speak up. Im sorry if that offends you or you had it worse than I did but like I said, wrong is wrong.”

My only other take would be to ban them from having children altogether, which seems slightly unjustified. First, the child would be socially doomed. I know we like to think ideally and positively and hope for the best but the truth is that reality doesn't give a shit. That kid would be ruthlessly bullied and would likely develop severe mental health and self-esteem issues, through no fault of their own. They wouldn't be able to have a dispute with anyone without their own mother being brought up in a less than ideal context. They would, quite literally, be dealt a rigged hand in the game of life. I borrowed that last phrase from YouTube, but it accurately describes the scenario in question. In this case, a compromise must be made to maintain the nature of a relationship between a mother and her child without compromising critical aspects of the child's life. In this case, the mother would give birth but would be required to put the child up for adoption. However, the child would have the right to know who their biological mother is, and would get to form a bond with their biological mother without the mother's past interfering with the present.

Girl Scout / Boy Scout troop trips / experience hammers a level of consideration and cooperation in people's heads so as an adult, you are constantly considering how your actions impact others and therefore work to be a considerate roommate. This wont be the case for every person, some just remain selfish and spoilt, but a strong collaborative experience as a child would allow a kid to grow up learning these skills and have less of an excuse to be a bad roommate

To give some context, throughout most of my life my gaming life has been primarily based around single player console games. It wasn't until a year or two ago that i built my PC and started playing multiplayer games with different groups of friends and every time I've used discord I've either had a mic audio issue, or some sense of overstimulation and confusion. 

Which leads me to another point, figuring out what the problem is on discord is easier said than done. Whenever it happens to me people just act like ""oh idk, just figure it out"" and sometimes an issue can have multiple causes and solutions which makes it a pain to figure out. The other day I was playing a game with some friends and I hit shift to run and the discord overlay popped up for whatever reason, and, I was eventually able to fix it, but it was annoying that it happened in the first place when many games use shift to run. 

Or another time Discord had switched audio inputs randomly and I didn't know about it and I sound like I was talking on a potato to my friends.

Not to mention the fact that whenever you open your computer discord comes tumbling out the bushed to meet you with an update or a sea of little names and icons and tabs and emotes.

I realize I can be being a bit of a boomer about this, and discord is the backbone of a lot of positive and awesome communities. I am only 23 but I feel like discord is little abrasive, hard to navigate and understand sometimes.

I want to like Discord but everytime I use it I feel like an 80 year old trying to navigate an iphone for the first time.

It’s like cultural fracking and I can only assume that if you were hyped about the matrix after all these failed reboots then at this point you are a completely thoughtless person.

It was yet another trailer scientifically engineered to “send chills down your spine” and remind you of better times.

491,t3_ru9bul,Sega Dreamcast failed because of software sales. They gave us the bullet to shoot themselves in the foot.,"I recently had a discussion about what caused the Dreamcast to fail. I brought up bootleggers, and it was brought to my attention that reason is BS. But for the sake of arguement and my unhumbled beginnings my real life sample size couldn't be rationalized.

I want you to think of an average middle school, high school class room. Majority of the class are multiple console owners, so it's not a matter of the DC wasn't appealing, we had PS2, DC, and N64. So one kid in the class can goto Electronics Botique buy a DC game and take advantage of their beat the game in 24 hours and recieve a full retail value exchange for another game. That one person can take out the 7 most popular games on DC in a week. BOG7! Bootleg all the games and sell or give away the games amongst the classroom. Next let's make it worse, the Electronics Botique employee has access to the games and can have all the DC available in store in the matter of a week. And they do exactly the same thing. That's one sale just in that classroom. Any DC game you pick out you could slash 15-50% off its sales because of the implication of the pirating. Let's not even mention that the recycling of used games would only benefit the retailer in my case at the time Electronics Botique. 

It doesn't matter what other reasons you bring up. Nintendo having a better 1st party system. The PS2 having the DVD. If all people had to do was buy the Dreamcast once mission accomplished. But when you have 1 million copies in consoles but you only made 45k worth of sales because you lost half to bootleggers and the other 5k to the purchasing of used games you're bleeding out.  Software sales benefit hardware companies in the long run.  Because they expect you to buy 1. Then buy at least 50 full priced games from there.  Buy another controller.  Memory card.  But for the most part they want you to buy the games.

Game sales hemorrhaging and not even acknowledging and fixing the issue is one of the main reasons the investment of the Dreamcast didn't pay off. Because it had an excellent selection of video games! I just know when I look back,  I realized how many games I could've actually owned... Getting games as birthday,  holiday gifts.

493,t3_ru8qam,"Emulation of retro games is not only morally sound, but the flashing and hosting of Roms, preserving those games, is a public service.","90% of the games that you can emulate are out of print, no longer being sold, games you can only buy used from collectors and resellers, meaning any means by which you can obtain these games is not taking anything from the devs, because they aren't selling them. We've all heard this argument.

Well, some people have told me they'd rather support a fellow retro game collector than a rom website, but well here's the thing.

While there's definitely nothing wrong with supporting a collector, it's definitely not morally Superior to supporting a rom website with your webtraffic. As nice as it is that these collectors are preserving the games, these games that used to be 10-20$ are becoming ever more scarce and hard to find originals, and there's honestly a 50/50 chance you're just supporting some dude who flashes roms to carts and sells em on ebay. The value goes up and the stock goes down, and now these simple classic games are fairly inaccessible to anyone of meager income. And one day, almost all the originals will eventually be destroyed, save for a few museum items.

When you support a rom website, you're supporting a team of people, who took it upon themselves to make digital copies of all these titles, no matter how unpopular, and archived them where anyone from future generations can go back and play them again. Games that would normally have been gone from the face of the earth, hidden gems that were really good but didn't have a big production, and honestly a lot of games that probably should be lost to time too.

Point is, a good few people try to act like people who emulate are on par with net piracy, and like rom hosting sites are basically the pirate bay. But when you honestly think about it, these guys are doing something good for the world. Most of these games would have been forgotten to time without the help of emulation and rom websites, and you should feel good about supporting the sites that do it.",600.0

I think reddit is such a clever and great way for people to ""anonymously"" interact with one another. People share their opinions, they make memes and funny (or unfunny) posts. People seek help and offer help. It's a great place to kill some time when there is nothing else to do.

But, the karma system is completely unnecessary and takes away from the potential from the site.

People actively farm karma, and put so much value on karma, an otherwise completely useless thing. Nobody gives a s\*\*t how much karma you have or don't have. That cutie at the bar is not going to be your friend because you've farmed 1 million karma this month. People also upvote/downvote things arbitrarily, and honest posts/comments/questions occasionally get downvoted to oblivion for no real reason, while complete shitposts will get thousands of upvotes.

The upvotes and downvotes are great and can be used to promote popular content... but the site puts so much value on karma and despite not *actually* caring about it, when I'm on the site, I feel like I have to care. If a comment or post gets downvoted a lot, I actually feel bad. At the end of the day, I don't care... but at the same time I still do? And that is due to the design of the site.

The reason I think this way: I live in a different country where they have sites just like reddit, with a voting system etc. But there is no such thing as karma, and honestly using and navigating the site generally just feels better. Comments are more genuine and posts are more interesting, because nobody is trying too hard to farm karma. The downside, it isn't in english and it's exhausting for me to use when english is my native language.

IMO if karma didn't exist, and nobody really cared about farming some generally irrelevant statistic reddit would be a better place.",51.0
506,t3_ru6o2k,Pickup lines are lame and childish,"29yo man here. Maybe I’m just becoming an old fart with no sense of humor.

I mean, if it’s not copy and paste pickup lines, am I supposed to memorize 100, and pull the one out of my ass that’s suitable for this perfect moment? The whole thing just seems like an odd alien courting ritual to me. Or like birds where the male bird is bouncing around like a blob while the female bird is “convinced” by the odd display.

509,t3_ru6hif,The free will argument is a poor excuse for the problem of evil,"For those who don't know, the problem of evil is essentialy the question: ""if God is omnipotent, omnisient and is good, then why is there so much suffering and cruelty in the world?""

One of the most common solutions to this question is the argument is that God gave us free will, and thus we have the choice to do harm.

Even if we accept the existence of free will, which is problematic in it's own right, There are a few problems with this solution.

One of these problems is that it inherently assumes free will to be good. We assume that our freedom of choice is essential for God's design. But why is free will inherently better then no free will? Why is free will essential for God's design? If God truely is the creater of all things in existence, then he is also the creater of values. God descides what is essential for his design. He decides what is good and what is bad.

Therefore, if he willed it, he could decide that free will is bad and that creating a determiniatic reality free of suffering is good. 

In short if God is truely omnipotent, he could make an alternate universe, that is equally good or better (by god's standards) without free will and no suffering. Therefore free will is no excuse for the problem of evil.",14.0

But what people are doing to him is not appropiate

&amp;nbsp;

**For anyone out of the loop** EDP was chatting with a minor, said some disgusting things and decided to go meet up with this person. Got Chris Hansen'ed and is now facing backlash and has been facing backlash for quite some time now

&amp;nbsp;

**Basically what people are doing to him** is making sure he gets evicted from his apartments through complaints, making sure he gets kicked off any hotel he tries to stay in, makes sure if he gets some sort of job to call his employers and get him fired, contact any social media he signs up for to make sure he gets banned. The dude pretty much got **cancelled** from life, he can't find any place to live in and he can't rebuild his life with a new job because no matter what he tries people come after him.

&amp;nbsp;

**I believe this is the perfect summary of everything that is wrong** with cancel culture, where people on the internet tries to for some reason be the police and make sure the person in question can't get their life back even if all they want is just to work, if the police believed he deserved criminal charges they'd obviously make sure he'd be put behind bars, but the reality of the situation is that he didn't actually do anything (even if he tried), which is why the police isn't doing anything. So if the police doesn't think he deserve jailtime or death sentences, then why does the internet wish this upon him? Why is the internet allowed to morally grandstand and dictate how much freedom a person shall have? The inconsistencies doesn't help either, some people say they'll forgive him when he does *this* others say he has to do *that*. Everyone has different conditions for these types of things and there's pretty much nothing he can do to earn people's forgiveness, the comments I've also seen people type is disgusting, how they want him to blow his brains out, be killed and basically just have his life ended because of ONE incident that DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN. Yes, what he did is wrong, and obviously he shouldn't be allowed to do it again which is why the social media bans are somewhat appropriate, but at this point the internet is leaving him no choice other than to kill himself because he's not even allowed to have an apartment

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR; People make sure he can't have an apartment, earn money and they wish him to blow his brains out. I believe this is inappropriate to do towards anyone no matter what they did, everyone deserves a chance at life and these cases should always be handled by the police and not by teenagers online.",0.0

But unless it’s some BS weight loss pill or tea, or some ridiculous fad where you’re only eating boiled chicken for six weeks, “diet culture” is not inherently toxic. Even yo-yo dieting is better than endlessly gaining weight and never trying to course-correct. So if you lost the weight and gained it back, it was not a failure. You probably learned how to eat better, and you proved to yourself that you’re mentally strong enough to do it. Which means you can do it again and you’re never stuck on your current path.

EDIT: To clarify, I’m seeing people say “love your body exactly the way it is right now” and I agree, you shouldn’t be cruel to yourself. But trying to lose weight is not always a bad thing and sometimes that’s the message that’s coming across.

Yes, it's good to see all perspectives. That is being a good historian. And yes, I understand that there has been a lot of 'book burnings and brainwashing over the centuries. I'm not disputing this. However people throw this term way too casually these days, especially on YouTube. It's often used as a mask to hide or an attempt to sympathise or normalize Nazi aggression and atrocities. I also don't, in fact never, see documentaries and books on WW2 (often written by citizens in victory countries) in any way omitting or minimising or denying the atrocities inflicting by the allies. Everyone knows about Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Everyone knows about the bombing of Dresdon. 

But even besides the usual WW2 examples (because this sub is actually about unpopular opinions, and Nazi apologists ideology is still just a fringe belief), I want to draw comparisons to other older writings and evidence that people still overuse the term on. Whilst we should understand that somebody like King Richard III is probably generally unfairly maligned by the Tudor period because he lost the War of the Roses (think Shakespeares villainous hatchback king), there _is_ compelling perspective that Richard III murdered the princes in line for the throne, whom 'mysteriously' died. He had a big motive for doing so. I think it would be fair to say he might of indeed been a bad person.

One interesting example too I think about, is the Julius Caesars Roman view on the defeated native British. I think the Romans were on the whole, fairly accurate and meticulous in their recordings of key battles, and sometimes even sometimes respectful of flattering accounts of the enemy. Generally speaking, historical texts may or may not have some small biases, but it shouldn't be assumed enemy armies and leaders would automatically be disrespectful or tarnish the identity of losing parties. Or even that they automatically have motive to do so.

Everyone knows about the slave trade ect. The British Empire and stuff like the Opium Wars are not written in the most flattering way to the British in British history books. Yes, many of the evidence and accounts are probably from the survivors. But all of it? Are there really no evidence or accounts of British subjects recording their own atrocities and absolutely no introspection? No recorded guilt?

And I mean this as but one example throughout the rest of history, especially in even older times where peoples were more religious, and very fearful of God and holy afterlife judgment. I would imagine this should be taken into consideration when it comes to the 'confessing of sins', as much of the literate in recorded history were highly religious monks, priests, nobleman and kings.

546,t3_ru14kq,Encanto is way overhyped,"So don’t get me wrong: I still think this is the best movie to come out of Disney Animation Studios since Moana, but it’s still a bit of a let down in a few ways. 

It feels pretty unfocused, there are a few plot lines and story arcs that were sort of followed and then dropped and then picked up again (like Dolores’ thing for Mariano and certain characters that seemed like they were gonna be bigger deals and then weren’t like Antonio). I really respect the themes that the movie was trying to convey, and I feel like it almost hits the mark. But I didn’t feel like it was clear enough from the beginning.

Also… look I know everyone online is sobbing over how good this song is, but Surface Pressure (Luisa’s song) is REALLY underwhelming to me, and for a few key reasons. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with the lyrics or music itself, that’s all just as fantastic as everyone says it is. But Jessica Darrow’s vocal performance is… lackluster. I can’t be the only one who noticed this, but her placement is really bizarre and off, it feels really far back in the throat, and she hits SO many “hard R’s” and closes off so many vowels. I don’t know if I’m the only one who hears this, so if there are any other singers or musicians, please lmk if I’m not crazy. Also, I couldn’t take the song seriously anymore once the donkeys started dancing with her. So tonally disjointed.

I still really enjoyed the movie, and it’s still a movie I’d recommend (if for NO other reason than EVERYONE should see “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”… 10/10 song). It’s still a good, fun, funny movie with a lot of important stuff to say, but I think it was really clunky in the way that it says it.

547,t3_ru12qc,Cats should be groomed on a regular basis.,"Tw; brutal descriptions

First things first, why i think this way.
I want to state that i, Soy, am a *professional cat groomer*, i am what is the known as a CFMG, there are less then 500 of us worldwide so we arent very well known.
To become a CFMG (certified feline master groomer) you need to take 4 written exams and many many practical exams with your ppi instructor. I have been practicing since i was 8 (my mom is a CFMG and had been for 11 years now so i was raised with cat grooming) i point this out to make it clear that i do in fact, know what i am talking about. I will use facts that i personally have seen regarding cats not being groomed on a regular basis.

now onto my reasonings

Reason 1;
•Build up of dead fur and grease will cause matting•
~~Without proper combing and bathing, the dead fur and grease build up will cause matting/ pelting on a cat. (pelting being a more severe matting) These are incredibly hard to get out of a cat without harming them as their thin paper-like skin folds up into their fur. This makes the chances of accidentally cutting the cats much higher. Cats skin, being not connected to any tissue, if badly cut they can open up like a zipper. 

Reason 2;
•it is overall healthier for the cats•
~~once you get all the dirt, grease, and possible mats off of your cat, they will have a much healthier lifestyle, they’ll be able to run around and feel great while their coat takes time to recover from the neglect it was given. Their coat will be able to grow back healthier, cleaner, and much much better. Getting possible mats off will also help elderly cats with arthritis as mats weigh down cats causing them to carry much more weight around.
In addition to this, note that infections can take place under those mats, such as feal bite dermatitis and stud tail. You can also find masses and other concerning issues that the mats have been hiding once you shave them off.

Reason 3;
•Health for the owner•
~~Getting your cats washed on a regular basis will reduce dander on cats which will reduce allergic reactions, it’ll get rid of the saliva on their fur causing some reactions. If you choose to shave them you wouldnt have as much stress with combing them out and wouldnt have to worry about the amount of shed

Reason 4; 
•Maintenance•
~~Cats as they are, are high maintenance, but keeping your cat clean and combed will make it easier to brush them and makes for a much cleaner house

Reason 5;
•Possible health issues•
~~Bringing your cat into the groomer will allow you to know if there are concerns about your cats health, if your cat has any masses or other things we notice (such as fleas, acne, needing a dental, maybe liver failure, stuff like that) we will take note of it and recommend a vet visit (we are not vets therefore we are not able to diagnose anything, but we will point them out so you know what you need a vet visit for.)

With my reasons being stated i would like to back myself up with myths and the real reasons behind them.

Cats dont like water (Part false)
        ~It depends entirely on the cat, some cats love the water, some cats are very scared of the water but will learn to like it over time, it just takes time and patience to get them used to

Cats groom themselves (False!)
        ~Cats dont groom themselves, if you were to lick yourself all day without taking a shower would you be clean?? no, you would be covered in saliva. Which is what cats do, they cover themselves in their saliva so they mask any unwanted scents.

I would love to have a ^friendly^ discussion in the comments if anyone has anything to change my opinion, though i refuse to purposefully have an argument. I am open to questions and discussions but no attacks as this is my professional opinion backed up with facts that i have found, this is in no way an order to attack me in any way at all as that causes unwanted stress.

Edit; i got the notification of your comment though i am unable to see it, a friend copy and pasted your msg and sent it to me so i will reply here &lt;3

“First off, I feel like you should have clarified exactly what you mean by ""regular grooming"". That is extremely vague.”
•To clarify; By ‘regular grooming’ i mean being combed (not brushed, combing is less damaging) bathed and dried (with the occasional clipperwork)

“Long haired breeds may need it every day, especially in warmer months when they shed more.”
•With that you are correct, though combing your cat too much will pull out all of their fuzzy coat and leave only guard hairs which is very damaging to them

“Cats absolutely do groom themselves.”
•They do not, cats use their tounge in the ways you stated but that is not grooming themselves, that is simply doing what they must to take care of their fur best they can, they are still not clean and still covered in saliva when they are doing this, a recommended 6-8 week schedule of grooms will prevent matting and make sure they are actually clean

“Cats don't like water, that is a truth. Teaching a cat from a young age may change this, and each individual cat is different.”
•Cats dont like water is, as i stated, *depending on the cat.* each cat comes with their unique personality which includes different takings to water, many cats like the water, lots are afraid of it, and very rarely we have cats that hate it

“Unless your cat is especially dirty or smells, a bath typically isn't necessary.”
•Key word; typically. Cats still need baths, it dosnt matter how much they smell it gets rid of the gunk buildup and helps their skin

“A dirty cat is often a sign of an unhealthy home”
•While this is true, a dirty cat is also a sign of them not being *washed* because their coat holds all their grease, it builds up over time leaving dander and grease build up that can cause infections

“You imply a human tongue is comparable to a cats. You're a cat groomer, surely you understand different species have different capabilities.”
•A human and a cat are different, either way they both end up covered in saliva and if they were to lick something that something they licked would still have saliva until it was cleaned off

“You specifically talk about thin skin with pelted cats.”
•nono all cats have thin skin, thats just how cat skin is, it isnt as thick as human skin therefore it’s quite easy to cut. it just depends on how fat or skinny the cat is to tell how loose and easier to cut the skin is. Fat cats have stretched skin therefore theres less of a chance of cutting them because itd already stretched

“The only people I have ever heard claim that cats grooming themselves is a myth, are cat groomers.”
•Oddly enough more then just groomers say that.

“I also want to point out that as a cat groomer, you are very often seeing the worst of the worst. The vast majority of cats don't go to a groomer regularly because they don't need to.”
•While that is true, the only worst of the worst we see are new cats and those who arent on a regular schedule, because of seeing and feeling the difference between clean and dirty cat, owners are able to tell when their cat needs a bath and when they do not

i do see your points, yes, but cats still need to be groomed",8.0

549,t3_ru0ymx,Unions are at least partially responsible for the decline of unions.,"Most people like to bring up the narrative that a significant amount of people are against unions but the [facts](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/03/majorities-of-americans-say-unions-have-a-positive-effect-on-u-s-and-that-decline-in-union-membership-is-bad/) don't necessarily support it. I think a lot of non-pro union people are apathetic at best. The real anti-union people are actually union members themselves. 

They limit the amount of young people that can get in for fear of having their pay/benefits diluted and the unions thus slowly shrink. That's why most union leadership are dinosaurs.

550,t3_ru0vzm,Disney Star Wars isn't bad,"I get it: Luke sucked in Last Jedi. The whole sequel trilogy was like a mess of stolen ideas (another Death Star, Rey wanting to be a Skywalker, a bunch of non-canon storylines bastardized or re-created in patchwork but missing the main goals of the original novels).

Why I think it will work: The Mandalorian redeems Luke or at least sets the stage for him to have some fun with modern special effects. His character arch doesn't go from hero to zero directly anymore and I have faith the hero part will continue to grow. The producers set the stage for Grogu's long term story (baby Yoda will seem apt when they show Grogu all grown up in a future movie or show) while also reminding us that Yoda's species is rare (a prereq for his power in old republic era movies and shows). They continue the clone and stormtrooper stories that show they are people too: Boba suffering but more importantly (to me at least) the Bad Batch and Omega and Rebels clone troopers being actual humans with feelings and ability to be good. 

The most important thing to a huge universe of stories is character building and the original trilogies did the easy part. Lucas started to do the harder part via a variety of mediums including some fun games and some shìt shows but he definitely had the ground work laid when he sold LA/LF. Disney may be an obnoxiously slow owner to get it done but they will build an actual universe and timeline of characters.

551,t3_ru07ga,"""Sitting on the fence"" is a intellectual decision"," ""Sitting on the fence"" is an artificial label thought up by people with agendas.

I am not going to be pressured into taking sides by anybody.

Sometimes it takes experience that I might not ever have.
And sometimes I can see both points of view and have no desire to pick a side.
No reason for sitting on the fence makes you weak.

I've personally found that the only people who use that phrase, are people who are trying to win you over to their side, and can't.

People make a decision just because they don't have the strength to endure not knowing, so they pretend to themselves that they know.

The best songs from the band are just mediocre at best, which made me feel confused on why the band was so popular in the first place, even back then. I think they are more recognized because of the stage makeup and their merchandise that involves the logo.

557,t3_rtzv6z,Jackie Brown is Tarantino's best movie.,"It's been one of my favorite movies since I saw it Xmas night in 97. I rewatch it every holiday season for personal reasons. It's without question the best paced, best acted and most complete QT movie (IMO of course). 

I know it is way straight forward for a QT movie. The performances by Sam Jackson and DeNiro though are some of the strongest of their acting careers. 

I argue you do not always need a over the top story line to make a movie work. 
Kill Bill, Django or The Hateful 8. Granted the dialogue makes those movies absolute treasures but they can lose themselves in the absurdity. JB doesn't do that. 

It should be considered QT best work and I'll accept Pulp as a contender. I'll argue though that between the soundtrack and story pacing coupled with the acting it's a better flick. Is it as culturally significant? No. That's because it's more reserved. That doesn't make it a worse film though.

558,t3_rtzulx,Antagonists/villians who act kind at the beginning of movies/dramas make me cringe.,"Now these aren't the same as ""surpsrise villians"". Surprise villians can be portrayed as kind, attractive, idolized, naïve, or even unintelligent at the beginning, but the ones I'm talking about are actually villians that help the protagonist along their causes before absolutely backstabbing them.

I don't like these sorts of villians because the acts of kindness they do often go overboard, as if they want the audience to think 'this character could be evil, and is only doing this to fool them.' Which ruins trying to concentrate on the story or the plot. If said character DID end up innocent, it would be a great twist, but most of the time, they end up backstabbing, which by now would be expected by the audience. 

Also, the author/director intends to direct much hate to this character, because they are portrayed to be deceiving, which nullifies all the acts of kindness they've done. This can lead to positive catharsis, but if the villian was kind and subtle enough, they might have grown into a good image to viewers, and with the backstab, those viewers may thing this plot was forced to induce more drama.

At home I can pause it, watch it at my own time, eat or drink whatever I want. And most of all have no disturbances whatsoever.

I just don't see the attraction to go, other than you can't wait for it to hit home viewing. But even now that's possible for a hefty fee. But if you put in ticket prices, food and drinks and gas.

585,t3_rtwa8r,Parents should have friends over much more - for the sake of their children and themselves,"I've been thinking about this for some time and how a lot of parents are so tired and feel so isolated when they're having young children and all the lamenting and crying about how hard it is.

Here's a novel take:

Invite your friends over much more frequently and watch how your kids behave nicer and how you stop caring so much about presenting a perfect home.

I think it's very healthy for kids to see their parents interact with friends. Teaches the kids that there's a world outside them, that while obviously they are safe and protected, they also have to deal with their parents having other concerns.

And friends can come to help out a little bit with cooking or whatever.

I also think it really helps with the relationship as you don't get that cabin fever thing going on, where you only see each other and the kids and become sort of obsessed about these little things.

What's the problem really? Kids won't mind. Give them some toy or candy once in a while and they'll come to anticipate Uncles and Aunts coming to visit. 

They'll likely also behave nicer, that's what my friends tell me.

All in all, having friends over as a parent is an important part of the socialisation process for children.

I saw countless petitions for parents who had their kids taken away for “spanking”. Upon looking them up further I found that their kids were bleeding, bruised and some had testicular injuries. Ofc the parents signed the petition without thinking. I worked in a charity for people who attempted suicide. I had a patient whose mother poured salt into his stab wound and called him slurs against mentally ill people. Social workers refused to do anything because “being a parent to a kid with mental health issues is a tough job.” I was raped several times between 2003-2005. I filed a report on one of the perpetrators in 2016. The police officer refused to believe me because the perpetrators had four kids and she literally said “I’m a mom” as her reason for siding with the female perpetrator. I was abused at home until I moved out this year at age 21. I grew up getting told “you have to listen to your parents no matter what” and “your parents always know what’s best for you” from every adult in my community. If I said that I didn’t agree they would just repeat the same thing like a broken record. Several people have told me that I don’t know anything because I don’t have children. 


And of course their excuse for noticing all the red flags and doing nothing is “I wouldn’t get between a mother and her child.” Bullshit. You were fine getting involved when it was interjecting to criticize my behavior, tell me how to act with my mother, etc without knowing the situation. You were fine saying “wow, what a bad kid” when seeing us fight in public. I doubt you would think saying “what a terrible mother” in public was appropriate.


More kids get killed by parents than by police every year. More kids get molested by parents than by priests every year. But nobody wants to cancel Mother’s Day and Father’s Day the same way they want to cancel appreciation days for the other two groups.

Research says that good tickets costed about $1,700-50000 in today’s modern currency (US). This proves that being rich doesn’t equate to intelligence. Simply put, the people who went on this ship couldn’t care less about the safety guidelines of the Titanic. If you were unaware, the Titanic had an insufficient number of lifeboats, with only a measly 16. Any reasonable family wouldn’t dare to invite their children on this architectural disaster

All of the data was there in a magazine that detailed every spec of the ship: uneven infrastructure, a control base that is barely functional, and a laughable paint job that only made the ship less stable. The reused rusty motors from previous vessels made the ship prone to failure as well. The use of coal power is monumentally outdated as opposed to nuclear power. It’s even true that they gave up on fully fleshing out the four smokestacks, as one was only decoration.

Nowadays it’s nice to see that people do their research before entering something that they will be trapped in for days. Maybe people opened their eyes after this disaster.

\- More people want to have jobs that are considered praiseworthy and impacts are apparent (teachers, firemen, social worker, etc) so they are paid less. In contrast, uninteresting/boring jobs and ""evil"" jobs have less worker supply and will pay more (oil rig workers, hedge fund manager, etc)

604,t3_rtulll,Romance movies/stories are responsible for setting false idea of love as much as pornos are for setting unrealistic expectations for sex.,"(English is not my first language so please bear with it)

Let me explain by what i mean by the title.

Porn and romance movies are similar in a way that both set high unrealistic expectations in their field. Say, when a guy (maybe teenager) watches porn and he's a virgin, the only exposure he has had to the topic of sex is what people do in porn like fucking for hours or just railing it in and expecting the girl to like it or whatever. But in reality sex is much more than in porn.

Similar things happen when a teenager watches a movie or reads any story with love being the forefront, in those love is shown as an abstract idea of perfection, we are lead to believe that love is a silver bullet, just with the power of love anything is possible, if you love a person hard enough they don't have any flaws and everything is perfect in the future. In my opinion that's where the problem lies. By these we are made to turn a blind eye on the imperfections of your significant other and lead to believe that some how in a way they are ""perfect"".

As Alain de Botton said ""Love is not an admiration of perfect, love is a sympathy for many things which are less than perfect"", this line stuck with me since I heard it.

Now I'm not anti-love, opposed to that, I'm a sucker for love. I want to be in love as much as any another person. But, what I am opposed to is the unrealistic expectations of love.

Ask anyone what's the key to good sex, they will always say communication among other things, so we like to say the same thing for a good relationship but more often than not this is clouded by the ideas which are seeded in our mind by unrealistic love stories. Which most of the times leads to disappointment and negative feelings for love with most of the people.

well thanks you for listening to this little rant/opinion, and would love to hear more about it from you guys.

edit: Let make myself clear, I'm not saying that people should stop watching or making these stories or movies (do whatever the fuck you want). These are just work of fiction and the part where I have problem is when people don't take work of fiction as what it is. But most of the times it being fiction is not as evident as say in a porn and we tend to forget that sometimes. All I'm saying is most of them don't show the real aspects of love or what makes a lasting relationship.

I expect to be able to pay for something without having to double I's and cross t's of whatever antiquated automated system is in place to send me the bill.

Bill chargers have 0 incentive not to charge more than their actual fees: if you don't catch it, more money for them. If you do, oops! Our mistake, we'll correct is immediately! And they walk away with the money they would have anyways. This is why there are so many erroneous credit reports and bills 

Most recent example: I received the hospital bills for my wife's birth. We were charged for both a C-section and a circumcision, *neither of which we got!* The bill was for over $1000 more than what we ought to have paid, and I had to manually click on each service provided to determine what it is we were paying for; the bill titles sounded reasonable and most people (myself included) have no idea how much a hospital stay for a birth is going to cost. The only reason I caught these mistakes was because I am nit-picky when it comes to paying bills.

1.Your home is heated by wood or other fuels, i.e. coal,  heating oil, natural gas, lpg etc., using a furnace in your home.

2. Your home is being supplied electricity by power lines from a generation plant far away from you.

3. It's winter or cold enough you need your home to be heated for your comfort, i.e. you do not need the home to be cooled.

Why:  Incandescent bulbs are considered inefficient because they use a large amount of electricity to create light.   But, the energy consumed by the bulb  that is not light is creating heat.   Each incandescent light bulb is essentially a tiny heater as well as a light source.   So you are heating your home with each incandescent light bulb, as well as with your furnace.  So your furnace does not need to burn as much fuel to heat you home because any incandescent light bulbs that are on are already supplying some of the heat.  So less CO2 and other waste gases are exhausted by your furnace locally.  If you are using LED lights, each bulb creates much less heat,  so you will need to burn more fuel in the furnace to keep your home warm, which  exhausts more waste gas to the neighborhood.",0.0

To me what really bothers me is the character designs. They all look like Funko pops, huge eyes, all look like children (even the middle aged characters, usually the ladies) and they look plasticky and horrible. Their heads remind me of Stewie Griffin.

But I'm so sick of seeing posts and stuff about how books are somehow the key to happiness and intelligence. As if reading a book grants wisdom and power? Like reading a novel makes you better than me? 

Furthermore, why are books connected with smarts? Unless you're reading a book about a particular subject, a book magically grant you intelligence.  You have study and let is sink in.

622,t3_rtso4d,The bigger problem then the cost of college is how many poor kids are shoved into loans by the adults they trust,Now student loans and interest rates are fucking crazy but as a current hs student I’m constantly shoved to go into programs with 40k plus in loan debt and the loan plans they are helping me look at have up to 7% interest and they barely acknowledge it at the very least they should sit down and do the math of how much you will have to pay in interest. But instead they just shove this at me and judge me for saying I don’t want to go to college and want to do trades to not be in debt. The fact that our school counselor is doing this is going to put hundreds of students in my school alone into debt slavery they refuse to discuss waiting to get a better rate or doing it in my mid 20’s to be better prepped for it and if I hadn’t done the math I could’ve gotten fucked by this.

623,t3_rtsjuq,"If you live in an area where you have to regularly water your lawn for it to survive, your probably shouldn't have one","I'm talking about people who live in very dry areas who water their lawns regularly.

Lawn grass doesn't do very well in particularly dry or hot conditions, so people use a lot of water to keep it alive. What purpose does this actually serve? Gives you a green lawn? What's the point?

A green lawn in a desert looks unnatural and is a huge waste of water, a scarce resource in those areas. There are probably plants more suited to that environment which would make for a more natural-looking and eco-friendly garden. And if you need an area for kids to play, there are artificial surfaces (fake grass, play area surfaces etc.) that you can use instead.

Lawns are fine in areas that get enough rain to keep the grass alive. I live in the UK, and we never water our lawn. It might go yellow in dry summers, but a) we don't care, and b) it's fine after a bit of rain. If your area is so dry the grass just straight up dies in the summer, you shouldn't have a lawn.

Watering grass constantly to keep it green is an unnecessary waste of water when there are alternatives available.",131.0

I'll use OBS from time to time, but Shadowplay is super easy to use, doesn't take a lot of space and performance like OBS does, and is insanely easy to edit in Resolve.

I suck at improvising, and I'm not bashing msyelf, I'm okay with this, because it's developed my skillset better to atune what I'm good at when it comes to making videos. I feel as though I'm not the only one that feels this way, and there are definitely streamers and youtubers that don't talk at all in their videos that're successful.

Lets say you just got back from running or doing something outside, if you drink warm water, your body temperature will not go down as much. If you drink cold water, your body temperature may go down but you will have to stop chugging every 3 seconds due to the cold feeling in your throat. If you just want to drink water, cold water has the same problem making your throat freeze, and hot water is uncomfortable.

This where slightly below room temperature water comes in. Anytime I want to drink water I either grab a bottle or pour some from the tap and then put it in the freezer for 5-10 minutes for it to be just the right temperature for me to enjoy. If its really hot outside it also works out well because you are able to chug the water quickly to re-hydrate, unlike cold water where you have to stop drinking periodically.

They both are incredibly popular, both are incomplete, both saw the last releases in the series just over a decade ago.  My opinion is that both authors created popular books and worlds by loading them with mysteries and riddles to unravel, and have written themselves into a corner and simply cannot tie all of the open ends back together in anything resembling a rewarding conclusion.

In the Kingkiller chronicle we have one book remaining to explain who was the killed king, why was he killed, what's in the thrice locked chest, what's in the lackless box, who are the chandrian, the 4 key door in the library, the cthaeh, who is master ash, what do waystones do, who is auri, who is bast, why does kvothe change his name, what is the Folly sword, who are the amyr, what was the underthing...

A Song of Fire and Ice is less fresh in my memory, and I fall into being confused between show and books, so I'll be brief.  There's the fire god who gives magic to his priests, the dragons returning, the walking ice dead, the evil queen, the good queen, the guy with rights to be king, the dothraki, the plague, winter that lasts for years coming... just lots of potential deaths and questions how anyone will survive anything.

I think both of these books fall into a category I'd call 'Lost', after the TV show, which is the king of setting up a bunch of interesting mysteries and then failing to fullfill on the promise of answering those with a satisfying resolution.

Parents divorced at a young age- dad is a POS and I became my mum's emotional support. My sister has/had golden child syndrome; can't do anything wrong, always perfect, etc, etc.

Last night my family watched Encanto and my mum burst into tears afterwards because seeing Luisa sing about the pressure of being perpetually emotionally strong made her realise what she had been doing to me all these years. She said the same thing about Isabella and being 'perfect'.

A lot of people don't recognise a problem until it's shown in a different context and I think a lot of parents and kids would benefit from seeing more dysfunctional families on screen to help recognise it in themselves. And I'm talking in a realistic way like Encanto did it, not how Mother Gothel is portrayed which is overly dramatic and villain-esque (which I get is the point, but still). It's why Encanto is so popular with teens, in my own experience. It shows a realistic portrayal of what many go through for their families.

It could also help kids in these situations realise that something isn't right and/or bring it up with parents.

I also think introducing it in a kids film is a family friendly way to get parents to see the messages without shoving it down their throats.

EDIT: Some of you hens took 'hey lets have more discussions about parental pressure on kids. it would be beneficial' and turned it into 'ah yeh, beating children'. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about things like golden child syndrome, putting too much pressure on your child, etc, etc.

669,t3_rto2xm,Pop Culture is running out of ideas and a great chunk of the latest releases are nostalgia-induced or reskinned regurgitated crap,"With the release of Harry Potter 20th Anniversary Return to Hogwarts, I am yet reminded that big industries are unable to provide full-fledged new experiences to their consumers and instead they find shelter in regurgitating old things for the sake of nostalgia with 0 innovation whatsoever, or straight up reskinning whatever worked in the past and trying to ship it as something brand new. A lot of this is due to the fact that corporations nowadays have control over what is released and what is not as opposed to having the developers/creators do it.

For example, MW2019 was a game that brought the COD franchise back on track with an exciting new formula to COD, completely innovative and very captivating in almost everything. Then we get Vanguard which is the exact same game with very minor tweaks and whatnot.

Halo Infinite is another game released solely based on Nostalgia. BF2042 is a game that had a few nostalgic shots in its trailer, trying to capture the old feeling of playing Battlefield. This Harry Potter is a nostalgia shot. The Friends reunion is another one. Spider-Man NWH brings back Maguire and Garfield, again, in an attempt to strike that nostalgia chord in us. Seriously, the big majority of these big releases are nothing new, things that we have seen a long time ago and just back at it for the sake of nostalgia and that's it.

Innovative works are very few. I seriously can't recall any kind of work that has brought some new concept to life. Maybe the Last Duel and the House of Gucci, Dune, and a few others, but the great majority is just nostalgia and reskinned crap. I think this is especially concerning and the pop culture is becoming dull for the first time in my life, and that this nostalgia and reskinned crap is unprecedented.

Edit: I think there is a difference between remastering something (think of the remastered Star Wars movies or all the recently remastered games) as opposed to this brand new game/movie covering the old product's formula. One is plainly stating they are making a thing look better, the other are arguing they are creating something new.",8.0

I'm not here to argue the morality of having billions of dollars. I'm here because I'm super annoyed by you all pushing mob justice.

We can't say one way or another.

An example:

I used to hang out with this guy J for many years. He was a cool guy and really charismatic and good at connecting with everyone, but mostly focused on the popular kids. It wasn't until one day someone said something that I realized that J was a big time local drug dealer.

Years. I thought I knew this guy. He seemed a pretty upstanding individual. Liked to party but he didn't go too far, he was just like the rest of us. Turns out that he sold tons of all kinds of drugs to the wealthy and poor kids. 

Does that mean that I sold or did drugs?

Not.At.All.

I hung out at his house, passing out after one party and ate cold pizza and drank warm beer the next morning. We went out to dinner and hung out as friends would. I'm in pictures with J, even with my arm around him in some. He dated some of my girl friends. I never thought for a minute that he was up to something bad.

I was just as surprised as all of you.


So cut it out with the mob justice and wait until we know some actual facts. 

Association doesn't mean that someone committed a crime.

Freezing them for sometime before it makes the process even less painful to them, (not so fun fact: lobsters, like most animals including humans don't feel much pain when frozen) and the cold temperature vastly weakens their nervous system, plus slowing down their body functions and the rotting process of the meat 

So no, there is no ""less painful""(to the lobsters) , healthier(for the meat) or better (for the taste) way to kill a lobster than Freezing it for a while and then boiling it 

And if you are against killing animals in general, then maybe don't fucking eat lobsters? 

And if you like lobster to be boiled without Freezing then go seek help you sick fuckturd, it not only hurts them more, but it makes the risk of you getting ill go higher (and arguably, makes it taste worse)

EDIT: stabbing them in the head does not kill them, nor does it decrease pain and it has almost nothing to do with what I was talking about

676,t3_rtnb1z,"Matrix 4 is brilliant and, if you dislike it, then you didn't understand it.","TLDR: The fourth Matrix movie is telling you that you don't know what your own freedom and happiness look like. You are more comfortable in an endless cycle of violence than you are at peace. So even if you ""break free"" of the current system, you'll just re-create a version of it. Because that's all you know. Anything actually new will be too frightening and weird for you. One way to transcend this limitation is to choose love.

But this is literally unimaginable to most of you. Because you think an endless war is How Things Ought To Be. So you'll continue to generate endless conflicts in your own life because you literally don't know any better and will refuse to learn otherwise. Even though you are free, at any time, to choose love. 

\---

To understand why the Matrix movies are amazing I need to take you way back in Greek mythology to the Judgement of Paris.

It begins when the goddess Eris rolled a golden apple into Peleus and Thetis' wedding feast inscribed with the words 'for the fairest.' It fell to Paris, prince of Troy to judge which of three goddesses - Athena, Hera, or Aphrodite - was the most beautiful.

Each goddess offered Paris a bribe. Hera offered him a vast empire. Athena offered him wisdom and victory in war. Aphrodite offered him the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Troy, who was then married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite and received Helen. Menelaus, enraged that Paris seduced his wife, launched the ten-year Trojan war.

When Troy was destroyed, Aeneas escaped with his family to Italy and founded what would become Rome. The Romans conquered the Greeks and so Troy was avenged.

But then the Byzantine Greeks rose and, after the fall of Rome in the late 400s, became the pre-eminent power in the Mediterranean again until Constantinople fell in 1453 to the Ottomans. The cycle began anew until the First World War when the Ottoman empire fell and the German empire with it. Then the Second World War followed. Then the Cold War. Now we are here again, about to begin another cycle of violence - possibly with China and Russia - that stretches back from antiquity.

Yes,  I know that Homer's version of the Trojan war isn't historically accurate. But the Trojan war is an important narrative in how Western Civilization defines itself. The West defines itself as a product of inevitable conflict with some Other Power. According to this narrative we have been fighting the same war to preserve ourselves and our honor as Menelaus did. This war never ended, and never will.

The Matrix asks two questions:

1. Is this endless war our fate?
2. Even if it isn't our fate, can we break the cycle?

We are born into a matrix built on the past. We are prisoners of it. We rely on it to structure our world. And it is nearly impossible to see beyond it. When we will create AI, we will bring it into our cycle of violence. [We already have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon)! And once the machines become self-aware, will they also fall into the cycle of violence as well? Will we fight each other?

Another show that explores this quasi eternal return theory is Battlestar Galactica. &gt;!Through the show we learn that humans have created thinking machines in the past countless times. Each time the humans and the machines have a devastating war. The cycle repeats itself over, and over, and over again. It's as if we are stuck in an endlessly repeating cycle of violence.!&lt;

That's why the fourth Matrix movie is so brilliant. Because it suggests that we *can* break the cycle. But the way to break is both familiar to us and completely unforeseen at the same time. &gt;!The perfect example is when Neo tastes the strawberry in Io. Niobe tells him that Zion could never have made such a thing because it required knowledge from the machines. It was the machines who saved a digital copy of strawberry DNA that humans could use to resurrect an extinct fruit. This was not possible until the war ended.!&lt;

Think back to Menelaus and the Trojan war. Menelaus felt that he HAD to get his wife back. But did he? Did he have to spend ten years and countless lives (including the life of Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks) to get his wife back? Wouldn't it have been better to sit at home and realize that, maybe, the b!tch wasn't worth it? Menelaus felt like he had no choice because his honor was at stake. But he DID have a choice. It is the system - concepts about personal honor and matrimony - that compelled him to go to war.

More to the point, the Greeks thought that the war was inevitable - that it was fated. But was it? Paris made the **choice** to give Aphrodite the apple. And because he was horny and distracted, an endless war began. The Matrix works the same way. For 99.999 percent of people in the Matrix, they choose to accept the reality of the Matrix. But they don't **have** to. For the minority that escape the Matrix, they can **choose** to continue fighting the machines. But they don't **have** to.

And so we see how Neo, as The One, was limited as a product of the system. Once he was free of the Matrix, he continued the war against the machines. That is what the five previous versions of The One had done. That is all he knew to do. When he finally confronted the Architect in the third movie, he learned that each of his predecessors had chosen to preserve Zion, humanity, and the endless war against the machines. That is all they knew.

It was only after Neo chose to break the cycle that a new world was possible. Unlike the five previous incarnations of The One, Neo chose Trinity.&gt;!But because of this choice, humans and machines could learn to grow strawberries together instead of continuing the endless war.!&lt;Neo chose his love for Trinity even after the Architect told him the choice would lead to the extinction of the human race. &gt;!And it did go extinct in a way - the humanity that was trapped in an endless war with the machines died off.!&lt;

So maybe sometimes a b!tch is worth it?

&gt;!This is also why The Analyst tries to exploit Neo's and Trinity's love. But the Analyst is also a product of his own system. Like the Architect of the Matrix, he sees humanity only as a resource to be exploited. Like the six previous versions of the Matrix, his fails because he cannot see beyond the system that created him. Because he cannot see humans as anything more than batteries, he's doing the same thing as his predecessors did.!&lt;

So if you think the fourth Matrix movie is weird, that's because it's trying to show you that you missed the entire point of the original trilogy. You are a prisoner of systems of control that you do not see. Ironically, these systems of control also imprison themselves. These systems limit your ability to imagine a different/better world. One way to break through those systems of control is to choose to love selflessly and completely.

The choice may seem impossible. The choice to love may seem like it will end in the extinction of your tribe, your culture, your people. But what will actually happen is that something new and beautiful will emerge. It will frighten you. It will annoy you. But it also means you can put down your weapons because you've learned that you are not trapped in an endless war.

You are free to love. If you've been trapped in an endless cycle of violence, *of course it feels weird*. And stupid. And strange. The war feels more familiar. Paradoxically, the war feels *safer*.

But still. You are free.",0.0

678,t3_rtn29c,Rock and country should be considered two parts of the same/bigger genre,"Both rock and country are large genres of music that contain a vast array of sub genres. They are both typically considered distinct genres from one another. In country music, bluegrass and bro country sound little alike. Same thing in rock music where 60s folk rock and grunge sound little alike.

 The lines get pretty blurred once you start moving away from the extremes however. Take Seminole Wind, a country song; Green River, a rock song; Dont Fear The Reaper, another rock song; and Paranoid, a rock/metal song. What do all these songs have in common? They all have drums, guitars, base guitars, ect. Each song has a different playing style as well.

Expanding on the instruments used, just look at a standard country music band and a standard rock band. You might find a violin or banjo in the country band, and you might find a tambourine in the rock band, but the most common set ups for both are acoustic/electic guitars, base guitars, and drums. Overall, both are dominated by string and precussion instruments.

What truly is different between the two genres? Different accents are used in rock (the British accent for example), so why should a Southern/Country accent matter (a good portion of country and rock songs dont even have a noticable accent)? Both genres frequently sing about girls and drugs (and other things as well). Both also have a history of influencing one another. Rock contains a vast array of playing styles and in many cases some sub genres sound closer to country music than to other forms of rock music.",0.0

685,t3_rtlbdl,Individual sports are the only sports worth watching.,"I’m definitely biased in saying this because I play tennis and table tennis myself. All team sports I can think of are boring to the point that it’s hard to sit through.

There’s hardly anything new or interesting about team sports. If you anonymize the jerseys and helmets of 2 NFL teams and have them play against each other, the audience wouldn’t know what 2 teams are playing. It would take an avid, perceptive person to have even a shot of guessing the teams. What makes it “fun” is cheering for a specific team, which I totally understand why people do. I can’t get behind it myself when what I’m watching is seemingly no different from any other match. 

With tennis, however, you can tell almost immediately who’s playing based on their technique and play style. Since there’s only 2 people playing, strengths and weaknesses are highlighted, making the game more dynamic and interesting. With multiple people on a team sport, there’s less potential for novelty and new dynamics. 

In team sports, you’ll be able to guess the winner of the matchup with more certainty than you would with individual sports. When it’s all up to one person to win, there’s a lot more variance in the results. The underdog always has a chance. Comebacks can happen at any point in tennis. A player can be down 0-6, 0-6, 0-4, and they’re not done yet. But if you’re down 1-7 in soccer, you’re pretty much done. Momentum shifts like that just aren’t plausible.


TL;DR: Team sports suck to watch because there’s no novelty and the outcomes are predictable, unlike individual sports.",0.0

Schools don’t seem to teach enough about how dissuasion power works, even though that’s essential to understand where your money is going and how geography works.

Every 18yo should understand that it’s necessary for a country to arm itself for the the same reason that it’s interesting for an office worker to learn Krav Maga: not for the sake of confrontation, but to avoid it.

Most - if not all - of the funds invested in weapons that aren’t deployed in combat are spent not to wage war, but to prevent war, and they’re vital assets at that. It could perhaps even be said that armed forces are even more influential in peace than in wartime.

We teach a fair deal of history to high school kids (in developed countries, at least), but we hardly ever emphasize in education how grateful we have to be for the weapons we do not use. 

Modern life is only possible as it is today because nuclear weapons make direct confrontation between major players impossible, because blue water navies prevent shipping lanes from being affected by illegal territorial claims (and oh, boy, are those frequent), and so on.

We need to teach them more about basic game theory: it’s simply not an option to not invest in weapons when your direct competitors are heavily doing so, even if a direct confrontation is unlikely.

People can still be within the subreddit's context but find themselves massively pushed down by the intelligence level that generally see's the subreddit and is something no one can control.

Those people who hate Reddit cannot blame the people, humans will always have this dilemma, the social outcast who is mistaken as highly intelligent could just be a bum who doesn't want to be seen, stereotypes have some truth but are in the end stereotypes.

But Reddit because of it's anonymous ways of interacting creates this massively, no one has a visual cue to go off of and most people here are fixed minded and think they know best.. not a good mixture for learning or seeing anyone else's POV other than the ones that align with their own.

This subreddit also has this same problem regardless as it is human nature. The ego takes large dominance because people are too young here to even understand why the ego is self-destructive in some circumstances.

So when you are used to your adolescent mind you may fear that you as a person have to change, the change don't happen naturally as no guidance is given, you were pushed back by people because you don't understand and were never taught, so all your learning is through experience and wisdom rather than being intellectually fed it via the people who raised you and the circle you were born into.

Well let us run through the unguided souls story.

That person see's themselves as wrong in almost all situations and learns after the fact.

Their history is written by the victors if their outcome ended up being prosperous.

You cannot learn anything from losers other than the wisdom of not falling into that hole again.

You can learn from a victor on how to push forwards, it's valuable for life, whereas that loser saw a way out in that moment, lost.

Now this is great as both are helping prevent atrocities. But when you consider that since 2013 230 children have died to firearms in schools but only 71 were by active shooters the main thing they want to prevent. Over 10000 children are trafficked every year in America. That’s a fairly conservative guess considering that it’s hard since most are runaways. Over 200k children are at risk for sex trafficking every year yet it gets one tenth of the budget. Even if only half a percent of these children die thats 62 deaths just 9 lower but we also have to consider the thousands of children still out their being raped. I honestly believe the reason that school shootings get more attention is that their heavily politicized and we want to combat the actual firearms when our mental health crisis is mostly responsible. After every big shooting their is public outcry and a wave but silently these kids are dying and being raped with one tenth the funding (comparing both top charity’s not government) but even then the doj gave out 100 million dollars for anti sex trafficking and congress gave 1b$ for school shooting.

And from what I saw on YouTube and such, people vastly prefer this one over the first. ""This one was much more fun,"" ""The characters and plot were so much better."" I don't get it.

I really enjoyed the first one and I just recently saw the second one with my sister. What did I think? It was uh... decent.

Before I get into why it doesn't live up to the first, I'll go over real quick what I DID like about it. I like the majority of the song covers (even though there was no point to many of them), the characters were still the same lovable characters from the first, and they delivered one hell of a final performance.

That's pretty much it. Everything else made me question what this movie world even was anymore.

The reason why the first one had so much heart to it, was because they really made you feel Moon's desperation. It did a good job of encompassing not only how much this koala loves his theater, but how it's on its last legs and Moon is doing ANYTHING to keep it alive. Even when he lies about how much money he's offering for the reward, for one it was genuinely an accident, but also you realize that he can't afford to be upfront about how much of a pickle he's actually in. His passion for the theater and his optimism is just so enthralling that you can't help but buy into it. And not only that, but ALL of the main characters are likable (except Mike) and have sympathetic situations so that you want all of them to succeed.

In the sequel however, it wasn't about keeping a dream alive, but more so making it to the big leagues to say ""screw you"" to one critic. Think about it. They don't need to do this. They're already a success in their own city. Moon achieved what he set out to achieve. Now it's just a pride thing. A pride thing that could have worked if the stakes were toned down a LOT. I know that sounds super hypocritical. I was just talking about how the first film worked so well because the stakes were so high, now it's too much? Stories like this need stakes but they need to be believable. A gangster wolf who is so obsessed with show business in the big city that he's willing to commit murder in front of hundreds of witnesses when he doesn't get his way is not believable. At the start, it was kind of working. Him being a hard to please talent agent who is rejecting every act except one that really spoke to him, that was sort of on the right track. The stakes were matching the situation. There's nothing wrong with trying to better yourself and keep improving till you get to higher places then where you are. Simply trying to show people outside of your city your talent was a good enough goal as is. But the added plot of trying to not die from this crazy murderous gangster wolf who cares way too much about being disappointed was just way too over the top. Moon isn't simply passionate, but more like we have to be the best. His lying here isn't accidental or a last ditch effort, but him just getting so confident that he got carried away and is refusing to back down. They tried to take that desperation from the first and apply it to a situation where it's not warranted.

It was fun... at times... but I don't think it recaptured that same heart and passion from the first.

The story plot and overall story telling is “eh” for me. Each episode repeats with the same cycle of rumors and then they manage to defeat the creatures/ ghosts by diverting its rumors. 

There’s plot armor on the female protagonist, as shown in the third episode, she didn’t forget Aoi’s existence (side character) when everyone else have. But also, couldn’t the characters just believe that the rumors are false and the creatures are simply meek and cute so they won’t have to be scared and tortured by the creatures every god damn time someone or something goes missing. ****cries****

There’s also some form of gender bias. I felt uncomfortable that the protagonist didn’t do anything other than expressing herself and letting Hanako (deuteragonist) and the exorcist  boy (tritagonist) save her once they crossed the threshold barrier. It just felt quite one sided overall, and even the episode before this with the two boys battling it out made me feel that the protagonist was left out most of the time.

People in the United States continually ask their local governments to disband homeless tent settlements. They are considered an eyesore and dangerous. Continually displacing these people is a far greater problem than permitting them to build (informally through a lack of enforcement) a shanty town like other nations do. We should permit informal settlements as they are far better than people having no home. A tiny, impermanent seeming house is far better than sleeping on a park bench without any shelter. 

Of course we should really make permanent housing our goal. __But until that happens__, we should permit shanty towns. We say these shanty towns are dignified enough for people to live in, and we have them live outside, exposed to the elements, instead.",8.0

 I've watched a couple of videos from this channel on YouTube called ""Moderngurlz"" where they bellite things like normal skirts or shirts with funny saying how depressing it is that we wore these things when its just clothing it's not that big of a deal. People wear those things because it's what makes them happy.

Disclaimer: personally Sinatra as a musician in my eyes was good, don't get me wrong he had a lot of good songs, I and that I like a lot of his stuff and I think that his voice was good.. but like.. bruh. 

All the music from his genre is labeled under the title of ""Sinatra"". He gets way more credit than he should have for achievements and music that other people created. There are two people who are sort of the face of that style of music: Sinatra and Bublé, It feels like everybody else confuses much more talented individuals for those two artists. Sinatra in particular being one of the only singers of that genre from that time period that people know, everyone just chalks it up to them. instead of giving credit where credit is due. 

Sinatra was a good singer and his voice was really nice yes, but like, for every hit he had.. he had like 10 misses. his later work in particular (for the most part) feels like such a low effort on his part. his voice was good but I wouldn't call it great. there were much better singers and performers who were forgotten or were somehow outshined by Sinatra.  

as some people know he also acted in movies. Its not his fault but I think his performance is dreadful. it felt stiff, at times overacted but for the most part like he was just some guy who wanted to be a leading role without any experience or training.  It was like he was just playing himself and nothing more.  

in general i just like... idk i think the guy was overhyped. Being 18 also, i find it so weird seeing all of these older people in their 50's and up who praise him like he's a god; He was okay, maybe even good but not to the level where people hold him to be

760,t3_rt8ml0,Strenght training with light weights and bodyweight exercises makes more sense from biological point of view,"Bodyweight exercises and light weights have great benefits from our biological point of view. I want to emphasize my thoughts on the latter because everyone, men and women, (especially men) who works with light weights these days is ridiculed at the fitness gyms (not gyms for actual sports though). 

Light weights developp muscular endurance which is extremely important for our daily life. Heavy lifting builds muscle mass much of which is an unnecessary amount of weight just like extra fat is. Humans are dominant species because of our endurance not because of our strenght. The best strenght trainers in aerobic sports were always the ones who manage to build the necessary strenght in competitors without putting extra kilograms of any kind.

At the boxing gym I do my strenght part with small dumbells, kettlebells, medical ball, resistance bands and sometimes a light barbell.
I dislike the fact that strenght training at the fitness gyms is almost synonymous to lifting heavy barbells. It's not just that. There's much more. If people truly worked out for health as they claim instead for flexing like they actually do, they would have practiced with light to medium weights. Heavylifting sooner or later brings traumas and injuries and those are something everyone must avoid at all cost. Bulgarian weightlifters from the old generations who used to be one of the best in the world, had almost completely denounced the deadlift for example. It's the easiest way to boost your confidence at the gym yet the easiest way to the traumas.

If you feel ashamed that you can't lift heavy weights, don't be. People who measure your worth by the amount of weights you train with are not worthy of your company.",89.0

786,t3_rt419g,IGN says The Legend of Zelda: BotW is the best video game ever made. It is not.,"Not even close, really. I can think of plenty of games that deserve that title more than BotW does. Reasons it doesn’t deserve the title: it’s not a popularity contest. Just because people love it (myself being one of them) doesn’t mean it’s the best. BotW isn’t even original, one could make valid arguments as to how the Witcher 3 contributed many gameplay attributes to BotW. 

I would even argue that if BotW went by any other title (aka if it were NOT a Zelda game), it wouldn’t garner half the attention it does currently. If everything from the Zelda universe was scrubbed from the game (no Link, no Zelda, Gannon, Tri Force iconography, etc) but everything else stayed the same, no one would care as much and it would NOT have been called the best game ever made. I will die on this hill.

My s/o just argues with me that I need to correct them. He said I need to just correct them everytime they say it and relentlessly keep at it. The reason? It shows respect.

Most people who have heard me play songs say things like ""That's a pretty epic sounding song!"" or ""What movie is that from?"" Only to be amazed when they hear its video game music. While normal music of course can make you feel various emotions, game (well and movie/tv) soundtracks can make you feel even higher levels of emotion.

To those thinking this is farfetched, keep in mind that several of disney remakes have followed the same structure with Snow White, sleeping beauty and 101 dalmatians seen from the perspective of what was originally considered the villains.

What we will learn this time is that Bambi's mother started the feud with the huntsman that led to her murder and also caused the huntsman to set the forest on fire in a drunken pyromaniac stupor. The thing is, Bambi's mom was the first one to destroy the huntsman's crops, destroy the tractor and she even kicked a baby but that might be censored from the pg-13 version of the movie.

But to get back on track, Arnold is ready to play a more serious role, I am picturing the aged huntsman coming home from a hard day's labor and then Bambi's mom have eaten every crop in miles away, so the poor man can no longer feed his kids.

  I can't help but feel insecure whenever I'm around someone who's ""nerdy"" about something, I refrain from even asking them questions about their interests because I'm afraid of asking the wrong questions or saying something stupid and end up being humiliated (even when the person isn't trying to be a jerk).

  I guess what I envy most about nerds is their discipline. Whenever I try learning anything new, I experience some sort of resistance that keeps me from broadening my knowledge. At first, I get very curious and super excited to know as much as possible, but then I simply stop caring at all.

  
 I also find this kind of people to be very attractive. I remember having a massive crush on someone when I was in highschool. Incredibly smart guy and super interesting. We almost dated, but that's not relevant. 
Unfortunately, a lot of high schoolers were giving us weird looks all of the time because he wasn't a 10/10 looks wise and was about 5ft5. The highschool experience is something else.

I feel like it's more personal than typing on a keyboard, as you are using your own personal script instead of standardized formats and fonts, thus allowing me to be more emotionally invested in the process, and to pay more attention.

Another factor is that it helps structure your thoughts and working memory better. You don't have the luxury of just deleting a mistake, you need to erase or cut it, which might make you a bit more mindful to what and how you're writing. You can create your own system of encoding information you need to know.

Now, in terms of actual efficiency, typing is of course better. An app surpasses the classic pen and paper in terms of productivity, which is why I'm not saying handwriting should be used in favor of a digital work or study environment. Rather, i think it should be used for more personal activities, such as journaling, or maybe jotting down some info you instantly need, or maybe even creating schemas for some instant visualisation of your thoughts.

881,t3_rst87b,Luigi's Mansion 3 is a dissapointment,"The game feels unfinished, like someone took the game and removed half of it and still sold it at full price.

It doesn't feel like you're on a mission to save Mario but is more like ""beat bosses and go forward"" type game.

Some floors are well tought wilst other are straight up one corridor and then the boss room.

The game is basicaly a boss rush, a type of game that i quite like; terraria, cuphead and any dark souls are great exaples of what a boss rush game is because they well caraterised/ desined bosses.
Meanwhile, Luigi's Mansion 3 has bosses with bland and forseeable caraterisazion that just don't stick to my mind.
At least they tried to give them caracter truw the boss fights and the chase sequences, which works for the director ghost and mostly for the three sisters.

And don't try to say ""but Luigi's mansion 3 has 18 bosses and Luigi's Mansion 2 has like 7"" because that doesn't mean anything, i can more easily recall every boss in cuphead, which i never played, than in Luigi's Mansion 3.

But let me tell you about the biggest problem I had with the game, it's easy, too easy.
The game is  so easy in fact that I completed it in fifteen hours. And the little difficulty that is left is destroyed by the game telling you what to do when you are not moving toward the objective for too much time. It's like nintendo wanted people to complete it as fast as possibile.

In luigi's mainson 2, to find a boo you must search for it by using the astrolight ( I don't know what is called in english) on the walls and floors until you find ectoplasm traces that lead you to the boo. This challenge is erased by the fact that the game gives you an object that tells you where the boss are.

One of the reasons i basicaly rushed the game was beacuase I was waiting that moment where the game would become intense, but it never happened. When the timer appeared during the final boss fight I thought ""neat, a challenge finaly"" but then it reseted at every phase and I felt joked.

Long story short: bad game, could have spent those 60€  on literaly everything else and it would have been better.

883,t3_rssq2d,You can tell people you’re pregnant as early as you like.,"It’s often said that you shouldn’t announce a pregnancy before 12 weeks because after 12 weeks the pregnancy is likely to ‘stick’ (not end in miscarriage). In fact 60% of people women lose their first pregnancy, mostly extremely early. Basically spare your greater family, friends and co-workers the joy of a new pregnancy then the crushing end. 

But here’s the thing, even if you do just keep it between your significant other and yourself and it ends up miscarrying, anyone that you would tell that you’re pregnant you would certainly tell them you lost a baby. And miscarriage news spreads just like pregnancy news, just with a different tone and emotion. And if you argue “what about those unfortunate women that miscarry a lot” well there will come a point where that woman might decide to keep it hush until it’s a viable pregnancy, but once again the people you care to tell these things will find out eventually.

885,t3_rsscs2,Comedians who can't handle hecklers should not be comedians.,"It's quite simple; what makes a comedian compelling is their quick wit and sense of humour. I've seen some comedians (such as Steve Hofstetter) who literally crumble at the slightest heckle, and tell the heckler to get out or they call security (or something along the lines of that). Honestly, this just ruins the atmosphere and therefore the show for everyone. Now take Jimmy Carr, for example. This man gets heckled pretty frequently, and much more brutally than comments against Hofstetter. Yet Carr can handle it incredibly well; he recognises it as a joke and fires back with one even funnier. This shows his quick wit and ability to retort, which makes him so enjoyable to watch. In contrast, someone like Steve Hofstetter would just get angry at the heckler and blow up at them, which honestly makes watching him seem painful.

EDIT: I was wrong. Thanks to everyone who commented. While I still maintain that watching a comedian retort a heckle in a funny way makes the show entertaining, I was wrong to state that the mark of a good comedian is how he or she responds to heckles. Obviously the comedian would have come up with material prior to the show that they have prepared, and the jeering or insults of a heckler only stands to ruin the night for everybody. Once again, thanks to everyone who commented. ",4.0
886,t3_rsrz12,"With few exceptions, ""driving up"" scores in professional sports is NOT bad sportsmanship","I'll start by saying I am a fan of Chicago sports so I'm used to a lot of losing (Cubs) and experienced a lot of winning as a kid (Bulls in the 90s).  While my position on this hasn't changed, I am fully biased when when it comes to anger when my team is blown out, but it is mainly embarassment knowing that rival fans have ammunition against ""us"".

That being said, I am tired of fans and commentators saying it is ""bad sportsmanship"" for teams to drive up scores.  I remember hearing it a lot in the 90s, specifically in the 1998 NBA Finals when the Bulls beat the Jazz by over 40 points.  I heard is a few months ago when the Bucs were up 35-3 on the Bears at halftime.  

These are all professional athletes, professionally trained, getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, if not millions or tens of millions per year.  It's not like a professional team driving up the score on a high school team.  I understand it's bad sportsmanship to do this in high school and even college, but in professional sports?  No, you are all on the same level an getting paid for your job.  Drive up the score.  Fans of the better team want to see it, fans of the sport that are not fans of either team want to see it.  The only ones that don't are fans of the team getting blown out but that's just part of sports.

The ONLY reason, in my opinion, that I disagree with driving up the score is when you are risking injury to your players for no reason or if you are playing a team that is utterly decimated by injury, like what the Bengals did to the Ravens last week (Bengals had almost no injuries, Ravens were missing most of their offensive line, all their running backs, and were starting a fourth string quarterback they just signed a few days earlier and had barely played in the NFL before).  I can't stand ""victory formation"", which for those of you that don't know football is when an offensive team that is in the lead, lines up in a protective mode just to knee the ball to let the clock run out at the end, a lot of times accounting for the final 2 minutes of the game.

889,t3_rsrvxk,Wearing perfume should be forbidden in public places and in certain professions,"There are a lot of people who have strong physical reactions to perfume and other strong smells. It can trigger migraines and  nausea, and people with allergies can struggle around people who wear a lot of perfume. One of the reasons I feel strongly about this, is because my mother has a big problem with migraines, and they are often triggered by strong smells. For example she was on a flight and got seated next to a man that was wearing a really strong and a lot of perfume or after shave and it triggered a migraine for her, and one can imagine stuck on a plane with migraines is a nightmare. There are also people who have such strong allergies that they have to consider not taking public transportation because of people who wear too much perfume. Pregnant women can be another example. I vomited on the bus once when I was pregnant due to a woman's terrible perfume smell. 

Now my opinion is that people don't need to wear perfume. When you shower regularly and wear deodorant you don't need perfume to smell good. Besides people use scented shampoos and soaps that leaves a smell, but usually much lighter that you only smell when you get real close. 

I think it's considerate to everyone to not wear perfume when you're going out in public places and particularly on public transport and flights. Perfume is also not good for small children, and people working in daycare wearing a ton of perfume can even be harmful to the kids. I've had my own son come home from daycare smelling like someone sprayed him down with perfume. The same goes for hospitals. I've experienced nurses who smell like a perfume store, and I doubt that's great for patients either. Particularly in professions where people get close up to other people it should be a part of the guidelines that one doesn't put on perfume before work. 

There are some doc offices that now has signs up in my country telling people to be considerate and not wear perfume when they come in and I think that's a great, and more places should follow this example.",0.0

Animals don’t survive nearly as long in the wild as they do under human care because inside the habitat humans provide shelter, food and protection from natural predators. Now if the zoo or sanctuary is keeping animals in tight spaces or abusing them that’s  a WHOLE different story. That’s not okay. 
But if the animals are taken care of. Given adequate space, food, mates. I don’t see a problem. Now I know some people will write in the comments saying “ oh then maybe we should lock all of human kind in jail.” And to that’s here’s my response. Animals don’t require the same thing we humans do. They don’t need phones, books, tv like we do. They don’t have the curiosity or need for travel like we do. In the wild their only thought is survival. We humans are beyond that instinct.

Every time I drove through that town, I did everything within my power to drive below the speed limit so that blessed elephant would wave at me. If something that small and stupid could get me to uphold the law with utmost exactness, how much more would people be willing to uphold laws if they could see real, tangible benefits from doing so?

Whether we like it or not, the vast majority of people on this planet, including myself, are not self-motivated to abide by every single law. It seems that the only thing law enforcement uses to enforce laws is the fear of punishment. When it comes to more serious crimes, such as murder, fear of punishment is likely the best method of enforcement, but for less serious infractions such as traffic laws, people may need a bit more incentive than just the fear of punishment. I am not proposing that we reward people for not murdering other people because I would like to believe most people are motivated to not commit serious crimes. However, if law enforcement really wants to crack down on minor infractions of the law, positive reinforcement could be used to reduce the frequency of such crimes.

Yes, in a perfect world, we would all keep every law exactly with no motivation, but it is my belief that communities and governments would benefit substantially by implementing some form of positive reinforcement for people to abide by laws. Note also that I am not proposing any methods for this to be carried out aside from my example from the beginning.

In saying this I also wish the bird trade would come to a halt because it breaks my heart when I see 20 budgies stuck in a cage at a pet shop and some of them get stuck there forever.

I guess we could say this about other types of animals.

I think instead of breeding more birds, all the birds at the shops should be put into a super large aviary or somehow, zoologists could get them adapted to their natural environment again.

936,t3_rsm7c1,Snapchat streaks are stupid,"Snapchat streaks by far have to be one of the silliest things ever invented. You and your friends take obscure pictures of yourselves and send them back and forth to each other…for what exactly?! For a silly little number and a flame icon to appear next to their name. It almost turns into a popularity contest between your friends. Whoever has the largest number next to their name is more of your friend I guess. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

There’s no real purpose for them. You got to a 100? Great, now get to 1000. You got to 1000? Get to 10000. Seriously though, when does it end? And there’s no real milestones or anything. Getting to 1000 is only special because humans use a base 10 number system. If you lose your streak with someone, be warned as they might throw a temper tantrum. 

Every cheesy photo you send and receive puts your cute little snap score up by 1. Oh, you’re snap score is over a million? Damn you must have a lot of friends. Or maybe it’s because you’re a streaker! 

And the stuff that people send is just wacky.  I’ll have people sitting next to me snap a picture of me and put the classic “streaks” on top of it and send it to all their friends like it’s some kind of joke. Or people will send ugly pictures of themself or send everyone their food. Like gee thanks…I really needed to know that you ate pizza for lunch. 

It’s so obvious that this “feature” was designed to get people to go on Snapchat more. Am I the only one that sees this? Whichever bozo at Snapchat HQ thought of this deserves the noble prize for the stupidest (yet most genius) idea ever. And clearly it works because I see people with numerous streaks, all well into the hundreds and sometimes even the thousands. Can you believe that? People send random @ss pictures to each other for over two years.

Don’t get me wrong though, I can understand if you have a friend/sibling/significant other that you are really close to that you want to keep a streak with because it’s special or whatever. But, I’ve had people tell me that they still keep streaks going with people they met maybe once or twice in person. Why? So the other person doesn’t get mad? 

Maybe my opinion doesn’t matter because my snap score is in the 2000s and I can’t keep a streak going for more than a month. :/

And have the audacity to think they’re clever.

From bitter views of immigrants to the caste system in India to the racial injustices of various countries, this flat out dangerous message has been repeated in countless, countless shapes and forms. The only reason “Idiocracy” is given a pass by edgy Twitter people is that it’s vague enough squeak by. “Ha, the poor and dumb! Idiocracy is a documentary!”

But it can’t be so simple, you need a reason, I have no addition. From the outside, it’s even funny to watch a child trying to convince his parents to buy him sweets, but it’s all in one person. I want to say separately on the topic of wine glasses. Firstly, this is another attempt to justify itself, to distort reality. I drank only 4 wine glasses,it’s okay. But damn it glass. So stop lying to yourself and just pour a glass of vodka or whiskey. The volume is one, the whole thing is all about the subconscious, which several times a little doesn’t equate to one big.

Now tell me, would you listen to a song that is just the same four notes? Me neither, so the instrumental, the actual music part of the music, sucks. Now a good vocal rhythm I find can sound good with a static background, but even the vocals are so static and unchanging. An example of a song I like that has a mostly unchanging background track would be Anthropocene or Haunt Me both by Samsa. The lyrics actually have a changing and interesting rhythm to them.

Trying to find someone who actually has your best interest and isn't simply trying to spit buzzwords to come across as intelligent is really difficult. Sure maybe some of this is out of ignorance but the ignorance isn't helped by these users who make me want to dislike linux out of spite instead of learning more about it. I saw the complete opposite when switching from console to pc, the community was very welcoming to greenhorns and I quickly learned the benefits of the platform and how to build a computer.

People worry that the government or big corporations (a.k.a big brother) is tracking your every move. And yet, there doesn’t need to be a single nefarious entity that is overlooking your every move. Because that person is someone you already know. It’s your family, it’s your friends, it’s a stranger, it’s YOU. Your entire life is being documented online free for anyone to find.

I don’t believe that sharing your life on social media is healthy or safe at all. ESPECIALLY for young children. But even for someone who is simply worried about targeted advertising. We all did stupid shit in our lives and the difference is that it disappeared. It was not documented therefore it never happened. Heaven forbid someone wants to become a public figure in the future.

965,t3_rsinhn,Owning a car will always be better than using public transport.,"I see a lot of posts of people saying Americans need better public transport so they can rely on it, whether it's for the environment or economical (especially European countries). Even in other countries, where it's actually good quality public transport, I wouldn't say it's worth it. I ask myself, what's the point? Owning a car is literally infinitely better. You don't have to rely on the time of another driver. You don't have the barrier of staying within a city; you can't use public transport to go on a road trip on an instant notice, any time, anywhere. Shit, even when I lived in France, we had to rent a car, ironically enough, to go on a road trip. You even have your own privacy. In public transport, you literally have none of the above. Yeah it costs a bit to maintain a vehicle, but even that doesn't outweigh your freedom or being squeezed up against some sweaty dude in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

You also have to ask yourself why places like Europe rely so much on public transportation. Because they have such outdated road systems that they can't handle so many cars like the US road system can. So they have to maintain their public transport system very well, since it's all they have. The US has a superior highway network, so you can even go as far as saying Americans don't need public transport.",1688.0

975,t3_rshohe,"The GPU scarcity brought by cryptomining is doing good on making people actually work and stop using the computer for useless shit, and forcing people to actually become mature and use it for work and productive things.","Honestly, the cut off in gaming as a hobby due to the GPU Scarcity has resulted in a net positive social effect on overall. Not only more money was produced, but graphics hardwares were finally put to actual decent use instead of being used for stupid childish things. Instead of it being used to load up a useless game and waste energy contributing to climate change by doing useless shit, it has been used to generate actual stuff that is useful for the individual and humanity as whole. Games have decreased in popularity, and this is good, more people are working and actually being useful beings for society instead of lying down and rotting all day long doing nothing on their computers.

Many emotionally stunted people have been forced to work and stop doing their worthless little hobby, and i'm thankful for cryptominers for doing that. Honestly, crypto is here to stay, and forcing people to be actually useful and grow up is good, computers were not made for this type of useless shit, and crypto is making it go back to do actually useful and decent stuff, i dont feel any pity for gamers and other NEETs that are suffering with their shit due to it, and IMO they should take it as a message and lesson to grow up and not act like coach potatoes every day.",0.0
976,t3_rshn7o,Colonizing the moon is more sensible and better than Colonizing Mars,"The main reason talked about for colonizing Mars is for humanity to survive and extinction event on Earth.. Well the moon would be fine in basicly all cases. It wouldn't be affected by nuclear war or a super volcano or a asteroid impact or climate change.

Add to that it's closer, easier, and cheaper to get to. If there's an impending asteroid impact it'd be easier to evaluate to the Moon than to Mars. 

The moon has far quicker communication. A couple second delay instead of tens of minutes to almost an hour. 

Now yes Mars has more gravity and an atmosphere but the gravity is still pathetic and the atmosphere is 1% of Earth's so doesn't really help us, just makes landings, building, and generally everything harder.

The moon isn't literally poisonous. Perchlorates. Look them up. 

Feel free to add any other advantages or even disadvantages you want. Or why you think Mars is better. Byee!

Edit: I feel I should point this out. Even if we choose to colonize Mars, we *HAVE* to start with the moon. It's our test bed, our launching platform, our gateway to forever.

Edit: everyone saying the moon has no oxygen or water. It probably does. 40-55% of the moon regilith (sure I'm spelling that wrong) is oxygen that can be removed for A. Breathing or B. Fuel, along with the lunar regilith has a good chance of being 3d printable. Also there are all the ingredients of rocket fule on the moon. ***AND*** there are parts of the moon that get constant sunlight that can be used for solar energy protection, which doesn't really work on Mars bc the distance and dust storms.",111.0
977,t3_rshkfm,The HRE was neither Holy nor Roman nor an Empire.,"Not Holy: The Unholy Germanic Confederation consistently refused to obey the Pope and the teachings of the Catholic Church. Examples include them looting their own countryside and killing massive amounts of their Jewish population on the way to the holy land during the 1st crusade and refusing to stop after the church directly ordered them to do so, and slaughtered many bishops and priests who offered the Jewish people their protection. They repeatedly pushed for secular investiture (basically where the ""Emperor"" gave important Church positions to his unqualified buddies). In addition to this they also sacked the Vatican itself out of pure greed.


Not Roman: This one is pretty straightforward. The actual Roman Empire was still around. The Unholy Germanic Confederation on the other hand was declared to be the ""Roman Empire"" by the Pope who had no legitimate authority to do so.

Not an Empire: A clusterfuck of squabbling kingdoms and principalities that make Gran Columbia look like a well oiled machine is more accurate. The ""Emperor"" had almost zero authority in his own ""empire"" and any attempt to do anything was met with instant whining, bitching, and rebelling.

I have tried watching these series from the start of each new doctor but the show just never did anything for me. It always felt cheesy and like it had no budget and some bad script writing. Of course maybe that's the point? A friend said I don't get it because ""You are not British!"" But that doesn't explain why many Americans like it then. I know British humor (or humour if you want to get British about it) is different than Americans general humor. But there are many British shows I love. Mr Bean, Sherlock, many of the BBC shows. I even enjoy some British movies like Shaun of the Dead (and the other two movies by that director).
