Without the ability to be based, there will be nothing of value separating us from each other, in a twisted imitation of communism that even AuthLeft will despise. Basedness is the commodity that our community is built on, and without it, all reason and hope will be lost. I suspect that this may be an unprecedented attack by the unflaired to destabilize our economy and create total anarchy among what we've worked so hard to build.
