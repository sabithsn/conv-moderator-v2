0,t3_rw0ep3,CMV: The bride and groom should have just as much rights to their wedding photos as the photographer who they pay to take them,"I have a lot of respect for the photography industry, and I understand that legally due to copyright law a photographer owns the rights to any photos they take. 

I think where it gets blurry and should be up for debate, is when that photo is taken of another person. 

For example, wedding photography. 

The bride and groom pay a photographer thousands of dollars to photograph their big day. They pay the photographer handsomely for their photos, not only because of the work that goes into the shoot and editing, but also because of all the work the photographer has done to that point to be that skillful. Which should be commended. 

The issue is that right now it appears to be a lopsided transaction between the married couple and the photographer. Here is the current transaction:

&amp;#x200B;

Bride and groom:

1. The bride and groom pay thousands of dollars
2. The bride and groom sign away unlimited rights to their likeness in the photos so the photographer can do what they want with the photos, commercially or private. 
3. The bride and groom receive limited rights to the photos they paid a photographer to create, all personal use only. 

Photographer:

1. The photographer gets paid thousands of dollars
2. The photographer does their work, plans photos, takes photos, edits, and delivers.
3. The photographer gets unlimited rights to the bride and grooms likeness in the photos. 
4. The photographer gets unlimited rights to the photos they were paid to create.

To me this seems lopsided in favor of the photographer. You have the bride and groom giving 2 things (payment and unlimited-rights to their likeliness in the photos), and receiving 1 thing although not in full (limited rights). You have the photographer giving 1 thing (the work paid for), and receiving 3 things (payment, unlimited and exclusive rights to the photos, unlimited rights to the bride and grooms likeness in the photos). 

&amp;#x200B;

To me, the solution to this unbalanced equation is as follows. 

Proposed solution: Equal rights to the likeness in the photos and the photos themselves. If the photographer wants unlimited rights to the bride and grooms likeness in the photos, then the bride and groom get unlimited rights to the photos, and vice versa.",4.0
1,t3_rvzmqi,CMV: The COVID Vaccination is unsafe and ineffective!,"The vaccination has failed to protect people from COVID we see many vaccinated individuals getting COVID still! The vaccine has caused many deaths, heart related problems, illnesses, etc.

We’re seeing this is major sports leagues such as the Premier League, NBA, NFL, etc. Many of these leagues/teams are mandating players to be vaccinated. Players who are vaccinated are still testing positive for COVID. Not only that but in the sport soccer/football/futbol heart attacks/collapsing has risen by 900% this year! This isn’t normal at all. Players are collapsing left and right from heart related problems after receiving the vaccination. We’ve seen players like Christian Eriksen or Sergio Aguero who are forced to retire. Keep in mind these athletes are incredibly fit and the only thing to blame is the vaccination itself. I see countless articles each and everyday on twitter of a player collapsing. From professional sports leagues to K-12 sports. It’s disgusting! Politicians and health officials need to stop touting for citizens to get vaccinated! These vaccines are unsafe and ineffective! It’s causing many problems! 

I’m not anti vac but this is ridiculous! Many people are being manipulated to getting the vaccination to stop the COVID. It’s not working and our president Joe Biden and many other world officials keep saying get vaccinated! People need to be informed of the consequences of the effects of the COVID vaccination. You’re more likely to get omnicron, you’re more likely to suffer heart related problems, you’re more likely to get ill from other forms of illnesses because the vaccination damages your immunity. There’s more negatives than positives to getting the COVID vaccination. So please people please be careful do your research stop listening to the mainstream media. It’s evidently in front of us we’re seeing the effects of the vaccinated in professional sports leagues!",0.0
2,t3_rvz3e9,CMV: Buying Organic food is a waste of money and does not help the environment.,"So, I actually DO think that the factory farming model has lots of problems, and I appreciate the ideas behind the organic movement. My problem is that the continued existence of non-organically produced food effectively makes buying organic a personal choice instead of a societal imperative. And since organic food costs more to produce, only a small fraction of people will make that choice.

So you end up with big companies, that certainly rely on huge farms with crappy agricultural practices,  deciding to produce juuuust enough organic food to capture a few extra bucks from a high-end market segment. And then they keep producing the majority of their food in the cheapest way possible, with all that entails.

Ideally, there would only be one standard for agriculture, regulated by the government and backed by ecological science. But having a market segment for organics is just a way for big companies to take extra money from well-meaning, guilt-ridden consumers.",4.0
3,t3_rvycht,cmv:Free Will is an Illusion,"I have over the the years slowly convinced myself there is no such thing as free will as most people imagine there to be. 

You, yes You, the one reading the post - are not what makes the decisions that govern your day-to-day doings, be them important, trivial or involved. 

We can, with concentration observe the flow or stream of our consciousness moment to moment. Yet as one watches the flow of water in a river- we are not the ones who decide the direction of this current. We watch it go by. We may see the direction and make predictions about what may occur next- given what we observe. Though we are not in the drivers seat in any meaningful way. In the way possessing 'Free will' supposes. 

I think free will is an adaptive model to interpret our own behaviour, and the behaviour of others. It's comfy and is intuitive. Yet, as with many things- the closer to the 'truth' ones approaches, the expectation is that the matter reveals itself to be less than intuitive. 

You can't force yourself to like something you don't. You don't even choose if you like something or not. You eat something you've never eaten before- You don't use free will to determine whether you'lll enjoy that item of food. You'll use your sense of taste/smell and a myriad of other factors that determines whether you'll like the food or not. 

This penultimate paragraph will try distill what I think the illusion of free will is. You are watching a monitor.  You see the protagonist (You) on the screen. You have a game controller and as you make inputs into this controller, you see the image of you respond/react as you make inputs. The reality is (as I see it)- you're watching a movie. The illusion is that you're playing a video game. Even if you were to put the controller down. Your heart beats, your cells divide, your organs are still in play- it wouldn't be called the Illusion of free will if it wasn't a brilliantly \_convincing\_ \*Illusion\*.   

There are an inexhaustible number of examples one could go through- the ones I've thought of myself, and heard from friends/colleagues are but the upmost tip of the iceberg. So perhaps someone here can cmv and convince me free will is \*not\* an illusion?",0.0

5,t3_rvx33d,CMV: I feel actors shouldn't get paid the amount they're getting paid these days.,"I understand. Acting can be tough. You need the right mindset and skills for it. But is it worth getting paid millions for a single movie? I mean really? Why? 

I know only the most famous ones get paid a lot but in general this line of work does pay a lot. I just don't see the point. I feel like people who contribute to the society are the ones that need to get paid more. Explain to me why, a doctor or a nurse that tends to patients multiple hrs a day, gets paid grossly less than an actor who just has to memorize a couple of lines and...act? Like what warrants the actor to get paid that much? Oh sure he/she looks good doing stunts and is hot/sexy but is this enough? It most certainly is not. 

I feel this way based on the following points.
1. Many get corrupted by the money and end up doing dumb shit anyway. Drugs, divorces, murders what not.
2. Majority don't even do their own stunts. I respect some that do, like Jackie Chan and Tom cruise, but guys like Dwayne Johnson are just a joke. Don't get me wrong I love the dude but he can't act!
3. I feel they don't contribute to anything much. Well Maybe apart from donations to charities which honestly any rich person can do.
4. A lot of movies these days are heavily cgi so there's not a lot of acting going on anyway.

So why pay them so much?",0.0
6,t3_rvx10m,CMV: The perspective of “stop trying to fix my problems” is unjustifiable,"It’s an issue that has confused me for a while - I have read many guides around it but all of them treat the validity of the ‘stop trying to fix my problems’ view as inherent, without ever explaining why.

There is a common stereotype of where one person voices a problem, the other attempts to come up with solutions to mitigate it, and the first person objects, saying things like “I don’t want you to solve my problem” and “I just want you to listen”. If I’m completely honest, I fail to see how this is a view that is particularly worthy of much respect. 

At best, the simple affirmation of their beliefs is likely to be a short term stopgap - without addressing it, the long term problem that is causing the issue will remain. At worst, it constitutes a lie - if you want affirmation, it’s presumably because you want the other person to actually agree with you because your point is correct, not just to placate you, as that just avoids addressing the issue and doesn’t help anyone. Furthermore, the refusal to search for or listen to a solution for me seems to be unjustifiable. If you have a problem and refuse to at least attempt to do something about it, that represents a total abdication of responsibility and you are essentially pointlessly wallowing in your despair. The attempt to fix it doesn’t have to be much - simply allowing the other person to try to help is all it takes - but if you refuse to do even that, I don’t see why you should expect much sympathy.

Now I understand that some affirmation of the other person’s feelings is necessary - they will probably need to feel listened to in order to properly engage. However, this should just be relatively quick and concise - there are only so many ways to constructively say “that’s really horrible” or “I understand why you would feel that way”. In a lot of cases, it shouldn’t even need to be said at all - if it’s someone you are willing to share this sort of information with (particularly if it’s a spouse or close friend), their sympathy can presumably be taken as read.

If the first person already has a solution and they are simply needing to wait for it to be implemented, then obviously a solution isn’t needed; however if this is the case then they can say so when explaining the initial problem. It is also entirely possible that the solutions proposed will be unsuitable - again though, there is no reason why this cannot be explained. It may be that them trying to help could cause more problems then it fixes - however the issue there would be them wading in without your consent to use the solution, not proposing the solution itself. Finally, I concede there are some situations where it is impossible for all issues to be resolved, although you would want to consult many viewpoints in order to come to that conclusion. In all of the above cases though, even if the core problem cannot be prevented, there will still likely be ways to mitigate the distress it causes - it is extremely unlikely that everyone is doing everything perfectly. Even if that is the case though, the very fact that is happening would presumably be a good thing to point out in order to alleviate distress.",0.0
7,t3_rvv1wp,"CMV: In order to live in a true multicultural society, we should add non-Christian holidays (Eid, Diwali, Rosh Hashanah) to the national government holiday calendar, and Christmas should still be ""Christmas"" not ""the holidays"" in some faux attempt at diversity","Right now in the U.S. it's common to refer to all things Christmas as ""the holidays"" instead, as if to account for the fact that a Christian holiday is privileged in the U.S. above other religions' holidays. No other national holiday is called simply ""Holiday"" as a euphemism to account for some intangible feeling of unfairness.

But that's not the proper way to go about it... Christmas should remain as Christmas and no one should feel bad about having ""Christmas parties"" instead of ""Holiday parties"", or ""Christmas cheer"" instead of ""Holiday cheer"", or saying ""Merry Christmas"". Then, **other non-christian cultural and religious holidays** should be added to the national holiday calendar, to instate actual diversity to our societal observations. Other countries around the world already do this, where a multitude of holidays are observed from a variety of religions and cultures, and yet the U.S. claims to be a bastion of diversity and multiculturalism?

For example, Eid-al-Adha is considered the big festival in Islam, while Diwali is big in India and Rosh Hashanah is big in Israel. Yet none of these holidays have any cultural, federal, or state weight in U.S. culture and government society. If we add them, not only do we ALL get more time off, but we learn about other cultures at the same time, and we avoid needing to ""cheapen"" Christmas into some generic festival for a fake appearance of being diverse.",142.0
8,t3_rvu4vl,"CMV: Pets should never be given as surprise gifts, and furthermore, posting videos of this event, glamorizing them, and fawning over them does considerable harm to animals.","The Christmas season has brought a lot of videos on reddit and many other platforms of pets being given as gifts to people. On the surface, these are very sweet videos, often of some ~~attractive~~ person receiving the gift and crying tears of joy and being filled with what we assume will be many years of happiness with this cute little furball.

Unfortunately, the reality is, [that is often not how this situation actually plays out.](https://vet24.com.au/5-reasons-you-shouldnt-give-a-pet-as-a-gift/) This article isn't from some rando on the internet, it is from a professional veterinarian, the type of person who is more qualified than 99.9999% of the planet to know what is best for animals, and they are telling you not to gift animals. You can also [read this](https://www.peta.org/blog/shelters-full-unwanted-present-animals-after-holidays/) for more statistics about how many pets are thrown into shelters right after the holidays (hint: it's a lot). 

Nevertheless, when I see anyone react to any such video with ""do not give pets as gifts"" or even ""good for them, I'm sure they will be good pet parents, but in general, this is still a bad idea"", their posts are met with considerable vitriol and hostility. So I must really be missing something and this must be some very uncommon and unpopular view, which, again, aligns exactly with what professional veterinarians think, to agree with these people who are getting downvoted to oblivion just for saying that gifting pets is bad!

When people fawn all over these videos and praise them and say ""awww, that's so sweet!"", they are building up and supporting a culture that approves of giving gifts as pets. I have no doubt that people get the idea in their head when they see these videos that gifting a pet is a great idea. That idea is further strengthened when they see all the comments saying ""aww, what a wonderful gift!!11!!"" This all encourages and likely increases the gift-giving of animals, and that's a huge problem. 

Do you think I'm a killjoy, that I want both the pet and the potential owner to remain miserable forever? If it surprises you just now to learn that I actually love and care very deeply about animals (which is literally exactly why I not only hold this view but am making the effort to write all of this also), then you may need to reflect on how the general attitudes of animal gift-giving have warped your perspective. I hold this view because I want what is best for EVERYONE involved in animal gift-giving, and that includes the animals themselves. And it turns out that animal gift-giving is just not good for the animal. 

A final note: please note that I am specifically referring to SURPRISE gifts, so if you know of situations where the recipient knew that the gift was coming, that doesn't apply here. But even if the recipient has SOME idea that the gift is coming BUT never gets involved in the selection process, then for sure I am against that. An animal and its owner need to bond in order for this arrangement to work, so if some pet is just freely doled out to someone, you just cross your fingers and hope that the bond is there for the next 10-20 years, and guess how that typically works out?

In short, I not only wholeheartedly oppose the idea of gifting animals where the new owner was not involved in the selection process, I also oppose glamorizing the videos of it, posting videos of it, saying so much as one positive thing about this act that does considerable harm to animals.

9,t3_rvt4w4,CMV: Society generally doesn't care about men,"This might seem like a broad statement, because it is, but let me explain. Over the years, and especially in the last decade, I've found that men are overlooked or not taken seriously on a variety of issues, like domestic violence, rape, child custody, education, suicide, depression, dating, circumcision, loneliness and homelessness.

Most homeless people are men. Most people who commit suicide are men. Most people who drop out of school are men. Most people who die in wars are men. Most work-related deaths are men. I don't see any large social movements ala feminism that have addressed these issues, and feminists who claim to care about men's issues have largely remained silent. 

How many domestic violence shelters are there for men compared to domestic violence shelters for women? Some might say women need more DV shelters because women are more affected, and that may be true, but figures I've seen indicarte something like a 60-40 split between female and male DV victims, respectively. If that's the case, men should have 40% of the DV shelters in order for it to be proportional. 

How many fathers lose custody of their children despite being the more stable parent? How many baby boys are circumcised each year and it's considered normal, while it's seen as a horrid practice to circumcise baby girls? How many men take their own lives because they felt they had nobody who'd listen to them?

So many men feel lonely and have basically no support structure, and if they bring up what's bothering them they risk being told to ""man up"", that they're manbabies, and that it's not that serious. Men are by and large expected to ""suck it in"" and carry on regardless of how we feel. A man who cries is often laughed at, mocked and considered weak.",0.0
10,t3_rvsk3n,"CMV: The ""Karen"" phenomenon has gone from rightful criticism to lazy misogyny real fast","I get it, entitled white women making innocent people's lives hell is completely irritating and is being called out regularly and rightfully so.

What I have started to observe though is that calling someone a ""Karen"" has simply become an easy way to insult women for their opinions and we are back to where we came from before #metoo. It's completely socially acceptable to call someone a Karen nowadays without fear of repercussions or having to explain one's self. Women will use it against each other for disagreeing with each other and it's just become a toxic word and sentiment.

Someone's annoyed by a woman having a strong opinion? Karen. Someone wants a woman to stop criticising them? Karen. A woman is standing up for herself? Karen. 

It's lazy, it's almost impossible to defend against and extremely convenient when someone is out of arguments and just wants to get the woman to shut up. 

In my mind it's up there with calling someone a boomer for no other reason than their birth date. Not to mention that it is being used exponentially more often than its male counterpart. 

This is such a bleak development and it's so counterproductive to everything females have fought for for centuries.

For example you can be funny, witty around your friends but then the skills completely disappear around the opposite sex, and then secondly you can charm someone with your personality but you will still need to have game to take it to the next level. Although I hate PUAs but their approach teaches you how to be direct with women which is one of the most important skill you need to be successful in dating. Although you can get lucky and meet your SO through mutual friends but if it doesn't work out, how many more friends do your mutual friends have that you can date? Not much really.

14,t3_rvm9tl,CMV: Mental Illness is a valid reason for a person's bad behavior and actions.,"Reason why is simple. Mental illnesses effect and often negatively influence a person's mood, thinking , behavior and actions. Therefore, a person with a mental illness is likely blinded to both the morality their actions and the possible consequences.

If a person with a plethora of mental illnesses like ASPD, schizophrenia and a bipolar goes out and shoots up an area full of people with the consequences of their actions being many deaths, it is valid to blame their actions on their illness because the person was incapable of recognizing what they were doing is wrong due to their various mental illnesses that distorted their thinking.

The classic ""he's not all there"" argument is **VALID** in this scenario and many, many, actual ones in which people who are mentally ill commit crimes.

The classic ""I also have (insert mental illnesses here) and I don't act that way"" counterargument often brought up is **INVALID** because everyone's brain is wired differently with some people being more negatively effected by the severity of their mental illness than someone else with the same illness. Not to mention not everyone get's or can afford treatment and even if they do, that treatment may not work as well and because most mental illnesses are incurable. 

Arguing ""if he didn't have faulty mental wiring he would have done the same thing"" is an unfalsifiable fallacy and **INVALID** argument because there's no way of proving this statement wrong. People should about the realities of a situation and not bring up hypotheticals.

If someone with severe mental illness commits a serious crime, it should be the mental illness of a that is highlighted and attacked, NOT the person because the person's brain is negatively influenced by the mental illness.

Anyways, BLM rioters are some of the most despicable, evil people I’ve seen in recent memory.  They destroyed buildings, businesses, and lives all in the name of “social justice”, claiming Black Lives Matter, but turn a blind eye to gang violence, which sees black people killing way more black people than cops do. If these BLM members truly believed in their message, they would speak about this and maybe try to do something about it, but they don’t.  They only focus on police brutality and racially motivated crimes against black people, which is why I say the group is deceptive.  Their name is Black Lives Matter, but they only matter when they’re killed by white cops and/or supremacists? Why? All that means is the young black people who kill each other by the thousands, the ones who really need help and support, are ignored.  I think that people living in poverty who feel like the only way to survive is to commit crime and be in a gang is an example of oppression and racial inequality, since no one should have to live like that. They could shed light on this issue, offer some money to the affected families and communities, etc, but they choose not to. BLM doesn’t care as long as there’s no racism.  Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe there’s a good reason why the riots happened that I don’t know about, and maybe there should be another social justice group for the issue I mentioned, or maybe there’s something else I missed. So please, change my view.

16,t3_rvl3ov,"CMV: If Capital Punishment is to exist, it should be conducted publicly.","In principle I am against the death penalty. But I live in the United States where the death penalty is still practice and, if we are to believe polling, most Americans believe that some crimes are so bad that anyone who commits then should be killed by the state. If we are going to play this game of ""divine retribution"" through the law (I am being sarcastic here of course, but if asked I can explain why I phrase it that way), then we should play the game right. Do it publicly. Allow journalists or just interested third parties to watch it happen in person. Or heck, broadcast it on TV and over the radio to get the greatest number of views. 

This probably sounds repelling to you. I find the idea revolting personally. We think our ourselves as enlightened, civilized, kind individuals in a society that has progressed morally. So we pay our taxes, and the state does the dirty work behind closed doors. We don't have to think about it. We didn't personally like the criminals. We don't have to watch it happen. As if that somehow absolves us from blame and responsibility. It does not. 

If we executed criminals publicly, at least the pro-death penalty crowd would see their beliefs in action. At least they would be putting their money where their mouth is. At least we would see the state as it truly is: a murderer. I'm not okay with that, but what boils my blood even more is hypocrisy and deceit. We claim to be so civilized compared to, say, France in the eighteenth century for chopping people's heads off. The Guillotine is actually quite a painless way to die. If you mess up then yes the person will be in a lot of pain, but there have been horror stories of people writhing in agony when lethal injection went haywire. 

Again, just to be clear, I am against the death penalty. If you truly want to make someone suffer then stick them in a cage for the rest of their life, and force them to make licensed plates or whatever they allow prisoners to do for peanuts. If people are all about punishment, then turning a person into a slave of the state (that's what prisoners are after all, slaves to the state) is perhaps the worst form of punishment you could give them. But at least they can be release if its proven they are innocent. At least they can be released once they've served their time if they weren't given a life sentence. And if they were given a life sentence (or multiple) at least they haven't been deprived of existence in its entirety. I expect prison life is pretty miserable, but when you execute them you prevent them from taking pleasure in anything--even if those pleasures are small ones like reading a novel in their cell or a 30 minute conversation with their mother once a week. 

When the state kills a person, the state becomes God, deems a person unquestionably guilty, and deems their actions worthy of death. I realize the definition of the state is the institution with a monopoly on violence. But that doesn't mean we should allow the state to do just anything. As much as possible we should put safeguards in place that reduce the state's need to use violence. People may not be perfect, institutions may have to get down and dirty sometimes, but that doesn't mean reforms aren't beneficial sometimes. Abolishing the death penalty is an example of such a reform.",6.0

19,t3_rvjstp,CMV: There is no problem with teens having opinions,"I'm a teen myself so I am biased, but on Reddit a fairly common sentiment I see on certain subs is that any opinion anyone under 25 or so has is worthless because of the brain not being developed and/or lack of ""life experience."" Personally I think this is wrong, hence this post. I'll address both of the main arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lack of life experience**

This argument is basically that teens don't have enough of this mythical ""life experience"" and therefore all their opinions are worthless. This seems like an extremely weak argument to me, I mean I doubt paying rent or some extra taxes will be so traumatizing that I'll change all my opinions right away. And most teens have at least some life experience, like a part time job (work experience) and/or preparing for college (working towards a long term goal).

There is also the problem that life experience isn't everyone gets linearly at the same time. For instance if an 16 year old with abusive parents who has to work 2/3 jobs and take care of siblings would probably have more life experience then a 30 year old trust fund baby who has never experienced any kind of hardship and never worked a day in his life. Those are extreme examples but you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

**The brain isn't fully developed**

This is true to an extent, the brain does not finish fully developing until 25. However you still have the ability to reason and use logic before then. According to the article below, around 11-14 is when deductive and abstract reasoning develops and you start to solve more complex problems. Rational thinking isn't 100% but it's getting pretty close. That's enough in my opinion to have an accurate opinion on a political subject like immigration, legalizing weed, universal healthcare or raising/lowering taxes. Especially with the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

**What will not convince me:**

* ""You'll understand when you're older"" I'm not older yet and until I get to that age to see for myself it's functionally the same as ""I'm right because I say so"" in my book and is not going to convince me.

Inclusivity is about highlighting what binds us together, not what spreads us apart. I am a part of the generation (x) that worked to destroy gender roles. Women with careers? Normal. Men raising children? Normal. Dress however you like? Check. Females take the initiative to initiate mating? Expected. 

I feel like my children's generation took a step back from that while trying to push forward. They want a world where you can be male or female regardless of primary and secondary sexual organs. But I don't get it. Why preserve the roles of man and woman if we are truly equal? I know that among high paying jobs there is still a wage gap, but it seems to me that becoming a man to avoid the downside is practically victorian thinking. I know certain ways of acting are considered feminine, but doesn't making acting that way okay for anyone seem more progressive than changing your pronouns?

24,t3_rvfo6s,CMV: The Ideal Economic System is Capitalism with a Socialist Safety Net,"Ignore the word “Socialist” in the title.  It’s confusing a lot of people and isn’t accurate to the type of program I’m trying to describe.  

Last post changed my view within an hour, let’s see if this one is as easy to change!

Problems with Capitalism: 

- invites the abuse of the working class by making the alternative to perpetual employment life ruining or deadly

- causes massive suffering and death whenever someone middle class or bellow suffers medical or career misfortune

Problems with Communism:

- Almost impossible to pull off on a large scale without leaning either into anarchy or authoritarianism

Compromise:
Only healthcare, really basic housing, and food are made public.  This provides a safety net that functionally removes the faults of capitalism while avoiding communism.

“That’s not extreme enough to liberate the working class!”  “That’ll turn the masses into welfare queens!”

* Worker abuses will be more difficult to perpetuate because loosing your job will be a massive inconvenience and temporary drip in quality of life, not a sentencing to homelessness or death.  

* No one’s life will be ruined by medical debt or ended by medical care price inflation.

* Simultaneously, very few people are ever going to be content living in a tiny apartment with only basic utilities and little to no luxuries, wearing shitty basic clothes and eating basic food (taste foods and fancy foods would be classified as luxury  products).  Look at how real- life “welfare queens” make up a tiny percentage of those who receive it!  If anything, low- motivation people will at least work part- time, low wage jobs, which ARE a needed part of any economy.

*As it is, this system is more effective than Universal Basic Income in not being exploited.  What are you gonna do, trade some of the apples and basic chicken that the other down-on-their-luck people also got for drugs or fancy stuff you don’t need.  Feel free!  It won’t be anywhere near as enabling as being handed money to do so with.  

*You also don’t have to worry about the safety net not being sufficient for vulnerable or disadvantaged groups like you do with UBI.

25,t3_rven4b,CMV: Most transgender people believe in (or harbor sympathies for) Ba'athism," 

Hey everyone! Ba'athism is a progressive, socialist political movement that calls for all Arab peoples to be united under one nation. In my opinion, Transgender people are Ba'athists; this is for a variety of reasons.  Every single transgender person I have ever spoken to about Ba'athism has either been a Ba'athist or held favorable viewpoints towards it. A crucial part of Ba'athism is a rejection of the old, imperialist order, and replacing it with a new one that makes every person equal. Secularism and feminism are a crucial part of Ba’athism, for instance. In Arabic, Ba’ath means “rebirth” or “resurrection,” which are terms that are often associated with coming out as transgender, and living the life that someone truly is. Another major tenet of Ba’athism is social and economic equality- one where all people, regardless of religion, gender expression, or sexuality, are treated equally. Ba’athism also warns against a “reactionary revolutionary,” or someone who uses progressive and/or revolutionary terms and ideas while still harboring reactionary viewpoints; similar to a TERF. A TERF is a reactionary who pretends to be progressive as an excuse to hate on transgender people.  I don’t think it’s a coincidence that every transgender person I’ve ever discussed Ba'athism with has been at least sympathetic to it. Please try to change my mind!

In fact if you look at a list of the top ten most-populous nations (China, India, USA, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, and Mexico) I wouldn't want to live on any of these countries over the US. This means that creating a high standard of living for all your people is very difficult in a large country. In contrast, Sweden has the population of North Carolina, and Denmark is the population of Wisconsin.

27,t3_rvdky7,"CMV: The 1950s were not even close to being a ""Golden Age"" of America","I hear many people talk about the 50s as some glorious era in US history but if you look even slightly beneath the surface that's just not true. If we measure aspects of well-being like health, access to commodities, wealth, safety, peace, and equity, there's no comparison. People remember it fondly because there was no longer a World War but compared to what we've seen since the 1950s, now is just so much better in essentially every category of life even through the darkest shade of rose tinted glasses

**In terms of health:**

\- There was 218,000 total cases of Polio throughout the 1950s; there's been zero for the past 50 years (this led to many people being disabled long-term in an era with limited accommodations)

\- There was around 500,000 cases of Measles per year in USA throughout the 1950s compared to less than 100 today

\- Infant mortality was 30 per every 1k births compared to 6 per 1k births today

\- Life Expectancy was 69 years in the 1950s compared to 79 years today

\- The advancements in medical technology alone would disqualify the 1950s as a golden age

**In terms of commodities:**

\- There was no internet and cell phones which means a lot of lucrative industries today would not exist, hence most of our jobs/businesses would not either.

\- We have more access to bulks of information than scholars did in the 1950s due to internet, and with cell phones, we have a more sophisticated way of communicating than world leaders did in the 50s

\- Food was very bland. The food we eat today is so much better and we get a lot more diversity/options because now they can come from all over the world if we don't produce them

\- Less than 3/4ths of homes had electricity in the 1950s whereas now it's universal

\- About 20% of homes didn't have indoor plumbing yet whereas now it's universal

\- Only 50% of homes in America had running water in the early 1950s

\- Things like dish washers, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, stoves, and washing machines were either all luxury items or not invented yet

\- ""Lower-end"" cars today function wayyy better than the best cars did in the 1950s

\- Commercial airlines didn't start until 1953 and were not widely used until the 1970s (it took like 15 hours with 12 stop points to get from Boston to Los Angeles in 1950) - also, most of the world was unstable at the time so international travel isn't what it is today

\- In terms of wealth, Americans are on average, about 16x richer now than they were 60 years ago

**In terms of safety/peace:**

\- Homes in the US built during the 50s included bomb shelters because everyone was so convinced the USSR was going to attack America at any moment

\- 37k American lives were lost in the Korean War which lasted 3 years compared to 6k in Iraq and Afghanistan combined over the course of 20 years

\- In the 1950s, we were about 7x more likely to die in a vehicle accident

\- In the 1950s, pedestrians were 5x more likely to be killed by a vehicle

\- In the 1950s, we were 20-25x more likely to die on the job

\- Lead poisoning is down significantly after leaded gasoline was banned in the 90s; emissions of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and lead as a whole is down by like 90% since the 1950s

\- Smoke was literally everywhere because everyone over age 12 was never seen without a cigarette

**In terms of discrimination:**

\- Being gay was illegal

\- There was still racial segregation for African Americans

\- Immigration was certainly not widely accepted yet

\- Women couldn't own credit cards and domestic violence was regularly brushed off",12.0
28,t3_rvdfzn,CMV: Adoption is Always Logistically and Ethically Superior to Conception and Surrogacy,"Originally posted to r/The10thDentist but told it might be better suited for here

So, let’s say you want a baby.  You get pregnant… and 9 months later is born a severely disabled child who you are not financially or emotionally equip to care for and may end up resenting.  Or maybe you suffer horrific complications that put you in pain…or even post- partum depression that wrecks your marriage.  Logistically, conceiving a child by yourself or through a surrogate is a painful experience that has the potential to go wrong in so many ways.  Taking this risks for something as shallow as sharing DNA with your kid seems almost deranged at times.

Adoption, on the other hand, not only provides for an existing child in need (as opposed to creating another human on this planet with too many neglected already), but also circumvents all this nastiness.  No post birth complications for you to suffer or your surrogate to suffer and you feel guilty about!  Most of the time, you’ll know exactly what you’re getting into- if the kid is ill or special needs, you can prepare or decide “we’re not qualified” instead!

(Note: I am disabled myself; this is not a “disabled kids are a burden” thing.  This is a “Ill- prepared guardians often do a shit job through no fault of their own” thing).

TLDR; see title

EDIT: alright, didn’t expect it to happen so quickly, but you guys have altered my view!  I still believe that more people should adopt, and in many cases it is the most ethical avenue, but you guys have proven that this only holds true if done in a certain way.  You’ve also proven that adoption has significant enough unique challenges that it isn’t suitable for everyone.",0.0
29,t3_rvc9f3,Cmv: AI can’t overtake humans because it does not have the survival capability needed to adapt to environment like humans do,"The simplest reasoning I can provide is that AI does not have the survival capabilities that humans do. AI cannot “adapt” to unfamiliar environments and cannot survive in critical conditions. An example would be humans (or any living thing for that matter) figuring out how to survive in extreme weather conditions or in pandemic etc. But the same cannot be said for computers. Computers crash (or throw an error) if an unknown command is given. Also AI does not “prioritize” it’s own well-being like humans do (when their survival is concerned). Hence I conclude that AI cannot overtake humans. Change my view 😊

Update: Since I see that my words are not communicating exactly what I meant, let me clarify. I meant that AI cannot adapt to conditions that are “outside their realm of existence”. In this case that realm is the physical world. Think of it like a 3D box and think of AI as a 2D creature. AI cannot “break the 4th wall”. Another example would be that AI cannot survive if you “pull the plug on it” or if you “lower the voltage or current that is supplied to the processor”.

30,t3_rvc923,CMV: Porn is not inherently unhealthy and most negatives are relatively overblown,"Porn is pretty normal in my eyes. Not normal in the sense that everyone uses it or that it’s good for everyone, but normal in the sense that hot sauce has or chicken wings might be considered. Some people like it, some don’t, it can be bad for some and great for others.

People speak of porn addiction as if you can’t get similar addictions to essentially everything. This doesn’t mean that porn addiction isn’t bad, but I fail to see how any of these arguments are worse that, say, food. Even the healthiest food will be terrible for some people because of things like allergies. Food in general leads to far more health issues, deaths, and overall distraction of ones self.

Porn certainly has issues (I.e. a video of someone not consenting to the sex/or the video being posted), but that’s not an issue with porn itself, it’s like saying food is bad cause it can be used to poison people.

I think a lot of people end up having skewed views of porn because of more “traditional” puritanical views on sex. That’s fine if they feel that way, but that shouldn’t have an impact on how anyone else lives their lives. If I think religions bad I shouldn’t berate some normal old lady who enjoys going to church.

People seem to think that porn harms things like people’s abilities to have good sex or to have a healthy relationship. These are issues of miseducation and it should never be porns job to educate people, that’s a larger societal issue that is completely separate.

I.e. before porn was accessible it was much more common for sex to be thought of as “just for a mans pleasure.” Porn didn’t create this issue and it shouldn’t be blamed for it.

I don't see any reason why the only method of acquiring assistance with a service would be locked behind a call-center except to create barriers to accessing that assistance. This practice traps people in contracts and should honestly be illegal - as it is especially problematic for people with speech impediments or disabilities.

Now, if a service can *only* be started via a phone call with a representative, then I suppose that's fine. It means that the customer already demonstrated an ability to access the service despite the barrier.

33,t3_rvaquq,CMV: abortion is not a fundamental human right,"I know what the arguments are pro-abortion. I mainly see these: No woman should become a life machine for someone else without their consent and fetuses are not yet developed humans, so they don’t have rights at all.

The second part of the argument is bad because you can’t put a specific point on when something has human rights. It isn’t based on much and saying a fetus is a human from day 1 is just as valid as saying it  only becomes one after x weeks.

The first part of the argument is bad because having consensual sex is giving consent to possibly having a child. And if no one should be forced to be life support for someone else, why does the right to abortion stop at x weeks, and why are people forced to pay life support for children?

I know that this discussion is not this clear-cut, and I know a lot can be said. But because it is impossible to objectively say what is good  and what is bad in this case, people should be able to make their own moral choice and be free. 

But if there is someone out there who heavily disagrees, and has reasonable ground to believe abortion is murder, I couldn’t say they were bad people, as it is their moral choice to make. If a community wants to outlaw abortion outside cases of health, rape etc., who are we to tell them to legalise abortion?

Arguing the morality of abortion could only change my mind if it shows how that abortion is not only moral, but that it is immoral to disagree.

“Human rights” should be a set of things we all agree on are fundamental for humans to have. Abortion is not nearly a universal value enough that it could be a human right, and it being up there brings the value of human rights down.


In summary: it is difficult to say abortion is an absolute moral everyone should have, so it doesn’t deserve to be a universal human right.",0.0
34,t3_rv9r06,CMV: Laws restricting the right to die are functionally the same as blasphemy laws,"The right to die is one of the most contentious topics in contemporary society, and may be the final frontier in civil rights or individual rights. 

As things currently stand, the state is allowed to actively interfere in cases of suicide, and in order to justify this, they typically claim that suicidal people have judgement that is severely compromised due to something called ""mental illness"", and therefore need the state to act in *loco parentis* in order to rescue them from their own thoughts.

But what is mental illness? It isn't an objective scientific category. It is a term used to describe human psychological suffering. The threshold for when psychological suffering becomes a pathology is arbitrarily defined and constantly shifting. And when you get diagnosed with a mental illness, instead of identifying some kind of pathogen causing an objectively observed pathology, all that psychiatrists do is give a label to the type of suffering that you are experiencing. So that would be a bit like going to the doctor because you have a sore leg, and being diagnosed with a ""sore leg"". Psychiatry isn't anywhere near finding the biological bases for the vast majority of these pathologies that they have invented to justify taking away people's rights, and this ability to label people as mentally unwell has been abused in the past in order to oppress various different marginalised groups such as homosexuals (homosexuality having been in the DSM as a mental illness until the 1970s until it was taken out because that prejudice was becoming old hat) and women who dared to defy gender norms.

In many parts of the world, deviating from the most prevalent religion locally is seen as a form of sickness as well, although the main difference between places with strict blasphemy laws and the western approach to suicide prevention is that the enforcement of the blasphemy laws tends to be overtly punitive, whereas suicide prevention tends to be dressed up in the guise of compassion through a process of gaslighting the individual into believing that the way they perceive the world is distorted and warped. You can prevent suicide by presuming the individual to be mentally ill, and because mental illnesses are not diagnosed through the process of objective testing, they are also unfalsifiable. Therefore, if you are presumed to be depressed because you are suicidal, there is no test that you can have administered in order to prove that you aren't in fact depressed. And this is one major reason why expanding assisted suicide is seen to be treacherous, because there would be no way of effectively screening out those who are ""depressed"" due to the lack of any way of objectively testing someone for it, let alone any way of objectively determining how ""depressed"" a rational person can be based on a given set of life circumstances. 

But the same driving force undergirds both the blasphemy law and the suicide prevention initiatives, and that is the desire to protect a shared cultural narrative. If the Pakistani government could prove that Allah was the one true God and Mohammed his only messenger, then there would be no need for such heavy handed enforcement against those who denied that fact. It would just be trivially obvious that those who denied the faith were delusional and not to be taken seriously, in the same way that Western governments do not feel threatened enough by flat earthers to actually start imprisoning them, let alone sentencing them to death, for their beliefs.

It is my contention that suicidal people are summarily discredited as ""mentally ill"" because our society has no way of proving the objective value of life (or what kind of risks and harms are an acceptable price to pay for the putative rewards on offer), and therefore our belief that life is valuable can easily come under threat from those who choose to reject life. It used to be the case that suicide was a crime here in the UK, and those who attempted suicide and failed would be punished by the law for their crime. Since the Suicide Act in the 1960s, we've started treating suicide as an act of desperation performed by someone who was seriously mentally unwell. Although this is supposed to be more compassionate, it is in fact, in my opinion, even more insidious than making attempted suicide a crime punishable by law, because once you are presumed to be insane, you lose your legal standing as a competent adult; a standing which it is impossible ever to recover due to the unfalsifiable nature of the ""illness"" that you have been diagnosed with (or even merely presumed to have). 

I believe that the reason that any attempt to introduce legalised assisted suicide draws an outcry from disabled groups is not because these people truly believe that they will be coerced into dying, but because it invalidates their belief that life is worth living, which is a position based in faith, rather than in evidence. The same can be said of those who work 40+ hours a week in demeaning jobs and barely have time to catch their breath before getting back on the same old treadmill to nowhere. Those people want to believe that there is more to life, and that life is a gift...but their circumstances and prospects for the future do not seem to bear that out, so they can stake their convictions on nothing more than mere faith. 

Regardless of whether one is enjoying life now, there was a virtual eternity of time which passed prior to one's birth during which one had absolutely no qualms about the lack of conscious sensation or opportunities to experience pleasure. And if one accepts that consciousness resides in the brain and cannot survive death, then the same will be true of the eternity of non-existence that follows on after death. If this is true, then if one is not having a good time, then why would it not be rational to cut one's losses as early as possible, given that one will not be able to regret that choice after death?

My thesis is that this argument is so compelling that there is no way to effectively refute it, and the only course of action is to pre-emptively silence its proponents by stigmatising people who might be inclined to invest their own welfare in such a philosophy as being mentally disturbed and in need of paternalistic care from the state. Since no self-respecting adult wishes to lose their entitlement to be perceived as a competent and rational member of society, this forms a powerful disincentive against speaking out for their right to full bodily autonomy, which would entail demanding that the state desist from actively interfering in their plans to terminate their existence in the most efficient and safe way possible.

The right has harangued Biden as being a pedophile. QAnon is based in part on accusations of pedophilia and satanic ritual abuse that are reminiscent of the McMartin trial.

To be clear, I am not saying that pedophilia is acceptable; I am saying that it is a distraction. To my mind, there is not a substantial pedophile problem in the United States. Pedophiles who act on their urges generally go through the justice system.

11 of the people looked and acted like you'd expect people who design custom cakes to look and act.

But there was this one dude, Dustin, who clearly didn't belong. He looked like he was at Home Depot getting more lumber for a project, and somehow ended up on this show. He's wearing a plaid shirt tucked into jeans, and used power tools to cut gingerbread (a tool commonly used to cut metal). 

I would say Dustin did not look like the other people there.

But if I were to use the phrase how it's commonly used, then that wouldn't be true; Because Dustin is white and there were other white people there.

Which brings me to the issue I have with the phrase: It dismisses people's individuality, their personal experiences, their personality...and reduces them to only their race and/or gender.

I DO NOT think Morgan Freeman, Jamie Fox, and Larry Elder look the same. They are all very different individuals with entirely different experiences.

40,t3_rv119m,CMV: Americans take the pro vaccine stance too far,"Title.

Most people are pro vaccine, but the American political landscape of... well politicizing everything, including vaccines, is detrimental to the world, the internet and just society in general.

No other country that I know of has actually decided this party = pro vaccine and another party = anti vaccine, why does this even fall under those brackets in the states? 

In Europe if you see someone without a mask where they are meant to where one, people might disapprove, but they aren't going to get into a shouting match about it. 

Currently in /r/news there is a topic about a anti vaccine riot in germany, somehow and for some absolutely insane reason, pro vaccine redditors are trying to justify the fact that a police officer pepper sprayed a 4 year old child who's mother was trying to break through a police line. I saw that and just came to the conclusion, pro vaccine America is just absolutely insane.  Reportedly the women had the child in her arms, but I don't think that excuses the officers actions. 

Just to be clear, I am really pro vaccine, but I'm not going to attack people verbally for not holding my beliefs. I might argue my case, but this partizan behavior specifically amongst Americans has really gone too far.  

I know vaccines save lives, but this manner of dialogue is not constructive to anyone. Tell me I'm wrong.",20.0
41,t3_ruy0aq,CMV: There should be a registry of firearms and owners in the United States,"I believe there should be a digital, searchable federal registry of firearm owners (and firearms) along with their licenses.  I think this will allow crimes to be solved much more quickly, especially if like Maryland gun retailers fingerprint their guns for forensic firearm examination.  However I'm also open to changing this view and understanding why it hasn't been done before.

Additionally, if guns are reported stolen, it would likely make it easier to keep them from being resold and make returning it to the rightful owner much more likely (just check the serial number if someone tries to sell it in a gun shop).

For law-abiding gun owners, I believe this will save their time as opposed to waste it:  ""Oh it probably isn't Joe, he has a 9mm with an x rifling pattern, we don't even need to contact him""

Of course, maybe we wouldn't want the suspect list for shootings to just go to the ""nearest n neighbors that own a gun,"" but perhaps it could help narrow down the suspect list.

* Why a registry is unconstitutional
* Why adding a registry will do more harm than good
* Good reasons why it hasn't been done yet",6.0
42,t3_ruxzwj,"CMV: there is nothing wrong with online content creators such as Jordan Peterson, HasanAbi, or Belle Delphine etc. extracting money from their audience","I've cited these names because they are representative examples but it could be any online content creator you can think of that is selling an experience, be it NSFW, political, gaming-related, para-social, etc.

If their audience has access to online payments, they are presumably adults. If they are not adults, it's the parents' responsibility to monitor where their child is spending their money. If there are places where kids can legally access their own online payments, consider my view to be against this practice.

If they are adults, they should be able to make their own decisions. If they genuinely believe that these content creators are their friends or that watching them is a valid form of activism or wish to send them money for any other reason, that's their personal responsibility.

It's not as if they were being sold cigarettes or substances that create a physical dependence. Nobody is putting a gun to the audience's head or trapping them in a cycle of addiction. Nor are they subconsciously being manipulated as with the UI in social networking apps or the gambling lootboxes in AAA games. They are coming to a spending decision on their own following the active efforts of an individual or small group performing in front of a camera. The YouTube or Twitch recommendation algorithm or any other such example is not sufficient help for the content creator to extract money from donations; they have to actually work for it once the user clicks on them. The user can switch off the screen or their attention at any time, and is not trapped by a dopamine cycle as with games or social networks involving social status games. Of course, there will be clickbait and all sorts of other techniques employed, but the content creator will have to work hard to maintain the attention and can't hijack it the way the Zucc's or game studios' trained behavioral psychologists can.

The ethical debates comes from the idea that they are milking their vulnerable crowd. But we can't make people's decisions for them, and adults cannot be considered vulnerable their whole lives. They deserve the freedom to make their own mistakes. If they are consenting adults but gullible or lonely enough to send money to online millionaires because the millionaires are telling them what they want to hear, that is their problem, not the responsibility of the creator. We cannot rob the audience of their autonomy in a paternalistic way, even if they make choices to their detriment. Nor does the fact that some creators make a ton of money mean that the situation somehow becomes more unethical.

Please CMV!

**tl;dr**

- Consenting adults should make their own decisions and take on their own responsibility
- There is no particularly strong neurological hijacking going on other than the charisma and skill of the creators, so the autonomy of the donators is not hijacked
- The cynicism of creators or their capacity to make a lot of cash is not a sufficient reason to make this unethical, due to the principle of personal autonomy and the low usage of dopamine/skinner box traps in this sort of content

**The things that would probably change my view the most:**
- If there's some other non-obvious harm coming from these content creators that I might have completely overlooked  
- If you have a philosophical counterargument to the framework of personal freedom I'm using.  

**Arguments unlikely to change my view:**  
- Anything to do with the debate about the merits of capitalism. This is a worthy topic of course, much more worthy than this one in fact but it deserves its own thread and is too wide ranging compared to this topic. It would be like trying to smash flies with a hammer.  
- Defending a specific content creator as an example of positive content. I don't care about whether any specific content creator is genuine or not, the point is about the personal freedom of consenting adults  
- That this makes political discourse worse. In this case the blame lies at the feet of the people. The content creators did not create a culture of low quality discourse and activism all by themselves: they were brought to prominence because they naturally met a need of the citizenry.

43,t3_rux1o2,CMV: Gift cards should never expire.,"&gt;Under the law, a gift card cannot expire until at least five years from the date it was activated. The law also places general limitations on fees. For instance, the card issuer cannot charge a dormancy or inactivity fee on a gift card unless there has been no activity for one year and the card clearly states its policy toward that fee. In addition, some states have separate laws that provide added protection in certain circumstances.

I think it's pretty messed up that gift cards can expire even after 5 years and fees can be ever be charged for not using them. I imagine that the counter argument to this would probably be something along the lines of ""It protects the company from inflation"". However, IMO it seems like the liability is on the company to take that risk when they create an artificial currency that can only be used at their store.

45,t3_rut4y6,"CMV: The Best Step To Prevent Online Cancellation Anger is Regulating Clear Ban and Appeal Procedures, Not Arguing Free Speech Rights","The Twitter ban free speech argument is a step ahead of reality and doomed to fail today. The focus should be regulating bias in automated bans on any platform, and rewarding clear record keeping about user bans and appeals, if any, so that users and services can interpret the facts and enforce their agreed upon terms better—without an opaque customer service appeals process arousing public confusion and anger. 

***

There will be many posts about Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Twitter ban for violating its terms. Her office likely has not even had time to formally appeal the ban through Twitter procedures, but they anticipate the outcome will be unclear and against Taylor Greene. This argument is too narrow. It’s not freedom of speech, deplatforming, or cancelling. It’s about procedural rights and record keeping. 

Forget Twitter and Facebook. You [can be banned](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10?amp) from Google. Your post on social network Google+ (RIP) could lead to your account being blocked from using any connected service including Gmail, Photos, Docs, Ads, and your speaker Assistant. That is considerably more frightening considering how much we rely on Google and Microsoft (XBOX anyone?) over social networks. 

On Twitter, Rep. Taylor Greene can appeal her permanent ban if a [mistake](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options) has been made by Twitter in applying the terms.  You can request Google to [review](https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/disabled2) the situation. But the terms of use are so heavily skewed in the providers’ favor, and the process is so vague (example: who is actually contextualizing my banned post on appeal: maybe a paid content screener in Bangladesh unfamiliar with American humor?), you’ll never win an appeal alleging you did *not* violate terms of use. 

Freedom of speech is an example of substantive due process (a government protection for courts to enforce for you). People like the idea because the court protects you from the institution “cancelling” you. Good luck convincing a court of your deplatformed account’s right to free speech on TikTok. 

**My view**: Instead, the first, and most workable immediate solution isn’t harping on your right to free speech, or section 230 of the CDA. It’s clearing up the opaque appeal process by expanding existing regulation. 

The FTC has enforced procedural fairness against [unavailable web and phone customer service](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2008/06/080610compucreditcmptsigned.pdf). This authority should pair with the authority to review potential bias in [algorithms](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2376209) that automatically ban users, and record keeping of the ban decision for the user, provider, and courts to review if necessary in a civil suit.  

Though the Federal Trade Commission is stretching broad deception and fairness powers here, Congress should expand that authority to critical internet companies. If the FTC and Justice Department can confidently widen by law its algorithm bias and [record keeping](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai) inspection [requirements](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-streamlines-investigations-in-eight-enforcement-areas), that is the clear discoverable ground for consider if a civil suit is viable to actually enforce any private right or damages that a simple ban notice and short explanation from Google customer service can’t offer.  

Clarity cools the temperature because this information may be inspected and analyzed by everyone involved before preparing for war over cancellation. Expand this authority first, because it just makes sense for trillion dollar giants to keep easy to access (improved) records of decision making without much investment or manual effort and justify that decision process clearly if challenged by the user.",0.0
46,t3_rupws0,"CMV: ""Deplatforming"" is a problem and should be stopped.","In the news today is Marjorie Taylor Green's suspension/removal from twitter, and a common (yet false) refrain from her supporters is that this is a first amendment violation, because it infringes her right to free speech. It does not do this, the first amendment only prevents the government from infringing MTG's right to free speech, and Twitter is not the government.

My opinion is that the world would be a better place if corporations such as Twitter were not allowed to arbitrarily revoke the rights of people to use the Twitter platform i.e. ""deplatform"" them. Note that I'm **not** saying Twitter must allow all speech that the first amendment would allow, or that Twitter should never be allowed to ban people, I'm basically saying that there should be _some_ legal restrictions on how and when Twitter blocks or removes speech. What those restrictions are is something I'd like to leave out of scope.

I have a few reasons for believing this:

1) We want people to have free speech because we want people to be able to speak their mind in public, spread information, organize protests, etc. When the first amendment was drafted, a pretty significant fraction of speech was literal speech i.e. making noises with your mouth, with much of the remainder consisting of distributing paper with your ""speech"" (actually writings) written on the paper. Both of these things can and could relatively easily be done independently, with no assistance from anyone. In the modern era, a much larger fraction of discourse is done online, mediated through, and thus assisted by, third parties. In order to achieve our original goal of ensuring people can speak their mind, spread information, and organize protests in the modern environment, we need to ensure that platforms allow them do this. As an example, imagine that in the distant future, Mark Zuckerberg's daughter gets elected to some government position (while Mark is still Facebook's CEO), and then Facebook starts removing criticism of her. In the status quo, Facebook would have the right to do that (assuming they do that of their ""own volition"" and not due to any request/influence by the daughter... not that there would be any way of proving that either way...), but to me that sounds like a terrible situation and I don't think they should have the right to do that.

2) We want people to have free speech because we don't trust the government to not be evil, and without the first amendment, the government may try to censor criticism or whistleblowing against it. In my opinion, corporations are even less trustworthy/more likely to be evil, and thus should also be prevented from censoring certain types of criticism or whistleblowing. As an example, suppose that ExxonMobil commits some terrible environment atrocity, and is attempting to cover it up. An internal whistleblower finds evidence of this atrocity, and posts it to Facebook and Twitter, and emails it to some journalists. ExxonMobil expected this (maybe because the whistleblower tried to go through internal channels first), and preemptively paid Facebook, Twitter and Google to scan posts and emails for evidence of the atrocity and remove it. In the status quo, Facebook, Twitter, and Google would be within their rights to accept the money and do as requested, but to me that sounds like a terrible situation and I don't think they should have the right to do that.

3) Another context where the first amendment is relevant is saying the pledge of allegiance in school. The Supreme Court has rules that because of the first amendment, public schools cannot legally force students to say the pledge of allegiance. But this restriction doesn't apply to private school. I think it should. The negative effects on the students is the same regardless of whether they are at a private or public school, and thus I feel that the restriction should apply. Essentially, when in school, whether public or private, the platforms that a student can use to speak are severely limited, and thus those platforms should be scrutinized and treated more similarly to the government, regardless of whether they actually are an arm of the government or not.",0.0
47,t3_ruonrl,CMV: Self identifying pronouns does not make any sense.,"EDIT: To clarify when I mean self identifying pronouns I mean expressing your pronouns in for example your twitter bio even tough the pronouns do not come from other people but merely your own internal thoughts about you think fits. So for example certain people write ""they/them"" and wish other to call them ""they/them"" and not he/him or her/she.

EDIT 2: To clarify regarding names. Names are not a grouping but are instead used to refer to a individual. You can call a specific chair whatever you want but it would make no sense to stop calling it a chair just because of that. The goal of a name is to be unique it so you can't tell it apart. A pronoun is meant so you can place somebody in a group to ease future communication.

Could somebody explain why self identifying pronouns is a good thing and why it

should be encouraged. Especially why making assumptions of somebodies pronouns

is a bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Pronouns are a social construct. They are constructed to assist communication.

The grouping of pronouns is arbitrary just like how chairs are arbitrarily

defined.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is nothing that actually makes a chair a chair it is just that we as a

society have accepted that a certain collection of items define a chair.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly we have done this with pronouns. We have decided that we split up

certain sections of our population and refer to them as different things as

this helps with communication.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These lines are murky for sure, but that does not mean we can throw these lines

out of the window. It also does not mean that the person we are referring to

when using the pronouns decides upon them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If objects could talk we would never care whether or not it said it was a

chair. We would only care about whether or not we would call it a chair as that

is what is important to us. This does not mean that we have to have a clear and

strict definition of what a chair is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Many people including myself already seem to have a good idea of what somebody

means when they say ""he"" or ""she"". Though if people are allowed to assign any

pronouns they wish then the word would have little meaning. Confusion arises

even more when neopronouns or usage of neutral pronouns such as ""they"" are used

in place of he or she.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen certain emotional arguments for self picking pronouns as some just

feel more comfortable with a certain pronoun. This is something I am sceptical

towards as we have many different languages with different words for he/she yet

nobody seems to have wanted to change ""he"" to something like ""han"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The only logical reason I could see would be for a trans person wanting to feel

like the gender they have transitioned to. Though by needing to constantly

correct people on their usage of pronouns this would merely result in you lying

to yourself about what your perceived gender is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For the record I do not care whether or not I am referred to as ""he"" or ""she"".

The only thing that would be mildly annoying is that it could potentially cause

confusion for others if they where to refer to me. But I see not reason to be

mad or feel the need to correct them.",10.0

Both parents should be active in their children's lives. The working parent should come home and spend time with their children until its their bed time. The family should have time together, they should try to make it to as many events as they can.

The Non working parent should do primary caregiver stuff like doctors appointments, feeding them, cleaning them, working on school work....

The working parent should shouldn't be watching TV for the rest of the day but they shouldn't be doing any form of exhaustive work they should be spending time with the kids/family.

You won't change my mind by proving that there are other useless companies out there that misuse valid technology like the way Nutrisense does. 

There is no 0 good evidence that non-diabetics need to check their sugars and 0 good evidence that checking actually leads to weight loss. 

They might as well sell a blood pressure cuff ""for weight loss"", and say hey check your BP and you'll see how your BP comes down the more weight you lose. 

Sure the more unhealthy your diet, the higher your sugars are going to be after meals. There is no information provided by a CGM for a non type 1 diabetic that is going to directly lead to weight loss, that a freaking scale can't provide.

2. A1c

This is a product that is feeding off of people's pre-existing health anxieties, and is going to add fuel to that fire.

Why do CGMs exist in the medical field, there are valid reasons. They exist specifically for type I diabetics to check their sugars because they are taking INSULIN. If you are not on insulin (or in some circumstances with type II diabetics not on insulin like if they are taking a sulfonylurea or have had previous hypoglycemic episodes) there is no reason to be checking your sugars. CGMs basically exist in order to number 1, protect you from hypoglycemia which can kill you and number 2, titrate your insulin doses so that your sugars remain under control, because your pancreas is no longer producing clinically sufficient insulin.

The COVID-19 pandemic got me thinking a lot about our connection with nature. Now, if you think about it, we have no obvious predators, like there are no species that hunt us down and make a juicy steak or something out of us. And the result is that we have become so comfortable and our primal instincts have diminished significantly. Well, there are no Saber tooth tigers existing right now, thank God. So, we have created an environment where we are able to consume however and whatever we want, making as slow and unfit. The insecurity of being hunted or killed is not there anymore and so we live in a reality where we can afford to eat three to five times a day without having to burn any calories or stress our muscles and minds to obtain food. Because of this, we have been able to procreate, our population has increased. But the species has to be kept in check. Despite eliminating or containing issues regulating the survival if the species such as warfare and famine, epidemics have prevailed as  major threats; and thus, our natural predators.

54,t3_ru9qs8,CMV: most new genders and gender labels are not productive to have in the long run,"
Right now US, and in lesser extent other western countries, cultural and social complexes are centred around “identity”. Knowing to what group you belong and what name you give to that group is very important for your personal identity. Delineations of Identity are thus very important, and things like racial categories and gender categories become very important to define and identify with.

I understand how making a new gender can benefit the people who don’t feel like the other genders there are. But to me, this only makes sense in a cultural complex where identity groups are very important.

In this cishet society it makes sense to create another gender if you don’t feel at home.

But in the bigger picture, why the emphasis on gender? Shouldnt the better course of action be to let biological sex be biological sex. And then to let everyone be their unique person without having to give who you are a name? Why make your gender identity so important to who you are?

For context: I live in a country where American identity and gender ideas are gaining ground. I think there are things to gain from cultural exchange with the US, but it feels like the “American” focus on gender(eg everyone putting pronouns in your bio, creating a new gender whenever you don’t feel any existing ones represent you) goes too far beyond “accepting differences” and perpetuates the culture of identity",1095.0

57,t3_ru3hl7,CMV: US style representative democracy will eventually break down as technology matures,"It’s plain to see that the state of political conversation in the US is devolving at an alarming rate. Most Americans agree that the best suited candidates for leadership are no longer being given the opportunity, and the vast majority of Americans are dissatisfied with their representation in the government at some level. The most extreme voices on both sides are the loudest, creating a rift between party lines the likes of which the US hasn’t seen since the Civil War. Bipartisanship in the senate is at an all-time low, and the election of Donald Trump has forced everyone to come to grips with the reality that the “prerequisites” of political office are changing such that they no longer include relevant experience. My view is that all this was completely predictable due to the maturation of the internet, and I believe that the inevitable maturation of the internet and the technology circle around it will eventually cause the American style of democracy to devolve into complete chaos lest it change in a fundamental way.

The first element in this evolution is social media. Much has been made about the effects of social media on our political circles, so I won’t go very in depth here. To summarize, inflammatory “newsfeed” algorithms prioritize the content most likely to incite an emotional reaction from the user, which in turn is more likely to make the user interact with the post and share it with friends to confirm their own ideas and biases. The lack of a diversity of ideas a person is exposed to serves as an echo chamber, confirms biases, and can make one more susceptible to extremism over time. Social media companies’ business models prioritize clicks and engagement, which incentivize people to make content that is appealing to certain groups, even if what they’re saying isn’t true.

The second element is misinformation (I am aware of the difference between misinformation and disinformation, but I don’t think this distinction is pertinent to the conversation, so I will be classifying all information that is false, inaccurate, misleading, or somehow removed from reality as “misinformation”). Most people are aware of the incredible amount of misinformation people are exposed to on the internet today, but what most people are not aware of is how much that is expected to grow, not only in quantity but in quality and persuasiveness. If one assumes any progress in the field of artificial intelligence at all, algorithmically generated misinformation will eventually become the prominent source. Not only will this increase the amount of misinformation available by orders of magnitude, but it will also be capable of providing the reader misinformation tailored to their own biases if data on their preferences is being gathered (as Facebook, Google, and Twitter already do this). Better misinformation means more clicks and more ad revenue for the companies involved, so this sort of individually tailored misinformation will be incentivized once it becomes cheap to generate. Deep fakes will soon be able to fool your most trusted source of news if they aren’t careful and news organizations will have their reputations challenged like never before. The truth will become harder and harder to discern.

The final element in the mix is the way we can expect all this to affect our politics. Obviously this part of the argument has to be speculation, but observing the way relatively poor quality misinformation has been peddled over the past number of years, I expect that higher quality, individually tailored misinformation will spread like wildfire and the majority of the voting population will eventually owe at least some of their core beliefs and values to falsehoods and smart algorithms, leading to complete disagreement, confusion, and disarray, at which point the representative democracy would follow suit. I honestly can’t think of a convincing solution to this problem, but I am increasingly convinced that it is a likely outcome.",0.0
58,t3_ru1gf3,cmv: Governments who were elected on single partisan issues are not representative and are a failure of democracy.,"Most governments today are illegitimate because they were voted for on specific and often partisan issues. Here in the UK, examples would be Brexit, immigration, anti-socialism etc. Most voters don’t take into account enough issues or enough parts of the manifesto for their vote to give the government a mandate, so those governments don’t have legitimate democratic authority and aren’t capable of fully representing the country. The focus becomes these divisive issues, so anything else the government does as ‘democratically’ elected officials becomes undemocratic, since it was not part of the will of the majority. Parties deliberately push these issues to get into power, so that they can push through their real agendas with the veneer of democratic representation. It’s made even worse when these parties have close links to media (skewing votes heavily) or the wealthy/ powerful, or when these parties, once elected, don’t deliver on their promises. The de-facto approach for many parties has become deceit and back-door-deals, and they have lost (ditched) their role as genuine representatives. The agendas these politicians really want to push aren’t representing the will of the public if the public’s attention was shifted towards a single issue, or if the public are manipulated by lies and the breaking down of trust in experts. We are in an oligarchy rather than a meritocracy or democracy, and huge reforms to the democratic process need to be put in place before governments can be said to be democratically elected representatives. 

During the 2019 election in the UK, the biggest issue by far was Brexit, to the extent that the Conservative party claimed that their reelection represented overwhelming support for Brexit, ignoring the likelihood that not everyone who voted for them necessarily wanted Brexit, given the incumbency bias, their outright smearing of the opposition, their heavy links to the privately owned press, and the failure of public broadcasting to hold them to account. No government can be genuinely representative when they were elected on such grounds with such focus on one large and divisive issue. I’ve attempted to avoid pointing to any one political party, but the Conservative Party are the best example and most relevant to me (as they are the current majority party in the House Of Commons with the biggest donors and the most links to media and power, with many top members coming from wealthy backgrounds and private education). 

This is likely a simplistic overview and I expect to agree with many counter-arguments, but this is a genuine view I hold and will attempt to defend in the comments. Happy new year everyone.",15.0

60,t3_rtwide,CMV: Making inferences based on data about unreported crimes seems highly problematic for me. I think they should be taken with a grain of salt.,"I was reading a Vox article about the rate of crimes being solved in America and they briefly said something to the effect of the solved rate for crimes is embarrassing for police and its even worse when you factor in unreported crimes.

I questioned just how worthwhile it is the even factor in data based on supposed unreported crimes. Heck, how do we even know a crime was committed if there was no investigation. Although there may be some merit to data on unreported crime to me it seems like there's too much uncertainty to really put any weight into the numbers.

61,t3_rtuxbf,CMV: Fat people have less discipline,"People are constantly talking about ""don't judge people off of their weight"" however, I would say that being overweight comes from a lack of discipline and it bleeds through into other parts of their life.

The military has the same logic when it comes to remedial tasks like making your bed, uniform inspection, or shaving.  Some people may think that those are useless and irrelevant when it comes to things like serving in the military, but the logic of the drill instructors is that if you can't put on your uniform right, then how can they expect you to handle a firearm.

I am applying the same logic to living a healthy lifestyle.  If someone can not properly diet and exercise, then how can you expect them to deal with things larger than that.  Discipline builds on itself.  Living an active lifestyle will have benefits in any mental tasks.  I am a perfect example of this: I love running, it is the most rewarding thing in the world to me, even though it hurts like hell.  There's no denying it, it is one of the most painful activities I can think of (definitely the most painful thing I do regularly) but it is the most rewarding thing in the world to cross the finish line with a new best time.  It pushes me to do my best and keep fighting regardless of how good I think it would feel to quit.  Through running, I have learned to not take the easy path, not go for the quick reward, and push through obstacles.  I have learned to apply the same logic to school, whether it's studying for a test, paying attention in class, or staying up late to do homework.  Even though there are much easier things that would make me feel better in the moment, like playing video games or going to bed, because of running I am able to see through that and do what is not easy.  I wholeheartedly believe that the same logic applies to any bodybuilder/athlete.  When you see them, you know just by looking at them that they have spent countless hours working to improve themselves, and it isn't always fun.  So if they can do that, then they are more likely to be able to be counted on.  The same logic can be applied to an obese person; if they always take the easy way out and have milkshakes instead of salad, then how can I expect them to work hard on something like a group assignment?

What I am saying is that staying in shape is a mark of discipline and it automatically shows that a person has the will to push on.

Some possible counter arguments:

* It is a different skill set, fitness vs. intelligence

No, it is not.  It comes down to discipline.  Having the ability to do things that you don't want to do, whether mental or physical tasks, displays a person's character.

&amp;#x200B;

* Some people do not have control over their own weight.

I might offend some people with this, but I'm going to have to call BS on that one.  I am not saying it is easy, but I am saying that it is possible, and doing so demonstrates to others that you work hard.  There have been countless people who have turned their lives around despite becoming extremely overweight.  Not doing so is a mark of not being mentally tough enough to stick it out when things get hard.  I respect those who have been overweight but been able to turn their lives around because they were able to continuously work to better themselves even if it is challenging.

EDIT: I have seen a lot of people saying that ""discipline has different forms"" but I am saying that it does not.  It is the same root of doing things that you don't want to do because you know that it will be better for you in the long run.",0.0
62,t3_rtuknm,"CMV: Either all definitions of gender is valid, or none are, it just depends if you want to use it","If I defined Poppa Tarts as anything thats blue, then it's true that jeans are also Poppa Tarts. It's ridiculous, however, it is 'valid'.

Now, what does this have to do with gender? For simplicity sake, I will use two systems, a trans non inclusive system and a trans inclusive system. These are the most common stream of thought. (Not saying it's the only one) However, both sides are accusing each other of flaws that I agree they have.

If I said that a woman is anyone with a vagina, then it is perfectly valid to say that someone who claims to be a transwoman is not a woman. (I want to make a side note, in my opinion, if someone asks me to call them she/her or whatever pronoun, I will do so) However, this runs into the problem of that most people do not know what is in between people's legs. With technology, cosmetic surgery, makeup, etc, there is definitely (no) correlation between outer appearance and chromosome indication. However, people who talk about woman = person with vagina may be operating under a different system. We need to ask what their goal is. (I personally don't think it's all that useful to know if someone has a vagina or not, so yes, I find it funny when people get mad that transwomen call themselves women)

However, on the flip side, if you say transwomen are women because they say so, or because they feel so, that's all very will, but if that's the case then I see no problem with saying that someone who identifies as a helicopter is therefore, a helicopter. I am not saying this ironically. If you cannot define 'woman' than that word might as well go down the trash. And the definition should not be one that if the logical flow was followed but simply replaced with another concept would be found absurd.

For example, I could say, 'apples should be legal because some people like it'. The underlying logic is 'things that should be legal are things that someone likes. Which means 'drugs should be legal because some people like it'

Now for both sides, let's say we live in a world where there is 50 people who define women as person with vagina = woman, and the other 50 is 'anyone who says they are a woman'. Why would one be 'more valid than the other'. These are simply two groups that have their own definitions. And that's how I see words. If I define sugar as the chemical compound xyz then that is sugar. If we somehow defined sugar as a color, then how is that not valid? There are plenty of words that have changed entire meanings, so I honestly don't see the whole idea of 'you are incorrect, transwomen are/not women' debate. If Trump says transwomen are not women, then he is correct in his system. IF Obama says transwomen are women, he is correct in his system. If I say no one is a woman, I am correct. It just depends how popular it is. IF you say everyone is a woman, you are also correct. 

I want my view changed to either side, because it's frustrating to have 2 conflicting views in my head.

What might change my mind is:

1. Clear definition of woman/man/etc. 
2. The definitions is something that the other side cannot do. For example, if you come up with a definition, and I come up with a definition, we need to find a way for 'our' side to 'win'. 
3. Having a gender system/definition that is MORE functional than the 'other side', and one that is better defined than the 'other'.",0.0
63,t3_rtuc2l,CMV: Switching From Windows 10 to Linux Would be a Poor Choice for the Average Windows User,"I've been a Windows user ever since Windows 98, and I'm currently using Windows 10. Over the last few days, I've been researching switching to Linux to start something new.

In all my research I saw that Ubuntu and Linux Mint would be the best distros for beginners like me, so I flashed Mint onto a USB drive and tried it out. I was whelmed by the user interface of Cinnamon. Upon further research, I realized that I really liked KDE Plasma, but then I took a step back and thought, is this all really worth all the hassle of trying out distros and desktop experiences? Because as just an average Windows user, I can already do everything I want on Windows and *more* than on Linux.

* I can browse reddit on Windows and Linux equally. In fact, the internet browsing experience in general seems to be equal.
* I can use Spotify on both.
* I can use a office suite on both.
* I have my phone companion on both.
* I can game on Windows with *more* stability than on Linux. And I'm not even a big gamer; I game maybe 10 hours a week at most.
* I can access my hospital's EMR on Windows through Citrix receiver, and I may or may not be able to do that on Linux.

And when I look up Youtube videos on the subject, many of them clearly cater to a more techy group, with titles like ""Why Coding is Better on Linux."" Sure, but is using your system just as your daily productivity and entertainment machine better on Linux?

Windows seems to *just work* for the average user, as opposed to Linux, which seems to need certain tweaks here and there to get drivers to work nicely and apps and peripherals to function properly.

EDIT: For anyone who doesn't want to comb through all the excellent replies, the gist of reasons an average Windows user would want to switch to a Linux desktop environment include:

1. They have an underpowered machine or a laptop. Windows 10 can be a resource hog, but Linux distros sip energy and computing power in comparison
2. They care about security and privacy. Not so much in terms of viruses, since Windows 10 has Windows Defender. More in terms of all the data that's being sent back to Microsoft on your computer use habits.
3. They care about customizability. Each successive version of Windows has removed customizability of the interface, forces you to update and restart when it chooses to, and even makes changes to the taskbar and start menu (including *showing ads on an OS you paid for*) without asking your permission. Linux allows you to customize your experience to your heart's content., and it allows you to run a lean computing machine without any of the bloatware.

67,t3_rto5vm,CMV: Religion Is Not Part Of My Identity.,"I have heard people say that religion is part of the identity of religious people. But I don't think it is part of **mine** specifically. If it was, I wouldn't feel guilty and embarrassed for what I believe.

You see, I'm a Hindu convert. I converted age 13, in a family of 100% atheists. I try to meditate and perform puja (like a type of prayer) in my bedroom at my shrine with candles, incense, offerings, bells and chanting. I try to do yoga as often as possible and read the scriptures at least weekly. I wear prayer beads daily, but I keep them under my shirt and I wear bindi as well. I do a different prayer (not puja) when I wake up and I go to the temple on festivals. I think about Divinity/Goddess  in almost everything. but in the back of my head, I am so embarrassed and guilty about it.

Now, if my religion was part of my identity, then surely I would be more comfortable mentally with not being atheist? I used to deny I was theist for months when people asked me if I believed. If it was part of my identity then wouldn't I be more open about it?

Another thing that makes me think it's not part of my identity is that I don't get insulted by any criticisms of what I believe. I just think about it logically, or shrug it off. Now, I have been told by people IRL that the majority of people get offended if you criticise or insult their religion, because their religion is part of their identity and they feel an emotional connection to it. Since I don't get offended by the criticism, wouldn't it be logical to conclude then, that religion was not part of my identity?

Also, I want my view changed because I DO want to consider it part of my identity. I just don't yet because of the above reasons.

68,t3_rtnzla,CMV: DeFi has nothing to do with finance,"There's a lot of buzz going around about cryptocurrencies, blockchain, web3 and other such concepts. One concept is ""decentralised finance"" or ""DeFi"". Calling it ""decentralised finance"" suggests it is to finance what blogs were to traditional media – ie a way to allow more people to participate in finance/media. I don't really think that's the case though.

It might be helpful to define what I mean by finance first. At its core the function of finance is to allow people with spare savings to lend out/invest their savings and people who need money to borrow money. There's obviously different ways to structure (and price) these transactions depending if it's a collateralised loan, if you receive equity in a company, if the loan is very risky or a million other factors.

To be successful in the traditional system you need to know what you're doing or have someone else (banks, pension companies, ETFs, etc) who knows do it for you. There are people who combine different loans/investments into derivative financial products and these can be very complex, however the principle is fundamentally the same: savers loan out/invest their money and are paid back with interest from the economic activity their loan/investment facilitates. The interest/yield is what makes it attractive to invest/loan out money in the first place. Etc.

It's important to note that without the finance system there wouldn't be much economic activity. Most companies are funded with a bank loan or an equity investment, most people pay their house with a mortgage, people need to loan money to study, trade finance facilitates the movement of goods across borders, etc. The finance system facilitates all this.

Now with ""Defi"" the idea of yield works very differently. Mostly people seem to just be staking their coins to earn a return in the same coin they staked. With more coins in circulation, each coin would be worth less except if they can convince more people to buy the coins. Another way to get a return is to loan out coins on a platform like ethereum but these loans are collateralised with crypto and used to buy more crypto anyways.

The only reason we're talking about ""decentralised finance"" is that some people thought it would get more people to invest/trade/gamble if it appears similar to the regular financial system. As such words like ""yield"" or ""APR"" are being used to attract savers/investors but it obscures the fact that it underwrites no underlying economic activity and that the only way to get a dollar out of the system is for someone else to put a dollar into the system.

A better word for ""decentralised finance"" would probably be ""counterfeit finance"" as it more aptly conveys that it's all smoke and no fire.

70,t3_rtlo9m,CMV: Aznidentity is just as bad as the alt right,"Maybe they're less widespread but they are just as toxic and bigoted. It's funny how i keep hearing about conservatives being alt right while aznidentity is far more similar to actual Neo Nazis than regular conservatives.
Aznidentity is a subreddit that claims to be a Pro Asian subreddit fighting against anti asian racism but they also hate on Asian women who date outside their race. Some of them use terms like ""pinkoid"" which gives me insane alt right vibes. They also hate half Asians with non Asian dads especially if it's white dad, asian mom (like me).
*I do not know much about the alt/far right. I’ve only heard a tiny bit about what they actually said.* 

Both aznidentity and the alt right reinforce harmful gatekeep-y beliefs. Sometimes gatekeeping is needed (like for people faking their gender identity for oppression points) but this isn’t one of the situations that need it. Aznidentity’s gatekeeping is misogynistic because they are excluding any asian women in interacial relationships only because her partner isn't Asian and she's therefore perpetuating colonization. 

***Unfair gatekeeping*** 

Paget Kagy, a woman literally openly called out toxic WMAF and self hate, was bashed and called an uncle tom just for having a white husband. Just disgusting. I'd be insane to pretend that that isn't misogyny. 

The gatekeeping that the AZNIDENTITY cult is doing to pro-Asian Asian women like Eliza Romero or Paget Kagy who happen to be in an interacial relationship is equivalent to the far-right wing’s gatekeeping of gay &amp; transgender conservatives/Republicans just for being LGBT. (Like how the far-right is against transgender people like Caitlyn Jenner or Blaire White being included in the Republican party)  
For instance, in this article, a [gay republican gets bashed by an alt right woman named Lauren Witzke for supporting LGBT](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/03/ric-grenell-shared-trans-womans-cpac-experience-conservatives-blasting-since/). 

***Bigotry*** 

Alt right MGTOWs/incels try to smear black/brown people for their pro-white agenda. Now, I am a right-leaning centrist myself who tends to agree more with conservatives than liberals.
The difference between the conservatives and the far right, the regular conservatives are critical of critical race theory (I myself am also critical of it) but they don’t believe black people are inferior to white people while the alt-right openly campaigns for white pride and believes in “the inferiority of non-whites” (in their words) 

And aznidentity tries to find news WMAF and WMAF hapas murders, crimes, ect, for the sake of their anti-WMAF agenda and openly expresses their racism against WMAF hapas and Asian women with non-Asian men the same way the alt right claims that black and brown people are a danger to American society.",5.0

73,t3_rtk4nw,CMV: artificial wombs will become necessary for humanity’s survival in the future,"The “fertility gap” in developed nations is well documented at this point. Countries with improving standards of living, particularly for women, have less children than poorer ones. 

One of the most recent examples is in India, which was previously known for its high population growth but has fallen off a cliff in that metric due to their rapidly improving economic conditions. 

There is not a single country in the world that has been able to simultaneously improve standards of living while also maintaining a sustainable fertility level. The Nordic countries invest heavily in child care, paid time off for new parents, etc. and yet their fertility levels have not improved at all. 

Fertility levels being low is an issue which can be temporary mitigated via immigration but this obviously only works so long as there are other countries with high fertility. Eventually, such countries will not exist anymore as we are seeing play out. 

This is an existential risk to humanity. The incentives to have children will continue to diminish as adults continue to be too burdened by their elderly parents/relatives to raise children of their own. This has negative economic implications as well, further hurting the incentive to have children. Our current path leads to irreversible population decline. 

There are several solutions to this, but most are highly unethical and will ultimately be rejected (mandatory child rearing) or unsustainable (life extension technology, which is mostly just sci-fi tech at this point and literally just delays the inevitable if people still aren’t having kids). 

Artificial wombs are the only realistic way to reverse population decline. It completely removes reliance on humans to procreate naturally.

74,t3_rtjes6,CMV: there should be no problem with neo pronouns there valid and people just don't understand,So for people who don't know a neopronoun is a pronoun that isn't exactly considered as one for example xe/xer/xers/xerself it's not in the English language but some people use it as xer prefferd pronouns. I understand why some are against it but just honestly why?? My first point is that it doesn't harm you to use these pronouns just say it honestly it doesn't harm you. My next point is people's general lack of understanding for why they exist in the first place. They were actually made for Neuro divergent people who have a hard time defining the way they feel. You can actually do research on this but sometimes people have a hard time linking themselves with certain gender identities and thus take things they like. This is also were xenogenders came from. In fact some people say disrespecting these things are abliest but I don't agree I just think it's stupid that people don't respect them. And keep in mind I myself am both trans and neurodivergent so I can speak on this.,0.0
75,t3_rtj1jh,CMV: Trans men and cis women should be just ‘women’ (or a new term referring to sex only) and vice versa,"There shouldn’t be a need for gender to be such a predominant part of society that it’s part of identification, legal documents, sport, etc.

I don’t care if you want to change your genitalia or have dysphoria or just don’t feel like you fit in with the gender you were assigned at birth. Be whatever gender you want, use whatever labels you feel comfortable with, and just live your life the way you want to. However, the (for some people uncomfortable) truth is that **you cannot change your sex**.

I believe one’s biological sex is important as the basis of things like medical information or for sport (to some extent, I know it’s very complicated with testosterone levels etc. but that’s out of scope here), so why don’t we use this for legal documents? This would save trans and non-binary people so much hassle, as well as keeping this technical information purely objective (of course each individual has their own experience and perceptions of what gender they are, and because gender is a spectrum it’s much harder to classify than sex).

So why has the words ‘male’, ‘female’, ‘man’, and ‘woman’ been overloaded to represent gender as well as sex? Given how relatively irrelevant gender is, why do words referring to gender exist whereas words referring to solely sex do not? This is also confusing as dictionaries such as Oxford (the one Google uses) still predominantly define these words, in terms of sex, yet culture says otherwise. These words also give TERFs the argument that a woman, by definition, is an ‘adult human female’, where female refers to ‘the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes’, so therefore a trans man is a woman.

Quite frankly, I don’t really care about what gender anyone is, and I don’t really care about sex either (unless e.g. I’m talking about periods in which case I usually wouldn’t want to be talking to a biological male about).

I think this conflation of sex and gender in the vocabulary we use to describe people is very confusing and that we should either

- go back to using ‘male’, ‘woman’, etc. to only refer to sex (basically impossible now)
- create new words that refer just to sex

79,t3_rt2go6,CMV: The Philosophy That Nothing Is Ugly Cartoon Examples,"There is this common philosophy that feels like a recent zeitgeist with the internet that could be summarized as 'nothing is ugly' and I don't understand it in the slightest I was hoping someone on this subreddit could explain it to me.

The easiest way to describe it is using the examples from cartoons that go back to Ren&amp;Stimpy and include Rick&amp;Morty and Bobs Burgers and that ever present Pepe the frog face.

Just typed that phrase into google and pulled up this John Constable Quote:
	
&gt;There is nothing ugly; I never saw an ugly thing in my life: for let the form of an object be what it may, — light, shade, and perspective will always make it beautiful.

It doesn't make any sense to me. The artists who made these cartoons easily could've made it not ugly. They went out of their way to make it ugly. It was a conscious choice to depict their art in a certain way and that seems to be the main selling point on why it's popular.

Y'all should be able to explain because this is the internet and our most beloved hero is Pepe the urinal frog. In case you don't know where the meme came from he is standing at a urinal with his pants around his ankles saying how it ""feels good man.""

It's baffling to me how or why anyone would ever choose to represent themselves with that let alone a majority of us. These aren't just trolls it feels like it's the majority of content creators and the fans who love them that are into this philosophy of promoting ugliness.

Is it a process of desensitization, in their minds? It's having the opposite effect on me.

Is this part of the no body shaming philosophy? Desensitize the world to ugly through cartoons? It's unfathomable to me what goes on in y'all's heads when you post a Pepe. I could certainly  love someone who is ugly but it's a double challenge if they're constantly saying and posting ugly things, and a triple challenge if they're proud of the ugly.

'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder' is a fine meme but the obvious reality is that symmetry is the #1 determination and bulging eyeballs with thin protruding lips and green skin, noodle like arms and nearly every other characteristic of this animation style is intentionally attacking the fundamentals of pop-beauty.

It is generally agreed on what the standards of beauty are and in the natural human world I think it is somewhat universally against what is depicted here. The most alien idea of beauty i can think of are extended necks and body mods (tats, piercings) but that is so much more relatable than...what do we call this?

What is the name of this style of animation?

South Park and Simpsons and Family Guy and all anime have a cute style. What do the fans of this other very particular style want it to be called?

Doesn't it deserve conscious recognition?

While it seems to me that we have universal beauty standards that have seen tall men and women with just the right hip to waist ratio is this agenda trying to rewrite all of that? Will the children of today grow up with completely alien beauty standards? Is it just too late for me?

While I feel like I'm just asking I have been accused of being the one saying and doing the ugly but all those artists would have to do is use a cute style. All you would have to do as a user is not post Pepe memes and not try to tell everyone you identify with the urinal frog. It seems like the ones doing the ugly thing are the fans and the artists; I'm being sincere I don't understand how anyone can relate to this.

It's 2021 and I feel like we're going backwards into cave glyphs art quality. Sorry if you feel cartoons are a shallow approach to the topic but I chose it because it's undeniably present while still representing only the tip of the iceberg.

Do the proponents feel like they're changing beauty standards when they're really just making NFTs with those basic cartoons more attractive?",0.0

81,t3_rt0p2v,"CMV: The shift from ""Art"" to ""Content Creation"" is degrading the artistic quality of creative works, and will continue to for the foreseeable future (Fresh topic)","Hey all, this one is mostly for fun, but I do think a lot about how the internet and content consumption has an effect on creatives around the world. Definitely open to changing my view and also hearing different perspectives.

In recent decades, social media, YouTube and other internet platforms have become the main places many people go to consume media and spend their free time. This obviously has had a huge impact on creatives, and we see a huge number of aspiring ""Content Creators"" and less aspiring ""Artists."" In my argument, I'm using Artist as a blanket statement to include anyone who makes creative works. Musicians, authors, poets, visual artists, filmmakers, etc.

***Artistic quality*** is something that is obviously subjective and up for debate, but I think many kinds of content are blatantly non-artistic, and it would be hard to argue that they are. Examples: Let's Play Youtube channels, reaction channels, Instagram and Snapchat influencers, many many subreddits, the vast majority of TikTok videos, many podcasts, etc. While I am open to debating what is of artistic value, I would say works that qualify as artistic and having lasting quality have some qualifications:

\- The act of creating, and the work itself is emotionally expressive for the creator. It also is typically seen as an artistic, self-expressive act by the creator.

\- The work provokes an emotional, meaningful, or thought provoking response in those engaging with it.

\- It has a lasting cultural effect or meaningful impact on society.

\- It is, well... creating something that wasn't there before! Someone making ***anything*** that expresses their inner world, to me, is inherently more artistic than a video of you doing squats at the gym.

It's obvious to see that these platforms function in an inherently different way than all other creative or artistic platforms in human history, and thus effect the artistic works made for the platforms. All social media websites are driven on user engagement, with the algorithms that drive these websites solely focused on ***keeping users on their platform as long as possible.*** This by itself is going to change the nature of the media made for these platforms - users are no longer rewarded for creating works that have higher ***quality,*** or have a thought provoking or lasting effect on society, they are only rewarded for creating works that are immediately eye catching, or keep users engaged for this exact moment, only to be forgotten about seconds later quite often. Obviously this feedback loop will lead to people who shape their lives around creating content for these platforms, and will make works that lead to user engagement. 

Does this change in mentality, the change to a ""Content Creator"" lead to less artistically valuable works being made on the whole? I think, in general, it does. Many platforms incentivize creators to constantly be pushing out new content, and I think this is antithetical to the quiet contemplation many artistic works require. I think many people who might have opted to be an author before YouTube became huge might choose now to make a film analysis channel, or something similar, due to the instant feedback and ability to reach more people, as opposed to spending months or years doing research and writing a novel alone. There are more people opting into a less artistic platform, and making less quality creations as a result. There is also much less of a focus on originality and/or artistry, and more of a focus on entertainment

Things to address about my argument and things that will change my view:

\- I hope this isn't coming off as pretentious - I don't think these platforms are bad for ***society*** or anything like that, they are just bad for ***artistic creation!***

\- If you can prove that on the whole, there are more quality creative works being made now than there were previously. I mean heck, maybe only 3% of all YouTube channels are actually of artistic quality, but maybe that's more than there used to be during the hayday of Television, Radio and film. (Please link your artistically pleasing sources here!)

\- If you can change my mind on what criteria is important when determining artistic value - I'm open to having my view changed on this, have fun with it!

\- If you can show me other platforms or other avenues that creators are disseminating their original artistic works, and are incentivized on originality. Bandcamp is a good example.

\- If you can argue that in the future, it won't always be this way, and that while at the moment this is the effect that algorithms are having on content creation, that for some reason it will actually have a ***positive*** impact on artistic value, eventually.",317.0
82,t3_rszo6b,CMV: The lack of a Battle Royale mode for both Halo and Battlefield killed either games chances at maintaining long term relevance in the shooter space.,"Just using Twitch to try and distil this down to a bit of a fact based conversation. 

Right now, for instance, here's the top shooter / fps games on Twitch based on viewership: 

- Escape from Tarkov: 300k 
- Valorant: 80k 
- Fortnite: 70k 
- Apex: 50k 
- Warzone: 50k 
- CS: 30k
- Super People: 17k 
- Halo: 5k
- Vanguard: 4k
- Battlefield: 2.5k

Now, some caveats out of the way, I do think a lot of this can be dictated in some cases by just a big streamer playing the game as that alone can boost these numbers. But as an FPS fan I have been following this for a while, and other then maybe the big boost Tarkov is experiencing right now, the beta being out for Super People, and Warzone not being as big as it used to since the new map, a lot of this is fairly consistent. 

I think whether it's based on a lack of foresight by the developers, or a stuck in the mud approach by the developers refusing to it on some principal.. I think both games missed a massive opportunity to get themselves established in a more modern gaming space. 

Where certain games like Valorant are maybe playing in an older ""search and destroy"" style, the game does innovate on the game mode and a lot of it's users I would say maybe aren't even CS:GO fans. Most people I know who play Valorant didn't even play FPS games before it, but liked the mode and I think it innovated very well to establish itself. 

Fortnite is another case of innovating on the traditional multiplayer style, and I think Warzone latched onto that for itself and saw the benefits, Halo and Battlefield didn't seem to adapt well enough and are now kind of experiencing what was predicted, that they wouldn't be relevant. 

I think BR in general, but even SnD itself like with Valorant, are definately game styles that lend itself to the streamer experience more as they are games that are a lot easier to watch, understand what's happening, and the flow of the game lends itself well to being watched by people. MP in general can be a lot more chaotic. I'm not necessarily using this to say that people don't plat multiplayer, but I am saying that I do believe streamers in general do have a huge influence on gaming culture and a lot of times things like this can be cyclical, where the streamers play games that everyone's playing, but they also get people to keep playing these games. And I don't think games like Halo are getting that boost right now because traditional MP is a bit outdated, or at least the wins don't mean as much so there's less of an incentive to play it as often as you would a BR where you're essentially chasing the win.

edit: 

Since it's been mentioned a few times already, sicne people don't like that Twitch is my only source. I'm using activeplayer.io for the below stats, but I'm not the biggest fan of that site and don't entirely trust their stats. BUT, for the sake of the discussion a few people now have used it so I will add the stats below: 

- Fortnite: 1 million
- Apex: 830k
- Warzone: 150k
- Halo: 40k 

Which feels to reinforce my point, even if Twitch isn't the best indicator of player base, it does seem to correlated to it well.

----------------

And Steam stats to reinforce my point (even though i do acknowledge a lot of COD / Halo players are on console, so this also isn't perfect): 

- Halo Infinite: 38,480 active players
- Apex: 92,059 active players",0.0
83,t3_rsxraw,CMV: Jared Leto was a better joker,"So I've been thinking for a while now that Heath Ledger being the best Joker is an exaggerated take. I would even argue that the Joker from Joker is a better Joker but that depends on what you want from the joker. I think that his legacy and the fact that he died is what convinces people that he's this great joker that he is not. For the most part he simply played the role he was assigned and didn't do a brilliant job at it. That said, I do love his role I just don't think he was the best and I don't think he gave us an insight into the lunacy of the joker.

I think Jared Leto provided us with a better aesthetic for what the joker should be and he looks like an actual psychopath. The way he emulated the mood of the joker and his psychopathy was genius and I think his role more so justified the reason why Harley Quinn was so in love with him. His role explains the appeal. He provided us with a sexy psychopath whos easy to fall in love with, Heath ledgers joker was not like this and I found he was more grimey than sexy. But then this is all down to what we think the joker should be and what role he plays. 

I like the juxtaposition of Letos Joker and I would've preferred to see someone similar in Dark Knight. I think it offers a more balanced rivalry between the Joker and Batman. In Dark Knight I was often uncomfortable with how grimey he was and how he didn't really fit into the serious aesthetic. Maybe if they made his role more murderous and evil and mysterious it would've been a better fit. The Joker from the Joker film offered a good insight into the personality of the Joker, but it still wasn't great. It didn't offer any reason as to why he is the sick mastermind that he is, more so just the reason why he is crazy. And I cannot imagine anyone falling in love with that guy, he's just a crazy dude. Ultimately I think they failed to portray the full image behind joker and I think they made him seem a bit pathetic.

Overall I think this is between Ledger and Leto. I used to think that Ledger was the guy, but after suicide squad came out, its been on my mind and its been bothering me. This is a really controversial take and many many people disagree with me, but I'm open to hearing other opinions because I can definitely see why Ledger is the GOAT, but when we consider what we want from the joker and the persona he is meant to portray, is Leto the one?

The fact that the ESH labels avoids the use of the world ""asshole"" is incongruent, and there is not a good reason why they suddenly switch.

Why would any parent be upset about it. A child (talking anything older than 12 years+ here) has their own decisions to make, especially about religion/faith/philosophy. Parents are not their child, so they shouldn't be upset if they come to a different conclusion to them.

Older children and teens should be able to form their own opinions, especially about philosophy. So what? Your child made a philosophical decision you disagree with.

91,t3_rsvn2s,CMV: We need to stop telling people that salt is bad for them (unless they have dangerously high blood pressure).,"Last night I roasted some carrots -- just olive oil and salt, and I couldn't believe how good they were. It occurred to me that if I had had those carrots when I was a child I probably would have happily eaten them. But I didn't get those, I got bland under seasoned vegetables because the understanding of the day was that salt was terrible for you and should be avoided at all costs. So as a result I hated vegetables well into my 20's, and ate much poorer than I would have otherwise. A little bit of salt would have changed my life for the better.

It's been years since I've done any research on this, so if someone offers up compelling new research then I'd be open to changing my opinion. But when I did read some of the studies I found that the only bad thing salt does is slightly raise your blood pressure. Otherwise it has a lot of benefits. It's an essential electrolyte, important for hydration and proper muscle and nervous system functioning. It also makes healthy food more palatable, and in the US it's a primary source for Iodine.

It's been pointed out that exercising reduces your blood pressure more than salt raises it, and is more universally applicable. For instance, in my 20's I had low blood pressure, which comes with its own issues, and I didn't start to feel better until I actually added more salt to my diet. Just because a lot of people have high blood pressure isn't a good reason to have a blanket directive to avoid salt when it's actually harmful for many people.

One of the arguments is that a lot of processed junk foods are high in salt, but I would argue that trying to eat bland unseasoned foods is one thing that drives people to indulge in junk food. I don't feel nearly the urge to eat a bag of potato chips if I've eaten a properly salted meal -- and that feels like my body just trying to tell me that it has some deficit!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I was expecting a variety of replies, but I wasn't expecting all of the stories that people have shared about how they or their loved ones have experienced medical issues related to a lack of salt. These cases are the minority but it's important that people know about them. Despite a cardiologist chiming in and people sharing how they were prescribed high salt diets by medical professionals to treat their issues, I'm still getting posts defending the blanket stance that salt should be limited for everyone. This just goes to show how deeply ingrained the messaging around salt is. 

It's not my view that excess sodium (like excess anything), is okay. Rather it's that different bodies have different needs in different circumstances, so the black and white message about salt is doing more harm than good. We should be saying that salt is bad if you have high blood pressure, but good if you have low blood pressure. It's bad if you're getting it from processed foods, but good if you've lost a lot of sweat from exercise. We should be able to trust people with a more nuanced message that includes the exceptions and not just assume that everyone is eating a big mac everyday. ",2489.0
92,t3_rsunas,CMV: The Solar Flare is the best technique in Dragon Ball,"A bit of a silly one for FTF, but hear me out.

So it occurred to me recently that many of the most memorable attacks and techniques throughout Dragon Ball didn't actually work, i.e. they didn't defeat their target. Most of the time, fights in Dragon Ball really are just a slugfest- the strongest character wins, and if the gulf in power is too big techniques don't really make a difference.

There are *some* attacks which do allow the user to punch above their weight, but they all seem to have serious drawbacks. Attacks like the Spirit Bomb or Piccolo's *Makankōsappō* can be charged up to provide more power than the user would typically be able to harness, but since they take so long to charge, they're really impractical and rely either on the opponent just standing there and letting them do their thing (which admittedly is oddly common in DB), or someone else holding them off until it's charged up. Then there's Krillin's *Kienzan* which can cut through targets much stronger than the attacker, but it's a running joke how it never actually manages to hit its target, so it seems like a wildly inconsistent choice.

Really, then, to qualify as a technique that's good in its own right rather than just reliant on the user's power or fortuitous circumstances, a technique has got to allow the user to consistently gain an advantage over even an opponent who's stronger than they are. And the technique that always seems to succeed in this regard is the Solar Flare. Unlike pretty much every other technique in DB, it works almost every time it's used, including against much stronger opponents- Goku against Great Ape Vegeta, Krillin against Dodoria, Krillin against Frieza, etc. Hell, Cell even managed to use it to blind Androids 16 and 18 who presumably don't even have humanoid eyes. It works against just about everybody, it seems easy to execute, and it doesn't sap very much of the user's energy, and it leaves the opponent vulnerable to further attacks.

This is a pretty light-hearted post, but I'm kinda intrigued to hear if anyone disagrees; I like Dragon Ball but it does all too often boil down to just a contest of who has the biggest power level, and the Solar Flare seems like the one reliable technique that actually transcends simply who is the strongest fighter.",6.0
93,t3_rsqgxv,CMV: School uniforms are creepy and unnecessary.,"I grew up in mainland europe where school uniforms are pretty much not a thing. In fact, for the first 12 years or so of my life I had never heard of school uniforms and the idea that children should be wearing uniforms in school never occurred to me. I first learned about school uniforms from anime but thought it was just another aspect of Japan's collectivist culture. Once I learned that outside of mainland europe and north america school uniforms were widespread it really wierded me out.

It might sound wierd to people who went to schools with uniforms that I find them creepy. But to best explain this feeling you can look at, for example, the pledge of allegiance that school children in the US do. When you see a large group of children drone a nationalistic oath with their hands on their chests and all staring at a flag, there's just something that feels wrong about it. I kind of get the same feeling when I see a large number of children all wearing the same uniform.

I have read plenty of arguments for school uniforms, but from the perspective of someone who has never worn one and who has never had problems from their absence they seem completely unnecessary.",0.0
94,t3_rsriw2,CMV: Simulated consciousness does not have moral weight,"# The Question

Let's say I have a computer running a simulation of a person, i.e., a computer program that can tell you how a person would respond to any given situation. This might be a simulation of a specific flesh-and-blood person or a generic ""person"" whose behaviour seems plausible to real humans. It might have a robot body that can move around, or a simple text interface, or any other kind of I/O.

Does the simulated person have moral significance? For example, if I simulate someone being tortured, have I done something evil? If I turn off the simulation, have I done something like murder?

The viewpoint that it does is prominent in science fiction, such as Westworld, Black Mirror, and the works of qntm (Sam Hughes). All those stories are great and I'm not arguing against the use of this position for pathos in fiction.

But as AI continues to advance, it behooves us to consider how we should treat such machines in real life, once they exist. I maintain that **the simulated person does not have moral significance**.

## A Note About Wording

I consider the question of moral significance to be equivalent to the question of ""having consciousness"" in the hard-problem-of-consciousness sense, but debates about whether machines *are* conscious tend to get derailed by different understandings of what the word ""conscious"" means.

Therefore, I have phrased this question in terms of ethics. But if I slip up and talk about ""assuming something is conscious"" later, pretend I said ""assuming something has moral weight"" instead.

(As a nice bonus, treating the question as an ethical rather than a metaphysical one makes it clearer why anyone should care about it.)

# The Argument That It Does

The most common argument that we *should* treat the machine as a moral person, as I understand it, goes like this:

We cannot directly perceive the consciousness of other humans, only ourselves. Nevertheless, we believe that other people are conscious, and we give that consciousness moral weight. Why?

We do this because other people behave similarly to us, and so we guess that they have similar mental functions, including consciousness. So, if we believe in and care about our own consciousness, we should also care about theirs, as it's probably similar in many ways, including whatever quality makes our own consciousness worth caring about.

Thus, if a machine could behave similarly to us, we would guess the same.

## Rebuttal

My issue with this argument is that my deduction about other humans is not based *only* on their behaviour. I know for a fact that other human beings have bodies and brains that are very similar to my own, and work on similar principles.

For example, even if I've never felt someone's pulse, I can assume they have one, because *I* have a pulse, and it plays such a critical role in my function that it seems very unlikely another human could be alive without one. But I would not assume the same of something I knew was a robot, even if it looked and behaved in a human-like way.

In the same way, I assume that whatever mysterious quality makes me ""conscious"" and gives my consciousness moral significance is also possessed by other humans. But I need not make the assumption about an object that I know works differently under the hood, even if its behaviour is identical.

# The Arguments That It Doesn't

For the record, I think the burden of proof in this debate is on the simulations-have-moral-weight camp, but debates about burdens of proof are lame. So I will now present two positive arguments as to why I *don't* think simulations have moral weight.

## First Argument: Humans Simulating Other Humans

The first argument is a simple *reductio ad absurdum*. In the real world, we already have machines capable of simulating humans: humans. That is, people are capable of simulating other people - a human being can tell you how another human being will behave. If the simulator knows the subject well, they can do this more or less flawlessly - there are multiple stories of people successfully impersonating other people, and even more of people ""impersonating"" people who don't exist at all (see: actors, writers, fraudsters, etc.).

In all these cases, the *simulating* person has moral weight for the same reason that people have moral weight in any context. But the *simulated* person does not have moral weight: if someone is pretending to be arachnophobic, it is not immoral to show them a picture of a spider. Even if they scream or burst into tears because they're doing a perfect imitation of an arachnophobe, the arachnophobe isn't real, they weren't really scared, and nothing of moral significance has happened.

So, if people simulated by other people don't have moral weight, why should people simulated by a machine?

## Second Argument: Simulations Are Indeterminate

This one is harder to explain, but in my opinion much more watertight, so bear with me. The core claim: there is no objective determination of whether a given process *is* a simulation, or what it's a simulation of. Not just no way of finding it out, but no objective fact-of-the-matter at all.

This is counterintuitive, I know. Let's take it from the top.

What is a simulation? We might say that a simulation is a kind of computation, but computations are abstract, and we want to talk about physical objects running physical processes. So we can say that Process/Object X is a simulation of Process/Object Y if X maps inputs to outputs in the same way that Y does. This is what we mean when we say the computer is ""running a simulation"" of a person: that it responds to things the same way a person would.

The problem with this definition is that it seems absurd to suggest that the ethical significance of the computer depends on its I/O setup. And indeed, most people in the simulations-have-ethical-weight camp agree that it doesn't. For example, if the simulation has only text I/O and the simulated person's behaviour is described in words, then it has just as much ethical weight as a simulation with a full android body.

To capture this, we can tweak the definition to say that X is a simulation of Y if X maps inputs to outputs in a way *analogous* to the way Y does. Thus, if you type in `set ambient_temperature 0C` that is analogous to the sensation of standing around in freezing weather; and when the computer responds `*shiver*` that is analogous to a person shivering.

But now we have a new problem: the meaning of English words (or whatever other I/O the computer uses) is in the mind of the beholder, not a property of the simulation itself. If someone chose to draw the analogy differently, they could conclude that the machine is simulating a completely different process.

For example, imagine a written language called ""Shilnge"" that *looks* similar to English - in fact, all the sentences in Shilnge happen to also be valid English sentences - but has completely different meaning. For example, all the English phrases that describe happy events mean something sad in Shilnge, and vice versa. Likewise, all the English descriptions of something a person might do or say when happy happen to describe the sorts of things sad people do in Shilnge.

(The simulated person speaks neither language; let's pretend they're a baby, or a human raised without human contact. Naturally, flesh-and-blood non-lingual people *do* have moral significance.)

So, is the simulation in English or in Shilnge?

I hope it's clear why the question is important: if the simulation is conscious, and it's in English, then when it outputs `*smile*` it's actually experiencing happiness, and giving it inputs that make it do that is morally good. Conversely, if it's in Shilnge, then when it says `*smile*` it's actually experiencing sadness, and giving it those inputs is morally bad.

And it's also clear that there's no objective answer to that question. The simulation isn't *in* a language; it simply maps particular sequences of ASCII characters to other sequences of ASCII characters, which the observer may interpret as one language or another, or not at all.

(The details of this thought experiment are contrived, but the argument works for any kind of I/O the machine might have. If, for example, the simulation is shown with complete audio and graphics, then the interpretation of those patterns of pixels and those sound waves is still in the eye of the beholder.)

Thus the simulations-have-ethical-weight position is attempting to put ethical weight on something that cannot be objectively determined, leading to contradictory results. Therefore it is incorrect.",7.0

96,t3_rso57f,CMV: (Cannabis) Dispensary employees should be required to have degrees in health or medical fields relevant to cannabis use.,"I used to work at a (recreational) dispensary. I also used to frequent dispensaries across my city — so much of this comes from both of those circumstances. This is also a US-specific post because I don’t know about the culture or laws regarding marijuana in other countries.

Often (when I worked at the dispensary), customers would come in with various medical questions (Will CBD help ease my anxiety? Can I use Purple Hindu Kush as a pain reliever? etc.) and we would answer to the best of our abilities. We didn’t assure anything and we reminded customers that effects could vary based on individual chemistry and anatomy…But regardless of our (very good) intentions, now I see our behavior as very problematic. None of us had medical degrees (and honestly, given that cannabis is not federally legal in the US, there is still very minimal official, non-anecdotal research on the individual and longterm effects of cannabis use). We would tell people to try this edible for their migraines, or that strain for their cramps — and sometimes it did help, but regardless selling someone a product using some semblance of health or medical advice as backing for that sale (when we didn't have the medical expertise to make said claim) is wrong (at least in my opinion).

Admittedly I’m torn on this. 

On the one hand, employees that work in the health and vitamin sections at grocery stores don’t usually have degrees in health or pharmacy studies, so why should employees at a dispensary(?)…but I also know that — while many Americans are developing a greater tolerance (no pun intended) for the federal legalization of cannabis, there still is a large stigma stacked against it. If a customer told a dispensary employee they wanted to ease a particular malady, and that employee recommended something that gave said customer an extremely negative reaction, THAT scenario could be used by anti-cannabis advocates as proof to delay or even reverse the progress we’ve made in legalization.

A big part of this is that I feel like many cannabis users treat marijuana as this “perfect cure-all.” Like I mentioned earlier, we really don’t have enough research on cannabis to determine that — but even if cannabis is shown to be broadly helpful (and to a large range of people across any number of demographics), there is still the very real truth that for some people, it will never be an option (just like how tomatoes are an excellent source of vitamins but that some people are allergic to them).

So, TLDR — Cannabis employees should be required to have degrees in relevant medical or health fields because:

A) They’re going to be asked medical questions by customers, and they should have a formal grasp of that which they’re speaking about.

B) It would help avoid the “Weed is perfect and everyone should use it” mindset by allowing employees to be truly educated on the pros and cons of cannabis and to share that with their customers. Implying or outright saying that cannabis can cure any number of issues based on anecdotal evidence is irresponsible.

C) It would avoid potential lawsuits or scandals, which could undo all the work we’ve done in changing the mindset around cannabis.",0.0

The response is “No. not only will we not do that, but we don’t even want you near our communities. Go figure it all out on your own. And Oh yeah, we still don’t like your race.”

So with absolutely nothing you try to start a society segregated from the rest of the country who has the land, money, and education. Finally 1970s come and segregation has ended. 

You say “finally, thank you. Now can you please help us. We need help with education, and some financial help. our community is struggling as we have been ostracized from society for going on 300+ years here.”

The response you get is “Jesus, first we free you , now you are no longer segregated, and you still want more? Figure it yourself.”

100,t3_rslo34,CMV: Fathers who teach their sons chess are exposing them to an Oedipal landscape.,"As we all know (rhetorically), Freud's Oedipal complex refers to a psychological desire of young men, that they replace their fathers to marry their mothers.

Chess represents the Oedipal battle in reverse with taking the other's queen and ""queening a pawn"" (mother-son), as well as the final goal, checkmating the opponent's king. Of course, it's also possible to knight the pawn, to bishop or rook it, but queening is most common.

Now it's not necessarily my contention that fathers do so deliberately.  They can sublimate that knowledge as much as anyone.

101,t3_rsl1a5,CMV: The Senate is pointless in 2021 and should be abolished,"My post is pretty self explanatory. The US Senate was originally established to give states representation, the thinking was that it would prevent the house (elected by the people) from going overboard. However I believe that this whole line of thinking was ill conceived to begin with as the Supreme Court and President can both keep Congress in check nowadays.

The main problem I have with the Senate is that it gives an ABSURD amount of power to rural voters to the expense of urban voters. Wyoming with 578,000 people, and California with 39.5 million people each get the exact same amount of representation in the Senate. You could counter that really the US is really a Republic not a true democracy so it doesn't matter, it is ture that the US is a Republic, but it's supposed to be a *Democratic* Republic. And having voters in 1 state have almost 70 times the voting power of voters in another state is very undemocratic.

People in rural areas and small states have their state governments to air their local issues and concerns, that's the point of a Federal system. However Congress represent the people, and if 80% of the people are in urban areas then they should have 80% of the representation. That means California should have more influence then Wyoming in Congress, which the Senate prevents.

I'm also not convinced that states need their own representation in Congress either. States aren't people, and they have their house districts to represent their citizens, I disagree with the Founders that states are so special they need a whole half of Congress on top of all their other powers and autonomy.

Overall, I just don't see the point of the Senate in 2021. It gives rural voters an absurd amount of power relative to their small population and is largely predicated off the false idea that without the Senate the House would go totally off the rails. I think it should be abolished and it's powers given to the House, which would remain otherwise unchanged. Please CMV!",0.0

105,t3_rsfcfk,"CMV: The Price System in all it's forms ""capitalism, socialism, fascism, communism"" is obsolete and destructive.","Throughout human civilization societies have operated around what is known as the ""Price System"". Any form of money or debt represented by tokens. Socialism, Communism, Capitalism are all various forms of price systems. They are just different means of managing the same underlying system (i.e. free price system vs fixed price system)

Mathematically the price system can be expressed with a growth function. Resources can also be modeled in terms of consumption in the same way. If you look through the world with an objective scientific lens then you see low entropy resources being used at an exponential rate in a finite close system called earth. I hope I don't have to explain why this is a problem in the long run when entropy is rapidly increased nor how it's related to issues of climate change, resource wars, peak oil, etc. these are all predictable issues modeled by sound science. The price system - by it's very nature - also has boom's and busts which is why politicians create systems and manage wars that secure resources for growth without regards to the long term support of ecology and sustainability. The political system only cares about staying in control and maintaining price system operations.

What I don't understand in my 10 years of supporting technocracy and their economic proposal of energy accounting is the lack of understanding people have regarding the price system. Everyone talks about capitalism and it's flaws but they never talk about what is the source problem and why it's an obsolete social construct in our high technological society. Peoples solutions are usually socialism or regulated capitalism which is just another price system. Is there some fundamental flaw that I am not understanding? Is the price system something we must deal with?

I ask these questions in the hopes of others changing my view because I feel like I might be missing something very important. I have arguments with liberals, conservatives, socialists, etc. about their proposals because it's all just slightly different versions of the same thing. This is also my reasoning/understanding as to why nothing changes. We are politically switching back and forth every couple decades without ever addressing the elephant in the room - the price system and it's demand for growth. However, I'm open to the idea if the problem is really something else I haven't considered.

**What is energy accounting?**  
Energy accounting is a method of distributing resources as proposed by Technocrats. The output of any products or services requires resources which can be measured in terms of energy it took to transform raw materials into productive and consumable resources. Technocracy proposes to account for that energy on the products and services themselves so the ""total amount of consumable things"" can be calculated and distributed equitably across the population. Engineering and technology can then be applied to make products and services better and more efficient.

107,t3_rsduz7,"CMV: There are gender imbalances the world mostly refuses to change, and there can't be true gender equality until they're addressed","Even in a non-worldwide sense, this still applies IMO. Let's just use America or the West in general, since that's where I'm from and have spent all my life.

This is most likely going to be a bit divisive, so **please keep in mind that I'm not trying to attack either gender or be antagonistic.** I'm just stating my opinion based on my experiences and what I see on a regular basis.

There are certain societal differences between each gender and what is normalized for men and women respectively. Basically I'm going to outline gender roles that people don't seem to care very much about, but that are still at least a bit sexist IMO and contribute to the imbalance between the genders:

* The tradition of a woman taking her husband's last name. This implies a clear power dynamic where the woman ""gives herself"" to the man. It also has an undeniably sexist origin; a woman took her husband's last name because she was barely a step up from being his property. She couldn't make legal, financial, or employment decisions without his consent. She was his, but not vice versa.

* Women's attire. This is going to be a controversial one, so bear with me and remember I'm not trying to offend anyone or be crass. That said... women's clothing in general is more sexualized than men's. By far. Women's clothing exposes and/or displays their bodies way more than men, either by showing more skin or being very very tight, thus emphasizing curves, breasts, butt, etc. I can't think of any reason why it would be normalized for women to show off their bodies more than men, besides the idea that part of a woman's role is to look good (or at least look seductive) for men, but not vice versa.

* Dating. There are some very, IMO, archaic traditions in dating regarding the roles of each gender. Men are sometimes (if not often) expected to make the first move, to plan dates, to pay for dates (and honestly, sometimes just to pay for everything), to propose, etc.

There's no reason why dating can't be more 50/50, but tons of women expect what I described above (not all, I know), and there's really been no major call to action for this or any of the above to change, from either gender.

There are no worldwide-trending hashtags, no \#MyLastName or anything like that. In a world where gender equality is seemingly becoming more and more of a rallying cry for people, these things appear to be ignored, and IMO, without addressing them, there can't be true gender equality.",4.0

109,t3_rsar2n,CMV: The collection of images that we have about the object are the whole of an object,"  

Hume argues that we have two mental faculties associated with this thinking subject. One retains information and is called memory. Another combines information and is called the imagination. Both get their information from experience. Hume’s argument for as to why they get it from experience is that a disabled person is unable to form himself a sensory experience of objects in the way a regular person would. A blind person would, for instance, not be able to experience color. 

It is however clear that Hume did not conceive on the nature of the disabled person in the correct manner, because the disabled person can conceive of objects outside of his sensory domain. When a singer sings on a resonance frequency and breaks a glass as a result the deaf man is more than capable of saying that something outside of his sensory experience has broken the glass. The deaf man has thus an experience of sound, even if it can’t sense that the sound was a cause. Instead of saying that our experience shapes our imagination we thus have to conclude that our imagination shapes our experience. When we thus perceive the world we can thus assume that our thinking subject warps that perception to suit its own particular needs. 

Now that we have established that the imagination isn’t limited to just our experience one could genuinely start to ask what it actually does. Let us turn back to the man who has just experienced the breaking of the glass. Let us suppose now that he thinks that a ghost was responsible for breaking that glass. We see that he is connecting an experience to an imaginary figure. That imaginary figure represents in this case an explanation as to why the glass broke. Furthermore we could argue that this ghost explains something outside of his normal experience. If the glass just stood there the man wouldn’t need to argue that a ghost broke it. There is thus something we could call a normative experience and a break from that experience. The question then becomes what that normative experience is and how that break establishes itself. 

Heidegger’s *Being and Time* does talk about normative experiences as being the everydayness of being. For him Dasein, as the being who is able to question what being is, should be at the center of the question of being. Dasein should be able to see itself by itself. However, as we have already established, the breaking of the glass remains an event outside of the horizon of Dasein. None of Dasein’s modes of being can properly capture this event. Heidegger was thus following the wrong trajectory when he said that no outside force should be used to describe being. We should establish that outside forces frequently intrude Dasein as such. 

Now we might be inclined to believe that these outside forces can be perfectly described, but there is just one problem with this idea. That is that there are multiple descriptions possible of that reality that all describe it in one aspect, but ignore other views. Let us take the philosophy of Meillassoux as an example. He describes reality as necessarily contingent and therefore non-contradictory. IT engineers might be aware that digital computers are non-contradictory. They contain the data of 0 or 1, but not both at the same time. Furthermore they are necessarily contingent. They can contain any collection of 0s and 1s and computers have to, by necessity, contain such a collection. Then he stands baffled as to why people use paraconsistent logic, which acts indeed as an intruder to his logical system, and reacts by stating that this logic does not deal with real contradictions as it is only used by computers to make sensible conclusions on opposite diagnoses. He fails to see that if one can implement a system of paraconsistent logic in a digital computer and it can lead to valid interpretations, the logic of his own universe should likewise be able to generate paraconsistent results that could be interpreted as such. Even thus if we assume the world to be non-contradictory it can be valid to interpret it as contradictory in certain specific situations, which is to say that we should assume that we can see it as contradictory or non-contradictory depending on the situation. We thus maintain that it is not the event as such that can be comprehended, but merely that one gets a perspective on the event. 

A perspective gets expressed by language. From a simple behaviorist perspective language itself is merely a product of memory. It is because we remember that a word was used for a particular thing at a particular time that we can remember its meaning. Chomsky famously disagreed. He argued that language was also algorithmically constructed because there is too little information that we can capture for a correct usage of merely data from memory to do this. However, Chomsky disregarded that we do indeed have the faculty of imagination to help us with the creation of language. When we hear a word in a certain context our memory stores the experience, but our imagination interprets that experience and modifies it in such a manner that it becomes usable as a word for further use. 

Language itself can thus be described with the metaphor of a “shared image”. Our imagination made an image of a certain word. When we thus communicate with others we transform the image into a language, which then gets captured and transformed back into an image that the user can interpret. While we are thus not capable of asserting facts about the world, we are at all times aware of which images are used to comprehend the world. 

From that we can assert our maxim: Consider what images there exists of an object. The collection of images that we have about the object are the whole object. 

To give an example we can use the diamond. For the chemist a diamond is the composition of carbon molecules. For the sociologist a diamond is an example of a status symbol. We can’t say that when we analyze the diamond that either image of the diamond doesn’t represent the diamond in question for us. When we thus ask ourselves the question of what a diamond is we don’t have to look for a unique definition of what the diamond is, since all definitions of what a diamond is will be lacking in some capacity because there is no way that one perspective can encompass all the perspectives we can take on us when we analyze the object.",0.0
110,t3_rsac6z,CMV: I don’t think China will be a bigger threat to the U.S than Soviet Union was,"China is being portrayed by the media as a big rival to the U.S in terms of economical, military and political power, some people (mostly pro-CCP folks) even boldly predict that China will end U.S hegemony and become the leading superpower in a near future. While the rise of China recent years is impressive and undeniable, it’s hilariously delusional to claim that they will somehow overtake the U.S in this century, especially if we compare them to the former U.S rival, USSR (who got beaten by the U.S without a bullet and never surpassed the U.S during the whole nation’s existence). 

Firstly, China doesn’t have such a big global influence as USSR used to, and seems like they won’t reach that extent of influence in the near future. Remember when the whole world was divided into two sides: Capitalist (led by the U.S) and communist (led by USSR)? Yes, USSR did literally lead HALF of the world in the cold war against big bad Murica. Some of their allies could create serious territorial threats to the U.S, look at the Cuban Crisis. What about China? They are surrounded by U.S allies, neighbors hate them, Russia don’t trust them, they have nearly no actual friend besides Pakistan and fucking North Korea!! Comparing with the great U.S alliance system around the world which consists of great powers like Japan, Israel, SK and NATO, it’s completely a joke. 

Secondly, China don’t have an attractive ideology to spread it and help strengthen their soft power around the world, something like USSR’s communism or American democracy. Confucianism ??? Please, its influence in other East Asia countries like Japan and SK is declining and still even somehow bigger than in China itself!!! Remember the days when Soviet Union (both secretly and publicly) supported a bunch of communist revolutions in Africa and Asia, making the West have to be seriously terrified of a “Red Wave”? Is China nowadays able to do the same? Hell no.

Thirdly, USSR, even during the 80s, was still a much stronger nation than nowadays China. The biggest country in the world, controlled half of Europe, had the biggest army and nuclear weapon stockpile, (arguably) beat the US in the Space Race. A truly superpower. Nowadays China is surely nowhere near as powerful as them. Economically, China is a much poorer nation, remember Soviet’s GDP per capita was behind the West at that time but still higher than every other part of the world, you can’t say the same for 21st century China (ranked below 70th in the GDP per capita list, 2020 figure). In terms of military power, they are also ranked behind Russia and USA, and their army never participated in a big war since... 70 years ago???

In conclusion, in my opinion, China is no doubt the biggest rival of the U.S at this moment, and yes the “freedom world” surely have reason to be concerned about them. But their power is being ridiculously overestimated, considering a much stronger nation than them got ass kicked by the U.S without any direct military conflict, i don’t think they have the potential to overtake the U.S current position in 21st century (even if that’s their aim ).

111,t3_rs9uqa,"CMV: In Zombie fiction where everybody is 'already infected' or automatically zombifies when they die, bites from zombies shouldn't be a 100% guaranteed death sentence","This kind of a trivial topic compared to some of the other stuff posted in here, but this has kinda been bugging me. This mostly applies to The Walking Dead but could also work for other zombie series/media that doesn't have a virus or disease that can *only* be spread via bites or contact with infected bodily fluids.

But here it goes, if everyone is already infected with the zombie infection but only zombify upon death if their brains aren't destroyed, then a zombie bite couldn't be the sole cause of zombification, but rather sepsis/bacterial infection that leads to death and subsequent zombification (I don't know if that's the right terminology). So it could be inferred that if the bite victim was given antibiotics or antivirals then they could survive the bite and not die and zombify.

The zombie bite = guaranteed death trope has kinda been overdone and not really explored well outside of 'amputate bitten limb' which  doesn't make much sense because wouldn't the infection have already circulated through the body by the time amputation has performed, maybe someone with a medical background can clarify this?

2. If they have internet, why can’t they look up how to save money? That could help them.

College isn’t the only option. And yes, many poor people have kids to take care of but many poor people could delay having kids.

115,t3_rs5dfn,CMV: If you can't build an IKEA shelf you should get your head checked.,"Sorry for the somewhat clickbaity title, but that's literally what I mean. 

There's a lot of bitching on the internets about how hard it is to build ikea furniture [1,2,3,4,5]. I've just recently moved houses and had to set up about 20 various pieces (yeah europoor). Every time I help my family or a friend build their thing and they stare at the completely unambiguous manual page, holding two parts in their hands and go ""waht do"" I'm just burning up inside.   

So here's my point: **if you can't build your ikea chair in an hour, you need to get a mental check-up for development disorders**. There's something deeply wrong with your brain. Our ancestors evolved to use three-dimensional thinking to make tools, and you would've been naturally selected out of the world of the living a long time ago.

But who knows? Maybe I'm just missing some very obvious bit here. CMV.

Caveat emptor: 
* I can't speak for every single piece of furnitue, I've only built like 50 of them in my life.
* Some just take longer than the others to build.
* I too got a part screwed in upside down a few times because I was too lazy to look at the manual precisely but you can always just go back a page and just figure out what you did wrong (like I did).

116,t3_rs3efd,CMV: Mold Remediation is a snake-oil cash grab that takes advantage of people’s ignorance and fear.,"I’ve been researching this for weeks now and the best I can come up with is: “experts are qualified”.

Sure, but how did they become experts? In theory, couldn’t anyone simply educate themselves and deal with the problem.

I’m not saying mold can’t pose a health risk or even that it isn’t something that should be taken seriously.

I’m saying that it’s become something people immediately panic about and call in the most expensive service possible when a halfway decent contractor or DIYer for that matter couldn’t perform the same service for less than half the price.

I challenge anyone: provide me with just a little information as to what these supposed “experts” are doing that’s so special.

At most, maybe they might have easier access to slightly more effective fungicides than what’s carried at Lowe’s or Home Depot.


Addendum: I will get around to responding to all the comments. At the moment I’m doing more Reddit than work and need to focus on the job. I want to provide a link and citation however, that I feel supports my claim and I feel like a lot of the people commenting should read. I’m still hoping someone can provide a technical explanation that justifies this industry, I remain unconvinced however that it’s anything other than an exploitative cash grab.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12762072/

Primary excerpt:

“Molds are common and important allergens. About 5% of individuals are predicted to have some allergic airway symptoms from molds over their lifetime. However, it should be remembered that molds are not dominant allergens and that the outdoor molds, rather than indoor ones, are the most important. For almost all allergic individuals, the reactions will be limited to rhinitis or asthma; sinusitis may occur secondarily due to obstruction. Rarely do sensitized individuals develop uncommon conditions such as ABPA or AFS. To reduce the risk of developing or exacerbating allergies, mold should not be allowed to grow unchecked indoors. When mold colonization is discovered in the home, school, or office, it should be remediated after the source of the moisture that supports its growth is identified and eliminated. Authoritative guidelines for mold remediation are available. Fungi are rarely significant pathogens for humans. Superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails are relatively common in normal individuals, but those infections are readily treated and generally resolve without complication. Fungal infections of deeper tissues are rare and in general are limited to persons with severely impaired immune systems. The leading pathogenic fungi for persons with nonimpaired immune function, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma, may find their way indoors with outdoor air but normally do not grow or propagate indoors. Due to the ubiquity of fungi in the environment, it is not possible to prevent immunecompromised individuals from being exposed to molds and fungi outside the confines of hospital isolation units. Some molds that propagate indoors may under some conditions produce mycotoxins that can adversely affect living cells and organisms by a variety of mechanisms. Adverse effects of molds and mycotoxins have been recognized for centuries following ingestion of contaminated foods. Occupational diseases are also recognized in association with inhalation exposure to fungi, bacteria, and other organic matter, usually in industrial or agricultural settings. Molds growing indoors are believed by some to cause building-related symptoms. Despite a voluminous literature on the subject, the causal association remains weak and unproven, particularly with respect to causation by mycotoxins. One mold in particular, Stachybotrys chartarum, is blamed for a diverse array of maladies when it is found indoors. Despite its well-known ability to produce mycotoxins under appropriate growth conditions, years of intensive study have failed to establish exposure to S. chartarum in home, school, or office environments as a cause of adverse human health effects.”

So, I’m not seeing the necessity for a specialized industry dealing with this unless they possess some tool or techniques in dealing with the problem above that available to the general public or at least a general contractor.

This began with me trying to do my own due diligence to treat a mold problem that’s slightly larger than I usually see. Now it’s become a matter of principle and concern that a general exploitation is taking place to capitalize on panic and misinformation.

120,t3_rrwvf8,"CMV: ""Clinical psychologist"" is a next to useless job for society","My line of reasoning is like this: a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis is next to useless in the context of our society right now, and since I don't know of clinical psychologists doing much other than diagnose people, I assume they're useless. However there is a chance they do other stuff too which is why I am open to changing my mind.

So why is a psychological diagnosis irrelevant? 

When a doctor in (most?) other medical fields makes a misdiagnosis, they are making an error about reality. When a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist makes a misdiagnosis, often times they actually have a clear picture of reality, they are just making an error about human conventions. In this way, mental illnesses are only ""real"" in a social context, whereas other medical diagnoses have a reality beyond the social context we are in. I will explain, but first I will slightly deviate to a tangentially related subject to make an analogy:

Grammatical mistakes in a language vs. a mistake in a STEM field. When someone makes a math error, they make a wrong assumption *about reality*. 2+2=4 on any planet, in any time. The meaning behind the symbols ""2"", ""+"", ""4"" and ""="" are socially defined, but the underlying meaning behind the phrase is constant across space and time. The abstraction has a basis in reality. If someone says that 2+2=5 they imply that if you take two sticks and you take another two sticks and put them next to each other you now have 5 sticks which is wrong regardless of how humans call them or whether society doesn't even exist and you are all alone on a stranded island. If aliens exist and are smart enough they developed their own math with the exact same rules as our math only that they write it/communicate it differently. 

Someone makes a grammatical error. They make no wrong assumptions about reality. A grammar mistake is wrong only because society decided that. If someone says ""You're a smart person"" or if they say ""Your a smart person"" in both cases they think the exact same thing and the second sentence says nothing wrong about reality as long as everyone correctly understood what the speaker wanted to communicate and yet it is wrong only in the context that society decided it's wrong.

Now we can go back to medicine. When a doctor tells you you have type 1 diabetes instead of type 2, they made a wrong assumption about reality.  They actually think that there is something tangible in reality that isn't there and that there isn't something that is. Like the math errors.

When the psychologist tells you that you have atypical depression instead of dysthymia or something, most of the time they make a social mistake, similar to the grammar errors. It's rare that they didn't understand your symptoms and how to treat them. In those cases it is indeed very bad to make a misdiagnosis. Yet usually they only misunderstood the socially defined words used to describe the symptoms in a shorter way. Heck, they change them up drastically with each edition of the DSM. 

The important distinction comes from the way mental vs. physical illnesses are defined and diagnosed. The coronavirus, cancer, diabetes, etc. are defined as a real, tangible object that itself *causes* some symptoms. The illnesses are not defined based on the symptoms. With all mental illnesses I know, *the definition of the illness is the symptoms themselves!*. It's right there, in the DSM (and ICD). This is why I have a problem with the fact that the medical/psychology field calls them symptoms which I think is somewhat deceiving. There is no underlying real object behind the symptoms. Now you might say, I'm not a doctor, and doctors are an authority on their field so they must know what they are doing when they call them symptoms, but doctors are not mathematicians, so I wouldn't say they are a trusted source of authority when it comes to rigorously defining their terms. To be fair, I'm not a mathematician either, but at least I'm trying, I'm getting pretty close sometimes. 

What we must understand about all mental illnesses is that they are defined and diagnosed simply based on symptoms, and hence they are literally *a shorthand for describing a more or less arbitrary cluster of symptoms*. BPD is literally a shorter way of saying ""person who has at least 5 out of 9 of the following symptoms simultaneously for at least 1 year: .... (insert the 9 symptoms of BPD)"". There's no underlying virus, cell, neurotransmitter, etc. that ""is"" BPD and that in turn *causes* the symptoms. *The illness is the symptoms*. Now you may say, sure, there are actually neurotransmitters involved, but that's actually not a consensus in the medical field but only a consensus on Google search, subreddit admins and Youtube influencers who read up a myth that depression is caused by a lack of at least one of 3 neurotransmitters which is likely a lie spread by Big Pharma to sell more antidepressants (that, or there is no conspiracy and it can simply be explained by ignorance). In reality SSRIs change serotonin levels in the brain in 1-2 hours yet it takes them weeks to have effect, if they have any. There is only a strong correlation between depression and serotonin, between ADHD and low dopamine, schizophrenia and high dopamine, and so on, but they are not *equivalent*.

Even if we found out there are physical correspondents to the mental illnesses, they are still *defined* right now based on the symptoms. 

We know from logic that to have a valid definition of a noun it needs to require at least these 3 proprieties: 

1. It must be a propriety that absolutely all instances of that category of entities have, without exception.

2. There must be no other category of entities satisfying propriety 1 for that same definition (unless they are synonyms).

3. The definition of the word must not include the word itself in the definition (else it is circular). 

If I want to define ""chair"", I must list proprieties that absolutely all chairs share in common, that *only* chairs and no other class of objects share in common, and that doesn't include the word chair in it. I haven't found a definition for bipolar, depression, ADHD, GAD, schizophrenia, and so on that satisfies all 3 proprieties and yet is also based in reality. They are only based in society. 

This is not a bad thing necessarily. It's good that we have a shorter way of saying ""person who satisfies at least 5 out of the 9 following symptoms: ...."" and so on and so on, in order to communicate more efficiently. The problem is when we give more importance to these labels than the social importance. People start identifying with them, judging others, basing their personality on them, psychologists waste more time learning the diagnoses than the treatment than is necessary, society itself gets attached to what it created. 

With all that said,  what does a clinical psychologist know that I don't know already? What's the point of getting a diagnosis? What new information do I get if I go to them? I will find out what symptoms I have? Well that's the thing I'm supposed to tell them. Then what do I find out? That my unique combination of symptoms has a name? Why is that relevant?

It's kind of deceiving to say that you ""have"" bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, or any other mental illness. You don't really ""have"" those illnesses, you have a cluster of symptoms, and that arbitrary set of symptoms happens to have a name by society. I'm pretty sure that with enough search I can find you someone who cycles between episodes of depression, mania and anxiety and I can find those people and call their illness ""tripolar disorder"" and it would be just a way of communicating their symptoms without any other inherent importance, it would be the exact same things psychologists did with all the other diagnoses. Maybe the symptoms tend to cluster more in the way they are now described in the DSM, for example there are more people with bipolar disorder than this tripolar disorder I just defined, or anything else I could define, which I don't know if it's true but it's irrelevant right now since I'm not trying to debate how good the DSM actually is but whether we actually need a separate job title to apply those labels. Technically the aim of defining those illnesses is to have as few people as possible in the ""not otherwise specified"" categories (to see in what way the symptoms cluster together). 

Also, this myth I've heard that it's dangerous that you should self-diagnose and you're not qualified for it and you should go to a doctor. Not gonna lie, if you can't diagnose mental illnesses with the DSM open in front of you you're... not smart. You literally have to follow the definitions there and see if you check the symptoms. At least this applies to mood disorders and anxiety disorders, maybe I wouldn't always trust a psychotic to admit they have a problem. 

And even if it was hard, the fact that patients are discouraged from diagnosing themselves just goes to show that they're useless, since the only thing they could have been important at is easier communication, but communication is discouraged. In all other medical fields, patients are encouraged to know about the symptoms of an illness and their definition and/or cause (ex: a virus) in order to communicate it with other people. They're discouraged from diagnosing physical illnesses since that is an entirely different process. In psychiatry and clinical psychology, there is a paradox since they are somewhat encouraged to do the same but they're discouraged from diagnosing them. It's a paradox because there is no underlying ""thing"" behind the illnesses, like I said before, and therefore knowing the symptoms of an illness and diagnosing it is pretty much identical. 

The fact they made a separate job for this (instead of letting psychotherapists do the same job) is either pure ignorance or conspiracy + ignorance. I'd best it's pure ignorance since what can be explained by both ignorance and conspiracy is usually just ignorance. There is a small chance however that when they started taking these labels more seriously some people gathered around a table and conspired to create a job just to steal people's money who they instigated into caring about the useless labels. Then the next generation of psychologists actually believed the evil ones before and it spread through word of mouth... It's a funny theory. 

At last, the fact there are many clinical psychologists working in psychiatric hospitals and that the staff there think they are important is meaningless because holding that title gives you authority on the theory behind clinical psychology, not whether the theory itself is important. That's like asking an English teacher whether grammar is an important skill instead of whether something is grammatically correct. Of course they're gonna be biased. That doesn't mean that grammar is not a completely useless skill  as society took it was too seriously and gave it way more importance than a few simple rules we should follow to make sure we avoid miscommunication.",0.0
121,t3_rrtm13,"CMV: Using phrases such as ""penis owner,"" or ""vagina owner,"" is unnecessary pandering and doesn't actually help anyone.","If I were to ask you how many fingers humans have per hand, you'd say five. (four if you're trying to be that guy) Obviously some people are born with more or less, or they get into accidents, yet it doesn't change the fact that most people have five. It's the same thing with gender and genitals. 

Most men have penises, and vice versa. Of course there's nothing wrong with transgender people. Going from being a man to a woman and having a penis is fine, but using that to go ""woah, we can't say men have penises and women have vaginas,"" is by and large not something that anyone should need to do. Saying ""penis owner,"" and ""vagina owner,"" sounds incredibly unnatural as well, the words man and woman have worked since the dawn of the English language. I get that language changes, but there is no need for it to here.

Lastly, if the hatred of transgender people is going to be stopped, something that I'm sure we all want, forcing weird terms into the English language will be seen by those who hate trans people as proof of mental instability or any other kind of bs, helping these supposedly ""inclusive"" terms to have the opposite effect.

So I guess what I'm asking is, what is the point? Why should I, or anyone else have to use these phrases, and do most transgender people even care about this?",361.0

Most arguments I see for this are pretty bad, so let me knock out a few:

THE LEGAL ARGUMENT: “it’s illegal so therefore it’s bad” is not an argument. Laws are based off of the morality of the nation, not an inherent sign that something IS immoral. 

THE EXPERIENCE ARGUMENT: “18 year olds and 12 year olds are in different places in their life” same can be said for 18/50 relationships. Different lives, different time periods, I’d argue that 12/18 relationships ar technically better by that standard because at least they have a similar understanding of pop culture and trends and such.

THE POWER ARGUMENT: “18 year olds have a lot more power and ability to persuade and groom a 12 year old”, again, same situation with an 18/50 relationship, just even worse I’d argue as most 50 year olds have extreme differences in levels compared to someone fresh out of highschool.

124,t3_rrrkgc,CMV: Requiring Boosters for Vaccination Compliance is a Misguided Policy with Possibly Catastrophic Consequences,"The top story in the New York Times today discussed whether or not the US should change the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to require a booster shot in addition to the two original vaccine doses. The article listed a number of businesses and schools who have already made this their policy. The article also quotes leading doctors as recommending this policy shift and claims that the Biden administration is seeking to change the language from ""fully vaccinated"" to ""up to date"" in order to ease future changes to the definition. 

Before I launch into my argument against this policy, I want to make clear I am in no way challenging the efficacy of vaccines or the legality or morality of vaccine mandates. There is more than sufficient evidence to show that Covid vaccines work with minimal side effects and the government clearly has a reasonable public interest which justifies the mandate. 

So, without further Ado, my argument:

Earlier this week the WHO put out a release claiming that blanket booster shots were a poor answer to the Omicron variant. Their argument was that boosters, currently, provide only marginal benefits in reducing severe cases and hospitalization. Furthermore, each booster given to a vaccinated person (only a third of the US population is currently boosted) is one fewer vaccination given to someone unvaccinated. Considering that boosters are almost exclusively used in developed nations, this essentially means denying basic vaccination to individuals in underprivileged nations. 

Now, I'm not a medical expert, but if I am to evaluate the claims of a national health service, whose responsibility does not include individuals outside the United States and a global health service which sees the whole of humanity as it's purview, my instinct says to go global. Some, maybe many, may disagree. They may prefer their own marginal benefit to larger benefits for others they don't know or they may just balance competing claims differently. I respect that and, obviously, anyone who feels they need to get a booster should be allowed to do so (at least in so far as health guidance allows). 

However, to mandate a booster is another step entirely. My problems with a booster mandate are threefold. Firstly, a booster mandate would require some, myself included, to perform an action they see as fundamentally immoral with little added benefit. Secondly, mandating a booster in the United States could create a cascade effect which would effectively increase the global vaccine burden by 50%. Thirdly, mandating boosters in contradiction to WHO guidance could risk significant damage to US security and foreign relations. 

I believe it is morally wrong to have an excess of a vital resource when others have a dearth. This is especially true of a resource which is relatively easily transported and distributed. If an individual dies or becomes dangerously ill because I took as a booster the vaccine which could have prevented their sickness, then no benefit save the protection of my life could be worth it. The WHO says the protection of my life is not at issue with a booster, and even the CDC admits that basic vaccination is sufficient to prevent serious harm in the general population. Thus, I believe that, without further evidence of need, my receiving a booster would be immoral. However, if the mandate threshold is changed I could be kicked out of school and lose my job for failure to receive a booster. 

This is an incredibly strong cost which should have a high counterbalancing benefit. As stated, any benefit to me personally is minimal. That said, there is a possible social benefit which is unaccounted for in the WHO guidance. If a booster reduces breakthrough transmission (as it seems to) it is possible that requiring boosting could reduce the transmissibility of Covid. This would be a legitimate social good, however not one which could not be achieved through other means (for instance free household testing or even a return to quarantine). Furthermore, the benefit is again not significant in a fully vaccinated population as the cases which are spread should be resisted by vaccinated individuals. Those with pre-existing conditions should also get the booster, meaning they should be protected from extreme consequences as well. 

It would also be naive to think that American boosting is the only thing on the table here. Europe is currently being slammed by Omicron and if the United States mandates boosters is not unlikely that other countries would follow suit. If this becomes the standard, the number of vaccines required worldwide would increase by half. This would further slow down the rate at which developing nations are able to vax. 

Now, for the most important point. Unvaccinated people create variants. The more unvaccinated people there are in the world, the more variants there will be. Thus far the variants have been relatively controllable, however, that is not guaranteed to be the case. By delaying the vaccination of the planet we are playing an international game of Russian Roulette, with millions of deaths as a possible consequence. This problem becomes compounded if we decide to mandate boosters every time there is a significant variant. At worst it could create a cycle of constant boosting and evasion as the vaccination of people in developing nations continues to be delayed by novel mandates in developed nations. As mentioned earlier, the Biden administration is considering a messaging change to prepare for exactly this possibility. 

Finally, our reputation on the world stage is BADLY banged up. The United States has been acting with wanton self interest in foreign policy for 20 years (probably more) and it has begun to wear our relationships thin. If the US were to pursue another blatantly self-interested policy in defiance of international organizations, if could provide a fatal blow to our perception around the world. This is at a time when the perception of US behavior is vital in preventing Russian and Chinese expansionism and (optimistically) for protecting the perception of democracy as an ideal. 

So, that's my argument. I'm sorry it's so long, but this is a serious topic and I want to make sure I have my bases covered. I would like to CMV, because frankly I don't really like the side this puts me on. Plus, if there's an argument I'm missing, I'd like to rectify my thinking so that I'm not behaving in a destructive manner. Thanks for reading!

Today's guilty verdict completely kills that hypothesis.

If this was the truth both Epstein and Maxwell would have squealed for a deal with the prosecutors or at the very least blackmailed these powerful people. The fact that anyone genuinely still believes that Epstein's suicide (which he had attempted recently prior) was somehow orchestrated, despite that requiring literally 10s of people in all sorts of unrelated jobs to be involved is mind-boggling.

Being rich, famous, or powerful does not correlate with being a pedophile or hebephile, those sexual orientations are very well studied and pretty much universally agreed on by experts to be defined in adolescence, not after you become a successful entrepreneur, senator, or prison guard.

Why is it so hard for people to accept that these creepy narcissistic sociopaths just happened to also associate with the rich and influential, without there being some magical pedo-ring? Occam's Razor force you to accept the evidence, and the evidence is quite damning in the sense that there was very few, if any, other wealthy people involved in their shady lifestyle. 

Are there other creepy rich and influential people? Of course, but why would they congregate and risk everything by associating with other creeps? It's not like billionaires or famous people would have any trouble getting their rocks off by themselves, the idea that all of these people (presidents, billionaires, world-leading academics, artists etc.) would group up to abuse teenagers is beyond ludicrous.

128,t3_rrnxul,CMV: Police Officers Touching The Rear/Trunk of a Vehicle During a Traffic Stop is Only Practical for Officer Safety and NOT Practical For Leaving Behind DNA/Physical Evidence.,"
Video reference: https://youtu.be/Wy1qbLjkJnY

If you look at the video linked above, around 00:05 you’ll see the officer touch the trunk of the vehicle as he’s approaching the driver window. 

Often in the comment section of videos like these I see people asking why do cops do this and almost every time I see that question asked people answer with that it’s done to leave behind dna/physical evidence just in case the officer is killed during the stop. 

Reasons why touching the trunk of the car to leave behind physical evidence isn’t practical. 

1. In areas where the climate is often cold, and people wear gloves, touching the rear of the car would not leave prints or transfer DNA. It’s a useless “technique” for over half of the United States for months at a time. 

2. All police cars that perform traffic stops have radios. Police officers call out, plate number, location, vehicle make, model, color, and how many times the vehicle is occupied. This is usually called out before the vehicle is being pulled over. This is all recorded by a dispatcher and the radio transmission itself is usually recorded. This alone is enough to connect any car to an officer who was killed just after making a traffic stop. 

3. Dash cams, do the same job as radios when it comes to identifying a suspect vehicle. 

These points makes touching the rear of a vehicle to leave behind physical evidence obsolete. 

The only practical purpose of touching the rear of the car like that is to make sure the trunk is closed/secure. To ensure that the trunk has not been partially unlatched, with someone inside, looking to ambush the officer once he gets to the driver side window.",15.0

This post isn't about that and opinions from that perspective should ultimately be irrelevant to the discussion for this. This is strictly about the word or term fatphobia itself, often used in a similar context to a word like say, homophobia or homophobic. For example, people don't say 'gayphobic' or gayphobia.  homophobe

&amp;#x200B;

It's more about the idea that it should follow a similar structure to how other phobias are named with the use of latin and greek words. Phobias are referenced by the greek or latin word that references the object or item for which there is the phobia of, followed by the suffix if -phobia or -phobic itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I would've said lipophobic but that's an actual thing that usually refers to grease or oil. Lipo is a greek word. Crassus, or crasso, means 'fat' or thick/dense in latin. Crassusphobia or crassophobia should instead be used in place of the context that words 'fatphobic' or 'fatphobia' are used. It follows the more proper structuring of how phobias are named.

&amp;#x200B;

**edit**: Lipophobic or lipophobia would be more correct and should apply in this context. 

&amp;#x200B;

Totally open to hearing from any language experts on this, as I'm an ESL and for all I know there could be a better way to utilize the etymology. From what I've seen of the Latin word crassus or crasso, it best fits the word to refer to fat.  If anyone has more certainty or knowledge as to the definitions of either words, I'd love to hear it. Sometimes the naming phobias get insanely long or complicated, usually in regards to specific acts or contexts. For example, the fear of getting peanut butter stuck in your mouth, or the fear of a duck watching you, have very specific names. If such a context would also fit this wording, I'm open to accepting that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of trans person am I, who openly doubts the validity of other trans people’s genders? Believe me when I say, my intention isn’t to discriminate at all; in fact, I feel terrible for thinking like this. 

The reason why I think this way is because the overwhelming majority of trans guys (especially transmasc youth) are super feminine, to the point where - and I’m going to get a lot of hate for saying this - if it weren’t for trans solidarity, I’d have a hard time accepting they were males. Yes, of course, if cis guys can be feminine, why can’t trans guys, right? It’s just that the number of effeminate trans males are uncannily high compared to the number of effeminate cis males; or if you want to go vice versa, the number of masculine trans females. Another factor is that a large portion of the trans community is gay - which normally I couldn’t care less about if it weren’t for the super high percentage. As with before, this number seems way higher than the number of cis gay males or trans gay females. It’s to the point where I don’t feel represented by the trans ftm community at all as a straight, masc trans guy and if I had to be quite honest, hanging out in most trans communities these days just feels the same as hanging out with my old group of straight female friends - I feel like I don’t fit in at all and have to compromise who I am to feel like I belong. 

I have tried really hard to convince myself that maybe I’m just the outlier here, but the logic doesn’t seem to add up? What’s the point of identifying as male if you’re going to act feminine, make no effort trying to pass - especially if you’re just into guys anyways; wouldn’t it be much easier to be a straight girl? It really doesn’t help just how many trans guys identify as femboys or act like glorified fujoshis. And to top it all off - there is such a huge number of trans males, especially in adolescents, compared to trans females. To me it just feels like that because it is quite easier to be transmasc these days, a lot of people who would otherwise be non-binary at most, just decide to identify as ftm and they’re accepted right in by the community.

134,t3_rrjdhh,CMV: Social justice/reconciliation are actually bad for/a threat to privileged people - even though they should support such causes for ethical reasons.,"One of the hallmarks of the rhetoric behind most social justice action/movements/arguments that I see is is the notion that 'we're trying to raise everyone up! Not bring anyone down!' But if I think about it honestly this is bullshit, it has to be. Raising people up practically (even if not logically) necessitates the bringing down of others.

But we say this because we have to because - spoiler alert - people vote for/support causes that are good for \*their own interests,\* and it is difficult/rare to see massive sections of people support causes that will hurt their material interests. Since most people don't care that much about their moral interests, the above described 'We're raising everyone up and making things better for \*everyone\*' bullshit is necessary.

Morality is not always easy, or fun, or even helpful. And in this case doing the moral thing is actively BAD for privileged people, but they are still morally required to support such action and help it if they can.

Social justice means that privileged people will have to give up that privilege/advantages they have. That's kinda the whole point right? Well, this literally means that things will get worse for those privileged people.

This means that white people, and white men, will have a much harder time gaining admittance into university, and hence getting into the specialized fields and get hired for jobs, for instance.

It's already difficult to become a doctor/English professor/whatever when you have privileges anyway. If you're a white man, and if these fields are dominated by white men, you are only competing with say 1,000 other people for any given position when you get out of uni. Now the more we dismantle systemic oppression, the higher these numbers get. Now once you add all of these new women/black people/trans people/Indigenous people who had previously been denied these opportunities, that number has now sky-rocketed to 5,000 (just to pick numbers out of a hat).

So, socially just policies have made it much more difficult for this white person would be doctor to reach his position he's chasing after. There are a limited number of doctor positions which are needed, and it is not like social justice is going to suddenly create a massive demand for these positions.

So social justice makes it more difficult for privileged people to access the things that really matter and are important in life. If a privileged person helps socially just causes, the knowledge they have done a good thing is in no way going to help them provide for their child better, and it will more likely make it more difficult for their child attain their goals, because they have taken away head start that they themselves got in the foot race that is life in their own childhood/adolescence.",0.0
135,t3_rriw5g,CMV: Religious beliefs are a necessary evil.,"Despite its questionable truth, a society needs some form of religion as an easily accessible but comprehensive view of the world. Religion provides the everyday person with a more or less coherent system to whatever ethical or transcendental question they have.
In the best of all possible worlds, everybody would be an atheist, since institutionalized religions aka churches tend to corrupt those in power or are hijacked by already corrupted personnel. 
However, for the following reasons, there is no alternative to a state policy promoting religious beliefs (of course in the boundaries of tolerance, which in my understanding ends where somebody else suffers harm).
1.	For one thing, not everybody is willing to build themselves their own idiosyncratic construct of personal philosophy, through which they can form a maxim to guide their life.
2.	Further, atheism, agnosticism, and thereby philosophy can hardly provide this as easily. As far as I understand it, philosophy is stuck in postmodern nihilism or relativism and scientific/ analytical approaches can’t produce ethical claims.
3.	Also, with religions, you have communities with believers of the more or less same worldview.
4.	While in my opinion, the belief in a creator god cannot explain his creation, from the viewpoint of a religion - which acknowledges the doctrine of an unmoved mover - this simply by definition is no issue of concern. Science and specifically astronomy cannot overcome the endless regression in answering this issue (maybe quantum theory can, idk, but if it can explain this, scarcely anybody will understand it).

136,t3_rrifmi,CMV: R/antiwork is a great movement that is bound to fail cause it’s members are too radical.,"I’ll start by saying I 100% support the community, and the vast vast majority of their ideas. The problem I feel is that similar to a lot of leftist movements they have 1.) a marketing issue 2.) a belief that everyone will naturally agree with them and that their only problem is getting the word out there and fighting the powers in charge 3.) a desire to change too much too quickly.

#1 the marketing issue. The community is obviously leftist leaning. One of the top posts today is how cops are “class traitors” and can't be apart of the movement. The fact that that is so obvious is itself a problem. They should be focused more on the idea bringing working classes together in a shared fight than dividing them by using words like “anti-capitalist” as the mods often do that just divides people. Even if every worker in the world agrees with this stance if they knew better, that is simply not the case. We are very very divided as a county and people naturally pick sides with people that they feel are their flock. Simply put, there are likely a lot of conservatives that would agree with a lot of points made in antiwork but using terms like anti capitalist is immediately going to turn them off and call the movement “libtard communists that don’t want to work” or whatever dumb shit they’ll say. Most conservative are normal people that also think their job sucks and they should get paid more. Focus on how the movement will benefit them and not on how it will cause change that is scary to them and shake the core foundations of their world view. 

#2 issue I see is the belief that everyone will naturally agree with them and that their only problem is getting the word out there and fighting the powers in charge. The issue just isn’t a marketing issue, or being held down by elitists and corporations. Sure there are tons of people that are simply uneducated and care more about buzz words than substance as stated in the previous point, but there are also people that simply will not agree with you even if they’re educated on the issues and intelligent. The US is a country that overall fairly conservative on a world scale and believes in individualism. That’s not to say every person in the country is a hardcore maga supporting conservative, but the average voter is far more right leaning than they are in other countries. Hell our “liberals” would be the right leaning party in some countries. So with that being said the fight is not just against the corporations and the 1%, it is against a sizable vocal minority that will just simply never agree with your more extreme points no matter how well made and logical they are. Not everyone believes minimum wage should be a “ thriveable wage” as opposed to just livable as I’ve seen mentioned many times in the community. The majority of people may be on board with the idea that no one should starve working 40 hours, but there are simply a ton of people that will fundamentally disagree that the minimum pay should be any more than the bare minimum to survive. Not everyone is going to believe a company is “exploiting” workers just cause it doesn’t share every bit of profit with them. That’s just a fundamental difference of options that comes with having a more conservative population. You can’t change these people, so don’t fool yourself in to thinking you can. 

#3 a desire to change too much too quickly. Left leaning movements have always succeeded by making reasonable arguments and asking the population to accept a little bit of change without completely rocking their world. Examples of this are the civil rights movement, gay rights movement, women’s rights movements, and the 40 hour work week. These movements asked for incremental change, knowing their leaders would continue to fight for more once they got their original ask. This desire for change fails or at least doesn’t happen as quickly as it could when too much is asked for too quickly. Look at the BLM protests of 2020. They were very effective in that they got the dialogue started but really what changed? A lot of cities put restrictions on police dependents and rolled them back shortly after. The issue with that is the message some people heard went from “the rate of violence and profiling against minorities is far too high in police departments and we need more accountability so that doesn’t happen” to “acab and abolish the police” making people that have ever had a single positive interaction with a cop uncomfortable by calling them a bastard as their profession is inherently evil. A lot of people will agree to police reform, not everyone is going to  agree to their cousin Billy being part of the problem so when you say that they’re going to tune you out. So when the movement calls for things like overthrowing capitalism, saying a small business that is barley profitable shouldn’t survive if it can’t pay worked $30 a hour, and that everyone deserves a thriveable wage it is likely to be too much too soon for a lot of people and be seen more as just as unserious whining than a real movement for change. We are all workers, so demand things that will benefit most workers, or at least stuff the majority of non boomers can get behind like minimum wage increase. Fight for fair wages by knowing your worth and continuing denying labor until your needs are met. Rally against at will employment so that employers have to give fair notice before firing. Let employers know that your labor is not given and if they treat you like shit you quit. Continue to demand additional benefits that won’t make a dent in company profits but will make your life a whole lot easier like more PTO or free child care options for large companies that can be done cheaply at scale. Even fight for the 32 hour work week as I think pretty much all walks of life will like working less and it’s definitely feasible. Fight for what is achievable without trying to shake everyone’s word view talking about how wages haven’t been in line with profit increases or that how everyone deserves the right to take foreign vacations from the wages of their minimum wage job (that’s partially a sarcastic characterization but if also seems a ton on the community truly think things like this so idk).

Again I 100% support the movement and think American workers have been exploited far too long  and the pandemic has finally given us the collective will to fight against it. The great resignation and the ending of boomer ideas like that we are lucky to work, as opposed to the truth that employers are lucky to have us, warms my heart. Just think the movement is bound to fail if it isn’t agreeable to most and feasible without a violent civil war. We need solidarity that will force real change, not radical online shit posting that is never going to happen. CMV.",0.0
137,t3_rrhs5b,CMV: There is very little difference between a store and scalper,"People get mad at scalpers for pricing things way higher than they should be. But how is it any different from a store setting the price? By any logic the price should always be as much as the market will be willing to pay, right?

So for as long as there is a person willing to pay thousands for a gpu, that's what the price should be, isn't it?

Same applies to all other entertainment/other non-essential things. The one exception is basic human rights like water.

I should mention I'm one suffering from scalping (rocking a 970 and not gonna upgrade in this market) and have never scalped anything myself. Still, I see it as reasonable to set the price to as high as you can

138,t3_rrgrnx,CMV: Getting a puppy from a responsible breeder is perfectly fine,"I think if it is reasonable for a person to get any puppy (i.e. they have thought it through, have the financial and living situation that accommodates the animal, etc.), it is fine for them to get that puppy from a responsible breeder. 

By responsible breeder I mean one that takes good care of their animals. They don't force them to have too many litters. They test the parents animals for genetic issues related to the breed. They keep all the dogs happy and healthy. Many breeders are trying to breed for dogs that are healthier and are better companions for people. If there are unforeseen circumstances where the owner has to give up the animal, many breeders will want to take them back so they can personally find a new home for them instead of leaving them to a shelter or on the street.

Some people want the degree of certainty that comes from knowing how this dog grew up in its first months and to meet their parents to have a good idea of their temperament, how large they will be, and what they will most likely look like. There is nothing wrong with wanting those things when they are available. This is especially true if you are in a situation where you would not adopt a dog if this information was not available for you. Not knowing these things carries a risk that some people are not comfortable with.

Further, responsible breeders will require the dogs get fixed. The dogs also come with their vaccinations already started. On top of that, most pure-bred dogs will easily find homes if they ever do end up needing a new one. So they aren't contributing to the problem of homeless animals and are protected from the worst diseases that cause suffering.

Sure, a lot of dogs and puppies need homes and it's very sad. It's very nice when people open their homes to help out. But it is not everyone's responsibility to try to help solve that problem.",56.0
139,t3_rrddac,"CMV: The outrage over dark skin makeup (""blackface"") outside the US is illegitimate and counterproductive","Wearing artificial coloring to your skin with the intention to play a character that is black has a heavy historical load because this was a common practice until early 20th century in theaters in the US. White actors would do it to play a very unflattering stereotype of black people, always depicted as stupid and less than humane.

When I was groing up, this was not a known fact where I lived. We would dress as characters for costume parties and try to emulate our favorite characters by imitating their ways, their clothes, their hair using wigs, their facial traits using make up. Skin color was not an exception.

At some point the concept of ""blackface"" and its offensive potential was introduced and created an absolute taboo on skin colour, even though where I live this type of make up was never used in racist contexts. Nowadays you can still dress up as Beyonce or Snoop Dogg for Halloween. You can copy their clothes, you can copy their hair, you can copy their face, you can copy their body shape... But not the skin color, that is absolutely forbidden. There is something about the skin that cannot be addressed. Everything but the color.

So my thesis is: 
 Ideally skin color should be just a trait, and I hope one day we will overcome racism and skin color will be nothing more than that.
In the US and other places blackface is still a painful memory that will take time to heal, and that should be respected. 
But I believe some people just loved to get a new reason to be outraged and imported the taboo into places where make up had never been a form of racism and created a whole new place where black and white have to be separated. Impersonating some celebrity we liked used to be a way of celebrating their looks and traits with admiration.
By importing this type of costume party police repression I feel we set the way we look at race back to where the US are, instead of being where the US will be in the future when they are ready to overcome racism.
Change my view if you think importing a racial taboo where there wasn't one is thr way to go",0.0

141,t3_rrbrlr,CMV: Canceling student loan debt is not a good idea.,"I don't think that canceling student loan debt (either $10k or entirely) is good for the US, nor is it progressive. 

I am a graduate student in STEM. I have about $35k in student loans now, which are in deferment (not accumulating interest) until I get my PhD. Canceling my student loans, or forgiving $10k of them, does not make sense. It is typical of people in my field to make approximately a $100-130k salary in industry right out of grad school, so I will have no problem paying off my loans. I have a ton of grad students in my cohort in the exact same position; we have some loans, but we will have no problem paying off our student debt. If my student loans are forgiven, that $10k (or $35k) would be much better off going to someone else who needs it more than me. To improve the economy and the lives of people in this country, I think that the money that would go into blanket cancelation of student debt would be better spent on:

1) Providing a stimulus check to everyone with a low income, or

2) Bolstering loan forgiveness programs so that people who have student debt and aren't able to pay it off can get them forgiven.

Forgiving everyone's student debt would benefit a ton of people like me, who are not struggling; it would be a huge shift in wealth toward people who have leveraged that debt into high paying jobs. For this reason, I do not think that it is even a progressive idea in the first place.

I would like to hear some arguments against what I've said.

TL;DR: As it stands, blanket cancelation of student loan debt would benefit many people who are about to get high-paying jobs, and that's not progressive. I think it would be much better to provide a cash stimulus to people below some amount of income and/or bolster student loan forgiveness programs.",3.0
142,t3_rr0v2r,CMV: cancelling student loan debt is an unrealistic goal,"First and foremost I hate college as it exists currently, like all other aspects of modern society that have become tainted by capitalism left unchecked.

My perspective regarding this sightly systems from a sense of jealousy at the prospect of this happening in the first place. If 18 year old me knew that 13 years later I would have all my student loan debt wiped, I would have been much more inclined to take that risk. As someone who never accumulated any student loan debt, why should I get nothing while those who made the conscious decision to do otherwise get any amount of their debt forgiven? What about people who have managed to pay off their student loan debt? 

I can definitely understand the feeling of regret that people may have after graduating and realizing that their path may have not ended up putting them in the best financial situation given the variables that exist. On the other side, I can understand how this can be seen as unfair to those not burdened by this debt for one reason or another. There are definitely fundamental changes that need to happen to eliminate the need to have as much/any student loan debt in the first place, not to mention changes in the way that we bring children up in a way that better prepares them for handling large financial decisions like this. Regardless, between my own selfish reasoning and other opposing political mindsets, I just don't see cancelling student loan debt a realistic goal to expect.",0.0

145,t3_rqwhfl,"CMV: As a black person, I don't see the merit behind minorities lambasting oppressors of a different ethnicity before holding members of their own community accountable","This isn't an attack on POC. I do not believe any community is a monolith and I know that true progress doesn't happen overnight. I try to call out people that have an overreliance on victimhood or that use buzzwords without really expressing an apt description. I get demonized and insulted regularly for this. I'm hoping to use this opportunity to assess my own opinions and whether they hold up to criticisms. 

Some more specific examples include the concept of reparations for the Atlantic slave trade. I don't believe that chapter of Americana should *ever* be forgotten. I don't think it should be a cudgel with which to beat a white person over the head with when their family emigrated from Ireland and they faced a whole different set of xenophobia and jingoism. I think the lessons should be taught as history and work best when referencing implementing solutions. Justice Thurgood Marshall was sharp in how he addressed Jim Crow and Civil Rights when talking about Affirmative Action but a key point he intimated was that this should advance ""with all deliberate speed"". I fully acknowledge the abuse and torment of those entrapped in the Atlantic slave trade. I believe those people that ask for reparations are essentially asking for a divestiture of wealth accumulated over generations. It manifests in the form of people giving up jobs at 'white-shoe' firms to the best candidate as opposed to a crony and that takes generations more. My qualm is that members of the majority ethnic group are villainized for their very existence. If this level of animosity was turned to your local neighrhood crip gang member, they would be eradicated. 

That brings me to the violence in the black community. I cannot fathom how this is the fault of anyone but the people perpetrating these acts. I'm extremely ignorant on how oppression compels you to gun down another for respect or street credibility. I (silently) lose respect for the people that defend these murders under the guise that they are products of their community or it wasn't in their ability to not commit violence.

146,t3_rqvf9a,"CMV: Current working practices involving the Mon.-Fri. 40-hour week are outdated, inefficient, and counter-productive","I'm numbering my reasons/ explanations in the hope that this will make challenges easier to refer to.

1. WFH/work from home: The pandemic has shown that many office jobs can be effectively and easily carried out from home. These include, but aren't limited to, call-center types of jobs, positions that don't involve face-to-face contact, computer-based jobs. There are arguments for and against continuing with WFH, but at the very least, this should now be made a real option for many or most office workers.
2. Changing the Mon.-Fri. 9-5 routine will help alleviate traffic jams and transport problems generally. 
3. Perhaps my central reason: There's nothing inherent in most 9-5 jobs that requires a 9 a.m. start, on a Monday morning, for 40-odd hours a week. Many such jobs involve repetition of tasks - receptionists, secretaries, customer support, etc. - and it's rare that there's 40 hours of work that needs to be 'filled'. Instead, we have a situation where there can be little or nothing important to do, e.g. on Friday afternoons, but workers have to stay at their desks because - well, why, exactly? The main 'reason' seems to be: Because that's what they're paid to do. But in terms of efficiency, and productivity, this is a very poor reason.
4. The demands of modern life, especially urban life, render the Mon-Fri 9-5 system useless at best. Before the advent of online banking, for instance, banks were only open at the same time as businesses were. So workers had two choices. The more common one was to spend their lunch breaks in the local branch, along with lots of other people in the same boat. Result: big queues and lots of time wasted. The other option was to take time off work: again, this is bad for productivity and efficiency. 
5. Weekends are neither sacrosanct nor even particularly significant for many people. Weekends, as a period of free time, are arguably most important for families or individuals with children, or people in education (at university, etc.). For people working in hotels, restaurants, essential services, and the like, there's nothing distinctive about Saturday or Sunday; it can be, and often is, just another working day.
6. Mental health issues are also at odds with the 9-5 approach. If you have depression, anxiety, etc., these conditions don't suddenly stop at 5pm on a Friday afternoon. However (in the UK &amp; Ireland) many doctor's surgeries, pharmacies, etc. do. A personal anecdote sums up the absurdities of this scenario. An organization I was involved with promoted their positive attitude to supporting mental health by setting up a 24-hour crisis service. To access that service, you first had to call a number, which was open - Mon.-Fri., 9-5...
7. Counter-arguments: What I'm not proposing here is something which involves 'everyone' or 'everything': 'So are you saying that everyone should be free to choose whatever working hours they want?' No, I'm not saying this. I'm suggesting loosening up this 9-5 straitjacket and have offices etc work much more flexible hours.",299.0
147,t3_rqv0z6,CMV: Refs Should Never Be to Blame for a Lost Game,"This CMV is aimed more towards the die-hard sports fans... I understand a lot of people are anti-sports though (I do not know why when I see sports as being a positive thing that unites so many people together lol).

Referees should not be blamed when a team loses a game. I am only a professional and collegiate football and basketball consumer (NFL, NBA, NCAAF, NCAAM, and MLB but I do not understand the game of baseball as much, I just watch it for the culture) but I believe this same principle is applicable in most team sports played.

I was taught this valuable lesson from a young age playing recreational sports by my father. His reasoning behind this is that teams are not true champions when they leave the outcome of the game to referees. So the final layup with 3 seconds left on the clock should have gone in and there was a missed goaltending call on the defense... but why was your team in that position of having to score a game-winner in the first place? Was it because of the 8 turnovers your team gave up that resulted in the opposing team scoring 17 points off of those turnovers? Now blaming the referees for a loss because of their poor officiating when your team had 0 3 and outs, 0 interceptions, 0 fumbles, 0 missed field goals, etc. is plausible but that has NEVER happened in the history of sports (someone fact check me lol).

Trust me... I have been an unfortunate sports fan of teams that have gotten the bad end of calls! I am a huge Hawaiʻi Rainbow Warriors fan and still remember the game Hawaiʻi's men's basketball team played the 13th ranked Nevada Wolfpack back in 07. Hawaiʻi was unranked with a record of 12-10 facing a highly ranked Nevada team with a 20-2 record on the road. In the final seconds of the game with Hawaiʻi down by one and the ball, a player leaned in for a layup and made it while being fouled in the action. The referees called the basket good and the foul. The Nevada head coach had an outburst (which he should have gotten a technical for) and was consulting with the refs. After that consultation, the referees had a five-minute meeting and decided to way off the basket with no explanation given to Hawaiʻi. Even if you can argue about the reviewing system: 1. Nothing was reviewed 2. This was in 2007 where there was no system implemented in place that would allow you to review this specific play and 3. The foul was called and you cannot reverse calls made like that in 2007. So Hawaiʻi went on to obviously lose that game with Nevada players running on the court and jumping for joy. This is probably the worst officiated game I have seen in my life. The incompetence of the referees still boils my blood to this day... I hold so much resentment BUT Hawaiʻi had many chances to put the game away on both sides of the ball but couldn't execute!

One argument that people make is that sometimes bad calls from refs can impact the momentum a team has during the game. This is a good point BUT if you allow a bad call to impact your team morale and performance on the field then that's on you!

Now do not misinterpret my post. Whenever I make this argument people tell me that I am playing devil's advocate for referees and being soft on them. I still believe that many referees are horrible. We are held to a level of standard in our daily careers where if we do not perform up to what is expected are fired from our jobs... so the same should be for referees! I watch sports all the time and acknowledge refs are the worst! We definitely need to hold these individuals and the league responsible for poor officiating. We still need to call these clowns out! With that being said, blaming the refs for losing the game is just not right though.

Finally, there are many benefits to having this mindset. You tend to be happier and can accept the outcomes of games your favorite teams play when you think this way. I also noticed that this has slowly crept into our youth... it's like every time a pop warner team loses you hear kids say ""the refs were out to get us"" and you're like kid... your team lost 35-7 LOL Don't even get me started on the comment section of sports posts I see on social media daily. Every time a team wins a game the comments are always flooded with comments like ""refs"" or ""refs sold"" or ""\*team name\* vs the refs"" and it is so cringe... I think it is a reflection of how many people just make excuses in their life.

People move like good little inch worms, and oh, God, you physically moved your body to a slightly different angle? You no longer hold your cardinal numerical position within our queue for arbitrary thing with strangers.

Delis have had numbers for CENTURIES, literally millenia actually. Roman fast food places used number systems (citation needed, just saw it in a YouTube video so feel free to ignore this). In numbering orders you free people from this nightmare conga line of anxiety we've all been found to for whatever reason worship.

I'm reminded of the [Asch Conformity Experiments ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) where people just stood arbitrarily in a long line for nothing, and passerbys would simply join, assuming if people are waiting for anything it must be worth the wait.

In a number system, you can be on your phone or have a conversation on the other side of the business or even outside without mob mentality humans who are *EXACTLY* like you in every way, meaning you and I are equally susceptible to this mob mentality and conformity getting actually physically, verbally upset with a stranger in a nonsense setting for not inching forward enough.

COVID adds to this, as now we should stay 6 feet apart, so people go back several meters doing the slight inching, and if someone dares not take an uncomfortable baby shuffle of the feet forward, God forbid a potential carrier come closer into your personal space.

It's like people think that if they keep getting psychically nearer to the cashier or whatever then their wait perhaps will become shorter?

No, no it will not.

When you are right by the register at a supermarket and have to begin loading your items on the conveyor, I can completely see an exception to the number system being reasonable, but if you're just waiting for service of some sort or to order a good or food that will be given to you later, there is no need for the awful inching.

I implore you to try this in public and watch the ASTOUNDING reaction of otherwise normal, amicable human beings. Go to your bank, go to a fancy deli in a nice upper middle class neighborhood, go somewhere where people have money and experience specifically so you will expect class over places where perhaps people have different views on decorum or social morality. Get in the line where you need to, then either don't inch up, or let the desperate people behind you physically walk in front of you but just inform them something along the lines of

""You can walk forward if you'd like, just remember that I'm after this person here"" and wait.

It's incredible the reactions you'll get from civilized adults. 

I suppose this is some evolutionarily programmed relic of our psychology, but I truly think that the vast majority of businesses would do better to switch to the number system, where people get a number or name from either a paper ticket (old school, super cheap and easy)  or punching in on a tablet of some kind (high tech, prone to errors and repairs, needlessly expensive).

Other than for the purpose of being closer AT THE VERY END of the line when you have to load up items on a conveyor, the physical construction of a conga line of humans desperate to claim a few square inches of floor space from their forward facing contemporaries is absolutely infuriating and unnecessary and should be replaced with just respecting whom is next without being forced to inch ever closer each time someone on a further up spot has the testicular fortitude to dare move their lower limbs a bit more to their front for any arbitrary reason including the person before them having finished, but it's even more annoying when nobody has finished and people just want to inch further forward.

Planes are another awful one. I always wait to be the last one to board, there is NEVER any reason to stand for 25 minutes among exhausted parents and screaming children, tired businesspeople, luggage encumbered tourists returning home etc., and likewise, I don't get up from my seat until everyone has gotten off, because everyone tries to stand only to crush each other, wait for individuals to pull bags out in different random orders etc. It feels great to sit and watch these people acting like the plane will take off sooner or that customs will take less time or that the baggage carousel workers will somehow work faster if they just trample other humans or waste nigh half hours standing among 300 other passengers with 20kg of luggage EACH on their backs hands and legs, as soon as they have even an inch of breathing room in which to flail pointlessly.

150,t3_rqqpwh,"CMV: It is Possible to be Racist towards Caucasians and Sexist Towards Men, Despite Societal Context","I have heard people say that it's impossible to be Racist towards Caucasians or Sexist Towards Men because of the ""societal context"" that we live in. Caucasians and Men are the ""oppressors"" and one ""cannot oppress the oppressers.""

I want to make clear that I don't deny such a context exists. We live in a society (at least in the USA) where White Men have had, and still have, the greatest advantage out of all ethnic and gender identities. In the past, Caucasians enslaved Black People. Afterwards, they enacted legislation that tilted the tables of society towards their favor and against Black Americans. The ramifications of these things is being felt by Black Americans to this very day, not to mention that there are plenty of Americans with racist attitudes. And it's not just towards Black Americans.

Women have also been oppressed by men. Legally, they received the right to vote much later than men. On a societal level, they were denied career aspirations under some archaic idea of what gender roles ""should be."" There are still men today that condescend women, and hold their value as lesser to men.

That all being said, societal context does not change the definition of a word. Racism is prejudice based on race and sexism is prejudice based on sex. Societal Context doesn't change definition but it DOES affect connotation. A white person using the n-word on a Black person is more severe than a black person calling a white person ""cracker."" The fact that I can spell out one word, but not the other, is just further validation of the existence of this societal context. The n-word is rooted in a deep history of abuse towards Black people and that history amplifies the offense and degree of wrongness.

But a black person calling a white person ""cracker"" is still racist. A woman making bigoted statements about men is still being sexist. It is not ""reverse racism"" or ""reverse sexism."" It is merely racism and sexism. Change my view.",289.0

What got me thinking about this was that when you divide a circle into small pieces the number of pieces is high and not a low number so that way you know exactly how many pieces are in said division. 

Since we can model the year on a circle 12 months, 365 days. Then knowing exactly how many days are in each chunk or month would be more beneficial instead of starting at 1.

152,t3_rqqi8q,"CMV: Every American should have safe shelter, safe food and water, a decent education, and access to medical care if necessary, and the government should provide these things to those who do not have them","I'm a big believer in equal opportunity. But the only way to ensure everybody truly has equal, or even close to equal, opportunity is to provide them with the basic necessities, the things the average person needs to live a good life. Shelter, food and water, a decent education, access to medical care. These are not luxury items and, if the average child of any identity does not have them, I don't think anybody can argue there is equal or close to equal opportunity. 

But instead of making it so the average person of any ethnicity and gender can obtain these things, why not provide them to everybody? 

I disagree with the left about a lot, but this is one area where I strongly agree and the main reason I consider myself to be on the left. I think the government should provide these necessities- Partly because I'm fortunate enough to have had these things in my own life and I can't imagine not having them, partly because I think if a government takes care of its citizens the country will be stronger and more unified, which most people want, and partly because even if people want to argue that adults made bad decisions (which is often not the case) the children of those adults did not. 

I also think it's cruel to deprive somebody of basic necessities even if they did make bad decisions if it is possible to provide them with those necessities.

Whenever something remotely close to what I'm talking about is up for discussion, opponents say the current debt is already too high. I understand where people are coming from, but every successful country goes into some debt as it expands and we spend a lot of money on the military and (much of it goes towards nuclear weapons and if we ever needed our entire arsenal, humanity as we know it would cease to exist) and other programs. Putting some of that money towards social security would make our nation stronger.

The final reason I believe the government should provide these things- if people find themselves in desperate situations, there may be backlash against the government, in some form.

154,t3_rqobbc,CMV: Transcendental Idealism can justify Perspectivism.,"**Edit:** I was apparently significantly wrong in my interpretation of transcendental idealism, sufficiently so to topple the whole argument.  This CMV can be considered thoroughly resolved.

Major caveat up front: I have read a good bit of Kant and Nietzsche, but can't guarantee that I accurately understood either concept above, not being a scholar of philosophy and having studied both without guidance.  I am also unaware of any more recent developments that may be relevant.  Could be some easy deltas there.

In the hopes of facilitating quick correction, I'll try to roughly summarize how I understand those two concepts.

* Transcendental Idealism: our comprehension of the world is dependent on certain fundamental conditions (e.g. causality).  In any world we are capable of comprehending, we can assume those conditions to hold; however, since they are conditions of our comprehension and not of the world as such, we cannot generalize from our experience to the world as it truly is.
* Perspectivism: ""There is no truth, only interpretation"".  Individuals experience the world through their own perspectives, without there necessarily being a singular correct one.

From these definitions, there's a fairly short argument from one to the other.  I get the impression that Kant was working under the assumption that humans share the relevant conditions.  However, if we do away with that assumption, then we get:

* Each individual's comprehension of the world is dependent on certain fundamental conditions, which can be guaranteed to be true of any world comprehensible to them but may not be shared between individuals.  As before, these individual experiences cannot be extrapolated to reason about any underlying reality.
* Without being able to reason about underlying reality, we cannot identify any one correct package of conditions.
* Therefore, each individual's world (as they experience it) necessarily conforms to the fundamental conditions making up their own perspective, with no way to identify a correct perspective.
* Thus, perspectivism.

156,t3_rqm8r1,CMV: Acknowledging that everyone will get covid is not Eugenics,"I was following The Discourse^TM on Twitter today and I cane across these two statements:

&gt; [""Everyone's going to get it,"" is eugenics. Are we all clear on this?](https://twitter.com/shailjapatel/status/1475605944251858949)

&gt; [""It's just the elderly"" is eugenics. ""It's mild unless you're unhealthy"" is eugenics. No paid sick time is eugenics. The whole discourse has been normalizing the deaths of 1000+ people a day by devaluing their lives.](https://twitter.com/djmckenna00/status/1475819203588415491)

I guess there's really two things I want to address here: 1. I do not believe that this is eugenics and 2. Trickier, I don't think this is bad or malicious health policy.

For the first point, as an abled person, there might be an issue of perspective here. There has to be some in-between of an indefinitely long era of pandemic restrictions and sacrificing the elderly and people with disabilities. Acknowledging that everyone is going to get Covid, *and structuring public health around that*, leaves open the possibility to protect at risk people. Everyone getting Covid-19 and not only not dying but not being severely harmed by long-covid should be the goal, and I don't understand how that is eugenics. I just feel like there is some disconnect that I do not understand how this logic extends elsewhere. I don't want to get into the metaphysics of society, but it seems that a lot of things (outside of direct control, like the lack of accessibility I find awful) disproportionately negatively affect people with disabilities. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are 200 circulating respiratory viruses, including other hCOV viruses. If this is the case, then structuring society that we don't try to completely avoid these viruses is not eugenics.

On the second point, it also doesn't seem like bad public health policy. To me, acknowledging that everyone will get Covid-19 is not an advocation that it will negatively affect people: I understood it that through vaccinations and other treatments, everyone will get Covid-19 in a form that isn't debilitating. Acknowledging that Zero-Covid-19 (the possible elimination of the disease) is unrealistic should be a benefit at risk people because it could make ""normal"" (pre-pandemic) more hospitable for people with conditions that make them more at risk.

Being taken by surprise, so close to Christmas, with something you can hardly even process... It is hard. But most of what he did was just, sorry for the term, kind of dumb.

First of all, YouTubers who not only have in YouTube their primary source of income, but also have a team, and ALSO primarily talk about copyrighted material... Should be really careful about obeying the rules. For him to just straight up ignore Japan's rules when his entire channel is anime based... It's complicated.

Being ""fair use"" isn't as clean cut as people think it is. You can't just claim someone was operating under fair use. Only a judge can decide that. Overall, his videos have two big problems which make them less likely to he considered fair use. 

First, the copyrighted material is used in long portions of the videos. You are allowed to use ""just enough"", to make a point. He uses it as a away to make the reviews less boring, which isn't really a good justification. Second, the way he uses those clips isn't a ""fair use"" way. You have to give them a new purpose. If you are using an anime clip, you are totally allowed to talk about the art, the animation, the design and so on. You can talk about the thing itself. But he talks about the characters and events happening, which might not be considered enough of a tranformation.

Another thing is that it's hard for me to believe he didn't know about blocking his videos in Japan. For someone who has been a full time YouTuber for years, has a team and many friends, it sounds really unlikely he never heard of that before. 

I don't really wanna talk a lot about the 2 videos he deleted, about the situation, because it would make this post way too long. His letter is enough of a trainwreck to make me write several paragraphs by itself. 

The last thing I want to adress is how entitled some people act. First of all: USA law isn't the world's law. Mark isn't American, and neither is Toei. YouTube is the only American part here, and they don't really get involved in this. You shouldn't expect them to take a side either.

Taking claimed videos without question is simply their way of protecting themselves. It's really naive to suggest they could just refuse to do what Toei asks.",0.0

Of course there are some people who cannot, for example if someone is under 16 and too young to understand the policies and positions, or they are not of sound mind for another reason. 

The main opposition to people voting will be a) criminals, and b) non citizens.

162,t3_rqio3j,"CMV: Sexual norms should be based on evolutionary biology - not politics, religion, or cultural inertia","Sex is a biological function. Our sexual norms and conceptions of morality have their origins in evolutionary biology.

For example, humans value monogamy because we reach maturity much later than comparable primates so having both parents around ensures that the offspring are more likely to develop to their fullest potential. Incest is frowned upon because it increases the likelihood of harmful recessive traits showing up in the offspring while negatively impacting genetic diversity. Humans have large brains, making pregnancy especially dangerous for females (one in ten women died in childbirth before the 20th century). So we enacted laws to protect our youngest whose bodies are not yet developed and whose social standing in a patriarchal society prevented them from exercising the evolutionary beneficial strategy of [mate choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice). Bestiality provides a prime opportunity for [zoonosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis) and directs reproductive energies away from procreation so societies which outlawed it had a competitive advantage over those which did not.

Fortunately, our social norms regarding sex generally do correspond to evolution *but not perfectly so*. We tend to make blanket statements like ""incest is bad"" where incest is bad simply because ""incest is bad"" rather than examining the evolutionary justifications for why successful societies historically deemed incest to be bad. **The lack of such a critical approach makes our social norms and attitudes regarding sex inflexible and thus hostage to religious, political, and cultural inertia.** It removes the possibility for us to make new decisions based on new scientific discoveries (e.g. the widespread use of effective contraceptive methods and antibiotics in the latter half of the 20th century), changing social realities (e.g. the AIDS pandemic and the shift away from having large families), and the possibility of enacting more nuanced laws that can better deal with the complexities of the issue at hand (e.g. having sex with a chihuahua or pangolin should be treated more harshly than having sex with a Great Dane).

In an evolutionary biology-informed approach to sex:

* **Homosexuality:** Homosexuality should be fine. Historically, there were evolutionary pressures both for and against it. They were less likely to mate and produce offspring so this would have been a drawback at a time when more numbers meant strength. However, it is also believed that homosexuals may have provided a survival benefit through the [""gay uncle"" effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#Gay_uncle_hypothesis) where they would assume caregiver roles by looking after related family members. This would have been useful in hunter-gatherer societies where mortality rates during one's reproductive years were high and is evident by the fact that homosexuals are still disproportionately represented in the modern male nursing population. That being said, none of this matters in terms of today's society so one should leave them be.
* **Contraception:** Historically, societies which opposed contraception through religious or political decree would have expanded more quickly over those that didn't - giving them an evolutionary advantage. Today, the drive to expand one's population at all costs no longer exists, so the debate over contraception should have ended a long time ago (not to mention their undeniable protective benefits from STDs).
* **Monogamy:** Monogamy should be encouraged. However, if equally effective methods of raising children can be proven to work (e.g. three way marriages), then they could be considered as well.
* **Incest:** The severity of incest laws should be directly correlated with the danger to the fetus. Incest laws should not apply to post-menopausal women, women with hysterectomies, distant relatives, or men who have undergone vasectomies.
* **Infidelity:** Infidelity involving partners without dependent children or those who have children who have left the nest should be treated as harmless.
* **Age disparity:** In relationships with a large age difference, gender should absolutely matter. A 30 year old woman dating a 15 year old boy isn't the same thing as a 30 year old man dating a 15 year old girl.
* **Miscegenation:** Miscegenation laws should be struck down and intermarriage should be incentivized. We can see the negative effects of inbreeding in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [who suffer from health problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_genetics_of_Jews#Ashkenazi_diseases) due to their insular marriage practices. Likewise, the same is also true of our purebred cats and dogs.
* **Bestiality:** The severity of bestiality laws should be determined on the likelihood of zoonotic infection affecting the community. Any physical harm that accompanies the act can be treated as an entirely separate issue.
* **Sex education:** Sex education should be completely revamped and brought back into biology classrooms, which is where they originated before being taken over by politicians from the left (through comprehensive sex education) and the right (through abstinence-only sex education). It should be taught only by those with biology degrees and every statement regarding human sexuality that comes out of a teacher's mouth should be accompanied by a corresponding citation from a peer-reviewed evolutionary biology journal - just like the way mathematicians must support their claims with logical proofs in order for them to gain acceptance. The scientific method should be explained beforehand and debate should be encouraged, with both sides of any argument being explored.

Note that many of these positions are neither strictly left wing nor right wing positions. That's because sex shouldn't be about being left wing or right wing or Democrat or Republican or Christian or Muslim. Sex should be about the science and the science only.",0.0
163,t3_rqhukc,"CMV: The political left should take the opportunity to embrace the political right's newfound discovery of the concept of ""My Body, My Choice.""","Two very different groups with two very different agendas are now using the same catchphrase. ""My body, my choice"" has been a rallying cry of pro-choice activists for the past 50+ (?) years. The right, or at least the outspoken cross-section of the right who has been railing against public health measures for the past 2 (!!!) years now has recently flaunted the saying to push back against mask and vaccine mandates. 

Abortion rights and access throughout Republican lead states are being rolled back and are poised to succeed thanks to the political games and partisanship of the different branches of our federal government. Meanwhile, we're in the middle of a catastrophic new wave of coronavirus that has only begun to punish our hospitals over the course of this winter season. 

This is set against the backdrop of a national political scene where the two sides are at each other's throats. Mass violence is threatened every day and our national unity is, at least for the time being, a broken and discarded thing. We are, in essence, in the midst of a cold civil war that has been raging since the mid-90s. But thanks to the megaphone that is social media, I believe we've all felt that cold war warming up. 

We're in a bad place and I think everyone could use a win and I know we desperately need to find a place of common ground. I believe that this is a win/win/win. 

The key argument of abortion rights is defining the personhood of a fetus. For those who rail against abortion, the idea of killing a child is abhorrent because that's what they believe a fetus to be. A living, feeling, knowing child. That unborn child deserves autonomy and protection under the law. This is also the kill your grandma for the economy group, so it could be argued that even if a more scientific understanding of embryology supported their claim, their ideals aren't rooted too deeply. 

Public health mandates are designed to mitigate adverse health effects to the greatest number of people. In the case of a highly infectious disease, that means educating and controlling the activity of people to stem the spread of a contagion. We've gotten as far as we're going to get with this. The battle lines have been formed and the anti-vaxxers are willing to go down swinging (or gasping) for their cause. I don't believe we can put this genie back in the bottle for this pandemic (or for the next one as long as this group is still kicking around). And while I'm all for protecting the immuno-compromised and the underserved, I believe that the group who actually cares about public health has already been vaccinated and already engages in safe practices. I think everyone else is a lost cause and that this is as good as it's going to get. I also think that further political action (mask/vaccine mandates) lack the political capital and will only result in political and violent backlash. 

I am no longer concerned with the health and safety of the anti-vax community. They believe what they believe and I don't think they can be saved. I also believe that they are an inherent danger to their families and their communities. Giving them validation, as repugnant as it feels, has the possibility of pushing along legislation that assists in protecting medical autonomy from legislative oversight in the future without giving away anything that we currently possess (aka public health stability). And while I'm certain there would be push-back from political leaders (who do no actually care about fetuses, but correctly recognize the political power that anti-abortion carries as a political wedge), these same people have lost the narrative and control of Q and the Gang and with just a touch of finesse (these aren't smart people) you could ignite their own grassroots solidarity with the pro-choice movement to keep ""tha GuBerMint oUttA mA hEllTHcAiR.""

EDIT: Many of the responses point to my assumptions. For clarity, here are my assumptions: 

* There is ideologic inconsistency that can be found in any group, but it is particularly prominent on the right. 
* The right will never be an ally to the left and will almost always operate in bad faith.
* The fight against vaccine and mask measures are not play acting. The people we watch in the videos railing against the retail workers genuinely believe in their fight and that they are standing up for personal freedom. That is a currency that should not be overlooked.
* Arguing for pro-choice on the back of anti-vaxxing is a lost cause, but arguing for restrictions on government overreach with regards to medical autonomy is not. I'm more concerned with establishing support for legal precedent, not changing anybody's mind.",0.0
164,t3_rqhlwc,CMV: We need a 100% inheritance tax above a certain amount,"I believe that as a society we need to strive towards complete meritocracy.

166,t3_rqf0mz,CMV: it's petty and immature to hold a grudge against someone for how they acted while playing a social engineering game.,"Perhaps it isn't the perfect genre description, but for the purpose of this, ""social engineering games"" are games in which either the explicit purpose is convincing others you're telling the truth (among us, town of Salem, mafia, secret Hitler) as well sa games where it can serve a significant benefit even though it may not be the objective of the game (risk, monopoly, dokapon kingdom). Basically, games where various forms of lieing, trickery, and deception are either encouraged or required by nature of the game.

As someone who enjoys these types of games, I find them to facilitate long play sessions, even if individual rounds are short, and they are really good for socializing with the group. Because of this, I play these games a lot. And while most people are fine, I find a disproportionately large amount of people hold real-world grudges beyond the game over actions taken in the game when compared to other games. It's perfectly fine, ideal even, if you hold those grudges while playing, even many rounds later since social engineering requires information about me, but it's just immature to bring those grudges into our real lives.

I find it immature because it reminds me of the spoiled kids that get mad at you for not letting them cheat at every turn and win every game, except in this case, it isn't even just winning/losing. I've had people hold grudges against me over games *they won*. What's more petty than holding a grudge against someone for not beating them in a game? If people wanted me to play with a handicap because they aren't up to the full game, that's fine. I'll gladly hand it to them, especially in games like risk where there's much more to the game than deception, but nobody ever asks, they just treat it like I should've known they weren't looking to legimately play.

I figure since it's so common, there's a chance I might be in the wrong, but from my perspective, the most honorable method of competing is to give it my best try unless there was a specific agreement beforehand stating otherwise, and to not give it my all is immensely disrespectful to those I'm playing against.",874.0
167,t3_rqey4b,CMV: Sex is not a “need”.,"

Sex is not a human “need” like food, water, and shelter. Sex, or even masturbation, is not necessary for a human’s survival. Sex is something that is needed for the survival of our species overall, since it’s how we reproduce, but it’s not necessary for the survival of an individual human. 

Plus, men and women require food, water, and shelter roughly equally, whereas the drive for sex mostly comes from men. Women’s sexuality, with some exceptions, is one or more of the following: 

1) Only desiring sex within the confines of a monogamous, committed relationship. So things like casual sex, sex with multiple partners at once, etc, are out. 

2) Having raw physical attraction to very few men they see. So even IF a woman is interested in a casual sexual encounter or a FWB situation, it’s only with a very attractive man.

168,t3_rqdksx,CMV: Mainstream bra companies knowingly profit by convincing women to wear unsuitable sizes,"tldr: Victoria's secret is keeping secrets and a ""DD"" cup is on the small side of things, relative to build.

Many women think that bras are simply uncomfortable by design or even believe there's something wrong with their bodies. Mainstream non-specialist bra companies profit by carrying fewer sizes and convincing their customers that this is as good as it gets. Since they're involved in the science of making bras, it is hardly imaginable that it is mere incompetence. That's my conspiracy theory, anyway.

Bra sizing is quite a bit more complex than A=small, D=big. The cup refers to the ratio between the band size and breast size. A 38A has the same volume as 30DD. The shape will be different, though. But if you want to produce a limited amount of sizes, you could convince your customer that they should be wearing 34C, which has the same volume, but will not provide the support needed (support in a bra comes from a securely fitting band size). The obsession with breasts in our society often means that people will get fixated on being a particular cup size, even as their body changes (""I think my breasts are small, so I have to be an A cup"").

And if you browse bra-review sites such as bratabase.com, you'll see that cup sizes go on and on and on. One of the largest regularly produced (which means somewhat regularly occurring) cup size is a British ""KK"", which is the 16th cup size starting with ""A"". ""Ds"" are barely quarter of the way there.

I think companies benefit from reinforcing these stereotypes, which includes misleading size charts. There is nothing wrong with catering to a select portion of the market. There might be something wrong with trying to push the idea that the rest of the market either doesn't exist at all or is somehow abnormal.

I've never seen an end of life for software not reliant on some web service recieve this type of hard cutoff with intent to kill the program. Microsoft doesn't EOL windows versions by trying to brick every computer running them, they just let it go. I can pick up an old iPhone and it will turn on and run and old version of ios without support, and Apple won't have bricked the phone. But flash? Nope. It repeatedly tries to kill itself deliberately.

Why do I believe this creates more vulnerabilities? Sure, it isn't all that difficult for content to be changed out of flash. Assuming you're still actively updating that content, have interest in continued support, and have the resources and know-how to do so. Basically, corporate interests. But the absolutely monumental amount of content on flash that doesnt have that support isn't going to magically convert itself to a different format. And because all of these things still need flash, flash will still be run by a lot of people. People who are significantly more likely to either downgrade flash or need to re-download from a 3rd party because it I installed itself. I consider myself lucky enough to have multiple computers and removable storage to always have a backup of flash when I slip up and let it delete itself, but I imagine a lot of people aren't. And where do those people go when their flash dies? They certainly aren't going to learn to port someone else's content to Html5. They're going to find a download link for flash, and from a quick search, there's not a lot of ones that seem credible near the top of searches. So people now need to expose themselves to more risks simply because flash tried to EOL itself rather than just sitting there to die slowly. Yes, there are flash emulators, but they still aren't perfect, and we're slow to fill in functionality after flash died, so I imagine that not many people ended up using them over pirated flash.",3.0
172,t3_rq8tp6,"CMV: The standards for women's bodies are much, much lower than the standards for men's.","Let's say you have a man and a woman of the same height and they're both obese. For a woman to get an ideal body, she has to lose her excess fat and her journey stops there. On the other hand, the man has to lose that extra fat to become skinny, to which point he has to build his weight up again through muscle. Otherwise, he'd be considered a skinny rat. Sure, woman may find it a bit harder to lose weight due to requiring less calories per day, however when the man and the woman are of the same height the difference may not be that much and this extra effort is likely eclipsed my men having higher standard regarding body fat percentage. (for men, the ideal is 7% while for women's anything below 25% is A-okay).

Additionally, despite the belief that women have higher facial standards, I think otherwise. From what I've heard from women irl and online, women considers facial attractiveness as important if not more than physical attractiveness. If anything, I think women sorta have it easier as well since a plain woman can offset her plainess by being really good at putting on makeup, whereas a plain looking man will just stay like that for the rest of his life unless he gets plastic surgery.

Finally, we got other masculine standards that are genetically determined and so we don't really have a lot of leeway to change. Things like: height, dick size, shoulder length, masculine handsome face (since we can't use make up), etc. Sure you say women have to worry about breast size as well, but that can be fixed with surgery",0.0

176,t3_rq02o9,CMV: We should be morally and perhaps legally opposed to teens having intercourse with each other,"Obviously, if one teenager were trying to rape another, we should be opposed to that, but that's not the topic that I'm trying to get at. Young teens, even if they were to engage ""consensually"", is something we should be morally and arguably legally opposed to. But why do I think this? Well first, we have to analyze why it's wrong for an adult to have intercourse with an underage person, even if the underage person ""consented"". The typicaly answer given is that children cannot provide informed consent, and that is correct. To expand on this point however, children aren't rational agents, or at the very least, they have extremely limited rationality, and thus, they have extremely limited rights to bodily autonomy.

Now, this doesn't mean that we can harvest the organs of children without their consent, even if that action ended up saving the life of another. That's not what I mean by their rights to autonomy being limited. What I mean, and I'm sure others understand what I mean as well, is that agents who are generally more rational must do what's in the child's self-interest and the flourishing of their well-being, even if the child's immediate desires contradict with those goals due to their irrationality. We do this in multiple ways.

It's immoral and illegal to let a minor take drugs or other dangerous substances. It's immoral and illegal to not give your child an education. It's immoral and illegal to let a child work in a factory. Even if a child claimed that it was their immediate desire to engage in such activities such as skipping out on school or taking drugs, it's still immoral. 

For the reasons we would oppose a teen having intercourse with an adult, even if it was ""consensual"", we should also therefore apply them to relationships where only underage agents are involved. It is an irrational behavior for teens to engage in sexual relationships among themselves. So, it is immoral to allow them to do engage in such activities, and it should also be illegal seeing as how we think it's reasonable to make it illegal for children to engage in certain other activities.

I don't think that we should treat teens as criminals if they're caught engaging in such activities. At most, a little extra education is called for so that a teen can be prevented from doing the same thing while they're still young and irrational. I also still think sex ed is important and should be taught. But I don't see the problem with teaching safe sex practices while also requiring abstinence at the same time. 

I'm also not culturally conservative in case if anyone had that suspicion. But I also see no problem with the state and parents getting involved more in the lives of children and facilitating a culture which encourages kids to avoid self-destructive behaviors and tendencies.",0.0

There should be jobs available that the prisoners can take and then buy food and a room. This will save on tax payers’ money being wasted on prisoners. Additionally, it will allow prisoners to keep in touch with their skills or develop new ones that will allow them to be a better fit once out.

As for prisoners who refuse to work, they can starve (same thing that happens to a lot of innocent people) and there should be sleeping quarters without bed and roof where they can sleep. Of course, this system should only apply to work capable prisoners.

184,t3_rpnxjk,CMV: Modern communists ought to rebrand.,"**TL:DR** The term ""communism"" has been too stained to the detriment of any movement, trying to redeem it rehabilitates and lumps you with some really bad hombres.

**Background:**

* I'm not a scholar of communism. I have a decent knowledge of history, but the closest I got to communist theory was listening to ""Revolutions"" podcast by Mike Duncan and reading Wikipedia. If I'm grossly wrong about something, I'm willing to listen.
* I'd like to abstain from ""true communism is impossible/viable/good/bad"" discussion because of aforementioned lack of knowledge.
* I have a baggage of being from an ex-communist country.

**A couple of pre-conceptions I don't particularly want to argue about:**

* *Marxist-Leninist totalitarian regimes produced mountains of corpses and repressed society, above and beyond other government forms we deem acceptable.* Liberal democratic governments have done their share of genociding, but Marxist-Leninist rap sheet stands out to me as uniquely terrible. There's a reason some countries equate those regimes to fascist ones.
* *Communism is cool again with a new wave of people identifying as such.* It might be a comparatively niche thing, but with communist streamers/youtubers getting 100s of thousands of views, I think it's popular enough to talk about.

**The view**:

Communist ideology is inexorably tied to USSR with its satellites and People's Republic of China: the former was a 20th century superpower with half the planet as its sphere of influence and OG of state communism, the latter is a current superpower with 2nd biggest economy and 20% of the world population. If an alien from Neptune asks you about communism, and you **don't** tell him about USSR and PRC, you're purposefully ignoring two blood-soaked elephants in the room.

Now, if you're a Stalinist or Maoist and want to be connected to those totalitarian cats, by all means go ahead put ""communist"" in your twitter bio. Everyone else doing so is fighting a losing battle: the things those two have done are so terrible that anyone with a surface level of history will have a ""hand touching a hot plate"" reaction similar to fascism. As they should in my opinion, ""never forget"" and such.

So if you do adhere to a different form of communism (which hopefully puts some breaks on mass state-killings) or even just general nondescript Marxism, you should call yourself cooperativist or Zizekist or any other label that fits to put as much distance between yourself and the M-L gang.

186,t3_rpmaos,"CMV: ""Cloth masks are little more than facial decorations"" in the context of preventing COVID-19 spread, and should not be mandated in most situations.","This specific verbiage comes from a longer quote by Dr. Leana Wen, a medical analyst for CNN as well as a prominent and influential MD in her own right, discussing recommendations for people attending the Times Square for New Years'. She is one of the more vocal ardent supporters of restrictions on the unvaccinated as well as government-enforced NPIs. 

https://twitter.com/DrLeanaWen/status/1473045198980665344?s=20

&gt;Wear a three-ply surgical mask. Don't wear a cloth mask. Cloth masks are little more than facial decorations; there's no place for them in light of Omicron. 

I'm not sure from the context whether Dr. Wen holds this position for SARS2 in general, or just for Omicron. My view to be changed is that **if regulations are warranted, they should be for surgical masks or above. If recommendations are given to people who are either vulnerable or come in close contact with the vulnerable, *only* N95 respirators or equivalent should be recommended.**

(A position I hold more weakly but will still accept deltas for is that even surgical masks should not be mandated, only N95s or equivalent.)

*****


####I. SARS2 is airborne/aerosol-spread.


Before Covid, there was little evidence that cloth or surgical masks were particularly effective against respiratory viruses. The mask guidance starting in early March and April 2020 was based on the assumption that most transmission was from droplets from infected persons within 6 feet. Even as late as September 2020, [CDC was still prevaricating](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/21/health/cdc-reverts-airborne-transmission-guidance/index.html) on the role of aerosol transmission. Since then, WHO and CDC generally recognize the role of aerosols, but most of the mask guidance only makes sense if droplet transmission is dominant. 

Cloth and surgical masks work well for pathogens that spread through droplets, but

####II. Cloth masks do not block most aerosols

https://www.acgih.org/covid-19-fact-sheet-worker-resp/

https://1lnfej4c7wie44voctzq1r57-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Table-crop-768x265.jpg

This chart using CDC numbers shows the time to infectious dose for someone not infected with COVID-19, based on whether the source and/or receiver are wearing cloth, surgical, or fitted N95, with estimates of mask leakage of 75%, 50%, and 10% respectively. These numbers are based on 15 minutes of &lt; 6ft distance from an infected person, both maskless. (This is likely an *under*-estimate, both for time and distance, see: SARS2 is airborne.) According to the chart, if 15 minutes both maskless isn't safe, 27 minutes both cloth masks, or 60 minutes both surgical isn't safe.

This also assumes delta or maybe even a previous variant. The base time for Omicron is likely far less than 15 minutes, perhaps less than a minute, while the rest of the values on the chart should scale roughly linearly. In that case, if 1 minute isn't safe maskless, 2 minutes with both cloth or 4 minutes with both surgical isn't safe.  

####III. Fitted N95s do block most aerosols.

The good news is that you wearing an N95 in a room with an unmasked infectious person is safer than being in a room where both of you are wearing surgical masks. This means your ability to protect yourself is greater than any protection mask mandates can give you (unless they mandate N95 FFRs). 

N95 and equivalents were in very short supply in early 2020, but they aren't anymore (or wouldn't be with appropriate policy decisions). Those who need or want protection or source control should use them, and those who don't should not be required to wear minimally effective masks that give little more than the illusion of protection.",0.0
187,t3_rplc0v,"CMV: the satirical movie Don't Look Up failed to address the biggest problem about climate change action, namely the difficulty of having to get people to change almost every aspect of their lifestyle","I did enjoy the movie. It was neither particularly good nor particularly bad, maybe a bit long near the end.

The satire was very on the nose, but to an extent self-aware as they did also poke fun at the idea of liberal-themed celebrities endorsing climate change action near the end.

Overall, it reads like yet another example of well-to-do elites lecturing people without addressing the actual solution. The choice of the ensemble cast strongly reminded me of those celebrities singing Imagine together or whatever song it was, if that makes sense as an analogy. A high dose of self-satisfaction but no real connection to reality or the crux of the problem being discussed.

For climate change to be mitigated, we in the developed world (the target audience for the satire) would need to alter our lives to an extremely significant degree. The actors involved in the production of the movie would have to abandon probably all of their luxury and travel; their own lives would have to become unrecognizable. As the COVID crisis has shown, even an absurdly high reduction in human activity all over the world (absurd in the sense of it being politically impossible to achieve in normal situations) led to a comparatively tiny reduction in emissions.

The movie is adept at satirizing our lack of attention span and inability to focus on important crises, but it fails to address the actual meat of climate change (no pun intended) which is the difficulty of greatly altering our lives and doing it all in a cooperative way. People will cite the example of companies being the source of emissions but that argument makes no sense since the companies produce these emissions to meet global consumption demands by the citizens themselves. The problem of climate change is not merely a case of a small group of people behaving badly but a fundamental problem with our lifestyles.

The actors who probably strongly and honestly believe in the film's message will not alter their lifestyle. Neither will most of the well-to-do or not so well-to-do people involved in the production. That doesn't mean they are not allowed to talk about climate change: I do not see them as hypocrites. Even if they were hypocrites, I would not care. *My view is just that they are missing a supplementary satirical layer concerning themselves and ourselves as the audience that nods along while watching: the fact that we are not realistically going to exercise the will to change our lifestyles until we are forced to at the last moment by unavoidable physical limitations.*",0.0

I can't imagine contractors are complaining about having higher bids for their work. I'm largely talking about the ""labor shortages"" coming after federally supplemented unemployment benefits ended.

I still keep seeing signs in retail + restaurants alongside reports on the news that there's a labor shortage. The way I've seen this talked about is pretty disgusting to me so I'm probably biased.

Firstly, I don't understand how this is even possible without a mandated maximum wage. I know a dollar or two above minimum wage is usually treated as a maximum wage for most retail jobs, but there's not actually a law forcing this.

All the employers need to do is purchase the labor they want at the market rate. If they can't find people, they aren't paying the market rate. It has nothing to do with a shortage. Why aren't employers able to pay the market rate for their labor. They pay it for everything else and transfer the costs to the consumer. Why is labor an issue?

The only cause I can think of is that large franchised companies aren't allowed to figure in the cost of labor into their pricing.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: ahh sorry got busy, will start responding again. Also I definitely should have clarified, I'm primarily talking about retail and service industries that overwhelmingly pay minimum wage or near it.

Edit 2: I'm realizing my initial post was way too general, and relied too much on a subjective view of the messaging I've personally seen on the news and from large retail businesses. There certainly is a labor shortage as the economy is rebalancing itself. I still think retail storefronts restaurants and other non-livable wage jobs are pushing a gross cynical narrative as to why they can't find workers. Neither do I believe most of these companies have made a fair effort to raise prices based on their own labor costs (there hasn't even been enough time for this to equilibrate in most cases).

189,t3_rpkrio,CMV: There are no good religious/faith-based explanations for why wild animal suffering exists.,"Religion apologists have presented a good amount of theodicies to defend or justify the problem of evil or existence of human suffering over the years. However, these explanations (usually based on free will) do not apply towards non-human suffering. 

We will keep it simple and avoid discussion of any suffering of animals that are inflicted by humans. So we ignore any hunting, farming, roadkill, etc. However, even removing that variable, it seems to me that if you added up all of the suffering that humans have experienced throughout all of time, it would be just a grain of sand on top of the Empire State Building that encompasses the equivalent for animals in the wild.

If this universe is indeed a product of intelligent design, why does the current system of wolves needing to satisfy their hunger involve mercilessly ripping into living and breathing baby deer? Why does a volcano erupt and cause the burning alive of so many innocent creatures?

It just seems to me, if there really was an almighty, benevolent, all-knowing creator out there, then the system that is in place would be a lot better and would've avoided all the current needless suffering that is being experienced by wild animals all throughout the world.

I have not found satisfaction in any of the answers presented so far.

*It helps prevent overpopulation*

-&gt; God could have limited their reproductive capabilities. Or done one of a hundred other methods to limit population growth while bypassing suffering

*Animals don't actually feel pain or suffer*

-&gt; Watch any video on youtube of a factory farm or animal slaughter and tell me that there's no pain being experienced. If animals can't feel pain, why did animal trainers in the old days whip horses into behaving? Surely it wouldn't help achieve that if the horse doesn't feel pain. There's even a talking donkey in the Bible that laments why its owner keeps beating it.

*It's the circle of life/predator-prey system at work*

-&gt; God could have made all animals herbivores. Most of the animals we humans eat are herbivores anyway.

Nobody in my immediate family has ever retired,  it simply wasn't an option. But my income has exploded. Yay me. 

Anyway, my friend and his wife never had to work much  because their parents are well off  I would say rich,  but reddit freaks out about that word. But they're upper middle class. He works around 8 hours a week, and his wife about the same. They have two kids and vacation often. His parents are divorced and both own multiple homes. Recently his dad sold an apartment in SF for 1.2 million dollars. All of the money has been put into a trust and will be dispersed in full as his inheritance. 

Now, I know this isn't common, but it isn't uncommon either.  I have a lot of friends in similar situations. Me, when my grandpa died we actually went into debt due to medical bills amd after care expenses. He was farmer who worked his whole life, was a wwii vet and even with the VA medical care we had around 100k in expenses for his final years. 

Now. Let's say I make 120k a year, which would put me in the top 10% of earners in the US. After taxes let's say I've got 85k take home. And I end up saving around  half of that, which is quite a lot. So that would give me 40k a year in savings. It would take me 30 years to save the same amount that my friend had plopped into his lap. Of course there's no inheritance tax either, so this all goes directly into his pocket. 

Even with a good job, there's simply no way to get ahead and ""compete"" with those who simply inherit their wealth. And often times those that inherit these exorbitant sums have no clue just how good they've got it.",1866.0

Another group, nearly twice as many died from cancer than from Covid.

Yet another group, stroke and diabetes combined accounted for deaths equal to roughly 75% the count of Covid deaths.

**At this point in time, if the vast majority of Covid deaths are unvaccinated people, then let it be the choice of the individual.** If your choice is to vaccinate, and you are protected then let the unvaccinated carry the burden of their choice.

\-Where is the illegalization or excessive taxation of empty sugar foods and beverages?  
\-Where is the illegalization of artificial food products that have been banned in other developed countries?  
\-Where is the subsidization of healthy foods?  
\-Where is the social stigma around junk foods?  
\-Where is the mandate that any company with over 100 employees require their overweight employees to exercise (excluding those who have weight gain for medical reasons)

195,t3_rpbpk1,cmv: The “Status Quo” that progressives oppose is really just a merit-based society,"Progressives continually rail against this mysterious “status quo” as applied to political policy, economic systems, and social issues.

My understanding of the anti status quo movement is one of renters vs property owners, entrepreneurs vs hourly wage earners, and socio-normal persons vs perceived social minorities. 

Every argument I have seen among the anti status quo camp has been one that discounts the value of a merit-based society upon which every successful government and social institution has thrived. 

Example 1. Tax the rich. Those with the most talents and dedication who have produced the most value within a merit-based economic system must subsidize the lives of those who have demonstrated less merit. The end goal of  challenging the economic status quo is meant to leverage the power of government to favor those who have demonstrated less merit. I place an emphasis here on legislation such as student loan forgiveness and taxes on unrealized capital gains, rather than the more general social safety net that has existed for decades. 

Example 2. Weaponized social policy and social norms. The last ten years of social policy and social demands from progressives could be characterized as a deflection of individual merit-based responsibility, and demands for equal treatment from society (in addition to equal treatment from the government), without any significant efforts to build intergroup relationships and public trust organically. Historically speaking, persecuted American minorities such as Italians, Irish, Blacks, Jews, Mormons, etc. all successfully built a place for themselves within American society as the result of merit-based efforts to demonstrate competence and build inter group relationships over time. My claim is that modern social progressives seek to shortcut merit-based social expectations.

196,t3_rpamsn,CMV: The Housing is not the result of “commodification” or “investment properties”,"Housing costs are simply a function of supply and demand. The reason why commodification of housing is claimed to be a problem is because it further constrains supply and increases demand, but this itself is just reaffirming the point.

Local zoning restrictions prevent building anything other than SFHs, and where other forms of multi family homes are legal, they often require upzoning which can be a lengthy and expensive process. Setback requirements and parking minimums further increase the costs of compliance. All these costs not only get passed onto the consumer, but also lead to less housing supply, ergo higher costs.

If federal governments stepped in to legalize everything up to and including midrise apartments everywhere, developer could simply build housing to meet demand without having to comply with complex regulations and increasing supply. 

Exhibit A: Japan. Median house price in the greater Tokyo area costs under 400K American. Rents for reasonably sized apartments are often below 2000K per month. This is all because housing supply can actually increase with demand.

The housing crisis seems like a clear cut case of a government failure, and radical solutions like nationalizing real estate will not be necessary.",1.0
197,t3_rp9o5y,"CMV: Arguments Against Transgender Rights Like Prison Housing Are Sexist, Irrational, and Boring","The typical argument will go like the CMV post before this, roughly:

* If we let transgender people use neutral spaces there will be a loss of control over the space. Like bathrooms prisons are a shared public space. 

* Transgender prisoners or prisoners posing to be women will falsely use this pretense to gain access to female prisoners they normally wouldn’t have access to. 

* The female prisoners, now without protection, will be subject to repetitive or appalling abuse by transgender or false transgender prisoners. 

* Maybe the prison itself will excuse this tragedy by distributing condoms or similar things tangential to the right to privacy or autonomy. Things will spin out of control. 

My view is this argument is repetitious nonsense and illogical. Here’s why:

* This already happens in many American prisons. The federal bureau that assigns and houses prisoners does so on a case-by-case basis ([p. 24](https://www.bop.gov/resources/pdfs/legal_guide_march_2019.pdf#page29)). Many state prisons do so. Though there are fewer federal women institutions the agency is required to review transgender casework already, and does house transgender women in female housing. 

* This process requires many layers of review. A prisoner doesn’t ask for a new unit. They apply for it through administrative, medical and legal channels. Each layer is responsible for the safety of the inmate and the unit. The inmate would have to fake their desires and self-image throughout months of review by specialists, lawyers, and a giant police agency with its own medical team. 

* This already happens for another reason: male guards patrol female units. 41% of female prison guards are male. In the bureau of prisons [98%](https://ocnjdaily.com/prison-reform-stacy-scuderi-speaks-florida-prisons-inhumane/) of sexual assaults on female inmates are by male guards. In New York 15% of female inmates report male sexual assault. 

&gt;	Studies have found that male correctional officers often abuse their position and demand sex in exchange for favors, including drugs, contraband, and access to educational programs. Additionally, prison officials have also been found to threaten inmates with false reports of bad behavior, planting drugs in the inmates’ cells, and withholding visitation with their children if inmates do not perform sexual acts upon them. Although women make up just 7% of the state prison population, they comprise 46 percent of all prison sexual abuse victims. This systematic issue is prevalent in nearly every female prison complex in the United States

Male guards can always strip search a female inmate under proper procedure. It seems that transgender women and women at birth both would be in greater jeopardy in a female unit. 

* The belief that women are sitting in prison waiting to be victimized is plain sexist. As seen, women are assaulted more often by guards than each other or male inmates. Instead, the female inmates will certainly, like all units, [regulate themselves outside official channels](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michelle-Burman/publication/248921162_Contemporary_Patterns_of_Female_Gangs_in_Correctional_Settings/links/60e7b82930e8e50c01f04b1f/Contemporary-Patterns-of-Female-Gangs-in-Correctional-Settings.pdf?origin=publication_detail). A gang is one example:

&gt;	If faced with physical or verbal threats, gangs will respond with violence to neutralize those threats. Our primary finding among females in correctional settings is that loose associations are formed--with many existing prior to incarceration--but they often are not recognized as gangs by correctional staff. 

&gt;	As this study has revealed, female offenders are indeed involved in gang-related activity, but the manner in which their behavior manifests itself behind the walls differs from male gang members. The functions of gangs for female members do not have the territorial and violent dimensions that are characteristic of male activity within prisons. Female gangs, like their male counterparts, serve to provide structure and support for their members but do so in ways different from some male gangs. As a general rule, female gangs are less violent. 

&gt;	Conflict within the gang and with other gangs tends to be more verbal and less physical and, within the correctional setting, often the result of failed relationships or ""jailhouse romances."" The attraction and influence of gang membership is as pronounced in females as males...

In other words, according to opponents of transgender rights and a grab bag of other rights-focused terms, a male inmate would need to hide their intent to assault female inmates from doctors, lawyers, and police over a period of months to years. 

If successful, the inmate would need to take advantage of their new housing to victimize female inmates without guards anticipating or knowing the risk. 

The inmate would have to do so knowing they are now trapped inside a housing unit with women already willing to regulate each other over things like drugs and dating by violence, potentially former violent criminals before incarceration, but would fail to regulate a man preying on them inside their own  house. 

That repetitive argument doesn’t add up to me. It’s sexist, ignorant of reality, dismissive of female strength and social intelligence, reliant on the image of a male guard preserving order in a female unit instead of female autonomy through self-agency, and a fig leaf for anti-transgender views.

If the woman wants to keep the baby though the man had willingly provided capital and a safe/legal place to perform an abortion, yet she still declines, he should not be held liable for child support. If he is unable to lay or  doesnt provide means for an abortion to occur than it is his responsibility to raise the child as well, either directly or moneterily.

200,t3_rp1nxu,CMV: The opioid crisis is a manufactured panic in order to maintain public support of the war on drugs.,"FACT: Since 2012 Drs have reduced the number of rx written for opiates by ~100 million. In that same time period overdose deaths jumped from ~20000 all the way to ~100000. 

There isn't an opiate crisis there's a warfare crisis. The war on drugs is driving overdose deaths. It is self perpetual, the more deaths and drug related crime and violence, the more money is spent on law enforcement programs targeting illegal drugs and stricter policy is shaped to crack down on illegal drugs and increases restrictions on legal ones. 

Patients who cannot get adequate health care treatment will seek to self medicate if their provider does not accurately and effectively treat those experiencing pain. This leads to patients seeking illegal sources. Absent of a medical professionals monitoring and oversight, self medicating patients ultimately find themselves on a path that leads to abuse, addiction, and ultimately overdose deaths. Anyone who thinks of a person seeking illegal drugs to relieve physical or even psychological pain and distress as being criminal or exhibiting behavioral deviance or is violating a social contract or norm has a fundamental bias and defect in their logic. 

First, I don't want to minimize or diminish the role of accountability or the obligation every person has to be responsible for their own actions and own the consequences of choices they make. The end user of drugs makes the choice to do something wrong, sure.... but if you follow the chain of responsibility past the individual then you will find that Drs are wrong to deny care or withhold proper treatment, healthcare providers/companies are wrong for setting policy restrictions on physicians who work for them that dictate the treatments options they must follow while employed, politicians who take money and are influenced by pharma/healthcare lobbying that go and pass bad laws and ineffective policy while making Public statements that are overstated and exaggerated in order to get more media attention and public support by giving the appearance of taking significant action on a public health issue while in reality they are promoting the interests of corporate lobbying efforts. The media takes it's cue from political actions and current political focus topics and shape the public's opinion and steer the public debate by sensationalizing the narrative in order to boost ratings. This leads to the general public having contempt and losing empathy for those ""criminal"" addicts at the bottom of the chain and leads to an increasing demand for the problem to be fixed by regulations and enforcement by police and the justice system. It is a perpetually endless, cyclical, self reinforced crisis that generates neverending growth by feeding into itself. 

This feedback loop traps every person affected by the crisis by links in a chain that guard the process from being disrupted. These chain links are made up of the hypocritical false narratives that present as a duality within the minds of the public about drugs, for example... 
Being identified by the public as a criminal user rather than a patient treating pain leads to further discrimination and stigma, decreasing that person's potential with a criminal record that follows them for life, limiting opportunity and providing barriers to mobility .
 Employers won't hire a drug addict and that's perfectly legal, discriminating against a job applicant based on an existing medical issue is a violation of federal laws. 
A Dr refusing to give controlled substance rx to a drug seeker is looked at as a holistic practice. Denying proper medical care to a person suffering pain/distress on the basis of personal bias (bias often built or reinforced by these flawed narratives) is a violation of Hippocratic oath and can result in loss of license to practice medicine and leaves open the possibility of civil action in court for medical malpractice. 
A person going to trap spot to score drugs is a criminal that should be arrested, prosecuted, and face a punishment for their crime. A patient filling a Rx at a pharmacy is responsibly following Drs orders. 
A drug dealer caught with a gun is a dangerous felon that's a threat to the community preying of addicts for personal gain/profit. A drug company exec using a lawyer to file lawsuits or a lobbyist to petition a politician is simply a businessman protecting their company interests or advocating their position within the free market economy so they can better serve the needs of patients.

Until people change their hearts and minds this crisis will only continue to grow. But a large part of the issue is.... people don't truly want to change. We use criminal history and use of drugs as a means to determine positions of class heirachy. We want to be able to think of ourselves as superior or special, we want to deserve what we have in this so called ""meritocracy,"" the American dream promises it. Those who are unable to achieve the dream either cannot because they don't deserve to, or are the reason that you personally are unable to achieve that American dream , due to those lower on the heirachy contributing to barriers for your your prosperous destiny from being manifested This justifies the stigma, the bias, the discrimination, and validates the false narratives that one will use to place themself in an elevated class position. 

It is a tragic catastrophic engine with each stroke being driven by inequity powering constant and persistent instances of human suffering and abuse. So to sum it all up, at the individual level sure, one is wrong to choose to take illegal drugs, but at the end of the day, who is more wrong, that one individual, or the Drs, politicians, the judges, the cops, the media, and society on the macro level that will contribute (in various degrees of vicariousness) to these institutions and societal norms that allow for the individual to be wrong in that situation in the first place?",0.0

**Argument 1: He was negligent in avoiding the crash-** He missed a runaway truck ramp because he failed to keep his nerves under control. If you can't control your fear and nerves then you shouldn't get behind the wheel a 80T vehicle. Had he taken the ramp no one dies, no one is injured, no pileup.

**Argument 2- He never should have gotten in the Truck.** People say his company told him to keep driving when he said there were issues with the vehicle. That does not absolve him from the responsibility of not driving it. He should have said no, and he should have been willing to get fired if that's what it took not to put lives at risk. ""My boss told he too"" is not an excuse for professional drivers to risk or take a life.

**Reason 3- Awful Judgement when the crash was imitate**- There was a Semi truck on the shoulder of the road, and he decided not to go onto the shoulder because of that. He chose to hit a 4 wheeler instead of a semi truck when there were no more escape options. Had he hit the Semi with his Semi likely no one dies.

210,t3_romsf1,CMV: Fat Acceptance is part of 4th wave feminism,"As far as I have seen, the ""Fat Acceptance Movement"" can be tied to 4th wave feminism and its focus on female empowerment. I have yet to see an overweight/obese man get the same considerations that an overweight/obese woman gets since the movement started. Nor have I seen a man deeply involved in the movement itself. It seems to be a movement based on the acceptance of overweight/obese women as well as the belief that they can/should be seen just as sexually desirable as their healthier, less weighty counterparts.

Until overweight/obese men get the same considerations and importance within the movement, it can't be considered as anything other than a Fat Women's Acceptance Movement.

211,t3_romj11,CMV: Social media has removed most ability to participate in interpersonal civil discourse and has degraded face-to-face conversation.,"Modern use of social media for the purpose of discourse, debate, or even common conversation has degraded interpersonal skills in the manner that most people do not have to put forth the effort to express physical cues, posture and eye contact, or even tonal influences on a conversation. Furthermore, most self identity comes from the appearance that people lead on with pre-planned writings, data, and other metrics that can put on the facade of being well versed when really it's read from a script. Most people in those instances aren't actually conversing as they are denouncing or even ridiculing for the sake of only that. It requires no learned knowledge at all. Also, discussing things over the internet allows people to not only speak in such a manner that they're not liable for the things they say, but they don't have to be present for any opposing views or counter argument. It does zero to develop one's social skillset, and only harms personal development in the manner of social settings.",56.0
212,t3_rom1s4,"CMV: Descartes' reasoning in the *Discourse* fails to meet his requirement of being ""entirely indubitable.""","I'll say up front that I am nothing resembling a philosopher, and Descartes could probably run rings around me in a debate. But I think questioning the great thinkers of the past is beneficial as a learning exercise.

Descartes writes that he will ""reject as if absolutely false everything in which I could imagine the least doubt, in order to see if I was left believing anything that was entirely indubitable."" Given what he meant by ""entirely indubitable,"" I think he should have concluded that nothing measures up to his standard. 

He quickly rejects the senses, reasoning, and thinking as unsatisfactory by his standard. Then he accepts the reasoning: ""I am thinking, therefore I exist."" That is a piece of reasoning, and it is a thought. And Descartes has rejected reasonings and thoughts. I don't see how that works.

Descartes' argument for substance dualism (the ""soul"") does not seem entirely indubitable, either. He says he must be distinct from his body because he can doubt that he has a body, but cannot doubt that he exists. First of all, that's reasoning or thinking, and Descartes rejects those as not satisfactorily indubitable (as above). Secondly, the physicalists would answer that Descartes is committing the Masked Man Fallacy. I don't see how Descartes can say he is more confident of this argument than of the simplest geometrical proofs, which he explicitly says are unsatisfactory.

Next, Descartes gives his general criterion of certainty. (At the risk of being tedious, I must point out that he arrives at this criterion by yet another process of reasoning, and that it's a thought.) He writes, ""the things we clearly and distinctly perceive are all true."" But we can (seemingly) think we clearly and distinctly perceive something is true and be wrong, just like we can occasionally be wrong about things we sense, reason about, or think. Descartes admits that there's ""some difficulty"" here, but he doesn't attempt to resolve it at all. I don't see how that fits with Descartes methodology of rejecting anything that has ever deceived him.

213,t3_rolj7x,"CMV: if Reddit is going to ban right-wing genocide denial subs (which they should), they should extend that ban to all genocide-denying communist subs.","It seems pretty obvious, right? That the incredible evil behind genocide should be what we focus on, instead of which group committed it? 

Not according to Reddit. Firstly, I’m generally in favour of free speech, but I side with their decision to ban subreddits devoted to denying genocides and atrocities. I think anyone who believes the Holocaust didn’t happen (or worse, that the victims deserved it) is not contributing anything valuable to the discussion, and that they can take their views somewhere else. Secondly, any comparison I make to fascists or nazis is never to praise those groups, but to draw attention to the double standard this platform has with allowing this kind of thing. This *should* go without saying, but accusations of pro-fascism seem to pop up any time you criticize communism to a large enough crowd on Reddit. 

So. This rule is common throughout mainstream social media platforms: Do not deny or excuse genocides. 

Reddit enforces this rule pretty well over all—*except* if the genocide in question was committed by a communist government. If that’s the case, you can deny, excuse, or praise the genocide with total impunity. You can say things like ""Stalin did nothing wrong"" and call the Cambodian genocide ""Western propaganda"". 

Hell, if you go to r/GenZedong, [this was one of the top posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZedong/comments/rn803f/sums_up_the_xinjiang_situation/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3) 

Here’s [another charming post from r/Communism.](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/ilalp1/the_holodomor_was_nazi_propaganda/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

These aren't just a few 'bad apples', either—it’s a shit barrel that’s beyond redemption. Go to any communist sub, and search up ""Holodomor"" or ""Xinjiang"", if you need more examples. 

Could you *imagine* the same cartoons, statements and jokes posted about nazism or a similar set of atrocities? Again, this is not making a case that we should allow *more* genocide denial, just pointing out the appalling things people are *currently* allowed to say, as long as they're on the left. I don't expect Reddit to change anything, but they allow this behaviour, even going so far as to allow the mods of those subs to ban people who argue back--in other words, actively facilitating a safe space for genocide apologists. I try to understand the other side, but I just can't do it with this one. Am I missing something here? Does the ideology of genocidal dictators matter more than what they did to tens of millions of people? Has Reddit ever defended their choice to let those subs and the accounts of their users to keep existing?

I do not, and have not, ever hated someone or discriminated against someone due to identifying with genders I do not agree with. I dislike the idea of the genders, not the people who identify as such.

I am recieving all of these genders off of the LGBTA Wiki (which I know is not the most reliable source but everything mentioned here still has firm believers of it's existence) as well as people I know.

I also want to clarify I am referring to genders that relate to objects, popular culture, or fictional worlds. These include: pupgender, dreamgender, fantasygender, etc.

These genders, in my opinion, are displaying the LGBTQ+ community under the media and social spotlight, to people, both inside and outside the community, that it is becoming a 'trend' of sorts to identify as a gender related to a fictional or physical thing. It groups the people that identify as relatively understandable genders such as transgender, non-binary, or genderfluid, with members of the community that use pronouns such as Dre/am, lol/bit, and honk/honks, which brings me to my next point:

Pronouns can not be already established English words that have been previously categorised as a different form of word. Using my examples of pronouns I listed before, honk/honks is a noun/plural noun. As a pronoun, it is the exact same as a nickname, just without the capital letter. To clarify, I listed pronouns who I personally know people to use.

That is about the extent of my confusion and I hope to develop an understanding on the logic of these gender identities and pronouns.",1960.0
216,t3_rokpo5,"CMV: It's not rude to say ""Merry Christmas"" instead of ""Happy Holidays.""","I say ""happy holidays"" or ""Merry Christmas, if you celebrate"" nowadays to people I don't know in case they are offended, but I don't understand being upset about being told Merry Christmas (without any qualifications) if you don't celebrate it. It's not like saying ""Happy Chinese New Year"" to any vaguely Asian-looking person, which is ignorant at best and racist at worst. So I would like someone to explain how ""Merry Christmas"" might be offensive.

I am not religious and I never have been, yet my family and I still put up a tree, give presents, write cards, and have a feast every Christmas. Christmas is not merely a religious holiday; it's now primarily a commercialized Western holiday that's all about getting together with family and friends and surprising each other with gifts and happy memories. It's much closer to Thanksgiving than Easter on the spectrum of holiday religiosity, and I find Thanksgiving more culturally insensitive than Christmas, if anything.

My view is that the phrase ""Merry Christmas"" is simply about spreading cheer; **I currently do not believe it has the side effect of marginalizing other cultures and/or religions, which is what seems to be making it politically incorrect.** I will say ""Happy Hanukkah"" to my Jewish friends even though I don't celebrate Hanukkah, yet no one has gotten offended at me for doing that. I will say ""Happy Easter"" to my Christian friends even though I'm not Christian. I have nothing against saying ""Happy Holidays"" as a substitute for Merry Christmas, but I don't see why ""Merry Christmas"" is controversial.

So what am I failing to consider?

**EDIT: In case you're wondering, I'm not a salty old lady or some crazy right-wing Ben Shapiro fan who latches onto any excuse to rail against political correctness.

Black owned as a selling point is actually a red flag for me. My experience with these businesses, is that they’re over priced, have low quality products and terrible service but because they’re black you’re supposed to accept it.

218,t3_roirc2,"CMV: Youtube should not hide dislikes on certain topics, mostly tutorials.","I don't have the slightest idea of how, but I am open to changing my views on this.

Tutorials are a key part of what makes youtube (and the internet) great. If you have been using a computer long and hard enough, you will come to a point where you need some obscure solution that only a dude from 2007 found out or some strange man from a foreign country has. Sometimes you need that solution fast and easy. Getting a .dll so you can pirate skyrim is cool, but sometimes you need a solution to start a car to go somewhere urgently.  I could also make the argument that ads should not be shown sometimes, but that's a whole another topic.

The easy and quick solution to have a quality seal from a certain tutorial were the dislikes. Some dude was pushing a strange .exe or .zip file? He got disliked to hell. Some dude had an actual solution? He got a good ratio of likes/dislikes. I believe it's in youtube's best interest to keep the tutorial sections useful for their user base, or they could risk making this whole section lack legitimacy and people might just stop using youtube for this purpose.

I can see the point of hiding dislikes to prevent brigading of a certain type of video, but if it's something like tutorials it shouldn't be able to be this way because the content in those tutorials are supposed to be objective instead of subjective like in many other videos.

219,t3_roic6x,CMV: All streaming services should have the option to watch at 2x speed,"A pretty straightforward CMV. As someone who watches basically all their media at 2x speed, I was pleasantly surprised when Netflix added 1.25x and 1.5x speed. I would certainly appreciate if Netflix added a 2x speed setting but beggars can't be choosers. Unfortunately, watching things on Disney+, Hulu, Amazon, etc makes me feel like everything is in slow motion since none of these sites have the option to increase the speed at all. I guess my question is why streaming services can't/don't implement this feature? It doesn't seem like a technological challenge. I don't think any site has any sort of patent on the feature. Streaming services don't lose money if you watch more movies/shows faster.

I think the most compelling argument I've seen for not implementing higher speed settings is that movie/show creators have an intended way they want viewers to consume their content and allowing people to watch at different speeds will alter the way a viewer interprets that movie/show. While I understand this sentiment, I don't think a creator's intended vision is enough to bar a platform from implementing a feature which some consumers, like myself, frequently use. I also doubt that streaming services take creator's opinions into that much account that they would be so accommodating but this is just me speculating. But yeah, that's my view.

221,t3_rogiry,CMV: Social Security is a horrible program that should be removed.," 

Every working American loses 6% of their paycheck under \~130k per year to social security, the employer contributes another 6% and self employed people have to pay the whole 12%.

This is a horrible system because if everyone took that 12% and put it into an index fund, they'd be far better off than getting a small SS check. Additionally, there is no way to opt out so someone like me who will make far more from their 401k and IRA's has to pay into this shitty system even though the checks don't benefit me.

I've heard all the arguments from people who try and defend SS.

""People are bad at financially planning, they're going to take the short term gain over planning for savings"". This may be true, but instead of screwing financially competent people with a 12% tax because some people don't realize they need to save for retirement, wouldn't it be better to focus on educating these people so they don't make shitty financial decisions? And even after that, if people refuse to save, then that's on them right?

Additionally SS benefits are going to run out at some point, so either benefits have to be cut or age has to be increased. Some people propose removing the income cap on SS to counter this but it also makes no sense to me. Someone making 200k isn't going to benefit from SS but they want to raise taxes on these people for no real benefit. The real problem is people can get more out of SS than they put in. This can be easily solved by reducing the income cap and increasing the percentage so revenue is the same but it's much harder to receive more than you pay in.

The other argument against investing in an index fund is the market might crash whereas SS is guaranteed. But does anyone really think the US govt is just gonna let the market crash and let everyone's savings go to shit and not intervene to fix the economy? Chances of that are so low that it just doesn't seem reasonable to me.

I think a far better system would be to focus on financial wellbeing and education, and require that 12% of your income go to an index fund or some retirement fund of your choice. Once again, I'm not trying to insult anyone, just trying to understand why something like this isn't possible.",0.0

223,t3_roc5ps,CMV: science reporters should be expected to have substantial background in the relevant field(s) and should be held to a much higher standard of accuracy and honesty in general.,"Major deltas so far:

* A better way to encourage accuracy would be to require science reporting to have two people on the byline, one the journalist and the other a relevant scientist who verified the accuracy of the article.
  * Or maybe that wouldn't be practical with concerns about conflicts of interest.  A better-still solution might just be to encourage an industry norm of having dedicated science journalists (who build up relevant background) and dedicated fact-checkers.
* My first bad example may actually come down to a difference in interpretation of importance of effects and not actually bad reporting per se.
* I am referring more to pop science than to the variety of science journalism that is written for people in industry.
* ""Higher standards"" should refer to journal*ism*, not journal*ists*.  The problems I'm describing may be the product of editors etc as much as the journalists themselves.

A few important clarifications:

* I'm not arguing for a law, more like an industry norm.  [Since I'm not arguing for a law, in a US context the First Amendment isn't relevant.]
* I'm not arguing whether reporters in other fields should also have such a background.  Maybe they should, but that's irrelevant here.
* I'm not arguing they should need to have a degree or any specific formal qualification, just a generally sound understanding.
* ""Higher standard"" is relative to current standards, not other subfields of journalism.

I have two examples in mind that spurred this.

One was an article reporting on some new paper, regarding the risks of alcohol assumption I think, that conflated ""significant"" and ""statistically significant"".  The quoted scientist said ""the effect was very small, but statistically significant""; the reporter interpreted this as ""small but significant"".  That's a massive difference; I've seen cases in my own line of work where a correlation definitely, unequivocally existed (we're talking p &lt; 0.0001) but was far, far too small to matter to anything.  That was also the case with this article; I believe the effect they were describing was on the order of a month or two of life expectancy difference.  [This is relevant to ""substantial background""; the reporter apparently did not know what ""statistically significant"" means.]

Another came up in a recent CMV post.  OP, arguing about the risks of imminent sea level rise, cited an article which, quoting an AGU press conference, said (in the headline and the first paragraph) that an Antarctic glacier could entirely melt within 3 years and cause up to 2 feet of sea level rise.  What the exact quote--in the article, but at the very end (I didn't even need to check the original source)--said was that *part of* the glacier could melt off in a few years, but the two-feet-of-sea-level-rise part would happen on a timescale of decades, not years.  The article's opening clearly framed it as ""two feet within a few years"".  [This is relevant to ""higher standard""; the author may well have correctly understood the point, but their early framing of it verged on an outright lie.]

I think both of these components lead to much of science journalism, as it is now, having an outright toxic, or at least unproductive, effect.  At worst, the association between science journalism and science leads to a transfer of mistrust from the journalists to the scientists, particularly when people aren't willing (or well-prepared) to actually read the papers (which are likely paywalled, aside from the time commitment).  For example, when sensationalist claims, like ""two feet of sea level rise in a few years"", utterly fail to come true, people blame the scientists for bad predictions, instead of the journalists for bad reporting.  At best, this just makes science journalism useless other than for pointing to new papers, since one has to check for themselves to get a reliable summary anyway.

I believe some sort of industry norm could significantly remedy this.  Namely:

* In order to do their actual job, a journalist should be able to correctly interpret the results that they report on; if they can't do this, then they can't report accurate information reliably, and are therefore useless.  Expecting journalists to have enough familiarity for that seems like it should be a basic requirement of professional competence.  This needn't be an actual degree in the field or anything of that magnitude, but they should be able to competently discuss the subject.
* I'm aware that online journalism depends on flashy headlines, but there's a difference between clickbait and flagrant dishonesty.  The article I referenced above could just have said ""The 'Doomsday Glacier', containing enough water for two feet of sea level rise, may lose its ice shelf within a few years""; that strikes me as plenty clickbaity and a bit misleading, but it is, in fact, true to the quotes later on.  In order to have any value as an industry, it's necessary for journalism to have some standards of honesty, and it seems that science journalism is a major outlier here.

I'm unlikely to budge on the fundamental premises here, but there's room for practical arguments discussing why this isn't the case already or why it wouldn't be feasible.  Could such standards not be effectively implemented?  Would people just not read it?  Is science journalism (as a whole field; I'm aware that positive examples do exist) just doomed to untrustworthiness?",2133.0

228,t3_rnw7wy,CMV: Neopaganism has little long term growth potential,"I believe due to various issues Neopaganism lacks long-term growth potential.

This emphatically does not mean that Pagan-inspired religions will not grow in the future. But rather I believe the successful ones will be strongly differentiated from mainstream Neopaganism to the point of being effectively their own NRMs rather than Neopagan.

I believe that Neopaganism will fail because of four issues

* Lack of leadership
* Lack of Vision
* Political sectarianism
* Tradition Fragmentation

I believe these issues will need to be resolved by any tradition that can hope to succeed moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of Leadership is a major issue. It keeps Neopaganism from being able to show a unified face to the public, and keeps it from enforcing behavioral standards. A particular issue is that Neopaganism finds it quite difficult to assimilate new members compared to religions like Mormonism due to this lack of leadership. Most Neopagans do not want leadership either, which means that this issue may very well last indefinitely. Most members exist as solo practitioners and even small local organizations rarely manage to thrive

&amp;#x200B;

Lack of Vision is a related issue to lack of leadership. Both in worldly matters and spiritual matters Neopaganism lacks vision. It has no clear vision to convert the world, nor a clear vision of spiritual benefits to give to its practitioners. Even if you believe in the gods of their traditions, there's often little incentive to participate in a particular organization, or even any organization

&amp;#x200B;

Political Sectarianism is highly related to lack of vision. Often neopagans prioritize worldly politics over their faith, and this creates strong political clashes for secular reasons. In particular socialists vs fascists.

&amp;#x200B;

Tradition Fragmentation is an interesting issue. Neopaganism is divided into many different groups such as Kemetism which is attempting to revive Egyptian religion, Hellenism for Greek, etc. The relationship between these groups is up for debate. Some say they are independently growing religions, others say they are denominations, others say they are something more like Maronite vs Byzantine vs Latin Catholics.

230,t3_rnn54x,CMV: Baby it’s cold outside is not a date rape song.,"The song was written in 1944. In those days women were not supposed to be alone in a man’s place by themselves or they were looked at as loose/no morals. The girl wants to stay but doesn’t want her reputation to be tarnished. Drinking in social settings in the house and office (and smoking too) were more common then. Thus the man offering her a drink was not to get her drunk and rape her, but a common courtesy. What’s in this drink was common to say to avoid responsibly for your actions after drinking. The guy wants her to stay, she wants to stay but is worried about what others would think. The censors would also never have approved a rape song. Back in those days Lucy and Desi could not even sleep in the same bed on TV. There is no way a rape song would make it on the air. The only people who have an issue with this song are people who have no concept of history and are placing todays values on an innocent song.

231,t3_rnlnus,Cmv: when in a committed relationship partners should be able to go through each other’s phones,"I believe that the most important thing in a relationship is trust and communication.

As such I believe that when individuals are in a relationship they should trust each other enough to know each other’s passwords.

I understand often partners may be inclined to go through text messages and reassure themselves that no one is cheating but I genuinely believe that a relationship in which a partner feels the need to go through someone else’s phone is not a relationship in which trust and open communication are well established. 

Knowing someone’s password does not mean that they will go through text messages, knowing someone else’s password can often be convenient as often pictures or videos may be only on one person’s phone. Similarly if someone just wants to check the weather or something like that knowing another person’s password may be more convenient if their phone is closer. 

Similarly knowing someone else’s password can be beneficial in an emergency as it means that parents or other family members can be contacted especially if they are not registered as emergency contacts.

I think however individuals should always ask each other before just taking another’s phone.

Personally my fiancé has known my password for many many years and I believe I told him after maybe six months of dating because I trusted him so much and because we communicated very openly too each other. I know his password and have known his password since the day I told him mine.

232,t3_rnl3u5,CMV: Mental illnesses should be treated more like physical ones in society.,"I’ve noticed that people who struggle with mental illnesses (for example depression) are usually accused of being “lazy” or “weak” or “just finding excuses to not face their responsibilities” and many other things like these.

I get how many can’t really understand what a mental illness can do to a person and how it can affect one to the level they’re not functional anymore. It’s not something a person chooses and it differs from just being sad, or just going through a bad phase. Sometimes it’s just a chemical thing that happens. People with depression can be perfectly fine for one moment and then the second one they get this awful feeling for the most minor thing or even without a reason at all. This is NOT how a healthy person functions. You can’t tell them to just feel fine and move on just like you can’t tell someone with a broken leg to just forget about it and walk. And no, suicide attempts are not ungrateful neither selfish it’s the outcome from someone who’s been suffering for a long time. 

I get how many will disagree with that since many times with mental illnesses it’s easier to get help and get better than physical ones. Of course this depends on how ill someone is. I also see that some people are faking mental
illnesses which is awful and completely disrespectful to the ones who actually suffer from them. 

My point is, we need, as a society, to remove the stigma associated with mental diseases, get educated on this matter and start treating people who suffer from them like people who need help and not like crazy or lazy ones who are just “ungrateful” and “waste their lives being sad”.",653.0
233,t3_rnksag,CMV: Communism is not practical,"Hello, drunk college student checking in.

I would like to hear people's opinions on Communism, mainly people that ARE actually communist.

I feel as if it's common sense that this style of government is just never practical in any first-world sense, but there are those who disagree.

I can give a few questions I suppose to work with(First post on here, don't know how to format sorry &lt;3):

1. How do you keep people working hard and passionately when all are equal?
2. How do you deal with people possibly trying to injure themselves or come up with excuses to get out of work, just to make the same money as those who do work?
3. How do you put so much blind trust in the same government you speak out against constantly? Protest and civil discourse have created the biggest movements in America's history. Having a government with so much power makes this drastically more complicated. Possible, but more complicated.
4. How do you put checks and balances on such a government that has the power to essentially do what they want?
5. How do you prevent government officials from abusing powers to regulate certain goods? We already see it, even in our free market. Insulin, for example, is regulated and DRASTICALLY overpriced. This seems ridiculous for something needed to survive. Imagine a government with the ability to control everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is not questioning socialism(kind of). I do have my own personal issues with socialism, however, it is VASTLY deeper to argue than communism. This is mainly for the extremely radical leftists out there.

Also, I hate that I have to say this, but I feel that I do: I have no ill-thought toward anyone for their political belief. I would love to hear your point of view and maybe learn a few things in the process.

This is my first post on here. I hope I did it right!

234,t3_rnjhrv,CMV: The future would be better off without nuclear weapons,"My thesis here is that: if nuclear weapons did not exist, the world would have a better future. This doesn't necessarily mean that as of today it would be better, but rather that our long-term future would be better. Currently a weakly held belief, but I'd like to see what you all have to say. 

Also, this is not about disarmament and its complexities. I think the genie is out of the bottle on getting nations to give up their nukes.

So there's this idea called nuclear peace, which argues that mutually assured destruction is a good thing because it creates stability between nations, hence why we haven't seen WW3 yet. I think this is misleading and biases peace in the present at the expense of peace in the future.

I think the above could be supported by two arguments: a) given nuclear weapons exist, nuclear war will eventually happen. and b) One full nuclear war is worse than having a standard great power war every few generations. I think the argument could possibly fail if x) Some technology in the future, like synthetic biology, is worse and nuclear weapons somehow deter that from being used first. Or y) we're a lot more robust to nuclear war / great power conflicts in the future are far more deadly that I would have thought.

Argument for A:

We came scarily close to nuclear war during the cold war [multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov) [times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls). While giving a probability to something that has yet to happen before, but some [estimate it to be 1% within the century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust#Likelihood_of_nuclear_war). However, given enough time, it will happen. You can only play the negative lottery so much before you lose. Also, [Black Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) are surprisingly common. I don't think the argument that nuclear war would likely be a limited exchange would work at countering this, since time doesn't stop there and again, eventually we'll end up with nuclear holocaust.

Argument for B:

One full-scale nuclear war could have the potential to either make us go extinct, or permanently cripple our ability to flourish. I think it's admittedly a fairly slim chance, since nuclear war would most likely be concentrated between nuclear powers, leaving the southern hemisphere intact. However, the cost of extinction is so great that even a small increase in probability is unacceptable, since it's effectively killing all future people. There's also the chance that we're permanently stunted, since rebuilding back from a nuclear holocaust could be extremely difficult due to supply chain failures, environmental challenges, the lack of easily accessible minerals and fossil fuels, among other problems. 

This is in comparison to great power conflict, which I think would be more likely in a nuclear free world, since the cost of war goes down. However, in WWII, only 3% of the population died, including both military and civilians. I think it would be unlikely that any conventional war would present the same risk to our species survival.

235,t3_rngp9t,CMV: “Reading” books by reading their summary is cheating and promotes a false sense of education.,"This would extend to listening to a summary instead of the whole audiobook, but I don’t really listen to audiobooks.  

My main argument is that while a summary can be useful to have a summary to understand what the book is about, it doesn’t nearly come close to being equivalent to reading it. You only get a few ideas that the person who summarizes the book thinks are important. So in a sense you’re potentially even straying away from the book’s original intent, as it’s passing through yet another filter before reaching you.  

I also see more apps that offer this and marketing it as “reading the book” when in actuality it’s not the same at all. Even if the writers did the summaries themselves, they would have to trim a lot of content.  
I would say getting into a book and reading it even if it may take a long time is the only way to truly connect and understand it more deeply and actually get something personally valuable out of them.  

Don’t get me wrong, while I believe this “summary reading” is a product of the current society no longer being willing to (or having the time to) invest much in activities requiring patience and can be useful to get a basic idea of the actual book, anyone who claims to have read a book by reading its summary is merely posing as being educated.",36.0

244,t3_rn5396,CMV: Every lawyer should serve at least 2 years as a public defender,"Similarly to how fresh medical school grads don't go straight into being a doctor, they become a resident first.

We need a similar system for lawyers. After you graduate law school and pass the bar, you serve at least 2 years as a public defender. Of course, they should be paid a decent salary just as medical residents are. 

Ultimately, the goal of this is to have more public defenders and BETTER public defenders. Currently, public defenders are overworked and tend to be people who do this out of passion or couldn't get the top tier law jobs. Under my proposed system, this would result in lower case loads, more attention to the cases, and all lawyers from the top of the class to the bottom would be working. Of course, if a lawyer is incompetent, they would be fire, just as a  an incompetent medical resident would.

Too many people, even innocent ones, end up in major debt fighting for lives when their public defender is shitty. We cannot have a fair and working legal system when one side (the state) has adequate representation but the defendant does not.

245,t3_rn3xbz,CMV: It would be better for everyone to have a higher barrier to entry for gender/sex reassignment and a more narrow definition of what it means to be transgender,"I believe that transgender women are women and transgender men are men.  I believe that everyone should be able to live their life with respect and full, equal opportunity for happiness.

I also believe some of the assertions made by popular progressive gender theory are counter-productive, confusing for most of society and impractical if they were to be fully executed as proposed.  For purposes of this argument, I will focus on MtF transgender people.  They are the largest sub-category of the transgender population, and the most problematic with regards to integrating into society as proposed by modern day trans activists.


**My definition of “popular progressive gender theory” as it relates to this argument:**


&gt;1) A woman is anyone who believes they are a woman.


&gt;2) Trans women should be treated exactly the same as females by society and the government.


&gt;3) Transgendered people should be able to change legal documents and records with little, to no requirements



If the three points above were widely accepted, society would look radically different.  I am a 6’5” CIS man, with a beard.  There are absolutely no qualifications for point number one.  By simply believing I am a woman, I become one.  There are no hormonal or surgical requirements.  No psychological evaluations.  No requirements to represent myself in any particular way to family or friends/work/etc.  I become a woman by self-identifying as one.
Once that has been established, I am able to go down to go down to my state’s dept of vital statistics, file a form (with a self-attestation) and have my sex changed to female on my birth certificate.  Afterward, almost every sex-segregated system in front of me begins to fall apart.

I am eligible to apply to local all girls schools and colleges (in some cases benefiting from reserved slots for LGBTQ+ admissions) .  I can apply for women’s only/LGBT only scholarships, grants and business development programs.  If I own a business, I receive preferential treatment when it comes to bidding on state jobs and contracts.  It is illegal, in my state, for women’s shelters and domestic violence support groups to deny me services if they receive state funds.  Of course, I am also allowed in women’s dressing rooms and restrooms.

To me, this equates to a total breakdown of every sex-segregated institution in society.  This is not a strawman or slippery slope argument, this is all doable in my state RIGHT NOW.  

**My issues are as follows:**


&gt;1) This is a circular definition, with no real value.  If we hold the definition to be true, there are no tangible requirements or characteristics that categorize anyone as “man” or “woman”.**

 
&gt;2) Females and transwomen are dramatically different.  Life experience, biology, inter-family relationships/expectations – they are very, very different.  ESPECIALLY in cases of recent transitions.  My friend is in a local support group for women survivors of domestic abuse.  They established a policy allowing trans-women to join.  5 years ago, this group was 19 females, one trans woman.  Now, the group is 13 trans women, 2 females.  The group just invited a doctor to speak on how to deal with the complications of hormone therapy next month.  The mission of this group has been erased.  Women self-segregate so that their issues aren’t diminished– is that wrong?


&gt;3) Beyond complicating and confusing record keeping and demographic information, changing your sex opens you up to benefits and opportunities reserved for marginalized members of society.  You should not be able to access these programs without a demonstrable need.



My proposal:

-     A woman should be defined as “an adult female human”. 

-     A trans woman should be defined as “an adult male who has completed the sex reassignment process.”

-     A transitioning person should be defined as “someone who has begun to transition to the opposite sex.”


This clearly defines and categorizes the process and different states of being for the 90% of the population who isn’t keyed into modern gender theory.  It establishes a different levels of transition, and ties it to sex, rather than gender.  Gender as currently defined today, is too fluid and impermanent to be tied to any kind of legal or medical record or practice.  


-     Transitioning should be a formalized process involving psychological treatment, hormonal treatment, and surgery.

-     Transitioning should be 100% covered by insurance and Medicaid.

-     Transitioning should be a pre-requisite to change your sex on vital records

Vital records record sex, not gender.  Many states and countries require psychological treatment, hormonal treatment, and bottom surgery to modify vital records.  There have been no studies that demonstrate rates of suicide or self-harm go up because of these policies, or that these rates are lower in states that don’t have those requirements.  By implementing this, we establish a baseline that ensures an element commonality between females and trans-women, we have checks on people looking to exploit the system, and we create a sense of “buy-in” amongst society that trans people are sincere in their beliefs.  

-     We should segregate spaces and institutions by sex, not gender

-     We should re-evaluate when/where/why we segregate spaces and institutions

Why do we segregate at all?  It’s almost entirely due to biological makeup (urinals in mens rooms/equality of opportunity in sports) unless it’s for cultural (racial/political/religious issues) or academic reasons.  If it’s not biologically necessary, we should move to mixed sex accommodation wherever possible in public spaces.  In private spaces, people should be able to self segregate based on whatever criteria they deem appropriate.  


I want my view changed because I have always considered myself a strong feminist and very pro-LGB rights.  My friends and colleagues have tried to argue that my positions as regressive and sexist/transphobic and I want to see the logic in their argument.  I have been banned from a few Reddit communities for advocating for the right of female women to have safe spaces reserved exclusively for them.  I am trying to see the logic and get a perspective on these issues. 

I’ll award deltas for being convinced any of my positions are substantially wrong.  My argument largely hinges on the definition that “women are people who believe they are women”, so if I’m incorrect in that a lot of the trans movement is predicated on that belief, that would obviously change my argument.",0.0
246,t3_rn3q9a,CMV: Using “the transporter” implies expecting quantum immortality,"This is a philosophy driven post that requires some familiarity with two different thought experiments:

## Using the transporter

There is a famous thought experiment known as the “transporter thought experiment“ designed to expound what a person means or expects when they claim to be a dualist or monist or to sort out subjective experience from objective experiences. 

In it, the question is asked: 

*“Would you use a Star Trek style transporter? One that scans you completely and makes an absolutely perfect physical duplicate at the destination pad while destroying the original.”*

If a person believes their existence is entirely a product of their physical state, they usually answer “yes” since that exact state will continue to exist. 

Most Redditors answer “yes”. 

##Quantum immortality 

In the many world theory (MWT) interpretation of quantum mechanics, there is a thought experiment called the “quantum immortality thought experiment”. 

In it, the famous Schrodinger‘s cat scenario is repeated except the physicist them self climbs into the box. The result of a quantum superposition decoherence (whether cesium atom decays and sets off a Geiger counter wired to a bomb for example) will either kill them or do nothing. Since the physicist exists in many worlds thought experiment asks if they can expect to consistently “get lucky“ because they would only experience worlds in which they are not killed.

Typically, this experiment is dismissed as nonsense because there is no reason to expect that you will “hop” between branches when dead. 


##Using “the transporter” implies expecting quantum immortality


It seems to me that if you rationally expect to be alive at the arrival pad of the transporter, then you expect *to be able to experience duplicate versions of yourself*. 

If you expect to experience duplicate versions of yourself, then you ought to expect to survive quantum suicide.

Which implies that it is rationally congruent with using the transporter to expect you can the outcome of quantum events. To take it a step further, if transporters “work”, one could put a quantum gun to their head and hold the universe hostage — forcing any arbitrarily improbable quantum event to happen (subjectively).

247,t3_rn3l3v,"cmv: It’s wrong to blame the ordinary, modern day citizens of country’s such as the U.K. and France for their country’s colonial past.","First time posting here. Obviously colonialism resulted in many atrocities and many countries are still suffering as a result to this day.  However as stated above, I believe that ordinary modern day citizens of countries such as the U.K. are not responsible for the past colonial crimes of their country so shouldn’t be blamed for them or called ‘colonisers’. 

Here are some reasons why: 

- Ordinary people did not benefit from their country’s empires at the time. The average working class Victoria slum dweller was oppressed by their ruling classes, just like someone living in a colony. 
- Many ordinary citizens living in country’s with empires spoke out against them and opposed things such as slavery. Take the Lancashire cotton strikes [as an example.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05tly3f)
- There are very few people alive today who had anything to do with their country’s colonial past. Would you blame a teenager living in Germany for the crimes of the Nazis?

248,t3_rn3k02,CMV: Democracy is the Best Form of Government,"Nowadays it's common to see people espousing the view that people are stupid, self-centered, and irrational, and this is why people are fundamentally incapable of governing themselves. What is striking to me about this argument is how it plays into the hands of every dictator, every Feudal Lord, every Oligarch and every technocrat that ever existed. If people are sheep, then they need a shepherd. If people are just beasts, then they need a powerful state to keep them in a cage. 

I think it's a big a big assumption to make. We don't always know what people are capable of. Genius is born in the most unexpected places. Besides, you don't have to be a genius to make a contribution to your community/society. Most people, in fact, contribute in some way whether that be as a preschool teacher or a ballet dancer or an organic chemist. Given that most people are able to contribute to their community, should they not have a say in how that community is run? After all, public policy is literally about life or death a lot of the time. On top of that, the state has to function either in two ways: pacify the citizens almost entirely (think North Korea) or give the citizens a part in the decision-making processes (think Switzerland). You can have a bit of both (I view the US government as a very deformed democracy has tends to try to pacify before it considers allowing its citizens to participate). 

But to say citizens have no power over their government would be absurd. If enough armed rebellions break out across the states, that would severely undermine the state's power. Sure, the government has the finest military technology known to mankind. And sure the US government could become a total police state if it so chooses. But there is a question in my mind how stable authoritarian governments are in the long run. And in a country as large as the US I think a police state would be even more unstable. There is a will to slavery in mankind, but there is also a will to freedom. 

My ideal would be a small community where Direct Democracy would be feasible. The citizens take a direct part in legislative and Judicial matters. But if that's not possible then I would support a federal parliamentary democracy (federal because that allows more local control under a larger state, and parliamentary rather than presidential because more people have their hands in the pie and coalitions have to be formed which allows more representation). 

If I talk to right-wing or left-wing anarchists they would of course call me a statist in a condescending tone. And strictly speaking I am. Whether you are talking about a Direct Democracy or Nazi Germany the monopoly on violence rests in someone's hands. I'm not convinced that a communist utopia will be created anytime soon. I also don't think the market is inherently just or even democratic (as far as I'm concerned right-wing anarchists just want a private state). A world without politics is beyond our abilities as humans.

249,t3_rn3fnq,CMV: Rainbow Rangers: Floof is the most vital character in the show.,"In the childrens environmental issues/activisim television show Rainbow Rangers, the character Floof is easily the strongest and most important member of the team.  While undervalued, it is the constant in the show, and always gets the job done.

Team:
Rosie Redd - Leader/Strength Power with a special x-ray visor.
Mandarin Orange - Cheerleader/Sound Power.
Anna Banana - Animal Power.
Pepper Mintz - Inviso Power.
Bonnie Blueberry - Vision Power/ Construc-O-Max.
Indigo Allfruit - Second-in-Command/Speed Power.
Lavender LaViolette - Micro Power/Flight.

Floof, who has no specified ability, is always deployed to respond and always contributes positively to the mission.  It never gets a rest day, as the other Rangers do.  Floof is treated as a mascot, which I think is a travesty!  It deserves more credit and respect than what is shown in the show.",6.0
250,t3_rn38gp,"CMV: It’s impossible to have a good Christmas season if you don’t have money or family nearby, and you’re not a Christian","Moving away from where I came from is one of the best choices I’ve ever made. But I always have a really hard time with the holidays. 

Every year in late November/early December I find myself hoping that maybe this is the year I’ll have a good Christmas. By the time Christmas itself is happening, I realize I wasn’t able to get gifts for everyone I care about, I didn’t have enough money/time to decorate/cook everything I wanted to, and the people I’d want to celebrate with all live 2000 miles away. I have ADHD and autism and all the logistics and socializing required to put together a good Christmas are overwhelming.

It’s nice seeing the pretty lights. It’s nice seeing people out and about happy, shopping for food and each other. That’s about it. You can only live vicariously through other people for so long before realizing that your own life is lacking. 

There’s the whole “Christmas spirit” thing but why do people need an excuse to be kind to each other and optimistic? It always has seemed shallow to me; like “I’m going to put in extra effort to be nice and cheerful right now but not for the rest of the year” 

It’s not like I hate Christianity; I was raised christian, I can still see value in the Christmas story. I would feel really weird going to church though. 

Everyone I’ve ever known who’s really into Christmas has money, family nearby, or is really into their faith - or all three! I’d really like to enjoy this time of year and would love to hear perspectives from others who don’t have these things, and manage to still be happy.

Edited to add: 

- can’t do stuff with friends this year because they’re all doing stuff with family. The only person I can celebrate with in person is my fiancé. 

- the point about Christianity is truly the least important to me - I’m indifferent about it but get that if you’re alone on Christmas and christian at least you can focus on Jesus stuff",0.0
251,t3_rn2dqq,CMV: COVID very possibly escaped from Wuhan Lab and until those involved are properly scrutinized we can't expect for people to trust the governments pandemic response or to prevent the next pandemic,"[Newsweek - How Dr. Fauci and Other Officials Withheld Information on China's Coronavirus Experiments](https://www.newsweek.com/how-dr-fauci-other-officials-withheld-information-chinas-coronavirus-experiments-1652002)

[https://drasticresearch.org/](https://drasticresearch.org/)

&amp;#x200B;

Its becoming more and more clear from FOIA releases that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was conducting risky research on bat coronaviruses that very possibly led to a lab leak of the Covid virus.

Fauci, who is the face of Covid response in the US has many times denied these allegations, and argued that those who question this have ""No idea what they're talking about"", that the research was ""judged up and down the chain by qualified personnel as not being gain of function""  and that if gain of function was indeed conducted, it was in accordance to the guidelines of the grant. Ignoring the fact that these are contradictory statements, the appeal to authority argument is a terrible one that  only worsens mistrust in these institutions and authorities. As the newsweek article states

&gt;The episode is a self-inflicted wound that has further eroded trust in  the nation's public health officials at a time when that trust is most  important.

Because this has become so politicized, criticism of Fauci or skepticism as to the origins of Covid seems to be off limits for anyone not wanting to be associated with the far right. Which is a shame because if there were to be an honest investigation and reckoning for those involved, it would not only be a good first step in restoring some trust in our institutions but also perhaps help us learn from past mistakes and look to how to prevent a similar event in the future.",0.0
252,t3_rn258k,"CMV: The current application of NFTs is dumb, but NFTs themselves aren’t.","Ok hear me out here. I want to clarify that crypto and NFTs are not “investments” and that is not what I want to discuss since I already agree with that sentiment. I completely disagree with the way that most NFT sellers are painting the technology. But I do think they have some uses. Just not for pictures of monkeys and also not as a proof of ownership.

It’s probably not right to think of it as a “proof of ownership” it’s more like a proof of transfer. It doesn’t prove that I own the thing the NFT is tied to, it proves that a specific person transferred this NFT to me.

Receipts themselves are useful in all kinds of situations but a receipt for something is only as useful as the item the receipt is for. If a homeless person sold me a bag of shit, I would have a random bag of shit. If that homeless person gave me a receipt, then I would be able to prove that I bought a bag of shit from that specific homeless person. Pretty dumb way to use receipts and I think we will look back at the current NFT craze and think it’s like the homeless persons bag of shit.

But, I do think the concept of a digital receipt might have some use in the future. For example, if you buy a tv from Walmart and want to resell it on Craigslist. You would want to prove that the tv is from Walmart and not a counterfeit seller from China. It’s completely impractical for Craigslist to check if the receipt number is actually valid for all the 1000s of retailers out there because they all have different methods for verifying receipts and most don’t have systems that are open to the public. NFT’s would allow Craigslist to build a system for automatically checking the authenticity of a receipt from any merchant without having to build a system that is specific to each retailer. This is pretty similar to the tcp/ip protocols that the internet runs on. Before TCP, there were tons of private networks that were run by individual companies so that they could communicate throughout the building. It was technically possible to connect all of these individual networks together without TCP/IP but it would have been practically impossible to do for regular people without some kind of standardized way of sending information between networks. 

Also, I know that blockchain is and likely will always be slower than a private database. Just like sending information to the other side of the world is slower than sending information along Ethernet cables to another computer 50 feet away is. It’s just that eventually, the difference becomes negligible. It just has the benefit of being 100x simpler to set up a server to interact with the internet instead of interacting with 100 different private networks.

Basically my argument is that blockchain is going to do for our databases what TCP/IP did for our private computer networks. 

I would imagine that the first counter argument that I’m going to get is “why would I want my shopping habits/private info to be public knowledge”. Well luckily, we don’t have to store the contents of the receipt on the blockchain in a readable way and the NFT would still be verifiable to any system that the owner of the NFT chooses to show. You only need to store a hash on the blockchain which could be verified by showing the original information the hash string was generated from. Then, the owner can verify the wallet the NFT is in is owned by them. And finally, we could use a system similar to SSL certificates to verify that the original wallet that sent the NFT is actually the retailer that sold the product. The benefit here is that the company that sold the product doesn’t have to give any information about their sales and also doesn’t have to build their own system for verifying the authenticity of their products. They just have to send out a single transaction once, and it would be easy for anyone to see if the Gucci purse or tv they have is real or not without having to go to a Gucci store. This won’t eliminate counterfeit products completely, but it’s going to make it much more difficulty to have an industry dedicated to making fake branded products.

The other example I’m putting forward is for removing centralized stock exchanges. The NYSE makes billions of dollars in revenue per year with the majority of that money coming from transaction fees. The most likely situation for replacing this wouldn’t be through a public blockchain like ethereum or cardano. Scaling these to the level of a stock market is significantly more difficult than using a permissioned (and non-POW) blockchain where the only people allowed to add blocks would have to be able to afford large server farms. The banks would be able to transact directly with anyone that wants to buy or sell stocks without having to pay more than the actual transaction cost. This one wouldn’t have much benefit for the average person, it would really just redistribute the profits that the nyse makes to the banks and brokerages themselves.

I might be using the term NFT a bit too liberally. Any tech buzzword starts to lose its meaning when marketing departments get their hands on it. So trying to convince me that these processes would not technically be NFTs but would still operate with a blockchain is not going to change my view.",10.0
253,t3_rn1lwc,CMV: Porn is becoming so violent as a response to women's empowerment,"If we look at the number of guys on the internet who have misdirected anger against female empowerment, and believe that women’s place is in the kitchen, it is obvious why they feel the need to seeing modern women being degraded, and as if, being put in their place! A lot of these men are basically not well-adjusted to current society, the notion of female equality, etc. On top of that, a lot of men have rejection issues/ incel mentality so they want to see women punished and basically being raped, because they know in real life they can’t go rape women who reject them because of laws and law enforcement, but in fact some indeed do. The worst effects of porn are in countries with less law enforcement, such as in India, where men, especially the younger ones, have learned newer ways to rape and kill women, influenced by porn. South Asia has one of the biggest population of young people, and they are the biggest users of online porn.

To simply say that men are becoming desensitized and need higher stimulation doesn’t make sense. Ok, I have read that back in the days, men would get a boner from excitement during fighting on the battlefield, but it doesn’t make sense to say that evolution would have made violence an erotic experience for men on the whole. Does this mean that men would ejaculate at the point of shooting or stabbing an animal when they were or are hunters/ gatherers? Or does it mean that heterosexual men are sexually aroused and would perhaps find wrestling, which is mostly with other men, more erotically enjoyable than regular sex with a woman? No, we are particularly talking about violence against women as an erotic experience, which is not devoid of the emotional especially when we know it is accompanied with degrading name-calling, which are also indictive of the psychology behind the need for violence, these words having a history based in certain gendering of sexual morality, ownership of women, etc.

I've been on Reddit now for 3 years and have accidentally fallen upon some subs that are so extreme that it's amazing how it's allowed on here. And with people like Jordan Peterson teaching men that women are totally equal and we are just complaining, causes them to harbor even more anger. 

This is such a touchy topic, but that's my conclusion. Porn has gotten more violent as a response to our empowerment. 

I will only respond to normal replies; this was a touchy subject.

I'd really like to hear from some women too, if possible.

255,t3_rn0xee,"CMV: If you died from taking a pressed pill that you thought was a pharmaceutical but it contained fentanyl, you didn't die of a ""drug overdose"", you were poisoned.","Think about a college student who takes an Adderall a few times per year as a study aid.

Or a single parent who takes Xanax for a few weeks to help them cope with the emotions of divorce.

Or someone with PTSD who takes Ambien to help them rest.

These are legitimate pharmaceuticals that are fairly well-known and **visually recognizable** to anyone who has ever had a prescription for them, or anyone who has been close to someone who had/has a prescription for them.

Sometimes, for any number of reasons, a person who has a physician-approved medical necessity for these pills may be unable to obtain them through the standard legal channels... Maybe the college student has been so busy that he missed his last doctor's appointment for a refill. Maybe the single parent canceled their health insurance so they could start paying rent. And maybe the PTSD sufferer simply can't afford the prescriptions this month.

When someone receives a controlled medication without a valid prescription, it's illegal, period. Whether it's from a fellow college student, a meth-head in the worst part of town, or it's just handed to them at a party, they're all the same in the eyes of the law. And I believe that's necessary to discourage recreational use and abuse.

**But when someone DIES from this pill, labeling it as a drug overdose is not only branding the victim as a user/addict, but *also* putting more lives at risk by failing to acknowledge or recognize the circumstances surrounding the death. Furthermore, it prevents any responsible party from being held accountable for these deaths.**

In other words, when someone shoots themselves, it's a suicide. When someone accidentally shoots themselves with a gun they're handling incorrectly, it's an accidental death. When someone is shot by someone else, it's manslaughter or murder. Why is it different with deaths from fentanyl?

I believe the reason that most middle-class white-collar families don't realize or understand the fentanyl problem is because when they hear someone died of a drug overdose, they assume the person was an addict and picture them snorting, smoking, or shooting up to get high. That's what most people think when they hear the term ""drug overdose"" unfortunately.

Look, if I shoot up heroin or smoke meth, then I know the risks. I know this stuff was made by a crackhead in their backyard. There's no telling what it could be laced with or what it could do to me - and that's been true for decades, long before the fentanyl epidemic. I'm not saying these people deserve to die AT ALL, but they are choosing to put a substance in their body that they KNOW is home made, unregulated, and dangerous. They know it's a calculated risk (whether or not an addiction overshadows their ability to make that decision is irrelevant to the greater argument here).

But in the case of pressed pills that are **pharmaceutical replicas** containing fentanyl, the ""drug overdose"" label seems like quite a stretch - they died from taking a SINGLE PILL that looks IDENTICAL to the pressed pills that come from their pharmacy. Regardless of how the victim obtained the pill(s), they were **deceived.** They thought they got Adderall because it looks just like the Adderall they got from their pharmacy a couple months ago. There was no perceived risk.

If I buy some Kool-Aid packets from the flea market, I'm sure I've broken a law or two by buying an individual retail product not labeled for resale and without its original retail packaging, but that doesn't change the fact that I believe that it's Kool-Aid because it's in a paper packet that looks identical to the Kool-Aid packet I buy at the grocery store. So if that Kool-Aid contains fentanyl and it kills me, did I die of a drug overdose? The fact that it contained something deadly isn't diminished just because the Kool-Aid was obtained illegally.

**TL;DR**

**When someone dies from a substance they consumed too much of for the purpose of getting high or staving off withdrawals, I'd agree that it's a drug overdose.**

**When someone dies from doing something they knew was dangerous/risky, I'd call that an accidental death.**

**When someone dies from a substance they didn't even know they were consuming because it was intentionally disguised as something FDA-approved, legally manufactured, and well-regulated, that's not a drug overdose nor is it an accidental death - it's manslaughter via poisoning.**",804.0

257,t3_rmz2e8,CMV: Obese people should be treated by society the same way smokers are.,"To be clear from the start:

* When I refer to obesity, I am referring to body fat percentage, *not* BMI.
* I am not placing blame on either group, just that they should be held to the same standards.
   * I.e. Smokers pay more for health insurance due to the increased risks. Obese people should as well. (or neither should, but I don't want to get into a huge ""health insurance should be free"" debate).

I see very little to no differences between obese people and smokers. When laid out on paper they are extremely similar groups of people.

* Its well known that \[smoking/obesity\] is one of the worse things you can do to your body, causing countless medical issues and complications over a long period of time.
* There's loads on information available on \[smoking/obesity\] to all audiences, though PSAs, doctors, the internet, etc. Lack of information cannot be considered a cause in the year 2021.
* In many cases, people who are \[smoking/obesity\] know the risks, and chose to continue anyway.
* \[smoking/obesity\] is a form of addiction that can require emotional or chemical assistance to overcome. Neither is easier/harder to overcome.
* \[smoking/obesity\] is very largely related to a person's social network and upbringing.
* In those under 18 years of age, \[smoking/obesity\] is the responsibility of the parents/guardians to A. restrict access to and B. provide reasoning and information as to why.
* A huge portion of design and manufacturing (public and private) has been devoted to accommodating \[smoking/obesity\] even though its detrimental to society overall.

At the end of the day, there's are only a couple of differences I can think of, and neither should really effect my viewpoint. Open to consideration.

* Smoking can effect those around them through second hand smoke. I believe in restricting smoking in public areas, I do *not* believe in restricting where obese people can go.
* There are some legitimate medical situations in which an obese person might not have total control over their weight. There's no such excuse for smokers.

Please change my view. We as a society have chosen to take action on smoking (and rightly so). I wonder then why we seem to just accept that obesity is a thing as opposed to an epidemic (which is what it really is) and do nothing to legally combat it.",391.0
258,t3_rmy9ot,CMV: The vast majority of what drives a lot of commentary about fat people is the person's lack of sexual desire for fat people.,"I don't believe that when people come to this subreddit in particular, with a great deal of frequency, and say ""I don't think we should accept fatness and promote body positivity"", that they are driven by anything other than sexual desire. I see the words they write on the screen and the speeches they try to make, talking about how their real concern here is for their well-being, that they are so concerned about the cholesterol levels or risk of heart attack from these people they know nothing about that they decided to come to subs like these and say, please, somebody, help them with their health so that they can live healthier and better lives! Please! But I don't buy that this is their motivation. I see the words and speeches and I don't believe them for a second.

I think, overwhelmingly, that what drives people to say things like this is along the lines of ""ew, I would never have sex with a fat person."" And once you learn that, in the United States at least, fully one-third of humans are obese, that's got to be awfully upsetting to one's prospects of getting laid, as automatically you know that 1/3 of the people out there are going to be unappealing to you. So it is no surprise that this would drive people to talk about it with such frequency, for young people in particular to come to this sub practically once a week, if not more, rather than simply searching for old posts about the matter, because they are driven more by the need to vent about the fact that the health decisions of other people is limiting their sexual opportunity. If they cared more about how to actually help people in this situation, that typically inspires a person to do more research rather than trying to vent about it, so the fact that I see a lot more repeats of this same topic, and from young people in particular who are disproportionately driven by sex, just drives me to believe this to an even greater extent.

Consider also how you see the complaint about fat people almost exclusively from males. Is that proportional to the actual rates of obesity between males and females? I'm not sure I have EVER seen a female make an unsolicited post about ""gosh, fat dudes really need to get their act together"", but I do see males coming here practically once a week saying something to this effect. If you look up the data on obesity between men and women, there's some difference, but there's not THAT much of a difference. Consider also that the diagnosis of obesity is purely driven by a reading of weight, and females biologically have more body fat than males and so automatically have some biological tipping of the scales in that direction. I also tend to think that where this extra weight is displayed can still be appealing to men, men who are all about the T &amp; A. Ultimately it just doesn't seem like the actual data on obesity differences explains why males complain about it a lot more, but the physical sexual desires of males certainly goes a long ways towards explaining why they grumble about fatness so much. 

In short, I think the driving factor behind a lot of fat shaming is not actually a concern for the well-being of the overweight person, but is rather an expression of sexual frustration.

**1) Congress is grossly underpaid.** Each congress person represents on average 700,000 people. Companies that have executives that with nearly a million employees have senior executives making easily in the 7 figures. Our congressional staff make a measly $174,000/yr. Their senior staff make more than they do. They oversee a budget of $6.82 Trillion, by way of comparison, I oversee a budget that is 0.001% of that, yet I make more than they do.  That is insane. Our political leadership is grossly underpaid and they know it. They should be thinking of these jobs as a gateway to a bigger payday, until we start making these jobs pay what they are worth.

**2) We spend more on toothpaste ads.** Slight hyperbole, but not much. In 2020 Procter &amp; Gamble alone is going to spend $10.1 Billion on advertising and marketing. For 2022, political advertising and communications budget is expected to hit $8.9B. Almost none of this is public dollars.  This means that  our national politicians are (a) forced to make deals in order to raise the necessary dollars in order get into office and stay in office; and (b) are not incentivized to communicate to the broadest constituency, but rather to their core voters.  If we cared more about communicated for our political leaders than we do about our toothpaste brands, our political leaders wouldn't be forced to spend their days making deals to ensure they had funds to run for office and they could be incentivized to communicated to everyone rather than just their most active voters (though admittedly the latter would require some creative legislating that  may not pass or last).

Most people agree that snuff films are urban legends. They’re actually listed as some of the most popular urban legends ever told. The thing is though, HOW are they a myth?

Firstly, as a 14 year old on the internet way back in the day, you could find some screwed up stuff purely badly accident. For instance, the ice pick video. In recent memory it’s the plethora of cartel and isis videos. And of course, the disgusting exploits of Peter Scully. I won’t go into detail about him but if you know then you know. 

I understand that some examples I’ve given here wouldn’t necessarily be considered snuff films because they “aren’t made for purposes of entertainment,” but a few examples I have certainly are made for entertainment. 

How can we confidently say snuff films are urban legends? I can’t wrap my head around it. With the dozens of examples of regular murders captured on film, paired with some of them being recorded for the sole purpose of entertainment, how can we say snuff films are myths?

262,t3_rmuvz8,CMV: Politicians who claim that they can save the Rust Belt are being dishonest,"The nature of free trade, globalization, and automation means that there will always be winners and losers. In 2016, Trump secured the presidency by pushing a protectionist platform that promised to renege on NAFTA and the TPP and implement tariffs to prop up an unprofitable manufacturing sector. Ultimately, his tariffs ended up raising prices and hurting other sectors of the economy, and most importantly, none of the jobs that he promised came back.

The reason why those jobs aren't coming back is simple: The United States is a post-industrial economy and has been so since the 70s. Even China, the current manufacturing capital of the world, has seen average wages rise to the point where businesses are now moving their manufacturing to more affordable countries in Southeast Asia.

The Clinton campaign took the support of Rust Belt voters for granted and the Democrats still continue to push the frankly tone-deaf and patronizing idea that workers who lost their jobs should be enrolled in ""job retraining programs"" and come out the other end as freshly minted computer programmers. Do they really think that the average blue-collar mining, mill, or factory worker (who only has a high school diploma and has worked in the same job for their entire life) would magically want to (or could) become a software developer and start churning out iPhone apps to support their family?

As we enter a new age of increasing automation where 100 workers in a factory can be replaced by a team of 5, the chances of the Rust Belt returning to its former glory reach asymptotically closer and closer to zero. There is no easy answer for the Rust Belt in the same way there was no easy answer for the horse and buggy industry after the invention of the automobile or for handweavers after the invention of the mechanical loom.

I believe politicians know this but instead choose to instill false hope because anything else would cost them votes. Due to their dishonesty, our country continues to be held hostage every 4 years by the misplaced dream that the America of the 50s will rise again if you ""just vote for the right guy"" only for the same voters to be left disappointed as each year brings more job layoffs, factory closures, and abandoned neighborhoods in its wake.

263,t3_rmrsfj,CMV: Having a child is an inherently selfish act.,"First of all, I'm not saying that people shouldn't have children, but to have a child you have to be at least a little selfish. (Or at least planned children that is.) Good parents can do a lot of good for children, but those kids never technically asked to be born in the first place. Yes, parents often act selfless by putting the needs of their children above themselves, but those children didn't have any needs before thr parents made the choice to bring that child into the world.

A lot of people have children because they want to be good parents, and while that might lead to them being selfless for their kinds in the future, the initial decision was still made with the thought of the parent first. The parent wants to be a good parent, not necessarily to provide for the child, but because providing for the child makes them feel good about themselves.

Again, I'm not saying that people shouldn't have kids. I'm also not saying that people who have kids are horrible and selfish people. But the desire to have the child in the first place is inherently selfish because it is only made with the parents' happiness in consideration.",0.0

265,t3_rml2bq,CMV: The publicity around Ranked Choice Voting has sabotaged America's odds of fixing its elections,"America needs to end its First Past the Post voting. 100%. That drives the two-party system, all but prevents 3rd party success, creates spoiler effects, and incentivizes voters to act against their own preferences.

But RCV does not fix this. Of all the multi-choice ballot systems, RCV is one of the worst because it uses rounds rather than simultaneous tally.

Consider picking two **popular** candidates as your preference, rather than the typical unpopular candidate that immediately loses as seen in all RCV explainer videos.

If you ranked two popular candidates, like 1st Sanders then 2nd Biden, or 1st Cruz then 2nd Trump, Biden and Trump do not get your vote until **after** Sanders and Cruz lose. The more popular your 1st candidate, the more rounds they last, even your order choice can completely change the results because your votes for #2 are withheld every round until your #1 loses, which fails the monotonicity standard for election systems. That matters in a close election.

You're punished for picking a loser 1st candidate. Even worse, you're punished for making the most realistic and likely ballot. More real voters will write Sanders-&gt;Biden than Williamson-&gt;Biden. More real voters will write Cruz-&gt;Trump than Fiorina-&gt;Trump. Yet that's the worst strategy as a smart voter.

RCV has a spoiler effect.

(Example election, you can change the names).

And there's more. Unlike simultaneous tally election systems like the far simpler Approval and STAR voting, RCV can completely change counts with each round. This makes it harder to count large numbers of ballots, harder to track states at a national level, and harder to remove fraudulent ballots.

268,t3_rmh6ia,CMV: I do not understand why anyone would use a credit card over the alternatives,"Credit cards are not very common where I live, but I understand they are quite common in some places. From how I understand their usage, the card owner pays with them, requiring only to show the card and it's number, not enter any secret passcode in any way, and the credit card company is then charged the bill. At the end of the month, the card owner receives a billing from the company for all expenses made, plus interest for the borrowed money.

Thus, not only is it quite unsafe, often hearing about stories how children temporarily steal their parent's credit cards or other forms of credit card fraud, but one acquires extra costs in terms of intrest, and one's remaining capital is harder to keep track of, since credit card debt must be subtracted.

The system I use which is more popular here is a bank pass: to pay with it once must put it at a scanner which can be done at any store, and enter a secret 4-digit code, having only 3 attempts to do, after which it blocks, the money is directly subtracted from one's bank account, and no further interest is accrued.

One can argue credit cards allow one to spend money one does not yet have, but even with this system, one is allowed to empty one's bank account below zero to a certain degree by the bank, one will simply pay the bank interest then, so in the event one's bank account be empty, this simply becomes a credit card, but with a secret pass code, and in the event it not be empty, it remains interest-free and is automatically deducted.

This system seems superior to me, but perhaps such systems aresimply not available in countries where credit cards are popular?",0.0
269,t3_rmgtem,"CMV: ""Healthcare can't be a right because then doctors would be made slaves"" is a ridiculous argument","(Note, you can replace ""healthcare"" with basically any other social program or facility, be it education, housing, food etc, the healthcare bit is not the important bit, just one example where this argument is made)

**Argument I see made:** 

If healthcare is a human right, that means the government **has** to give it to you, which means if no doctors wanted to work (or not enough doctors), the government would have to **force** a doctor to treat you, which is **slavery**. 

**My issue with this argument**: 

There are many, for one, it's solved incredibly easily by just saying ""rights can't violate other rights"" or something, isn't that literally already in the Bill of Rights in the US? 

For two, this doesn't seem to happen with any other rights, you could justify a lot of horrible shit with something like the right to life, or right not to be tortured. Should we tap the phone of every single person all the time in order to stop any possible rights violation happening to someone? Well no of course not, that would violate other rights, so we understand it's not a good response to the argument. 

For three, there are countries with national healthcare systems where doctors are not enslaved. 

And for four, ""human rights"" are just goals we try to reach, no human right is 100% achieved, people still get murdered, tortured, enslaved, sometimes by the government in cases like George Floyd, it's not like there is some magic force compelling us to push for these rights with 100% of the power we could, I think if healthcare was a right, and we ran out of doctors, people would be understanding to the government saying ""sorry we can't help there literally are 0 doctors left they are all busy"". I find it unlikely in this scenario people would start rioting to get the doctors enslaved to help more people or whatever. 

**Disclaimer about my own beliefs on this matter:** 

Personally I do dislike sayings like ""healthcare is a human right"". For one it's wrong, it's not (talking US here mainly), the proper statement would be ""healthcare *should be* a human right"", but even that I don't like as it leads to dumb arguments like this, and people get really nitpicky about ""positive vs negative rights"". 

Nothing *is* a right inherently, we just all agree some things should be guaranteed (like not being tortured or enslaved) so we make them rights. ""universal healthcare"" means the same thing as ""healthcare as a human right"" and just sounds less strange as an argument and stops a lot of weird responses like the one I'm against here. Anything could be a right if we want it to be, but we don't have to call everything we want people to have universal access to, a right. So I'm not super attached to the saying ""healthcare is/should be a human right"", I just think this response to it is very stupid and find it surprising it comes up so often.",29.0

271,t3_rmgi4e,"CMV: The supposed interpretation of Invasion of the Body Snatchers as ""anti-mccarthy"" is a huge stretch.","I'm not including a spoiler tag because it's an old movie.

I'm posting this here because I could imagine there's something I'm missing. I don't think there is, but it's distinctly possible.

This is not a discussion of the moral sanctity of communism or McCarthyism. This is just about the movie.

Some people say this movie is anti-communist. Some say it's anti-McCarthy. Some say it's both. Edgar Wright, someone who I don't necessarily think of as being unable to analyze movies intelligently\*, said something along the lines of ""it's got both messages, but really it's an anti-McCarthy movie and the anti-communist stuff is just to throw the easily-fooled conservative censors off the scent.""

Warning: I don't care about the movie's screenwriter's professed inner thoughts, I'm talking about the movie itself. There's the thing on wikipedia where the framing narrative was added and that supposedly changes the message of the movie. I think my argument is still strong even discounting the framing narrative.

**I'm not attached to the anti-communist interpretation**, but it seems like most or all of the evidence people use to say this movie is anti-McCarthy applies to both interpretations, or is so broad that it applies to any number of things.

Let me review the evidence in favor:

1. The aliens have taken control of government institutions, like McCarthyism.

Well if there's a perceived threat, real or not, the government is going to take on a form to respond to that threat. A threat-response-form isn't necessarily an infiltration, it could just be an emergent property of the government as it's always been. And the pod people aren't infiltrating or seizing power under the guise of responding to an external threat, they're just seizing power for the sake of spreading their ""movement"" or whatever you want to call it.

Also, McCarthyism is pretty open about what it is, whereas communists (at least sometimes) hid their beliefs, like the pod people.

2. Is the movie anti-McCarthy because the humans hid their beliefs, like communists had to? At worst I'd say this applies equally well to both interpretations, since both the humans and the pod people hid their beliefs. So it's either:

Anti-mccarthy explanation: Pods (McCarthys) hid until they got the numbers to persecute their enemies, forcing the communists to hide.

or

Anti-communist explanation: Pods (Communists) hid until they got the numbers to persecute their enemies, forcing the non-communists to hide. (The second part hasn't happened yet in real life, within the metaphor of the movie).

The anti-McCarthy explanation doesn't win out between these two, in my eyes.

Acknowledging possible counterarguments: I guess I can imagine an old-timey communist saying ""I was taken aback when McCarthyism started to be popular. All these anti-communists appeared out of nowhere, like they had infiltrated.""

But it seems to me like a lot of people in the United States were just sort of always (within the relevant timeframe) anti-communist. Anti-communism didn't really spread secretly either, for the most part. To the extent that anti-communists did dealings in closed rooms in order to respond to communism... that's really just the sort of thing that happens with any government operation or political movement.

3. Also the pop people are devoid of emotion. Some say that's a metaphor for the supposed uniformity of communism, some might think that's a stretch. At any rate, it certainly doesn't help the anti-McCarthy interpretation.

\*I often read film critics saying things which I think are \[insert adjective of your choice here that means bad\] in one way or another, so I guess I'd put Edgar above all those film critics, since this is the first thing I've seen him say which I think is noticeably wrong in this way.",2.0

274,t3_rmcw9d,"CMV: We should consider courage/cowardice the same for all emotions, not just fear","DISCLAIMER: Before I get bombarded with being called ignorant about depression/anxiety/etc, for the sake of this CMV, I'm specifically talking about mentally healthy people who are experiencing emotions.

EDIT#1: Already I realize that lots of people are misunderstanding me. I'm not suggesting we eliminate feelings. By ""overcome"" I mean we don't let the feelings control us, and by ""succumb"" I mean to let the feelings control us. Overcome DOES NOT mean to stop having the feeling.

I believe we should treat responses to emotions the same way we do with fear. We encourage overcoming fear (courage), and we discourage succumbing to fear (cowardice). But for some reason we don't do the same thing with other emotions. Anger, joy, sadness, etc should have the same sort of response when someone overcomes/succumbs.

If you're furious but get a grip and let it go, at best people will say that's what you were supposed to do, but if it's fear you overcome they call you courageous. I believe the same thing for positive emotions as well. Joy can drive you to do stupid things just like any other feeling. We can envision a scenario where I get scared at a loud noise, but I keep my wits about me (courage) look around and see it's a loose tiger, then I run like crazy because that's the smart move. I fled, but it wasn't cowardice in this situation. I might get super happy, get a grip, then still decide the right move is to dance around with frivolity. But if I get excited and dance around with frivolity in a setting where it's inappropriate, people will forgive me because I was so happy (not the case if I succumb to fear).

**Don't get my shit twisted up. I'm not saying people should bottle up their feelings or become robots or live like the movie Equilibrium**. Just that we should encourage/discourage the ability to overcome one's emotions the way we do with fear.  What I object to is when we let our emotions get the best of us, not that we experience them, and I believe the way we respond to people's emotional responses does this for fear but not the others.",6.0
275,t3_rmclor,CMV: Members of Congress should not be permitted to buy and sell stock.,"Edit2: If you agree with me, cool. This post pretty much says that my current stance is universally held, as far as I can tell, so I'm looking for *arguments from the other side*. If you aren't making a good-faith argument proposing why it would be *bad* to make special rules and regulations for Congressional members, then why are you here, and why are you posting on this thread? I've already had to report like 10 comments on this thread for violating the sub's rules.

There has been enormous debate about the US members of Congress being permitted to trade stocks and bonds lately. I understand the arguments suggesting it should be prohibited, and those are extensive and thorough. In fact, they are so commonplace, both in the media in general as well as forums like Reddit, conversations day-to-day with friends, etc, that it seems almost to be a universally adopted view at this point. There is a STOCK Act, there's a statement from Speaker Pelosi as of yesterday (against it, yes), there are petitions including a White House petition, etc. It seems everywhere, now.

But seriously, I *tend* to be called ""moderate"" by friends even though I'm extremely liberal and progressive, and the reason I'm labeled that way is I often try to look out for *unintended consequences*, or at least learn some opposition theories.

So, change my mind that we *should* permit Members of Congress to trade stock? What are some problems with prohibition against it? Are there unintended consequences that people are ignoring?

Edit: I want to revise/update this post to clarify - I am talking about restrictions on Members of Congress which *do not exist* for laypersons.

I understand there's a lot of gray area here, but I would say: Members shouldn't be immune to Insider Trading laws, but I'm looking specifically for arguments that would allow members to trade stocks individually (and options, I guess?) *as long as they don't violate Insider Trading laws*, as per a regular citizen?

I'm learning about a lot of new things today :)  


On countless occasions I have found people (typically on the Internet of course) use the word ""Ableism"" incorrectly and treat it as some sort of deflection tactic in cases where the word has no viable context or application. For instance in one online discussion someone was talking about the economic problems plaguing a country in West Asia and someone, disagreeing with one of their points on economic structure, claimed that people not being able to make enough of a living was ""Ableist"" when in reality it has nothing to do with whether a person is able or not. It has to do with the economy. Then there was another instance in which during a discussion of racial prejudice, someone claimed that African Americans being treated poorly by the system (aka systemic racism) was ""Ableism"" even thought it has to do with race and nothing to do with how able a person is.

Sexism, Racism, Xenophobia, Classism, etc. have NOTHING to do with Ableism and the fact that people keep trying to call everything Ableism is really pissing me off (and this is coming from a liberal / independent).

Science shows that consciousness comes from the brain and it’s neural connections. If the brain is not alive there is no consciousness. Basically you are the brain. There is no mystical ‘soul’. Our consciousness is made up of our bodies and our brain. 

As for near death experiences I think a lot of that can be explained by brain chemicals being released during near death and are similar to dreams/hallucinations.

281,t3_rm5qp5,CMV: We live in an age of volatile simplification of political and philosophical discussions/viewpoints and it is a threat to society,"My view is this. The 20th century and social media have moderately to severely exacerbated the simplification of viewpoints and discussion topics already found in humans; the proclivity to simplify the oppositions argument as a way to cut corners on concepts to understand them more easily has been made worse by volatile ideologies over the past 100 years.

The reason I think it is not all the 20th centurys' and social medias fault is that this attitude can be seen if you go back in time as well to watch discussions regarding politics - I want to be clear that I only think of the last centurys' political and technological trends as having a negative impact but on a trend already demonstrated by humanity. Additionally the trend I'm seeing could be the result of it being more easy for people to share their opinion due to the increasing ""democritisation of information"" just due to the accessibility of social media but I digress. 

The actions taken by the Third Reich in the 20th century horrified all who were made aware of it: the nature of WWII and of the holocaust need no introduction by me (this may be apart of this wider problem I'll go into with bandwith issues but again I digress) It seems possible to me that due to such horrific acts being commited by ""Ordinary Men"", of whom's political aims they themselves thought were righteous, that people in at least the West had as a result naturally defaulted to a state of defense when their beliefs are questioned and a state of offense when someone else has a different viewpoint to them. I'll return to this later

2 years post WWII the Cold War began. If you don't know about the Cold War then it can be described well as the geopolitical tension between America and Russia over who should have Western power post WWII due to their alliance in helping to stop the International Nazi Takeover that had started by invasion of Poland on the 1st of September 1939. The atmosphere geopolitically amongst the public from 1947 to 1991 was that if you weren't Pro-America then you were a Communist. ""Communist until proven guilty"" This kind of culture seems to be inadvertently created by a government that likely rightly wanted to guard against the nuclear end times and Communist takeover that so many in the time had feared as it went against eveyething that was American to them. This was, I predict, the next major step in the inflammation of the divisive ""political-razor""

After this came, as organisms have always tried to propegate, ""efficiency efficiency efficiency"". As we progressed technologically as a result of the Cold War we wanted better tech, faster cars, faster fashion, progress as we've always desired. But what comes with this is social media. Now in the form of an abstracted network ran by code that transfers information to space and back that offers us a 24/7 everything plethora of whatever we want to see whenever we want to see it. What comes with this is a shortening of bandwidth. For example on Twitter the max was only 140 characters until recently. What this does is it naturally simplifies what detail can be specified when on forums and through channels such as Reddit even, which important issues are often talked about by the global populus. 

This limits expression of ideas and therefore decelerates the rate at which information can be learnt and applied to the conversations that are necessary for the public to be having and as a result small amounts of information are used to indicate someones political identity, this then separates wrongfully those who are slightly right leaning into the camp of fascists and white supremacists and those who are slightly left leaning into the camp of anarchists and men haters. This makes it easier for people to believe they are opponents when discussing politics. When talking is adversarial it is no longer conversaional but it is intended as directive. 

Its very rare for people to enjoy being talked down to and its better if someones points are discussed freely to examine any biases' etc. There are things like 2-3 hour podcasts that young people especially will listen to so I believe that its still possible and there are still people practicing it but theres an emerging culture of people who influence political and philosophical discussions without examining the nuances of what they believe they are against which, in my mind, can only lead to escalate things like extremism and authoritarianism. Additionally I believe we can all coexist, given anyones views aren't homocidal in their nature.

TL;DR I believe from the evidence I've given, that we live in a time of volatility in regards to political identities. That fast paced politics will only end up as separatism and extremism

EDIT: A lot of people seem to have just read the TL;DR and not the whole thing which is fine but proves the point I'm making. I said in this post that I don't think political volatility is a new thing, far from it.

When I think of the people in my high school who had the most love in their hearts - people who were good friends, who were loyal, who were kind, honest, and genuine - they were the conservative kids more often than the liberal ones. They were the ones who would be willing to take time out of their day to help you if you needed it.

The liberal kids tended to be the ones who were more academically focused - I wouldn't say smarter, because when I was in middle school, there were a number of kids from conservative backgrounds who were obviously really, really smart, but when it was time to take AP classes in high school, for some reason they didn't opt to take them. The liberal kids were more worldly -- they knew more about politics, different kinds of people, different parts of the world, etc. And they were nice -- but they also just didn't seem as genuine as the conservative kids. And obviously I can think of plenty of conservative asshole and liberal sweethearts from high school -- but in general, it was easier to connect with conservatives than liberals.

So when you normally think of conservative lack of compassion, you of course think of the racism / bigotry. But I am convinced that the racism / bigotry is not about a lack of compassion. It's about a lack of understanding. And I think the two are inextricably linked. The problem is that they don't even know that they don't understand. People will often say conservatives are willfully ignorant of other people's experiences; I think it's true, but in a very specific way -- conservatives don't care about people who aren't their friends, family, and people in their local community. From their perspective, if there are black people being imprisoned at astronomical rates, while that is sad, this is not their problem -- this is the problem of the black community. If transgender people face discrimination and violence more than any other group, this is again seen as sad but simply not relevant to them.

So is the difference between conservatives and liberals that conservatives care only about their own whereas liberals include all of humanity in their tent? I think that's what liberals want to believe -- but honestly, when I have conversations with my liberal friends (who are almost all white) about political issues, especially when they concern people who aren't white, or people who live in other countries, etc -- I am always left with the sense that they don't actually really care about these other people. Their concern doesn't come from compassion. It comes from a concern with intellectual integrity; the reason they ""care"" about the poverty of disadvantaged groups isn't because of empathy, it's that because you can social scientifically demonstrate the persistent structural disadvantage facing these groups, it would be \*wrong\* not to feel they are deserving of support. It's not compassion, it's philosophical fidelity.

In short, my liberal friends think, ""Well, it's understandable that that person turned to selling drugs to support her family due to the disadvantaged position that she found herself in, and as a result, ended up in jail"" whereas my conservative friends think, ""It's sad that some people grow up in those types of circumstances, but it was her choice to have a family before she could afford one and that she decided to commit crimes to support it."" And reading that, you think, ""How callous! What a lack of compassion!"" But what I really think it comes more from a position of: ""This person has nothing to do with me. So it's true, I *don't* care about them."" Whereas I feel like with liberals, they feel like they *should* care about people they don't know who are in difficult circumstances -- but they don't *actually* care. And I'm not saying they should -- but I actually think there is a relationship between liberal's feigned compassion for others' and conservative's actual compassion for people in their immediate social circles: there is a wealth of research showing that conservatives are happier than liberals. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that conservatives are more accepting of themselves than are liberals, and so they therefore are able to be more accepting of others who are in their life. And it's less that they aren't accepting of people they don't know who are in difficult circumstances -- rather, it's that they don't care about them because they don't actually have a real, existing, interactive relationship with them. Conservatives feel they have limited time and energy as it is for the people they care about in their life; they are not going to waste it worrying about other people, because it's the responsibility of those other people and the people who care about them to take care of each other and figure out their own problems. Whereas liberals often feel like they are never enough, never doing enough, always feeling guilty about something, etc -- so when they hear about something going badly for people in some war-torn region of the world, or a poverty-stricken black neighborhood in MIssissippi -- the reality is they don't really care, not because they are bad people, but because they have absolutely no connection with the people there. But because liberals are the ones who feel like they need to be more than who they are, better than themselves, they gin up a belief that they *should* care.

I think the only difference between liberals and conservatives is that conservatives don't feel guilty about not caring about people they don't actually care about. I think there's a lot of truth to the quip, ""A liberal is someone who can't take their own side in an argument.""",0.0

Edit: Just wanna point out how I'm totally part of a new stereotype of liberals/civil libertarians, who remember the incident, then get all confused by media portrayals of events and the possible mistrial. MSM is indeed bullshit. They never get down in the weeds. CourtTV is a bit better. I've amended my view to have some doubt on the jurisprudence side. I dunno if its a reasonable doubt. Some quantify reasonable doubt as a 10% doubt but every legal professional I've met says that's bs.

I do think everyone in that room except the jury has a pro-police bias. I think DAs were a bit eager to overcharge both Rittenhouse and Potter. This muddies the waters for jurors. I suppose there's something to be said for complaints about ""actavist DAs."" I want them to focus more on releasing non-violent offenders and not bow to public pressure and end up charging the woman with two crimes that are substantially similar. The key difference is whether she recklessly intended to injure and didn't care if he died (man 1) or whether she acted with disregard for any possible injury he could sustain (man 2). These states of mind are contradictory. Even though they are substantially similar. So the defense can easily assert a state of mind that falls short of culpability

284,t3_rlxxmw,CMV: The n-word has become dogma.,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a racist, and that by the title I do NOT mean use of the word as a slur, to diminish someone’s worth based on their race. The word (and all other racial slurs) are always unacceptable in this context. 

What I mean is this: the n-word has become the subject of such intense social stigma that ANY use of it will cause people to feel uncomfortable, as if any use of it whatsoever is something that is always indicative of the users character. 

I divide use of the word into 3 categories: Bigoted, colloquial and indirect.

By bigoted, I mean the use of the word as a slur, which like I’ve stated is unacceptable to me.

By colloquial, I mean the use of it as a replacement for “friend”, “homie”, “bro” etc. No prejudice / negative connotations attached.

By indirect, I mean when paraphrased from literature, music or other sources. For example, singing along to a rap song you like.

Can someone explain to me the harm in singing along with your favorite songs and saying whatever the artist says? Recently had a heated discussion with my partner about the topic, and she just would not agree with my position that being offended / uncomfortable about the use of the word in this context is overly sensitive / fearful of social dissent.

I would also be curious in your thoughts on colloquial usage of the word by non-black people, whether POC or white.

Point 1: Vaccines aren’t initially as effective as we thought against the spread of covid but clearly more effective against the severity of symptoms and death rates. If somebody wants to refuse a vaccine for their own reasons then they aren’t going to just kill a million people by spreading it like a madman because it is very clear that asymptomatic people spread it (vaccinated or not). 

Point 2: There is definitely more downside to the vaccine then upside for certain age groups. For example, as a 25M who is healthy, the vaccine poses more risk then no vaccine. Is is extremely unlikely I die from Covid. However, the vaccine could potentially have unforeseen negative side effects, take the event news about the JnJ vaccine for example.


Point 3: Big pharma has never had the best interest of the people, like ever. I’m not sure why everyone thinks they do now. I will never trust big pharma as I have seen normal people who have never done drugs get addicted to opioids from a surgery and die, all at the negligence of big pharma.

I don't see it setting any worse example than something such as *Star Wars* with it's villain parental figure. In particular in the case of *Boston Legal*, that Alan Shore is a rule-bending criminal is the draw of the story; the attorney blackmails, bribes, threatens, swears false oaths, hides evidence, kidnaps, intimidates witnesses, and all such manners. — Yet, I see a disproportional amount of criticism to that he also uses sexual harassment, both as a legal, and romance tactic, which I find disproportional.

This is also something I've seen both sides do in contexts outside of the media, too. It's odd and I don't really understand it.

291,t3_rlp70n,CMV: Discrimination can create societies where the people discriminated against actually are different and too often people fail to take this into account when discussing disparities,"It's not a nice view. But it is my belief that if you take two groups of people and starve more of the people in one of the groups that group will be less capable overall, assuming there weren't any other factors to offset the disadvantage. This is based on numerous studies that show malnutrition affects cognition. 

If this is true, by all means we should do everything in our power to make it so more of the people in one group are not malnourished in the future, but we also cannot expect the two groups to be identical. We should expect to see disparities, in everything that follows. 

It would not make sense, given what we know about malnutrition, for every group of children to have the same capabilities even if one group was malnourished. 

How does this tie into real life? Too often when there's a statistic showing that, say, black children don't do as well in school, there is a rush to blame the tests or the teachers-something at that level. But even if the teachers and tests had no bias, black students as a group would not be expected to do as well because of the effects of malnutrition which black students are disproportionately affected by. It does not make any sense to say it must be the teachers or the tests. It would be surprising if there weren't disparities. 

I'm not saying that anybody is born less capable, nor do I think that's the case. But factors that affect people at very young ages can cause disparities at very young ages. When one group is disproportionately negatively affected, that group is not going to perform as well, all other factors being equal. 

It would be very surprising to me if given what we know about, say, malnutrition a group that is more malnourished is as capable overall as a group that is less malnourished. 

I'm also not saying you can look at an individual and determine that they are less capable based on their skin color-you cannot. Most children of any group are not malnourished. But if you're looking at an entire group of people, and a disproportionate number of the people in that group are malnourished, this fact seems inescapable: the group that was malnourished will not be as capable. 

Now why I want this view changed: because it's uncomfortable for me to even type. I have firmly opposed the idea that there are genetic differences, but looking at everything, I don't see how we can dismiss the effects that factors at a young age, like differences in malnourishment, have on people. But to say that is essentially saying black elementary schoolers as a group are less capable than white elementary schoolers as a group because more of them were malnourished at a young age. (nourishment is only one of the factors.) As I say, that makes me extremely uncomfortable and sounds racist. But I know there's no chance of my view changing if I never talk about it, so as awful as it feels to say it, I think I need to so there's at least a chance of it changing.

292,t3_rlnp94,"CMV: It would be better for movie studios to keep movies in theaters as opposed to going straight to streaming, because of how easy it makes piracy.","I guess this must obviously be wrong, but I’m genuinely confused. Pirating movies is so easy! Entertainment is as freely available as water from a tap if you have a laptop and an internet connection. 

I’ve been pirating since I first had a laptop of my very own in middle school, and it’s the first place I go if there’s a movie I want to see. Same for many of my friends. When we decide on a movie, for many of us the first question is not “who has Disney plus?” It’s “who has a torrent going?” It’s to a point that if I recommend a movie to someone, and they ask what streaming service it’s on, I get confused why they would ask that. 

In the before times, I had to go to a theater if I wanted to see it without waiting, as the only versions found online would be cams. Now, with movies coming straight to streaming, I can pirate it immediately. 

Does a movie coming straight to streaming really result in a worthwhile increase in subscribers comparable to a movie being in theaters? I would think the people who have a subscription would watch it on the service, while people who don’t would just pirate it, but that must be wrong.

As someone who grew up in poverty, it has been nearly impossible to maintain a decent credit score to qualify for even a modest credit card (not to mention purchasing a home). I have excelled in my field and now, at 30, I have a respectable income but not enough to live comfortably AND pay my debts. 

Regardless of my situation, my main complaint with the system is that without a good credit score, you: Pay more in interest on the things you are able to finance - you cannot buy a house, so you pay more in rent vs. mortgage - you cannot get a credit card with low interest, so you are paying to use your own money.

294,t3_rlmtgy,CMV: Abolishing/defunding of police is bad,"I see a lot of posts about people wanting to defund or abolish the police. 

My view is that, while reform is certainly necessary in some capacity (IMO mainly with regards to accountability and rules of engagement for using a firearm) defunding or abolishing the police entirely would be a monumentally bad decision. It seems many feel that the solution to this is to use social workers or other non-LEO type intervention. 

Regardless of the anti-highlights you see on the news we are talking about people's who job is literally to run into gunfire or be the first on the scene in a fatal accident. 

Let's say we had a school shooting, or a drunk driver hit you and seriously injured or killed someone in your car, or someone broke into your house in the middle of the night, or someone was following you home. Would you not want a cop to intervene? Are we just going to call an emergency response social worker and talk the school shooter out of it?

And I'll say it again before the responses pour in, I support the function that police are supposed to serve in a community.

295,t3_rllt4a,CMV: All Soldiers Are Bastards,"Over the last few years I've found myself sympathetic to *All Cops Are Bastards.* It seems straightforward to me that even the kindest-hearted, most well-meaning police officer is, by simply wearing the badge, propping up and perpetuating a system of socioeconomic and racial oppression that undermines human rights while offering little promised benefit of public security. I support defunding the police and radically reconsidering the role of policing in American society. 

I grew up during 9/11, and vividly recall the anti war sentiment of the time. I recall grasping a nuance, early on, that opposing the war is **not** the same thing as opposing our troops. You can support the troops but hate the war. I took that to heart when I was young. 

I was surprised to learn the other day, in conversation with a friend who is more plugged in on social media than I am, that there is a trend amongst the youngsters / Gen Zer's on TikTok bashing or insulting individual soldiers on the basis of their being soldiers - essentially *all soldiers are bastards.* Namely in the vein of actor Adam Driver being a controversial figure due to his having served and his philanthropy work with soldiers and veterans. Upon hearing this I balked - how could people not see the nuance? That the soldiers didn't choose to start a war? Surely if these kids had lived through 9/11 they'd understand. 

My friend pointed out to me, though, that *All Soldiers Are Bastards* is hardly a leap from *All Cops Are Bastards.* The U.S. Military is an imperialist system of violence that disproportionately inflicts suffering along class and racial lines, undermines human rights, and fails to achieve its stated mission of global security for democracy or even just the U.S. The only difference is the military's evils are primarily inflicted abroad on non-US citizens. Even a low-ranking officer pushing papers on a desk in Kansas props up and perpetuates that system. 

So, reddit, I find myself with two beliefs that are wholly incompatible. I felt I had to concede to my friend that there really wasn't a difference in the two positions, therefore my CMV is that *All Soldiers Are Bastards.* Through discourse please try to:

296,t3_rlj19r,"CMV: Mental illness is often used as an insult for dismissing a healthy opponent, and psychiatry is to be blamed for this.","So many times I have seen it, whenever someone highly opinionated speaks out their mind on the internet, and when those opinions are unpopular, especially in a political setting, the opponents of those view try to refute them by asking them to seek treatment for their underlying mental illness, as if mental illness is fundamentally a flaw in character and it should be something to be ashamed of. Every time this happens, it feels like a personal attack. Isn't this what stigma is? Underneath is a belief that there is a 'cure' and what normal people would think as craziness is actually a 'condition'. This is a direct consequence of the popular marketing that psychiatric conditions are just like other medical illnesses which can be cured. This has now allowed a lot of people to dehumanize and patronize any person they can't tolerate, that they are better suited talking with a psychiatrist. The definition of what qualifies as mental illness is so loosely defined and broad in the DSM (as opposed to legal insanity) that they can actually get away with saying this. Worse than calling someone simply crazy, lunatic or mentally ill is telling them it has a cure because it's no longer banter but something more serious called gaslighting.

297,t3_rliit9,CMV: The Ministry of Magic was right to send Dolores Umbridge to Hogwarts in 'The Order of the Phoenix'.," Okay, so this is only dealing with the decision to send Dolores Umbridge, or any strong-willed representative, to the school in 'The Order of the Phoenix', and how it was actually overdue.   
I think Umbridge was ambitious, and had an evil streak (she was a Slytherin and she sent the Dementors to attack Harry at the start of the book), and she was a bad choice. However, I think by the time the story gets to ""The Order of the Phoenix"", enough has happened at Hogwarts as to warrant the Ministry taking a more active approach, and getting more involved with the school's administration.  
In book 1, a teacher dies (Quirrell), and the one item that is guaranteed to bring Voldemort back to full power is being housed at the school. Not in the Ministry, not in a high security area of Azkaban, but in a school where most of the occupants are between the ages of 11 and 18. And it's so poorly guarded that 3 first year students, using only rudimentary magic skills, are able to get all the way to where it is held. It was way easier for Quirrell. That's terribly poor oversight by everyone, but particularly Dumbledore. The Headmaster should be adamant that the Sorceror's Stone should be kept elsewhere, for the safety of the children he is in charge of. Given that every teacher knows about it, obviously security around it is terrible. That's the first problem with Dumbledore's tenure, in the books. If the school is so secure, how does a freaking troll make his way into the halls and nearly kill three students? If a troll can be let in, then maybe Hogwart's isn't the best place to be storing something like the Sorceror's Stone.  
In book 2, a freaking baselisk is terrorizing the students. Students and ghosts are being petrified, and Dumbledore can't get it under control. It's only through sheer luck that none of the students are killed by the baselisk, including Harry, who is one of the most important people in the wizarding world. Again, big problem with Dumbledore. He's supposed to be one of the most powerful wizards in the world, yet a 12 year old figures out where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is, instead of him. What was he doing as more and more students were getting petrified? Pretty serious problem with his priorities. And he *would have known* that Myrtle was the ghost of the student that was killed, seeing as he was a professor there when she was murdered. Why not ask her? It had been 50 years since she had died, and he never thought to ask her? Dumb. His poor stewardship of the school nearly led to the return of Voldemort.  
In book 3, now we're in the stage where dementors are sent to guard the school because of Sirius Black. Granted, this was at the direction of the Ministry, and not Dumbledore, but Harry got attacked twice. The most powerful wizard in the wizarding world could surely have conjured a patronus that would have kept students safe at a Quidditch match. He brings in a teacher who is a werewolf that winds up nearly killing 2 students and a professor because he can't control when he turns. It was a full freaking moon, and Dumbledore didn't think ""Gee, I should probably put some sort of protections or restraints on Professor Lupin, on the off chance he decides to, you know, be a freaking werewolf tonight, which is a full moon..."" The Ministry is outraged, parents are outraged, all of it. He even instructs Hermione in how to use the time turner to save Sirius and Buckbeak after Ron has badly broken his leg from their previous attempt. Do your own dirty work, Dumbledore! Damn. Now he has to answer for a werewolf professor that attacked students that he knowingly hired, the wizarding world's most wanted convict escaping, and a student badly injured.  
Book 4, *a student freaking dies*. One of the most promising students in Hogwart's dies, from a well-known family, under his watch. Yes, the Triwizard Tournament is a dangerous tournament, buuuuuuut he was already suspicious of Professor Moody. At no point does he maybe try to test his memory:  


""Hey, Moody, remember that time we ate that spicy Thai food and absolutely destroyed McGonagall's office bathroom as a joke?""  


""Oh yeah, that was hilarious!""  


""We never did that. Who the hell are you? *Petrificus Totalus!*""  


He had hired him, he knew he was showing the students the Unforgivable Curses, he knew that he turned a student into a ferret as punishment, these are all singularly enough to probably get a headmaster fired, particularly when you look at the track record of the previous books. By the end of the 4th book, he should have been fired 4 times over for his stupidity. In the aftermath of a student death, the Ministry *should be expected* to improve oversight.   
Then you look at his history: His father went to prison for attacking 3 muggles. His brother was a.... *goat fucker*. His sister was seen as having significant mental difficulties and died young. When you look at those things, combined with his age (roughly 114 years old by the start of the 5th book), it is reasonable for the Ministry to conclude that he was certainly slipping, and may not be the best person left in charge of children anymore. Additionally, the Ministry would have had to contend with the fact that he was dividing the wizarding world about the return of Voldemort. Granted, he was correct, but to them, there were a great many issues with his recent performance that would have made them question this.  
Now we get to the Ministry's decision to send Umbridge. Umbridge is the Ministry's representative that begins steering the course of Hogwart's closer to what the Ministry thinks is a necessary curriculum. At every turn, she is thwarted by the students and professors. She had to have been absolutely convinced of the school being turned into a sort of hotbed for Dumbledore to build the sort of devotees that he obviously had. The professors rebelled against her, and Dumbledore interceded every way he could. She fires Professor Trelawney, who serves very, very little purpose as a teacher, and she is replaced by a centaur. Centaurs are known in mythology for abducting and gang-raping women, hence the half-human / half-horse look they have. And *that threat* is what Dumbledore brings into Hogwarts, with what is probably a 50% female student body. She bans clubs and activities, and then catches the students in the Room of Requirement with a roster that says 'Dumbledore's Army'. So duh.... it would appear to her and the Ministry that he was indeed building an Army to directly challenge them. Yes, she makes the students write with the quill that uses their own blood, but if no one batted an eye when Draco got turned into a ferret, why should that quill be so bad? And then, when she finally catches the students, one of whom is communicating with a still known and wanted felon through the flu network, they say there is a weapon in the Dark Forest. Hermione leads her down there, initially to apparently be pulverized by Grawp, Hagrid's half-brother who is a freaking giant that nearly tried to squeeze Hermione to death earlier in the book and has beaten the absolute snot out of Hagrid repeatedly. With Grawp not there, they are approached by an angry group of centaurs, and she winds up attacking them while standing in front of the students, and gets dragged off.   


Now, she's a terrible choice for the role, a racist, arrogant, and all of that, and the Ministry could have chosen better. But there's no way that they shouldn't have begun having better oversight into the school, and placing someone there who was a pain in the ass and not likely to be wooed or charmed by Dumbledore was a necessity at that point.   


So Change My View, that the Ministry was wrong in placing their own loyalist representative at Hogwarts in 'The Order of the Phoenix'.",12.0
298,t3_rlfuu0,CMV: We are witnessing the end of NASA as a builder and flyer of rockets,"As we know, Space Launch System, or SLS, the flagship delivery vehicle, has had its first launch put off again, after being years and years late and umpteen billions over budget.

A first launch that will fly without crew around the Moon.

We also know that NASA has funded private alternatives like SpaceX and others that are, in some cases, performing very well for the money invested.  SpaceX is now outcompeting launch costs of every other system there is with reusability.

I can't ""prove"" SLS will fail on launch, or that it will never launch, but I am sure that, in the event of either occurrence, NASA is done, politically.  People will howl at the non-performance and the agency never live down the shame.  That's just how I read the tea leaves, and I think the endless delays bear out my suspicions that NASA is nervous, hesitant, and incompetent.

When we add James Webb, the most expensive scientific instrument ever built, which must not only survive launch, but undergo 300 separate mechanical or electronic commands to become operational, all of which must execute flawlessly, and can't be undone or repaired if they don't work, then the risk goes up immensely.

A second such failure in the space of a few months would sink them as an operator of launch vehicles or scientific probes.

How can my view be changed?  Show me their political capital is deeper than I describe, or that there is a deep sentiment of good will they can draw on, or that the amount of money spent on these two systems, if they fail, isn't a big deal, and I'll agree that they will continue getting budgets to build and fly stuff themselves.",5.0
299,t3_rlfmh4,CMV: America isn’t the best country.,"My reasons:

1) There’s no universal healthcare here, despite having generally higher taxes than places like the UK (who does have free healthcare). 

What’s more is that America’s health care costs are the highest out of 48 countries (https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)

2) We have a pretty shit education system.

For example, in student math performance, America comes in at number 39 out of 71 countries. (https://www.businessinsider.com/pisa-worldwide-ranking-of-math-science-reading-skills-2016-12)

Also, In reading, the United States ranks 24th out of 71 countries. (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/15/u-s-students-internationally-math-science/)

3) America has bad crime. “*While the United States represents about 4.2 percent of the world's population, it houses around 20 percent of the world's prisoners. Corrections (which includes prisons, jails, probation, and parole) cost around $74 billion in 2007 according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).*” 

More so, America’s crime rate is 56th out of 137 countries. (https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp)

And the murder rate per 100,000 people puts America at 89th out of 230 countries. (https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/murder-rates-by-country.html)

4) Obviously the college expenses here are simply batshit. This and the healthcare issue are the biggest contributors to why America isn’t the best.

America does have some good for sure. For example, we have probably the best entertainment culture. But just because popular things like Football, superheroes, Star Wars, or whatever is American centered doesn’t even come close to reparating for all of our issues. 
But sure, things like the National Guard, American culture, American food (which we seem to enjoy a bit too much), and the amazing geographical sights are all things that are great in this country.

But I just think the bad outweighs the good. The fact that America, for example, hides free healthcare and free college behind serving in the military simply doesn’t sit right with me. Might sound like a trivial thing to mention, but the little shit really does add up.

To prove that I’m posting this in good faith, I won’t bring up things that I don’t think are relevant.

We aren’t shoving food down people’s throats; If people want to eat 20 Big Macs per day and refuse to go for a run, that’s their problem. 

And I also won’t bring up gun violence because I understand that it’s extremely hard to compare gun deaths through countries. Also, from my understanding, much more people are saved with uses of a firearm (in self defense cases) than murdered. So that’s something I really haven’t made up my mind on.

302,t3_rlbq37,CMV: Congressional Term Limits might backfire,"So there is a popular idea both on the left and right in US politics that term limits need to be imposed on congress. While I agree that there need to be reforms to address issues of entrenched Congress members being virtually impossible to unseat and the tendency for them to be captured by lobbying interests, I do not think term limits would be the best possible solution and would likely not solve the issues which stem from the financing of campaigns. 

1) It could likely lead to a strengthening of non-elected individuals in the government. If Congress members are rotating in and out, then none of them will ever gain a complex understanding of the internal working of the government. This would mean they would have to rely on the bureaucrats and lobbyists more to navigate the political process and to draft legislation giving non-elected actors more influence on policy.
2) The incentives for Congress Members would now be more in favor of sucking up to lobbyists. If there are strict term limits to your tenure, then you are going to be going in with the calculus that this position is only a stepping stone. So you need to suck up to interest groups while in congress to make as much money as possible and to insure employment afterwards. 
3) It would make it even harder for candidates without large financial backing to get elected. Grassroots campaigns are very difficult to run let alone win. Very few people are capable of winning those kinds of races, but when they can and if they enact legislation that is representative of their constituents, then you’ve got a shot at actually keeping them in congress. However if every few years you’ve got to find a new person with no track record that has to be able to run a grassroots campaign against the people going in with large backers, then you’re gonna have even more losses than wins than today. 

I don’t think term limits in the abstract are necessarily a bad idea. In fact I think some kind of term limits with the current structure of the Supreme Court might be a good idea, and if financing was solved perhaps for congress as well. But the way the Supreme Court justices are picked and the incentive structures around how they use their power are very different from a member of congress. The current structure of campaign financing makes term limits at best completely inadequate and in my view would only exasperate the problem of financing.",2.0

The impact of pilot video game terms in chats and blatant refusal to hold anyone in special forces accountable - two after action reviews out of over 1,600 strikes reviewed, one on the ground and 12 consolation payments over several years - should bother us and our allies.*

*62% of casualties are children, over 2.5 times the previous estimate.  Others are angry and disabled survivors. Our precision munitions have become a surprising excuse to bomb closer to and bomb more civilians. We fail to review results tainted by confirmation bias and no cultural knowledge (“they look like a terrorist so they must be a terrorist”). Residents sometimes look up to terrorist groups for stability because rural towns are destroyed and their only information source is propaganda.*

*We don’t yet have records from Afghanistan (these suits have been since 2017) but let’s assume the same failures are taking place from Somali to Mail to Pakistan to Yemen.* How is bombing cotton mills and hospitals under IS control Russian Air Force-style going to win the West this war?

**Views at end section. **

***

The Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/18/us/airstrikes-pentagon-records-civilian-deaths.html) today 62% of drone strikes kill children. In over 50% of strikes a double tap even on just civilian targets kills more civilians. 75% of civilian casualties were reported as enemies. 40% of survivors are crippled. 88% of allegations aren’t investigated at all. Only two strikes in Afghanistan and Syria have resulted in an after action review, one on the ground. Only 12 payments have been made to survivors despite a half million dollar appropriation every year. (Shorter summary article [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/18/us/airstrikes-civilian-casualty-files-pentagon.html).)

Afghanistan records remain under litigation. FOIA suits for Iraq and Syria are ongoing since 2017 and required specific detail as to each air strike to begin that process. 

The central finding is the impact of confirmation bias, and that precision bombing appears to encourage more bombings in close proximity to civilians. My view: this is just ugly.  What’s the use of no-strike targets and rules unlike the Russians in Syria if they are broken repeatedly? Operators are typing “area be poppin” then killing 3/1/3 (three men, one woman, three children) in a cotton gin mill as a righteous strike because ISIS uses cotton. Or a hospital because an enemy Imam walked into it two weeks before. 

From Obama through Biden the precision strategy isn’t delivering as publicly promised. In many cases the teams aren’t doing their assigned tasks. The paperwork fails. The reviews are nonexistent or a joke. Evidence goes missing. Sites are denied existence because a single witness of dozens on a website didn’t confirm what the operators saw. Sometimes there aren’t enough drones and shortcuts are taken. Sometimes an operator misreads cultural cues (i.e., striking a cemetery funeral procession when Islam rarely has such processions in a cemetery).

There will be a lot of injured young men and broken families in these places that will be very angry at the West. Many will [remember](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/01/what-america-never-understood-about-isis/amp/) ISIS as state builders before bombs fell, instead of the taxpayers that build their states. How can they not when the leading cause of death isn’t the enemy but their national armies and their [allies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953440/). And this isn’t just in the Middle East but undoubtedly is the same issue in Somalia, Mali, Yemen, Pakistan, you name it. Apparently the U.S. misled its own allies with stricter casualty rules to conduct air strikes on its behalf with the same results (Netherlands, Australia).


Confirmation bias is a serious issue since forever. But now we have well-funded and well-staffed tools to put good targeting into effect, and counter bias with training, but apparently purposefully with little accountability, just aren’t. 

***

**My view:**

* There must be a better way to be effective in the war on terror than deferring war to teenagers and **it starts with breaking skulls of poor performing special forces and drone operators doing the work. The worship of special forces not seen since Vietnam must cede to reality in 2022. **

* This failure by the Pentagon but also presidents and congresses is fueling sentiment against the West. **I’m really not convinced about the fog of war arguments and the need to be cruel sometimes to win, because this particular war against shifting populations, urban and rural, can’t be won this way, by any party in charge. **

* We spend far **too many resources to sell the “cleanest wars” in history as President Obama said** only to double tap a family of “squirters” and family minivans in downtown Raqqa. Then **we complain about funding the government. We should end this insanity, use more effective and intelligent but riskier troops if necessary, and bear the real consequences Americans chose of policing terrorism instead of special forces and contractors (twice as many have died as troops)** around the globe. ^may ^be ^controversial 

* **This all falls due to confirmation bias, bureaucratic diffusion of responsibility, failure to record lessons** to teach airmen about mistakes, and outright lies to regulators.

* This problem can be quickly solved using simple modifications to enforce existing protocols, like clear paperwork. I may be wrong.",9.0
305,t3_rl83cw,"CMV: Are feelings valid? At times only for their existence, not the content","×× Disclaimer... feelings related to mental health conditions are excluded from the discussion.   The blur between reality and unreality is real and cannot/must not be minimised through philosophical discussion. 

I've been thinking about this latest fad for a while now.  The fad being, in my opinion,  for (people younger 40'ish in the main) people wanting to be told their feelings are valid.  

And generally what they are saying (100% of the time in my case but I'll say generally) is that they cannot be told they are wrong.   To them the perception and receipt of a feeling is valid... full stop.  Therefore if I don't agree I am invalidating them.  Therefore I am wrong.   Therefore they retreat from the argument believing they now inhabit the moral high ground. 

Certainly all feelings are valid through the simple fact that they have existed and are therefore authentically real.  It's simply there.  A passing thought.  That feeling in that moment is valid... but what that really means is the *validity is in its existence only.""

Thinking about the actual meaning of the word ""valid""... ""having a sound basis in logic or fact "" ... and thinking of synomyms for the word such as ""reasonable"" or ""cogent""... then there there becomes a realisation that feelings,  by their very nature, cannot be valid.  They can only be valid if the evidence itself validates them.

There's the added consideration that feelings can lead to actions (actions including those that exist only in the brain... to choose to ignore or justify the feeling for example).  And it's actions and inactions that can be judged. 

So my problem has been that telling someone that their feelings are valid, is like saying they are right.  If I think they are right I say so and this is validating them.  

Perhaps a simplified example. The example is a thought experiment and has not happened.  

-- My daughter is discussing feelings of anger towards her SO.
--  Initially I take this as venting and provide the space for her to do that.
--  eventually the discussion becomes circular with her coming back around to different points and wanting me to agree with her feelings. 
--  I believe she has antagonised the situation.   I was there at the time and I saw her own contribution to the problem.  I've allowed her to vent so her brain has the space to let that go and potentially make room for solutions.   Now her talking has become circular I see no reason to withhold my opinion.   I tell her the bits of her own behaviour that could have exacerbated the issue.
--  cue righteous anger with the lead accusation being  ""you are invalidating my feelings "".

I'm saying her anger is only valid in the fact that it existed in a moment.  Her subsequently choosing to believe the anger is reasonable to feel is not valid if the circumstances don't support it.  Having to listen to an alternative point of view is not invalidating.. . it is simply information.",17.0
306,t3_rl371t,CMV: Web 3.0 is not immune from the problems affecting Web 2.0,"2021 was a big year for Web 3.0 (lots of chatter about cryptocurrencies, NFTs becomes a household term, etc.) and I've more recently been seeing a lot of posts on Reddit, YT, and Tiktok hyping up all of the potential for Web 3.0, namely the decentralized nature that makes it ""free of third party intermediaries"" (this phrasing comes from /r/web3). In [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=89fbBdvHIt8), the CEO of Bitfury explains that one of the issues of Web 2.0 is that a handful of companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) ""own the Internet"" because the internet is run off of servers that they own. In turn, since Web 3.0 will have everything decentralized, the ""new Internet"" would be run by and for ""the people,"" making it so no one tech giant could run the show. While I agree that these companies do currently own servers and run services that the majority of the Internet relies on, this doesn't really seem to be a byproduct of Web 2.0's design (and thus something that could be fixed with Web 3.0) but rather one that stems from monopolistic practices and anti-competitive nature. 

As far as I have read/seen, there is nothing that stops a company from creating a service in Web 3.0 that no one is *forced* to use but nevertheless the vast majority of people rely on because it's the standard or the cheapest or they're the only real player after they've pushed other competitors out of the market. In Web 2.0, this would be like AWS, Google Search/Ads, etc.

In fact, since most users of Web 3.0 won't have any idea how to deal with the blockchain directly (not everyone is a coder), most people will have to rely on 3rd party exchanges or companies to get them access to this ""decentralized network,"" effectively bypassing what is touted as one of Web 3.0's main benefits. Most people and businesses would have to go through services created by tech companies (could be Google, could be Meta, could be a new tech giant) and then we're back to being reliant on a few big companies. We see that now with how most cryptocurrencies are traded and/or used through third-party exchanges and apps - there are a number of exchanges, but there are definitely a few big players and nothing to stop them from eventually monopolizing the whole game.

Anyway, I wanted to get folks thoughts on this because I would actually love to be wrong about this. I am quite frustrated with the monopolization of the web and our reliance on huge tech companies and I would love to live in a future where that is not the case.

A ten year old Ford Focus with 150k miles should cost nearly five digits, and yet that has become the norm. Food prices are significantly higher than they’ve been and home prices are astronomical.

317,t3_rkpsty,Cmv: Land acknowledgments are stupid,"I'm a student at a large public university in the pacific northwest, and its very common here to see formal announcements, meetings, and disclaimers at the bottom of web pages contain a land acknowledgement.

This generally consists of naming a local ethnic group, praising their ancestors, and apologizing for colonialism.

This is quickly becoming the liberal version of the pledge of allegiance, a meaningless ritual meant to affirm our collective devotion to our side in the culture war.

In these acknowledgments they typically say something like ""the [ethnic group] have inhabited this land since time immemorial"". Which is obviously false. If it were any other ethnic group these people would be the first to tell you that ethnicities are a social construct. But for some reason we're supposed to pretend that native american society existed exactly as it was when encountered by europeans for eternity.

319,t3_rko1bn,"CMV: I believe that in partisan politics facts, truth and sound reasoning inherently tend to be more moderating and democratic than deceit, lies and partisan motivated reasoning, which tend to be inherently more polarizing and authoritarian","I pose this OP this because an increasing number of Americans, now a non-trivial minority, involved in some way or another in politics believe that the ends justify the means. Such means include, lying, deceiving, hiding behind unwarranted opacity, irrationally emotionally manipulating and relying on partisan motivated reasoning ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated\_reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning)) in their discourse with others. In this OP, lies mean non-trivial lies ***in politics*** not little white lies that help smooth social and family interactions.

Two lines of fact- and truth-based reasoning that I find to be persuasive converge on the belief that ***for politics*** facts, truth and sound reasoning tend to be more anti-authoritarian and pro-democratic than non-trivial lies, deceit, unwarranted opacity and partisans who rely on motivated reasoning. One line of argument comes from moral philosophy. That reasoning holds that when people are deceived, including irrationally emotionally manipulated, and they act on the basis of false beliefs or exaggerated (irrational) emotional responses, they are deprived on the power to make political decisions on the basis of facts, true truths and more rational sound-defensible reasoning. If one defines authoritarianism as a system where power is mostly concentrated among elite and wealthy people and interests, deceived people unknowingly transfer whatever power there is in deciding for themselves. Authoritarians, e.g., fascists, communists, neoliberals, etc., generally prefer power to the state or powerful commercial interests over societies that operate with more power distributed to the masses.

A second line of reasoning is grounded in research evidence from cognitive and behavioral sciences. There, research has found that when people are lied to and emotionally manipulated, usually by exposing people to (i) divisive lies and false conspiracies, and/or (ii) fomenting unwarranted emotional responses such as fear, anger, distrust, intolerance, bigotry, etc., the human mind tends to reduce or completely switch from relatively more control by conscious reasoning ([Khaneman's ""system 2""](https://fs.blog/daniel-kahneman-the-two-systems/)) to the unconscious mind and its mode of reasoning (system 1). Unconsciousness reasoning is much faster and far more powerful than the conscious mind and its severely limited sensory input processing capacity. The unconscious mind tends to be intuitive and emotional (not logical), biased and [morally intolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_foundations_theory).

A third line of reasoning is that when asked most Americans appear to still say that (1) they rely on facts, true truths, and sound reasoning without resort to unwarranted emotional manipulation, and (2) but the political opposition does do those bad things. Current political science research indicates that most people, including liberals, moderates and conservatives, rely much less on (1) than they believe. The human mind is a powerful machine for creating comforting, self-affirming delusions. That aspect of the human condition arguably amounts to an existential threat to modern civilization and billions of people alive today, maybe even to the existence of the human species.

Therefore, I believe that people dealing with politics who often or usually lie, deceive, hide inconvenient facts and/or truths, are usually more partisan and authoritarian and less moral than people who try to be honest, transparent and apply less biased but more fact and logic-based reasoning. Change my view because holding this belief is not pleasant. What are the flaws behind that personal belief?",16.0

322,t3_rkm3cv,CMV: Covid vaccine mandates are bad,"Disclaimer/Edit: By mandates I mean passports. As in, you can't go to gyms, restaurants or bars unless you're vaccinated. I'm fine with employer mandated vaccines as long as there's liability and all that.

I've already seen a bunch of debates on this, and I currently think the ""Vaccine mandates are bad"" side is winning. Most of the debates end at the same place, so I want to see if anyone can further the discussion. Here's how they usually go:

Negative: Imposing a medical operation on someone just because they're stupid is wrong. Imagine if a bunch of religious people started killing people just because they thought they were sending people to the after life. It doesn't matter who's objectively right. Don't violate someone's bodily autonomy just because they're stupid.

Affirmative: Unvaccinated people are aggressing on everyone else by spreading the disease. The analogy isn't one-to-one because the people being killed are innocent. A better analogy would be a horde of vegetarian zombies are roaming around on the streets and they're spreading parasites and disease and the cure is a simple jab that makes them sick for a day.

Negative: Alright let's say they're mindless zombies aggressing on everyone else just by their mere existence. Violating bodily autonomy should still be the last resort, and should only be used if you have an actual risk of dying. The hospitalization rate is below 1%. The death rate is even lower.

Affirmative: It is the last resort. We've had periodic locked downs for over a year. Just because the hospitalization rate is below 1% doesn't mean we shouldn't violate their bodily autonomy. There's a chance that the virus will mutate because of the unvaccinated.

Negative: 1% of 300 million isn't enough to violate bodily autonomy. Smoking kills more. Besides, if the virus mutates it is highly likely it won't be deadly because deadly strains will have an R less than 1. Using lock downs to prevent hospitals from being overrun is a better solution.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point the affirmative side stops making good points, which is where you guys come in. I think the weakest point on the negative side was the ""Smoking kills more"" point because smoking actually has some utility whereas covid doesn't, so maybe start there. I still think the ""1% of 300 million isn't enough"" point could stand on its own though, so that might be a red herring.",0.0

324,t3_rkk1r0,CMV: Vigilante justice against perpetrators of sexual violence would be a net positive to society.,"Hopefully this doesn’t get taken down for being too offensive. 

Realistically when someone is sexually assaulted or raped there is a minuscule chance that justice will be served. Of the assaults that are reported, only about 5% end in an arrest and even fewer are convicted. The VAST majority go unreported and most perpetrators have multiple victims. 

Giving victims (or their supporters) the leeway to take justice into their own hands means:
- more criminals will pay for their crimes
- stop generational trauma (for both victims &amp; children of perpetrators, who often commit similar crimes)
- fewer instances of addiction &amp; suicide 
- fewer victims suffering from PTSD &amp; the side effects mean they can contribute more to society, economy, etc.
- if this was the standard, you’d have far fewer instances of harassment, assault, rape, etc. due to criminals’ fear of repercussion
- sex in general would be healthier and more consensual because all involved parties would want to avoid miscommunication 


I don’t have a perfect solution…but I feel that the best way to protect from rampant vigilante justice for crimes unrelated to sexual assault would be that any victim who goes to a therapist/counselor/doctor/teacher and tells them about the crime would also be allowed to give personal information on the perpetrator. That information can then be entered into a database so that detectives can confirm this person was accused of sexual violence and they then would not be required to investigate the vigilante. The professions I listed are merely examples of people who’ve likely dealt with this type of trauma before so they can determine (better than the average person) whether or not the claim is true before inputting personal information into the database. 

The two biggest flaws I see: 
- This method would require the victim to speak with a professional. There may be financial or other personal barriers, in which case I do not advocate for the vigilante approach. 
- This doesn’t entirely eliminate the possibility of false reports. 

The major argument that will likely be proposed but will not change my view is false reporting. Stats for this kind of crime are difficult but from what research can tell only about 2-10% of assault charges are false/baseless. With vigilante justice I think that number would go down because:
- fear of repercussions would result in more people confirming consent
- experienced therapists/doctors/etc. are the only people allowed to add names to the database, and as I mentioned before they can better determine if a claim is false

Even without those 2 points I feel that false reports is not enough. I still see vigilantism as a net positive.


EDIT: Based on the discussions here, I no longer think vigilantism is the best remedy to sexual violence. I now believe that anyone who chooses to have sex should have to sign a “sex contract” showing that the act was consensual.

EDIT 2: Someone has pointed out that sex contracts get very messy in the instance of spousal rape. I’m still willing to hear additional comments to change my view.",0.0
325,t3_rkjmca,cmv: Full auto? Full send!,"So the center idea of this is that I’m American. I think this applies in America. Other nations have different law, culture, and a host of other differences and I don’t speak for them. Because of this I won’t address issues seen in the UK, Germany, Australia, or any other nation. I’m simply not informed and can’t speak on it intelligently. 

That out of the way lets not delay. 

I think full automatic weapons (being those that when one pulls and holds the trigger the entire mag will fire until empty or jammed) should be legal for any adult to buy. As it stands any adult can buy these weapons if they bribe Uncle Sam with enough money and holds a clean record. The same holds true for suppressors and short barrel rifles (I am cool talking about those as well if anyone wants but my focus of this post is full autos). 

Now there are a few issues here. 

1 such restrictions are blatantly unconstitutional. “Shall not be infringed” is clear language as it gets. If people wanted to remove the second than fine. Go ahead and try but as it stands such restrictions are obviously illegal. There has been president that the 2A only applies to military weapons but even then fully automatic weapons have been proved time and again in conflict up to and including today. I disagree with this interpretation but if you want to take it my point still stands. 

2 assuming we ignore 2A most crime is committed with hand guns. Very few of which are full auto even in military use. That simply isn’t the role a side arm has. If your concern was to ban weapons that were used in crime there is little reason to ban full autos but not hand guns. The only reason I can see is baby steps to slowly remove gun rights over many years. 

3 full autos used to be perfectly fine to own before the valentine’s Day massacre. This was a brutal mob massacre. The history is kinda interesting and I recommend looking into it. For those who can’t be bothered that is fine and I won’t bring it up in comments unless you do. This is Reddit not an official debate. 

4 it is trivial to make a full auto weapon. I’ve priced it out and could make one for less than 500 US dollars in an afternoon. If I was evil enough to murder do you really think law would stop me from making one? Yea it wouldn’t be as good but a slam fire weapon is easy to make and shockingly reliable even if made in bubba’s shed. Further most shootings happen at very short range so accuracy isn’t an issue.

326,t3_rkifp0,"CMV: Murder (even abortion) is much worse, morally, than rape","I was having a discussion with a woman about this just the other day.



She was of the opinion that rape was *so much worse* than the alternative, and that I wouldn't understand because I've never been raped... Soon after admitting that she'd never been sexually assaulted herself, I enquired as to *why* rape was worse than murder (given that we were the same in this respect).



She told me words to the effect of, ""Because it ruins the life/mental health of the victim for life!""



I then responded with what I believe to be true: depriving someone of life (specifically abortion, killing of an innocent) wouldn't even allow that person the chance of recovering from sexual assault (if it were even to happen to them).



Besides, in my opinion, rape, like *most* things in life (except murder, in terms of the aftermath of non-existence—not the actual way in which they're murdered), exists on a spectrum... There's date rape, rape in which one hasn't even realised they've been raped, blurred lines of consent (drinking, etc), outright stranger rape, rape while being married, etc etc.



I've spoken to some women and a lot of their fantasies/kinks involve being raped/sleeping sex... I'm not going to go into this one because I'm a man and I have no idea about the ethical and realistic, flesh and blood boundaries that divide rape from imagination—especially from their subjective point of at the time in which they told me that.



My bottom line point here is that being raped = the possibility of leading a normal life (with therapy, medication, CBT, EMDR, TMS, etc etc in more extreme cases), while being murdered = being deprived of the chance of ever living any kind of life, as miserable as it may be.



Full disclosure: I am most certainly both pro-choice and definitely anti-rape, but I believe that murder (specifically abortion, killing of an innocent) is much worse of a moral issue/'crime' (even though it's legal where I live) than murder... It allows the person a *chance* to live a normal life rather than simply wiping out them living a full, potentially great life, even given potential chance of sexual assault happening to them (taking into account the support networks available in modern times for sexual assault) if their existence had not been annihilated prior to birth or after.",0.0

Because climate change is a global phenomenon, we need the vast majority of people to do actual changes in their lifestyles. Something I just do not see happen, even when it literally is too late.

Honestly, I've reached a point where I believe spending any amount of money or effort on this matter is futile, just looking at the actions of people today. We should just enjoy doing whatever we want with the earth as long as it lasts for humans because we won't do anything meaningful about it (not because we can't, but because too many people won't).

328,t3_rkfvc8,CMV: Birthright citizenship is an excellent idea,"Hey guys! I've been hearing a lot on Reddit about how some want to end birthright citizenship. I completely disagree with this and think birthright citizenship is an excellent idea. The main argument I hear is that if some illegal immigrant gives birth on American soil, the child is not *really* American. I disagree with this, because to me, citizenship is not really predicated on DNA. Some kid born to an illegal immigrant or to a legal immigrant that forgot to sign some form or another who grew up in American society going to American schools consuming American media in the US is American and should be treated as such in my opinion.

It also jives with the idea of America being a nation of immigrants and opportunity, deporting someone because their parents forgot to sign an obscure form 20+ years ago doesn't really fit with our national principles and is pretty messed up. People also get stuck on anchor babies, I really don't have a problem with them. I say the more the merrier and one more person getting to experience the American dream is a positive in my book.

So I was in a conversation with a friend who supports this idea. Essentially according to them the cycling education is very shit in north America. It leads people to not know the rules of the road or how it applies to them and can create unsafe situations. People ride there bicycles on the sidewalk, run red lights. and cause other traffic violations cause they don't know any better.

My main reasons for not supporting this are:

1. It would kill cycling, people aren't going to pick up a bicycle and ride it to work if they have to go get a licence to ride one. (Honestly ask yourself if you would every cycle again if you had to go through a year long process of getting a licence to ride a bike)
2. It costs alot of money, The main reason a city should encourage cycling is because it lowers infrastructure maintenance costs and can increase tax revenue if other cycle freindly steps are taken to make your city more cyclable. (higher density, more buisnesses in residential areas ect.)
3. If you want to make the roads safer the cheaper solution is too get proper cycling infrastructure, just because our infrastructure isn't there yet doesn't mean we should kill cycling until than. What are we just going to build a bicycle city while no one cycles and then when it's 100% perfect remove the licensing requirements?

331,t3_rk9fe5,CMV: The world's governments are currently transitioning into authoritarian states under the false pretext of taking measures to combat the pandemic and its associated effects.,"

The Australian government is forcing vaccination of its indigenous aboriginal population.

Austrians could face prison if not vaccinated by February. 

Where is the line? How many measures like this can be imposed on its citizens in the name of the public good. At a certain point, you have to consider that if it walks like a duck…

I can understand vaccination mandates for federal employees and those that are employed in high population environments but a state mandate imposed on its entire citizenry is taking it too far. These are authoritarian mandates effectively undoing the citizenry's right to body autonomy; slippery slopes potentially leading to disastrous outcomes that far outweigh any threat that a Covid-19 pandemic poses - which leads me to my next point…

People are now having microchips implanted that include vaccination records. If you can’t see how that’s a slippery slope, I don’t know what to tell you. The implications of that kind of technology and its potential applications falling into the wrong hands is terrifying. 
Another thing that walks like ducks… The endless pattern of a new variant, new lockdown, new booster are red herrings meant to distract and fatigue the citizenry from seeing their freedoms erode at an almost imperceptible rate.

One of the largest protests in human history is taking place in some of the more authoritarian-leaning countries in opposition to the mandates. Of course, the mainstream media covers none of this. It is clear that the collective concern is not one of fringe conspiracy theorists but rationally minded individuals that can see the forest for the trees.

The definition of Anti-Vaxxer has recently been modified. I can understand the definition of ""Anti-Vaxxer"" encompassing anyone who opposes vaccination but extending that definition to ""anyone that opposes LAWS that mandate vaccines"" is troubling at the least.

333,t3_rk9d5l,"CMV: The understanding of gender as a function solely of individual self-expression is not conducive to the understanding of sexuality identity in terms of Gay, Straight and Bi.","For the purposes of this post, I’m going to refer to sexuality in the sense of sexual orientation, i.e., who you would want to have sex with. I honestly don’t have any experience with asexual people and don’t want to speak on their experiences at all, so they don’t appear in this, but I hope they are doing great. Again, for the purposes of this post, one’s gender identity will be what gender they internally identify as – no matter what they look like. This could be Male, Female, Non-Binary. Someone that is gay is someone that identifies as Male or Female who is sexually attracted to someone that is the same gender. This has seemed to me to be the way that talk about this sort of stuff.

The idea that someone can be whatever gender they want to be inside, no matter how they externally present or behave does not allow for people to define their own sexuality in the common terms of straight, gay, or bi. In fact, it directly contravenes these terms. For most people sexual attraction is some function of how people appear, how they behave, and how they present in society. It does not depend on how the object of the desire views themselves. If Natalie Portman viewed themselves as a male (having trouble with pronouns, sorry), it would not – such that no one else knew – change who found them attractive.

However, if you take the idea that gender is fully self-identified, then Natalie Portman’s new view that he (probably right in this context) was a male would then make large swathes of people now bi-sexual, or pan, or whatever they had additionally + men. Which invalidates their self-assigned sexual identity without their knowledge, which I see as not making any sense.

Further still, if gender identity is self-assessed and valid, despite external viewing of it, then how can anyone’s attractiveness to one another depend on that identity when may be unknowable to the person that is attracted. How can it be possible to differentiate people based on gender, via labels of Gay, Straight, Bi, etc. when the only one that can 100% know what gender identity is correct is object of attraction. At this point it makes no sense to even have gender-based segregation of sexuality.

I guess I’ll leave you with a hypothetical thought experiment – Schrödinger’s Sexuality? I’m a man who has only (so far) been attracted to women. I have a long-term partner, whom I love very dearly. Secretly, they start to identify as a man, but I am not to know. They don’t seek to change their life at all but still identify as a man in this scenario. There is no exterior evidence discernible to me, but I am still in love, both physically and emotionally with this person. They have not told me yet, but they have told their friends and family.

Let me start by saying this: I believe the ability of the scientific method to discover the truth. Every fact that I believe is subject to change pending better evidence. I am not getting the vaccines because I have a genetic predisposition towards myocarditis (it killed my grandfather), which is the most common adverse side effect of the vaccines in my age group.

I survived the alpha variant in February 2020.

Natural immunity following recovery from infection is stronger and longer lasting than any of the vaccines. 

What is it about the artificially derived mRNA triggered antibodies compared to the natural antibodies that makes them garner a person the ability to go into a store? They are produced by the same cells that have encountered the actual virus and retain an immune response for longer compared to the antibodies from getting one of the mRNA vaccines.

[The natural immune response is more complete than the vaccinated immune response](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-19) because it is able to target more than just the spike protein (which evolves rapidly), and the latest study data is showing no drop off of immunity during the studied period, unlike the vaccines.

&gt;Virus-specific B cells increased over time. People had more memory B cells six months after symptom onset than at one month afterwards. Although the number of these cells appeared to reach a plateau after a few months, levels didn’t decline over the period studied.

&gt;Levels of T cells for the virus also remained high after infection. Six months after symptom onset, 92% of participants had CD4+ T cells that recognized the virus. These cells help coordinate the immune response. About half the participants had CD8+ T cells, which kill cells that are infected by the virus.

[There's also this paper](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-response-vaccination-after-covid-19) that directly compares the vaccinated immunity to natural immunity. 

quote:
&gt;Overall, those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had higher levels of antibodies at all three time points. The levels of antibodies taken before vaccination in people who were previously infected by the virus were similar to those seen in uninfected people after their first shot. Antibody levels in previously infected people after their first shot were as high as those from uninfected people after their second shot.

Add all that to  [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114674/)

&gt;We believe that the public should be fully informed that vaccines, though effective in preventing infections, may have long term adverse effects. 

Given all that I don't see how you can be in favor of vaccine mandates or firing someone who survived covid and doesn't want the shot.

336,t3_rk79ru,CMV: Politicians should get paid more to encourage more qualified professionals to seek office,"Inspired by another recent post on this sub. 

I believe that the current salary being offered to politicians in the US is not enough to attract qualified professionals to seek office. A google search reveals that a senator in the US gets paid around $170k per year, which is a high salary compared to the average, but it is in line with senior leadership positions (Directors and VP level) in the corporate world. However, the level of responsibility that a senator has in comparison to a VP at a medium sized company is on an entirely different level, which I believe entails a higher pay level. 

Furthermore, I believe the cost of seeking office should be factored into the pay of politicians as well. Prospective candidates have to spend time and resources campaigning for the job and there is an inherent risk of not winning the election. So in the case that the candidate does successfully take office, the pay should be higher to compensate for the risks taken. 

There are a few more points I can think of but this is the gist of my position. Please let me know what you think.",0.0
337,t3_rk63wa,"CMV: The Left should prioritize addressing the increase in crime, or risk losing important related initiatives including excessive sentencing and excessive use of force.","This post pertains to the current U.S. crime situation. Violent crime is up 4% for the first 9 months of 2021 over prior year which is on top of a 36% increase in violent crime for that same time period in 2020 as compared to 2019, based on an FBI report looking at 22 U.S. cities.  An October, a Pew Research poll showed that 61% of Americans believe that violent crime is ""a very big problem.""  Additionally, a group of 20 leading retailers including Target, CVS and Best Buy have recently lobbied Washington to address the increase in “smash and grabs” which causes significant economic damage and negatively affects employee mental health.

Some on the left seem to believe the increase in crime is a sign of economic decay that has forced those most negatively affected by wealth and income inequality into committing crime.  They believe the focus should be on the factors behind the crime, not on reducing the crime.  Others such as Daniel Cox author of the following Five Thirty Eight article, believe that crime is unlikely to be an issue in the 2022 midterms as Democrats views in the last 12 months are changing towards the police, the GOP may not hold the same advantage over Democrats with respect to public opinion of who handles crime better and even liberal strongholds such as Minneapolis seemed to reject defunding the police.

[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-crime-likely-wont-be-an-issue-in-the-2022-midterms/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-crime-likely-wont-be-an-issue-in-the-2022-midterms/)

&amp;#x200B;

History tells us that Republicans will likely gain significant seats in Congress as there is typically a ""swing back"" in the opposite direction two years after a presidential election.  Politicians however do garner support, including financial support, political allies and the support of voters based on the issues they campaign on.  Donald Trump promised to ""drain the swamp"" and install conservative justices and in office he worked to gut / alter certain government institutions and traditions to the support of his populist base and nominated 3 conservative supreme court justices to the support of the Christian right.  That cemented his popularity amongst the Right.  The Democrats dominated the recent elections with a promise of addressing climate change, repeal of the Trump tax cuts and implementing social policies to provide working Americans more life balance and financial security.  Their base is clamoring for results and the view in the Democratic Party is that they cant return to their supporters empty handed so they need to pass a significant bill addressing these issues (i.e. Build Back Better).  Succeed and they believe they will have strong support from the Left.  The result of why a party gains power in government is complex and varied.  The economy, COVID and the former President's dis-likeability may have sunk Trump, but Dems have to follow through on their promises to keep their support.  If Republicans gain power in 2022, which they likely will, the economy plus just the way voter sentiment works may likely be the culprit, but they must deliver for their constituents.

My view is that rising crime is a big problem for America.  The American public believes this to be true and data tends to support it.  The left in aggregate seems unsure how to address it as we've had an awakening as a country as to how ""tough on crime"" can damage minority and poor communities.  Many on the left don't want to see a return to ""tough on crime"" tactics.  They'd rather either focus on other issues or wait to see if this improves naturally as the impacts of the pandemic abate.

I believe this is dangerous for certain issues including combating excessive incarceration and excessive use of force by police officers, racial profiling and police brutality.  While I can't find any data on support for a more broad police reform that does not include defunding, their is evidence of support for a variety of changes to specific policing tactics including choke holds and mandated use of body cams.  Individual officer liability, racial bias training, increased mental health support, etc. are areas of improvement that are being discussed.  As far as excessive sentencing goes, there seems to be growing support for addressing this issue amongst all Americans.  Even Trump, pursued overturning high-profile excessive sentencing during his term in office at a time when crime wasn't a major issue.  In this climate it's questionable whether he would prioritize that agenda.

So if the Left addresses the crime issue, and is seen as making America safer, they can leverage this credibility and support to reduce problematic areas of our criminal justice system.  If they don't, they allow conservatives to run on a popular issue that will resonate with voters and will drown out any conversation on other criminal justice reforms.  Conservatives will have gained support on being ""tough on crime,"" and they will caste any criminal justice reform as ""soft on crime,"" attempting to delegitimize support for this issue.  They must follow through for their supporters and constituents.  This applies to the national conversation but also local elections which follow national trends.

So in summary, the Left should prioritize addressing the rising crime issue so they can continue to build support for other criminal justice reforms.  If they fail to do so, those criminal justice reforms will languish.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  Please change my view.

Edit:  I have changed my view because it does seem like the Left's view on crime and policing this has shifted dramatically since this past summer.  We're in the early innings of seeing Dem politicians respond including Newsome recommending an additional $300 million to combat ""smash and grabs.""  So my view that it is important for the left to focus on crime is still intact, but I may have been wrong that they weren't.  It sounds like it's coming.  Thanks to all!",0.0
338,t3_rk5mre,cmv: state prisons should switch to vegan only meal provisions,"When produced on a mass scale, cheap / low quality meat is usually sourced from factory farms. I would be willing to change my view if my mind could be changed on one of these three premises.

This is something believed regardless of political party. Both Republicans and democrats agree that there is a divide. 

Some people believe that there is a genetic difference that causes this while others believe that this is caused by environmental factors, namely the historical treatment of both race.

It's a nature vs nurture argument. 

But there are some people who would argue that the disparities are the result of ""culture."" Now this bothers me for many reasons, but most jarring is that often those who I have spoken to who have made this point don't elaborated.

We reserve certain rights (e.g. driving, voting) from children due to their reduced mental capacity, impressionability, motor control, etc. Similarly, certain rights (driving, medical) are often stripped from older folks who can no longer function properly.

Older people are more likely to hold outdated beliefs that can harm society (racism, sexism, etc.). They also have more to gain from for short term policies over long term goals since their remaining life spans are much shorter. Finally, older people hold most of the wealth, meaning they are more likely to vote for miserly policies instead of laws that would benefit the rest of society.

344,t3_rjzhrm,CMV: NFT technology has no practical use,"I can find no practical and realistic use case for NFT technology. Supporters keep pushing it to be used as a ""decentralized proof of ownership"" system. But why? What's the point of decentralizing proof of ownership?

&amp;nbsp;

Say you use an NFT entry to prove your ownership of your house, as an example.

Great, you can point to it to 'prove' it's yours. Doesn't stop someone from ignoring your claim of ownership, beating you with an aluminum bat, and squatting in your house.

If someone does that, just waving your NFT at them doesn't stop them, and doesn't get them out. What gets them out? Going to the government and saying ""someone is squatting in my legally owned property. Also they hit me.""

In order to enforce ownership, you need to go to the government anyway. So what benefit does ""decentralizing"" the proof of ownership away from the government provide over centralizing it under the government which will enforce said ownership?

&amp;nbsp;

Same goes for virtual goods. What's the point of using NFTs to verify ownership of, for example, Team Fortress 2 hats? Right now, ownership is centrally managed by Steam. The Steam servers distribute the goods, the Steam servers manage trades of goods between players and even for real money.

Say you ""decentralized"" this and wrote it in a decentralized ledger instead. What does that accomplish? The items are still only usable on Valve's Team Fortress 2 game. They are still distributed via Steam. What benefit has been gained by moving the ledger from some Valve server to a public record?

Safety in the case Valve shuts down the game? Well then the game is shut down, and you can't use those items anyway, except on private servers which could just ignore the ledger or grant you identical items.

347,t3_rjutca,"CMV: From a progressive point of view, it would make more sense to have a 'hate the game but love the players' mindset and applying it to every religion equally","Progressiveness is a bit difficult to define since it will always be in relation to the local customs (and the word itself is somewhat pretentious), but let's say it's groups interested in social reforms towards the goal of improving quality of life, as opposed to groups who believe that maintaining traditions is what guarantees that same quality. For the sake of the discussion, we'll focus on progressivism as it exists in Western Europe and the Anglosphere and any other region roughly on the same page.

What bothers me is that progressives tend to have a mixture of attitudes towards specific religions that I think is not helpful for social reform. Here are some examples:

|*Religion*|*View of the 'game'*|*View of the 'players'*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Christianity|Mostly negative|Mostly negative|
|Islam|Mostly positive|Mostly positive|
|Judaism|Unclear|Unclear|
|Buddhism|Positive|Positive|
|Hinduism|Unclear|Mostly Positive|

Generally, with Christianity, there is a broad agreement among progressives that the religion is harmful and the Christians themselves are not seen in a good light. For social reform, I believe it would be more productive to help Christians move away from their religion and support them if they take steps towards that outcome, as opposed to being mostly hostile on a personal level most of the time. -&gt; keep hating the game, but start loving the players

For Islam, the adherents are often seen in a good light and progressives are highly supportive of them. While progressives do voice criticism of it fairly often, the religion itself is given too much leeway IMO and there is not enough push back against its conservative elements. These are often minimized out of fear of racism and the desire to welcome any force that counterbalances Western traditions. This introduces harmful contradictions that undermine the strength of social reform, especially if there is a broad consensus and clear understanding that Christianity, a similar religion in terms of cultural values and social norms and with the same Abrahamic roots, is not OK. Instead we ought to keep supporting Muslims who try to move away from these conservative beliefs as best we can but be more ready to examine the faith without fear -&gt; keep loving the players, but start hating the game for the same reasons as with Christianity

Judaism: this one is tough. On one hand, the religion itself is generally associated with Western traditions just like Christianity, and is generally disliked for that reason and also for its thematic association with Israel (though obviously the vast majority of progressives thankfully don't equate Judaism with Zionism). While being a minority facing strong discrimination, Jewish people are often not granted a clearly defined status in terms of social justice priorities. On the other, there is a reluctance to criticize the religion given its painful and tragic history and progressives often find themselves tiptoeing around the debate just like with Islam. It would make more sense for progressives to clearly delineate the harmfulness of the orthodox and fundamentalist forms of the religion while supporting reform Judaism and Jewish people who move towards secularism. -&gt; hate the game, love the players

Buddhism: progressives tend to have an imaginary vision of this religion, believing it to be about good vibes only. I would encourage progressives to read a bit more about Buddhism in history since in reality it is no less conservative and restrictive than religions that are clearly labeled as harmful such as Christianity. The way it was practiced in Tibet for much of its history was particularly horrific, with monks at the head of a brutal slavery-based society well into the 20th century -&gt; keep loving the players, start hating the game

Hinduism: on one hand, progressives see the game as good because it is non-Western, but bad because in recent years it is associated with discrimination against Muslims in India. Progressives don't generally like Hindus as much as Buddhists or Muslims (since the former benefits from a fictional interpretation and the latter is at the center of social justice concerns in the West) out of a lack of familiarity but they have a broadly supportive view  in absolute terms. -&gt; clearly delineate the reasons why hating the game is beneficial for social reform, increase your support of the players and try to learn more about them

**tl;dr the general trend is that religions associated with Western culture are seen as broadly negative, and there is a lack of empathy for their adherents which stalls social reform. Religions associated with non-Western cultures are often seen too positively to be consistent with the goals of social reform, given their inherently conservative nature. To speed up social reform, it would make more sense to have a consistent appreciation of all religions in themselves as retarding social reform, while maintaining productive empathy for their adherents as the reforms are made.**",0.0

349,t3_rjl17a,CMV: Cheering for individual graduates while diplomas and given out should be frowned upon.,"During graduation ceremonies, while graduation candidates are having their names called and are walking across the stage to receive their diploma’s, some will cheer/shout/holler for their friend/family member when their name is called. I think this should be generally frowned upon for a couple reasons. 

1) in my experience, the situation usually just ends up with families attempting to be the loudest. By trying to be the loudest, they often just yell longer, which creates these issues.

Either
2a) the family yells long enough that the next name is inaudible. This ruins the next grads moment on the stage. 

OR 2b) the speaker has to wait for the group to finish cheering. This pause, while brief, adds up quickly in a ceremony of several hundred or 1,000+ graduates. 

3) a third issue I see, is that the graduate candidate knows who is in the audience with them, and is typically celebrating with those people before and/or after the ceremony. Recognizing this, I think the cheering takes away from the formality of the ceremony, as it is more like cheering for “your team” at a sporting event. 

4) lastly, some international candidates cannot have their friends/family present at their commencement. The silence after their name creates an awkward moment that I think could ostracize students who are already away from their home country.

354,t3_rjdrhm,CMV: We should stop building culverts over small streams/creeks and replace them with bridges,"I feel like bridges would be a better alternative to culverts, at least in some situations. One of the reasons why is because culverts can get clogged. Culverts are really tiny circular tubes and debris can easily get stuck in them and I believe that beavers can also block culverts from carrying water.

I just discovered a youtube channel called Post10 and the guy unclogs a lot of culverts that were blocked by beaver dams. At one point the beavers even built their dam literally INSIDE the culvert, probably because they were so fed up by someone removing the dam every single time. There was also a culvert that kept getting clogged by debris and he had to revisit it over and over to unclog it. I also noticed that some of the culverts he goes in are rusted out on the bottom. I even found a video online (not by Post10) of a road being washed out from underneath, probably because the culvert underneath was clogged, and the water was going around the culvert in the surrounding soil instead, thus eroding the road.

I feel like much of these problems could be avoided if these culverts were replaced with bridges instead. The road would be supported by strong concrete pillars instead of dirt around a culvert that could easily wash away. The water would also not rust anything if the entire road structure is carried above the stream. Thus space for water to flow through would be larger and I believe that will make it harder for beavers to dam up the stream. I have personally never heard of a bridge getting clogged.

I also believe that culverts can be harmful to the natural environment. Instead if replacing a natural riverbed and its banks where there could be habitats of species with a tube and dirt to fill in the gaps, why not just build a bridge over it instead? That way, the road wouldn't interfere with any species that have habitat in the area; it would just simply go over them.

355,t3_rjdloa,CMV: Kim Potter is not guilty of manslaughter.,"I wanna preface this by saying I’m in no way pro-cop and my account history shows that. This is just a very specific case that I feel resulted in over-charging. I do believe though that it was completely appropriate for this to go to trial, because a cop shouldn’t just be allowed to shoot someone on accident and not prove her account. 

I believe that what happened to Daunte was horrific, but that the state has failed to prove that she was consciously negligent in any way. 

Pretty much every single police witness said that a taser was justified here, and the prosecution admits that she did genuinely believed she was holding a taser. 

So where does this become more than a tragic mistake made from adrenaline and a high-stress situation? I understand she was an officer for 22 years, but even experts can make mistakes, and she had barely ever used a taser in her whole career, besides training.

The weight of the taser vs the gun is almost negligible in a high-stress situation because you’re kinda going on autopilot and you’re not thinking very hard about the weight of what you’re holding. 

I’m just having trouble figuring out how she took a conscious risk by pulling out what she thought was a taser. It’s not like she was trained to closely look at her weapon before using it.

356,t3_rjck9s,CMV: I Am Not A Religious Fundamentalist,"People on Facebook have been calling me a religious fundamentalist.

Now, the definition of fundamentalism, usually applies to Christianity or Islam, and refers to people who take their scriptures absolutely literally. These people usually are not open to change or different Interpretations and want their scripture to affect everything including law and politics.

I on the other hand do not take my religion (Hinduism) to be the one, absolute truth and I am perfectly accepting of other religions. I do not take the mythology completely literally, nor do I want it to Influence politics - I'm a secularist.

Yes, sure, I try to meditate and pray each day, and I used to quite often bless people, even when they haven't asked, and I have a shrine in my bedroom and I always have Divinity on my mind in some way, but I don't think I fit the definition of a fundamentalist. I also try to go to the temple on festivals, listen mostly (but by no means exclusively) to religious music, I don't eat beef (considering going pure vegetarian in future) and I wear 4  prayer beads daily on my wrist. I also wear bindi every day.

360,t3_rj9ppa,"CMV: I view offensiveness of words or phrases as a binary black-and-white, ranking things according to offensiveness is impossible.","So there is a current trend going on at Twitch.

People are getting banned for using the term ""cracker.""

This has resulted in an outcry from two separate sides:

(1) One group argues that it is silly to be offended by cracker and no one should be banned for the word

(2) one group argues that cracker is an ethnic slur and should be banned if you are banning slurs and offensive words

My personal stance is that all words should be allowed and you would ban on a case by case basis, but since that is not an option, I tend to agree with Group 2.

And I became resolute in my position when I saw this comment on the subreddit drama thread discussing another ban:

&gt;Streamers use the r-word to make fun of people and demean them: ""I sleep""

&gt;Streamers use the least offensive slur in the world to clown on people: ""REAL SHIT""

I really don't understand this reaction. I don't know why it is surprising that white people cold be harmed by a word aimed to hurt them.

Rebecca Knight wrote an entire piece for The Harvard Business Review on microaggressions. In it she discussed a few ways to handle hurting someone's feeling and offensiveness. Some quotes here: 

&gt;These remarks and behaviors “happen casually and often without any harm intended,” says Jana, but they offer a clear demonstration “that the initiator harbors unconscious bias.” Meanwhile, the person on the receiving end who belongs to a group that’s discriminated against — be it because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — is often left to suffer in silence.

&gt;If you’ve been called out for committing a microaggression you need to respond with compassion, concern, and humility. “You want people to feel respected, so you need to walk the talk,” Zheng says. “It’s important to get this right.” Here are some tips.

&gt;“You must not make it about you,” says Jana. “When a human being tells you that they have been harmed by your words or actions, you need to focus on the injured party.” 

&gt;“Just because something isn’t offensive to you based on your life experience, it doesn’t mean it isn’t or can’t be hurtful to someone else,”

Almost everything within this piece agrees that you should not continue to say offensive terms even if you don't find them personally offensive because others can and that you should concern yourself with the harmed rather than yourself.

So based off of most the dialogue around offensiveness and microagressions that I have seen, consideration and inclusivity is almost always prized over personal rights and freedoms.

So I have come to the view that in our modern world, something is either offensive or it is not. And if it is offensive, you should act consistently upon that action.

***What could change my view***

If you can demonstrate why/how it is okay to say some offensive terms, but not others while still prioritizing inclusivity and consideration like much of the modern world tries to do.

Or, if you can explain why taking offense at certain terms is uncalled for and that people are rightly acting irrationally by being offended by the term cracker.",0.0

I identify as a very left-leaning, very anti-authoritarian individual. My CMV is not because I agree or disagree with the ideologies of the named subreddits, or similar subs. In principle, my belief boils down to live and let live.

&amp;#x200B;

A subreddit dedicated to discussing politics, current events, etc, from an authoritarian point of view is not, in my opinion, inherently harmful. A subreddit where the name and expressed goal is to have discussions from an authoritarian viewpoint is not inherently harmful. As long as the subreddit is more or less self-contained, nobody is going to visit AD and be shocked to find authoritarian and reactionary posts and comments. In addition, as has been very heavily documented by AHS over the last few days, the ban will inevitably result in a ban evasion sub popping up in its place, putting everyone back at square one. Prepare for virtual whack-a-mole, I guess. In the event of members of that community harassing others in other communities, that is obviously an actionable offense, and the situation should be evaluated to determine if action should be taken against the sub or the members involved. However a community designed specifically for a group of people, even if I strongly disagree with their opinions, should be left alone. If you want to go there and debate or challenge them, feel free, but you are taking that upon yourself.

As for AHS, from what I can see of that community, there tends to be mass reportings coming from users of that community against subreddits they deem harmful for one reason or another. While I tend to agree with their definitions of harmful, I don't think that they should be policing other subreddits in this manner. Instead of being a self-contained subreddit, it seems that they, as a community, seek out other subreddits to ""shut down"".

362,t3_rj93l6,CMV: student loan forgiveness is a terrible idea and the only people demanding it are the ones with large amounts of debt,"Some of us went to a state school, picked a high demand degree, worked part time jobs in college, and avoided Spring Break destinations because we couldn't afford it. There were weeks at a time I can recall eating nothing but .50 cent ramen with an added baked potato to quench the hunger, and cheap beer of course, with occasional free pizza from random happy hour places. A can of chunky soup was a treat. And I lived with 2 slovenly savages in a cheap ass apartment without real A/C in a city where it regularly reached 100 in the summer.

So Amber goes to a private school, picks a fun, sexy degree that everyone would like to do, doesn't work so she can focus on studies, goes to Cancun for Spring Break, and enjoys Starbucks 3 times a week, drives a newer model car, and now wants to cry about forgiving her $120k debt? How is that fair to the millions that came before her and did it the right way?

That doesn't solve the core problem of out of control University costs and doesn't help society by funneling more people into the high demand jobs, even if they aren't the most appealing. Universities need to fix their book price racketeering, Athletic Director and Coaches making millions, knocking down buildings that could be functional for 50 more years, and so much other nonsense. And not everyone needs to get a college degree. There are plenty of blue collar jobs out there where a technical school could get someone a jump start into a legit career as an electrician, plumber, etc.

366,t3_rj6x20,"CMV: Influencers do actually have the ability to change the world for the better, and they should be shamed or cancelled if they don't","Individuals can't really make much of a difference. For example, you could cut your personal CO2 emissions a lot and barely make a dent. But if you can convince millions of people to cut their emissions through laws changing the upstream decisions of large polluting corporations, then that starts to make a difference. There are other ways to influence millions of people though.   


The people whose job it is to be influential (and promote products that way) are in a position of immense power, way more than their incomes would imply. Companies recognize this.  


And with great power comes great responsibility.   


These influencers know their decisions matter a lot. They could threaten to hurt union busting  companies by trashing their products and boosting their competitors. Imagine if instead of skinny jeans, it was jeans manufactured by unethical companies that became unfashionable in the last few years.   


It could be more direct. Influencers could command an enormous voting bloc, and political campaigns would love to have people as dedicated as influencer stans.  At the time of writing 727 people have been charged in the January 6 riots - less than 0.001% of Zendaya's follower count.  


I don't understand why their influence is only ever used for consumer capitalism, and why none of them ever seize control of their image. Donald Trump is proof that it's possible, and while he can be criticized a lot  for his actions, I think the other celebrities and influencers in the position to wield and accumulate just as much power should be criticized for their inaction.  


They know they can make a difference using a fraction of their time and energy, and they're choosing not to, or choosing to do so in facile and self serving ways like Kendall Jenner's Pepsi ad, or even benign campaigns that ultimately don't do anywhere near enough like #teamtrees/#teamseas. They're all essentially looking the other way.  


I also think activists should target influencers more, as I think they're more capable of change than people with a major self interest in defending the status quo (e.g. fossil fuel companies), and they would be a good stepping stone. Many of them aren't sociopaths, and they talk about being affected by negative reviews, mean tweets etc. Cancel culture has proven itself an effective tool, and I think it can be used on people whose sin is inaction.  


Anyway I guess this is more a themed collection of views than one singular view, but none of it seems to be seen as a ""normal"" view (and I've been pilloried in other subreddits for suggesting).

367,t3_rj23zc,CMV: it's not inherently transphobic to not want to date transgender people,"So one of the biggest counter-arguments I hear is that transgender men/women come in a wide variety and you can't have possibly met them all, so to exclude transgender women/men as a group from your dating pool is transphobic.


I think this argument falls flat because men also come in a wide variety and you can't have possibly met all men, so how come it's not sexist to exclude men as a group from your dating pool?


Trans activists believe that it's not transphobic to not date a trans person for reasons such as genital preference or wanting biological children, but not dating a transgender person because they're transgender is transphobic. How is not dating a man because they're a man not sexist then?


You're not saying trans women aren't women, you're just saying that they are a type of women you don't want to date.


I do acknowledge that transphobia in society leads to some people who are attracted to transgender people to exclude transgender people from their dating pool.

371,t3_rivape,"CMV: BPM in music has an upper limit, probably around 500","I became interested in some faster genres of music (around 200 bpm) and began exploring the extremes. There are genre classifications such as ""extra tone"" and ""hypertone"" denoting music with bpm anywhere between 500 and 1,000,000 BPM. These genres typically feature percussive elements stacked so closely together that they sound begin producing a tone, or just sounding like a synth.

To be clear, I am not arguing whether or not these things are music. I just think they exist outside of BPM. Or another way to say it is BPM does not convey any information about the song to the listener, and the same sounds could be achieved at any tempo.

[16. Insomnia (750 BPM) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS1BdPJp2Jo)

This song claims to be at 750 BPM. But the only discernible rhythms are actually counted at about 190 bpm. The artist set their Digital Audio Workstation to 750 BPM which allowed them to more easily produce glitchy sounds. But, despite this, they really made a song at about 190 bpm imo

[\[25,056,000(?) BPM HYPERTONE\] Murriosity - Crooked Smiles - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmLf468yNS0)

This song has no discernible rhythm at all. The percussive elements are stacked so tightly that they sound like one continuos tone. Calling it 25 million bpm makes as much sense as saying any key of a piano plays at 25 million bpm. When things are that fast, we use an entirely different way of classyfing them, hertz.

The extreme opposite would be calling a recording of a single snare drum hit in 60 seconds ""1 bpm"". It may literally be true depending how you think about it, but obviously it doesn't convey anything about the ""music"". BPM is meant to be experienced by the listener.

372,t3_rip996,CMV: Shamima Begum should be repatriated to the UK,"[Shamima Begum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamima_Begum) is a former British national who traveled to Syria in 2015 aged 15 to join ISIS. In 2019 after an interview with the Times her citizenship was revoked by the then Home Secretary Sajid Javid. She should have her citizenship returned and **she should be repatriated to the UK where she should be prosecuted for her actions**.

### Those who engage in terrorism should face the full force of the law
Shamima Begum is alleged to have been involved with some of the many unsavoury aspects of ISIS life including being an enforcer in the so-called morality police and assisting with suicide vests.

We as a society have an obligation to prosecute such individuals in a systematic manner.

#### Revoking citizenship is not justice
A politician deciding on a punishment for a person, in this case the revocation of citizenship, is arbitrary justice. The success of western society is built on (amongst other things):
* Consistent and predictable legal processes
* Separation of powers between the judiciary and executive branches of government
* Public and transparent application of the law
Sajid Javid summarily making a person stateless is violates all three of the above principles.

#### Justice isn't just about punishment
Some may say that Begum deserves to rot in a refugee camp and that in itself is justice. I would argue that punishment is only important insofar as it is part of process which publicly affirms the legal process and the state's moral authority over its citizens. Punishment in itself holds no value. In the case of Begum, not only did the government not engage in any process against Begum but it made her stateless and thereby relinquished its authority over her. 

### Britain should demonstrate leadership in dealing with Terrorism
Britain seems to have washed its hands of an alleged terrorist who was born with her shores. It's our mess, so we should clean it up. The message this sends to the international community is that it's okay for them to toss  their rubbish into any old refugee camp in some god forsaken corner of the world. How can we expect other countries to do their bit on terrorism when we abdicate our own responsibilities?

### Making someone stateless is a violation of their human rights
One of the things that we despise about ISIS is that they have no concept of human rights. We must not be dragged down by them. Instead we should stand by our principles and upon our moral high ground. The moral high ground is incredibly important as a form of soft power. If the west is seen to be just as cynical as other countries in dealing with its problems we'll have a harder time in gaining allies.",67.0

I've been casually watching the show, and it's okay, but that one scene between Yelena and Kate threw me for a loop.

Though I'm not hugely invested in this, I'd like to know if I'm missing something that must seem obvious to everyone else

I've seen Black Widow, and setup looked straightforward enough there. Natasha dies in the fight against Thanos, during which Yelena had been blipped out of existence. In the post credits scene, she is approached by a certain sinister person who tells Yelena that it was, in fact, Hawkeye's fault that her sister is dead. Okay, some American asshole killed her sister, Yelena wants revenge. Simple

In the Hawkeye TV show, we find that Yelena has caught up to Clint in New York city. They have a brief fight in episode 5, it comes out to a draw. Then in episode 6, Yelena breaks into Kate Bishop's apartment to ask her where Hawkeye is so she can attack him again. Kate has been hanging out with Clint all week and worships him. She's scared of Yelena, doesn't want to give up her hero. It's a recipe for a decent scene

What happens instead is that Yelena starts to lecture Kate about how Clint isn't a real hero, but is in fact a very bad man because he's killed people. Also, she's now after Clint because Kate's mother hired her or something? Whatever

Yelena is literally a hired assassin. Her sister was also an assassin. All her friends are assassins. In fact, before the events of Black Widow (which subjectively are pretty recent for her), Yelena and everyone she knew had spent their entire lives doing nothing but killing people, and training to be better at killing people. As well, while it has been a shorter amount of time since her sister's death, Yelena isn't attacking Clint a week after Endgame. She knows Clint's history, her sister's, has had plenty of time to reflect

You could argue that Yelena was brainwashed and is now reformed. You could further argue that she had that excuse, while Clint willingly became a government hitman, that there's some room for nuance. *You* could argue that, because the characters don't. Yelena breaks into this woman's apartment, openly threatens to murder her, then gives a long speech about how bad Clint Barton is, and Kate just stares at her like she just cannot possibly argue against such facts and logic

The only other reasonable assumption I have is that Yelena was just lying, doesn't believe any of that she's saying, and is just fucking with Kate to throw her off and intimidate her. And that Kate is just too scared or too much of an idiot to point out the inconsistencies. Which also could work, if the show acknowledged that was happening. It seems to be taking the entire encounter straight? Particularly because of how it's treating the other major character who wants to kill Clint. And Clint's own thoughts about his time as Ronin

374,t3_rininu,CMV: The California Environmental Quality Act is bad for the environment in California.,"**What the hell is the California Environmental Quality Act?**  It's a law passed in 1970 which requires that almost all new construction undergo an environmental impact review and take actions to mitigate the environmental impact of that construction. Single family homes are exempted.

**Why would this be bad for the environment?** By focusing on individual level construction, and exempting single family homes, the CEQA massively disincentivizes constructing any density. The onerous requirements of environmental impact review and mitigation mean that anyone who wants to stop a construction project can file lawsuits that cost millions of dollars to resolve and tie things up for years, often killing the project entirely.

Since single family homes are exempted, the overwhelming incentive is to just build single family homes, contributing to massive sprawl and the emissions that come with it.  

I think California would be a lot denser, and a lot less polluted, if the CEQA never existed.  Is there something I'm missing here?",257.0
375,t3_rilk6a,"CMV: The character Miles Morales actually does a disservice to what made the character Spider-Man great for all races, especially for children.","Don't get me wrong. I love Miles Morales. Especially in the non-comic interpretations like Into the Spider-Verse and the Playstation Game.  But before I became really aware of him I saw a clip of Stan Lee talking about spider-man and it struck me as really important.  I'll give the clip and the transcript.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxxNXrCZnUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxxNXrCZnUM)

""you know one of the greatest things about spider-man's outfit. he is completely covered so any kid could imagine he's spider-man because no color of the skin shows he could be black under that he could be red he could be yellow he could belong to any race and that wasn't done purposely it was done accidentally but i think it was the best thing we did making him so that he could be anybody under that costume"" - Stan Lee

This is such a great thing, and I think we've all see kids dress up as spider-man regardless of race, and it truly didn't matter that they weren't the same race as Peter Parker because that didn't matter.  That's not what made the character great.  But now with Miles Morales becoming more and more popular, it seems that kids are being separated on race needlessly.  If you are white you wear the Peter Parker suit, if you're black or Latino, you wear the Miles Morales suit.  Like it or not Miles Morales is a character based on race. Especially in Spider-Verse. It makes a big deal out of his black and Latino origins.  I love both of the characters but now it's no longer the case that anyone could be under the costume. you see the costume and you see the race.

I really would like my mind changed on this since both characters are great.

Edit: a lot of really good points have been made. but most have to do with either

1. the same argument can apply to miles's suit. Which is a good point. but there are many people who would a kid out on that, like the people who got upset at a kid for wearing a maui costume. I understand that that is different, but I still beleive that there are people in the media or celebrities who would say that Miles Morales is not for white kids. just like how Brie Larson said that Ms. Marvel was not made for men.
2. nobody but twitter trolls care if a white kid wears the outfit.  There are media personalities every year who cancel people for wearing the wrong costume, and the twitter trolls can and have done damage to a lot of people by doxing them or getting them fired, or preventing them from getting in schools. There are even schools that would prevent a white kid from wearing the morales costume supported by u/DetroitUberDriver.  and it is irrelevant if you disagree with that person. There exists a double standard created by miles morales

Edit 2: At this point I would be able to change my opinion if the comment made by u/DetroitUberDriver could be solved. If miles Morales did not do a disservice to children by making spider-man about race, then what.

I would also like to make this clear that this is not necessarily a moral argument I'm making, I'm just saying the creation and popularity of an argument did a thing. not whether the total morality of his existence is good or bad.  I'll be back in an hour I have a meeting to go to thank you for making your points though. I'll be reading all the comments but could you make it clear that your point is about the content in this second edit.",0.0
376,t3_rihrdf,CMV: Apples are secretly in charge of the world,"People dont realise it but apples have an amazing amount of influence on us so much so that we dont even realise it. I think they are the most influential of the fruits so much so they might even have a consciousness of their own.

Think about all the ways they have infiltrated our everyday life. The basic argument will be listed below and sure you can challenge a couple here and there but net net I would like to be convinced of a more powerful fruit.

For some it defines patriotism -   as American as apple pie.

Health&amp; body – we have an adams apple (tied to religion as well) but only a navel (orange)

Plus an apple a day keeps the doctor away

Sheer variety of apples and their uses in food. For pies, baby food, juice, alcoholic drink, fresh fruit (5 a day), can be baked, steamed, fried, sautéed…..basically versatile in flavour and usage and in most cultures.

Emotion and love - when someone refers to another being the apple of their eye

Mythology and religion – apple tree is the tree of life, apple usage in art and the apples relationship with the fall of man. I am sure in many mythological texts its used over and over. (trojan, avalon, norse, the forbidden fruit)– garden of eden even if introduced later, quotes in the bible.

Competition/hubris – with saying such as ' how do you like them apples'

Business – Johnny Appleseed (spreading the seed), Plus world leading company is called ‘apple’ (need I say more! its the perfect place to hide a conspiracy in the conspiracies)

Science – Newton,  “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.” Sagan, when comparing statistics its always 'apples to apples or 'apples to oranges'

morals - a few rotten apples, or just a bad apple.

Hidden lair of the apple headquarters  surely must be Tasmania the apple isle

377,t3_ric3o1,CMV: Universal Postal Ballots are a bad idea for verifiability and integrity of elections.,"First, to begin with: I'm not a US/EU citizen (Indian) but I do tend to follow a decent amount of world news (which disproportionately covers US, China and EU) and also lurk around in politics-related subreddits on Reddit, both of which are primary sources of information I use for politics in general. In India (a country with 3.5x the population of US), we rely almost 100% on in-person voting and most races have 60%+ voter turnout [exceptions exist only for members of the armed forces who are on duty at the border, and for Indian civil servants currently not working in India, i.e. diplomats and stuff]. 

For democracies in general, here's why I think postal ballots are a bad idea:

0. **It opens you up to pressure from your family members (or people you live with) on who you should vote for**. In a ballot box vote, you can just pretend to agree to people you live with about their political beliefs, but continue to vote for whoever you want. In a mail in ballot vote, people who live with you _will have access_ to your ballot, and you might face pressure to ""prove"" that you voted the right way. This sort of stuff affects poorer, and more religious/conservative households the most since ""the man of the house"" often is the only wage earner and has disproportionate amount of power over everyone else.


1. A common argument that I've seen specific to the US is ""only half a dozen cases of fraud show up for millions of postal ballots, i.e. negligible"". However, these are _reported_ cases - if a family member (or someone living with you) votes on your behalf, or ""aggressively encourages"" you to - would you really report them for voter fraud and throw them in jail. Is it likely that the number of actual cases is much higher than the ""true reported criminal cases of fraud"". And even without taking extreme actions (like forcing a family member to vote in front of you, or voting on their behalf by forging their signature), having postal ballots makes ""softer"" forms of influence/encouragement likelier to happen too. 



2. Somewhat a ""poor country"" specific problem that India faces is cash for vote. Political parties out here routinely bribe lower income voters before elections with Rs. 500 ($8), or more often, a bottle of liquor or cigarettes to vote for their party. Today, however, they can't really verify if the people they bribed are actually voting for them, since polling stations are often pretty well guarded and monitored. In a mail in vote system, you can ensure you have ""proof of vote"" by asking people to tick the correct options on your postal ballot before offering the bribe. Now, this might not work in a lot of places in developed countries like the US/EU, but if poverty in the US has been on the rise, it is plausible that homeless/broke people might agree to under the table cash for vote deals if they had the oppurtunity - and sleazy political parties would have incentives to pay for votes _provided_ they can ensure to buy a (verifiable) postal vote at $X.

I've outlined a couple of other concerns in a recent comment of mine in another post too:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/r43d3j/why_is_it_a_problem_in_america_that_you_have_to/hmg0ant?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3

Copying the comment from there:

&gt; Genuine question: how would you prevent the following from happening in a mail in voting system [I'm from India, and while we do have postal ballots, they are restricted basically to members of the armed forces, and diplomats - everyone else lines up and votes in person]:

&gt; 1. Family members voting on behalf of someone without their consent. Even if they find out, would they report their husband/son/wife to the feds?

&gt; 2. a family member coercing/""encouraging"" their other family members to vote for party X in elections, and ""verifying"" that their ballots are correct before sending them out. This is especially problematic since a member of the household would not ""rat out"" a member of their own house for what is presumably a serious crime (ballot tampering) because they don't want aggression?

&gt; 3. Anonymity of the ballots being compromised since the ""from address"" + signature on the ballot will be enough to identify who voted for whom.

&gt; 4. The postal system tampering with the ballots in transit - for example even if you could, maybe tick all the options in a poll, you could invalidate that ballot. 

&gt; 5. Someone ""harvesting"" empty ballots from mail boxes and filling em all up with whatever they want.

&gt; 6. A person moves from their old house, but their ballots still keep getting delivered - allowing anyone living at the new location to keep voting for whoever they want.

&gt; 7. Political parties or their goons paying (bribing) people to vote for the party they support. (in a physical voting scenario, goons cannot verify if the people they bribed actually voted for the party they were told to.)

&gt; 8. People threatening people to vote in a certain way - with an in person secret ballot voting system you can have a large number of cops around each polling station - even if someone intimidates someone before the voting period, there is no way the goons threatening people will know if their threats worked. With postal ballots, people can force others to fill out the form then and there itself.

&gt; A lot of these might seem outlandish to you folks - but each of these are things that would be extremely likely to happen in India, if we had mail in ballots universally. I understand that the US is a more secure, stable country than us - but I'm still curious how proponents of mail in votes claim that none of these _can_ happen, or happen in low enough probability. 

&gt; For context, in India: you go to a polling station, show your voter ID, and sign, and then you are sent into a closed room one by one, where there's an electronic voting machine. You press the button corresponding to the party you want to vote for, and then your voted is recorded. To make sure the electronic voting machine is keeping track of votes correctly, as soon as you click a button to vote, the EVM immediately prints out a small piece of paper with the insignia/logo of the party you voted for + the name of the candidate from the party who will be representing you. You see this behind a glass screen that's part of the same machine for 3 whole seconds, before the paper is dropped into a bin attached to the machine. When counting votes, they first get the totals from the machine programmatically, and if anyone objects a manual recount is done using the printed slips as an audit trail. Usually, polling places are pretty heavily guarded before and during elections.

I understand that voting might be way more secure in developed democracies, which is why all my fears/concerns listed here might seem to over the top for some people - but my question is this: is it worth increasing the number of weak points (potential sources of failure) in a voting system, at a time when there are greater incentives for malicious state-sponsored groups to attack elections in democracies.",0.0

Their main counter claim is that capitalism and consumerism are the real problems, that we will peak at 9 to 11 billion and that technology will ensure our sustainability. 

These arguments seem ideological (ultra left, not moderate or centrist) and not factually robust given that we are in the midst of the 6th major extinction event - caused by humans.

381,t3_ri8o7x,CMV: Hard-working Asian immigrants would benefit more from Republican ideals than Democratic ones.,"Asian immigrants are generally industrious and grew up in societies where strong work ethics were absolutely necessary for survival.

In the U.S., Democrats are typically left-leaning, while Republicans are right-leaning. It would make more sense for an Asian immigrant to be a Republican than a Democrat since right-leaning societies are typically more merit-based than left-leaning ones.

382,t3_ri8897,CMV: Cats are ruthless and sadistic psychopaths that only exist to serve themselves.,"I really want to change my view on this because I think cats are cuddly and adorable little animals. I admit that I am a dog person, and love the unconditional love and affection that dogs have for humans, but still like cats. I actually respect cats quite a bit as well. They are some of the most majestic and intelligent predators on Earth. However, I can’t help
but feel they fit the description of a human psychopath. I’d like to focus on house cats for this CMV as well.

I see that cats love to torture their prey before they kill them. I’ve seen countless cats torture and kill birds, mice, insects, and other small mammals with joy and glee. I’ve heard that if we theoretically shrunk to the size of a mouse, a cat would torture and kill us too. I don’t think a dog would do this.

On top of that, most cats I’ve owned or encountered, tend to not really care too much about their caretakers the way dogs or horses do. This might be purely anecdotal, but it seems like cats have a superiority complex about them, which fits right into the psychopathic stereotype of excessive narcissism.

I feel like a cat doesn’t want to snuggle up to a human because they love them, they do it to get pet or scratched or to get some warmth. I’ve read that they do this to transfer their scent to you as an indication of dominance. I’ve also read that when they rub up against you, they view it as “petting you” and that we are their pets in a sense. 

They’re also smart enough to know who feeds them and keeps them sheltered. Sans exceptions, most cats only let you pet them on their terms, which circles back to why I have a certain respect for them as well. But again, not all cats are created equal, and some are more friendly than others.

So all in all, it seems like cats disproportionately exhibit psychopathic qualities such as a lack of empathy, sadism, narcissism, and perhaps even machiavellianism.

If you Google this topic, you’ll probably find articles that could go either way on the nature of cats. Some articles say cats do indeed feel a real connection and affection for their caretakers, while others will say that cats really are psychopathic by nature. There is likely an implicit bias for most cat owners to want to reject the idea that their furry little pets could be evil critters, and believe that their pet truly loves them, which is understandable.

I’d really like to change my view on this because I like cats, but feel I could love them more if I knew they weren’t psycho. CMV.",0.0
383,t3_ri86ek,CMV: I'm Pro-Choice AND I Believe Abortion is Killing,"The debate over abortion's morality and legality is often said to come down to ""when does human life begin?"" Does it begin at conception? After 3 months of pregnancy? 6 months?

I believe, if we are honest with ourselves, that we ALREADY agree human life begins at conception. From a legal standpoint, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act recognizes that a child in utero is a legal victim if they are injured or killed in more than 60 types of violent crimes. This means that if you kill a pregnant woman, it's considered a double homicide.

Even if you define life by intelligence, that definition would mean that individuals with SEVERE cognitive impairment are not human.

So if I believe abortion is killing, why am I pro-choice? Because we sanction killing in our society quite a bit. We sanction killing in self-defense. We sanction killing in times of war. We sanction killing as punishment for certain crimes.

I believe the right to control your body is a fundamental one to being a human being. Our bodies are the most basic property that we have. If you believe in a right to your property, you believe in the right for a person to do what they want with their body. I believe that this right is so great, that it is ANOTHER reason to sanction killing.

Now you might take this to its logical extreme: ""If the right to do what I want with my body sanctions killing, doesn't that mean I have the right to use my hand to plunge a knife into someone else? You can't tell me what to do with my hand!!"" The problem here lies in that the other person is not threatening you (or at least may not be). If they were, then it could be sanctioned killing under the self-defense exemption.

But babies technically ARE threatening their mothers. Pregnancy takes a heavy toll on the body and causes a lot of pain. Sometimes, pregnancies even cause death. They even threaten the mother's way of life in a huge way. Due to these reasons, I believe that abortion technically falls under the self-defense exception of sanctioned killing. Change my View.

EDIT: Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I've had fun engaging with the comments and some have made some great points. My view has not necessarily been FULLY changed, but at least partially changed. For example, someone pointed out that the existence of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act does not necessarily indicate we all believe life begins at conception. Laws are enacted by political parties, and therefore, not valid indicators of what a majority of people acknowledge. Fair enough.

Furthermore, people have refuted my self-defense argument by saying that self-defense must necessitate that the individual be under a reasonable threat of death for them to be allowed to kill. Low-risk pregnancies wouldn't fall under this. I have now changed my view to believe that abortion could act as a way for the mother to get the baby off her personal property (aka her body). It's similar to kicking someone out of your house and then they end up dying outside of your house as a result. I wonder how other's would respond to this view?",1634.0

I am extremely pro-vax — I got my 2nd booster a couple of days ago. I can’t speak for the rest of the world, but the US is pretty relaxed with mask mandates, social distancing, etc.. now places recommend, but don’t force what we had to deal with a year ago when covid was hot. I was very pro mask and just in general not being a d**k so I don’t infect someone else. 

So when mask mandates were a thing I was totally for it,and same with social distancing. But now that in the US places aren’t enforcing it (some private businesses still do and medical establishments )

But everywhere else: no one gives a shit. I don’t see the point of wearing masks when 85% of everyone else doesn’t. 

A few examples — my kids go to day care. They require us to wear masks when we pick them. However they don’t require or force the kids too. Now any 2-4 year old is gross and puts almost anything in their mouth. Now tell me how does a mask help prevent the spread of covid?

Another example — we go to the grocery store and majority of people are walking around no masks and touching everything. There are a few of them that do wear masks..but what’s the point if not everyone is required to do so. 

In my opinion it just seems stupid to wear masks or social distance when majority of the population doesn’t care anymore. You are better off sanitizing your hands often and refrain from touching your nose and mouth until you wash your hands. What am I missing here?",0.0

- The site must block all content until the user is signed in.

- All persons making adult content must be 21 years or older.

X person: I have faith that the moon is made of dragon cum and fairy shit.

Y person: What?? That makes literally ZERO sense.

X: No it doesn't!

Y: ok then, provide me evidence that the moon is made of ""dragon cum and fairy shit."" 

X: I don't need evidence! Faith is strong enough on its own! I just KNOW the moon is made of dragon cum and fairy shit!

Y: Ok well, I have plenty of evidence (some physical) that the moon is made of rock and metal! For example, did you know astronauts have literally brought back rock samples that have been carved out of the very moon! We also have plenty of evidence otherwise because astronomers have observed close up images of the moon and it has the same texture as earthly rock. So, that's why I don't believe the moon is made of ""dragon cum and fairy shit."" 

X: But you cannot prove that that's not what dragon cum and fairy cum looks and feels like!

Y: Yes I can, because ""cum"" has the DNA of a creature inside of it!

X: dragon cum doesn't because dragons exist outside the boundaries of our universe and it's laws! The dragons just put it there, that's all!!

Y: And what evidence do we have that any of this actually happened and that you aren't making this stuff up?

X: I DON'T NEED EVIDENCE, I HAVE FAITH!!

Like I said, I could have faith in anything and make up a bunch of ways that it's not true that arguments are valid and you could never prove nor disprove my claim.

So technically, it's possible that the moon is made of ""dragon cum and fairy shit"" if I continue adding rules or say ""it exists outside our universe"". Hell, I could say that anything exists because it's ""outside our universe.""

So in conclusion, I don't care what you have ""faith"" in, but evidence will always Trump what you have ""faith"" in. And if you want me to also believe that the moon is made of ""dragon cum and fairy shit"", you will need to show me some evidence for that claim.

390,t3_ri20n0,CMV: placentas are vegan but not vegetarian.,"Vegetarianism forbids at minimum meat (flesh or organs of land animals and birds).  Ovo-vegetarians and pesco-vegetarians may eat eggs and fish respectively while some other vegetarians may not consider those ok to eat, but you can't be a hepatovegetarian eating cow livers.  

Vegans are sometimes claimed to be stricter vegetarians, but in at least one regard they are less strict: they can eat meat that is consensually given.  

We know this by analogy with milk.  Vegans refuse milk, and many refuse cow based formula for their children, but will prominently and proudly state that human breast milk is vegan because it's consensually given.  The same is true for other bodily fluids- vegans may consume semen as long as it's consensually given.

Thus the same should be true for placentas - they're a human organ that can readily be consensually given to another person to eat.  They are thus vegan albeit not vegetarian.  The same may be said for human muscle tissue (straight up cannibalism) although there may exist valid questions as to whether consent can truly be given there in the event of death.  But amputated limbs, same deal.  Can be freely given to a vegan.  Aren't vegetarian.

Anyway I often hear it said that veganism is strictly stricter than vegetarianism, so CMV.",0.0
391,t3_rhzaej,CMV: Opponents of Critical Race Theory are justified in their concerns about Critical Race Theory,"I've heard a lot of people on the left say that critical race theory is a conservative bogeyman popularized by Christopher Rufo. That it's a legal framework that examines racism in the law and that's all it is and Rufo created moral panic around it.

CRT opponents seem to have a couple of primary concerns about Critical Race Theory-first, that it is not just a tool for examination, but is actively trying to change society, second that it has spread to many different areas. This particular view concerns those two things. 

When I read the writing of lead CRT scholars, it seems to support both. Here's a quote from introduction to CRT written by Jean Stefancic and Robert Delgado

""Unlike some academic disciplines, critical race theory contains an activist dimension. It not only tries to understand our social situation, but to change it; it sets out not only to ascertain how society organizes itself along racial lines and hierarchies, but to transform it
for the better.""

This seems to directly support CRT opponents' first concern-that CRT is actively trying to change society. 

Also from Introduction to CRT

"" Although CRT began as a movement in the law, it has rapidly spread beyond that discipline. Today, manyin the field of education consider themselves critical race theorists who use CRT’s ideas to understandissues of school discipline and hierarchy, tracking, controversies over curriculum and history, and IQ andachievement testing. Political scientists ponder voting strategies coined by critical race theorists. Ethnicstudies courses often include a unit on critical race theory, and American studies departments teach materialon critical white studies developed by CRT writers.""

That seems to back up CRT opponents' concern that CRT has spread to many different areas.

Some CRT opponents may conclude, based on the above concerns, that CRT will harm the country. I don't think we can possibly say whether it will or won't (I don't personally see a path from inequality to equality via CRT but I could be wrong.) I'm just talking about their concerns

It seems that their concerns are well supported and that whatever Chris Rufo's intentions were, many of the things he's said about it are actually true, according to lead CRT scholars. 

I am curious to see if there is something I am missing here, because I personally cannot square the two things-CRT lead scholars talking about all the areas outside the law where it has spread and saying CRT aims to create a better world and CRT proponents' claims that CRT is a legal framework and tool for examination.

393,t3_rhy62r,"CMV: Social media platforms detract from the political wisdom of society, generally speaking","This argument involves two points.
1) social media sites tend toward majority rule in political views
2) uniformity makes people less wise

Point 1 :

So I've joined a number of different social media platforms and I've observed discussions on them for years and it seems to me that there is a to common pattern in political discourse: the majority rules. This is because...
A) the minority loses the approval of the masses and becomes exhausted by ""public"" ridicule and having to forever defend themselves.
B) the majority gets positive affirmation and tribal support over and over again, incentivizing participation.

This cycle continues to reinforce as one side becomes less interested in engaging and this withdraws from the conversation, leading to an echo chamber of the majority view. E.g left wing r/politics.

An important nuance here. I'm not saying that the entire site will become one way because there are groups within social media sites where minorities can make themselves into a majority within that domain. E.g. right wing r/conservatives. However, where self-segregation is facilitated, political one-sidedness may be more persistent.

Point 2 : 

First, defining politically wise: i mean having an informed understanding of the tradeoffs involved with certain political outcomes, and as a corollary, being able to understand and being sympathetic to the perspectives the opposing political party.

So why? People for the most part sort themselves into groups where they feel at home, which buttress them against the weight of viewpoints they don't agree with. (It seems like feeling a sense of belonging matters more than logic to our opinions.) This factor seems to far outweigh the role of considering new data in determining our political beliefs. Even having read through many political CMVs, which is a place where people who want ""honest"" debate should be the majority, I don't think I've ever seen one person fully change there view on an issue. 

Once people have sorted themselves, they start to feel more entrenched in their beliefs because they are normalized to a new overton window. People become more and more aware of why their views make sense and less and less aware of gaps in their thinking. This overall makes the basis of their beliefs more emotional and less rational without any intellectual foundation to support contradicting beliefs (e.g. ""how could someone think that? They must be evil."") The ""other"" group becomes demonized and validations of opposing beliefs are cast side.

This is all the more problematic because people presumably spend a limited amount of time learning about political issues, meaning any increase in the time spent learning about political issues from social media will likely be either at the expense of the spent learning about political issues in less politicized environments or the spent at least disengaged enough so as not to nurture a stronger bias.

I don't think it's necessary to explain why the above would lead to lower political wisdom as I've defined it, but feel free to challenge me on that.

394,t3_rhx49q,CMV: More people should use a wearable camera to record going out in public.,"*In areas where it is legal to do so. Also, not if your intention is to be creepy. 

The way I see it, public domain is unpredictable territory, especially if you live in a city. A camera might not stop you from getting mugged, but it will prove that it happened. Maybe you witness a car crash, witness someone abusing their children, or hear someone say something very concerning to the safety of the public. 

I personally think that one-party-consent recording is justified, but on one main exception: You must provide a copy of footage to authorities if you witness something illegal. This way, everyone is protected, not just the person recording. 

I would imagine that certain public crime rates would drastically plumit if more people did this. Security cameras in shops deter criminals (for the most part) but there are lots of places stilll not surveillanced, especially with the point of view of a person. 

When I voice my opinion to others, most of the time people are firmly opposed to the idea of it, and I can't see their point of view.

397,t3_rhv9lx,"CMV: There will always be elites who rule, and massed who are ruled, and the sooner we realize this the better","When has there ever been a society or civilization which was not ruled by elites exercising power arbitrarily and often brutally, allocating the best resources and wealth to themselves? I don't think you can come up with any examples which aren't transitory or small-scale. I am familiar with anarchist Catalonia in the 1930's, I read Orwell's book on it. But I think there is a reason why this arrangement -  or any other non-hierarchical arrangement - of society did not last long - because as everyone knows, power abhors a vacuum. Any attempt at a classless and non-oppressive society simply opens up a massive opportunity for those who are willing to oppress and use violence to swoop in and take over. Often they can present themselves as the liberators (e.g. Bolsheviks in 1917) when really they are just violent thugs willing to say and do anything and everything to maintain their status as society's new power elite.   


I think that the myth of a classless society, whether promoted by social democrats like Bernie Sanders or AOC, all the way to communists at the extreme, is extremely harmful and naive, because it disarms and blinds people to any new upper class which forms while preaching the rhetoric of equality. It is depressing, because it puts forth an ideal which has never and can never be realized, and disempowering, because no action can possibly change this state of affairs within our knowledge. The belief that utopia is possible leads to justifying the worst horrors that have been committed in its name.   


We would be way better off if we just accepted as a sociological fact that any society of sufficient complexity automatically generates classes in order to manage and govern itself. You can abolish one form of elite power but another form is always waiting to take its place - and it may be worse. Is this problematic because it gives the elites the ability to abuse and brutalize the masses? Absolutely. That is why the masses should never allow themselves to be lulled into complacency with promises of utopia. They must always educate themselves, resist elite propaganda, band together and use their overwhelming numbers to pressure elites into giving into their demands. History has proven that progressive victories are possible this way - it's how we got the weekend, the 8 hour workday, workplace safety laws etc. The fact that these protections have eroded over decades of declining union membership and ""greed is good"" neoliberal propaganda, is not a reason for despair at our impending doom of the inevitability of capitalist victory. It is a reason for understanding our true potential at the exercising of counter-power in response to elite power, without any illusions that ultimate victory for all time can ever be achieved.   


This is not to say that revolution is never justified - sometimes it turns out to be inevitable. It is simply not possible for people to endure any more oppression, and the old elites must go. But those are precisely the times when one should be the MOST skeptical of the idea of a classless society, because it is exactly with that rhetoric which the new elite class will use to take power. The masses should not be fooled and they should do everything within their power to reign in and limit the emergence of this new class.   


In short, there is never a time when the myth of a society without rulers and ruled, is useful to anyone except as a means of propaganda by which aspiring new rulers can establish their rule. This is not a reason for despair or capitulation to the rulers, but instead a reason for never-ending vigorous resistance to whatever form the ruler takes.",0.0

And now, even though I was blessed enough to find love a second time in my advancing years simply highlights the emptiness I felt when I was alone.

It isn't unreasonable to think that large corporations, perhaps included in the SP500 for example, may not only harm us but benefit by doing so. Tobacco and fast food companies are examples.

&amp;#x200B;

It is highly likely that sometimes non-governmental corporations interact with governments and some members of those corporations develop personal (but still business-like) relationships. How else would such large-scale interactions function?

Occasionally, through the magic of social life, governments and corporations find a series of mutually beneficial relationships that feed off of one another. We know they find individually beneficial relationships because we know a government contract is negotiated bw the two parties and if we can suspend disbelief for a second we could say those contracts are efficient.

The magic happens when there are so many forces pushing them in one direction that things can get out of hand.

One possible scenario among many: A combination of wage stagnation, taxe changes, asset inflation, technological development, medical operations and divisive psychological operations could be used in combination to make billions beg to be submitted to new rule.

405,t3_rhkeqh,"CMV: The only way to ""fix"" congress is through an Article 5 convention.","What: If you look at my profile links and recent posts and comments, you'll see a lot of talk of an article 5 convention. For the uninitiated, Article 5 of the US Constitution lays out how Amendments to the constitution are passed. Congress can pass them by ratifying them in both houses, or they can be proposed by the State Legislation. The amount of state legislators needed to ratify an amendment to the constitution is 5,538. There are 7,383 in the whole country right now. It's never been done- and really never been more doable. We should use this method to pass a flurry of overwhelmingly popular Ammendments to the constitution:  Term limits, increase size of Congress, the right to transparent elections, anticorruption measures, end gerrymandering.

Why: Our country is going through a crisis.  We need the disenfranchised on both sides of the aisle to elect people at the local level to pass a very clear message to congress: stop fucking with our democracy and start representing our real interests. 

How: There is no historical basis or precedent for an Article 5 convention. There have been attempts to pass them on partisan issues, but big money has always stopped it in its tracks. We the people need to ignore the experts opinions on how many laws could be passed at once because our elected leaders have abused their powers, corrupted the political climate, and shirked responsibility for decades. Do they really think a legal scholar's professional opinion should stop a movement by and for the people?

I think a divergent, bipartisan, grassroots approach is key.  A tiktok campaign during an off year election could work.


Responses to common arguments:

A:This is a dangerous precedent. We don't want to change a bunch of things too quickly.  Ammendments should go through the normal process. 

R: Nancy Pelosi. Congress will never limit their own power. That's why article 5 gives us another way. Shit is so flicked right now that we need a clean slate. 

A:  Democrats and Republicans will never agree on anything

R: congress and traditional media have always controlled the talking points. When we talk about congress being unable to get anything done, it's because they cling to labels and party loyalty.  We dissolve two parties into three or four by expanding congress. By targeting voters to turn out in an off year- the resolution being to fire not only their rep but potentially all of them at once- we may be able to convince people that it's possible. 

A: A clean slate is no good because we end up with leaders who are incompetent. 


R: We already have some pretty unqualified leaders now. Can I mention that all of the rules of Congress still exist? We'll still have checks and balances between the three branches. Still have staffers and experts to guide. 

A: Term limits don't help because then you get seedy deals and puppet politicians.

R: That's why a whole flurry of new rules is needed and not just the one. Pass an Amendment that allows a repectable political career without becoming a fixture ALONG with an Amendment ensuring financial transparency of Congress members and you've found your healthy medium. 

A: A bigger Congress will slow everything down. 

R: is it too crazy to Ammend requirements for votes on capital hill? We could quickly and efficiently have our Congress speak on issues and vote on issues through an online forum. If that's what it takes to end 535 people grandstanding on their constituents sign me up.

408,t3_rhg4nt,"CMV: ""science says we should..."" rhetoric encourages science denialism, and should be avoided","Edit: [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/rhg4nt/comment/hoqobfj/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) pretty much wrapped it up.

One important point up front: I am **not** referring to whether a given course of action is actually the right one.  Just the rhetoric.

To be clear, I'm referring to explicitly framing a given course of action as *the* recommendation of science as such; for example, ""science says we need to go carbon-neutral by ..."" or ""science says you should wear a mask"".  I am not referring to ""science says so-and-so will happen if we continue current emissions"", which isn't explicitly coupled to a ""should"".  (And let's not get into when and whether it's appropriate to say ""science says..."" without the ""should"".  That's unnecessary to this point.)

When we frame rhetorical points that way, the implication is that, if the science is correct, then there can be no valid basis for disputing the given course of action.  The ideal response from someone who disagrees would be to dispute the connection between the science and the action--but, in practice, the response to ""fact, therefore action"" is often to challenge the fact, rather than the therefore.  The implied connection between science and politics also often seems to lead to the assumption (whether founded or not) that the scientists are therefore political, and untrustworthy as a result.

For example, there is at least the possibility of debate about the ethics and pragmatic implications of specific climate-related policies, but a particular general response is often framed as the one true recommendation of climate science (in rhetoric, not by scientists in their capacity as scientists).  The result is that people who disagree with the course of action attack the science.  (I think I picked up that point from an environmental ethicist at some point.)

I think we could have much more productive discussions if we established the facts and *separately* argued about the appropriate response to those facts; that way, we could hopefully reduce the tendency to attack the science, and at least be able to work from factual common ground.  This might also allow for more legitimacy in raising reasonable questions about ethics and practicalities, which would hopefully facilitate a more productive response in general.",113.0
409,t3_rheg2u,CMV: Better to fake it and break up after the wedding than call off the wedding,"Say you realize you have too many doubts/don't want to follow through in the days approaching a wedding. You should just go through the ceremony w/ your fiance, then afterwards tell them your feelings. Reasons:

* You're calling off an event potentially hundred people have planned for and contributed to, and have travel plans for
* You're embarrassing yourself and your fiance publicly without their consent
* You don't have to sign a marriage certificate immediately, don't have to complete the marriage legally
* Better to have the conversation with the pressure of the wedding behind you and a clear head-- your decision making might be clouded by the pressure of the situation and you might feel better afterwards
* Breaking up afterwards will be much less dramatic, the audience of people who would potentially care will be smaller, less engaged, and more understanding.

EDIT: To emphasize a point from above, this is *the days approaching a wedding.* Meaning that everyone's already travelled, everything's set up. Obviously if no-one's travelled/setup the venu/etc, the easy choice is to save everyone the time.

EDIT: Given some of the hate I'm getting, I want to make it clear, this is not MY situation. I'm commenting on the movie trope of people breaking up with their SO at or around a wedding after they realize something important.  No need to call me names or criticize me personally!

It seems to me people kinda just jump to calling women Karen's at this point for very personal reasons. Another thing that really got me thinking about this was how it seemed like both women who yell at others to wear masks and women who refuse to wear them can be called Karen depending on the beliefs of the commenter, and they never really get criticized for using the term incorrectly from what I've seen.

413,t3_rhc2h4,CMV: Cryptocurrency has been a net negative for society,"Obviously, some people have become very rich off of cryptocurrencies, but crypto hasn't ""created"" that wealth; it's merely served as a mechanism to move money from people who got into it late to people who got into it early.

It was promised to us as a decentralized currency that everyone could use for their everyday purchases; digital cash.  However, the fees associated with it are high enough that it's really not useful for everyday use, and has primarily been used for speculation (which, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, isn't really creating wealth, just shifting it around).  That, and as a semi-anonymous ransom collection method for ransomware (which also isn't creating wealth; just shifting it from victims to criminals).

Meanwhile, it creates relatively large costs to society in the resources that are used up by people trying to acquire more of it; namely electricity and computer equipment.  In general, anytime society's resources are expended to give one party a leg-up in a zero-sum game, that it a net loss society.  And the expenditure of otherwise useful resources for party x to mine the next block instead of party y is an example of exactly that.

So, on the whole, I'd say it's been negative.  Society one the whole would be better if crypto had never been created. CMV.",70.0
414,t3_rhbs9w,CMV: I have no sympathy for obese people.,"Context: I was north of 280 lbs (127 kg) at one point not too long ago. I had a multitude of leg injuries from sports (knee, ankle, and hip) that led to me not being able to exercise. I just kept eating but became lazy and put on weight. It got to the point of not being able to look in the mirror, shaming myself constantly, barely being able to go up stairs due to the weight/injuries. I was told I would need multiple surgeries to repair my ankles.

I was extremely depressed and hated everything to do with who I had become.  All I really needed was reaching a breaking point and finally deciding to improve myself and actually sticking to it. Worked little by little every day until I figured out a plan of action that worked for me. It was changing perspective on food, starting with one meal a day making a good decision until it became more normal than not to eat a healthy meal. I slowly ramped up exercises that I could do until weight came off and my legs could handle more and more. There were, of course, many setbacks and points of weakness, but I also learned to not get mad at myself for these and focus on the positive change I had set into motion.

It hurt, everyday, bad. There were days I woke up, put my legs on the ground, and my knees gave out. But, I learned to not give in to the hardships, like I had become accustomed to doing.

I've lost most of my excess weight, and held it off for a year with no issue or setback.  I realize that weight-loss really isn't that hard if you just put in effort.

So now, when I see someone extremely overweight I don't have sympathy, at all, when they tell me that they can't lose weight. There is always an option, it is just on you to do research and learn what can work for you. A very small percentage of obesity is caused my medical issues (which I do sympathize with). But those that I see being lazy every day and not ever putting any time or effort into what goes into their body, I have started to view as weak. Of course those that are (or want to and just don't know where/how to start) I will always support and encourage.

I won't outright shame anyone overweight directly (it doesn't help). But, if you never make any effort towards improving something that is slowly killing you and degrading your quality of life, then you've given up on yourself. At some point, no matter your mental or physical state, there has to be a moment where you want to improve.

Edit: More emphasis should be put on, I lack sympathy for those that have given up or never tried to improve themselves, less the actual obesity itself.",1.0
415,t3_rhae80,CMV: Using the word “lynch” isn’t racist,"So my college had a mafia club that I was really into. For people who’ve never played mafia, it’s a game where a secret group of players called the mafia “kills” a member of the town each day, and then at night all players vote on someone to “lynch”, in the hopes eliminating all the mafia.

Now, partway through, some white people decided that we should change the word “lynch” to “execute,” on the grounds that historical lynchings disproportionately targeted black people, so it might be offensive. I thought that was stupid; definitionally, when a mob decides to kill a person on the grounds that they maybe committed a crime, that’s lynching. Using a different word doesn’t make it not lynching. It just makes our language less clear and concise.

It’s like deciding that the word “nuke” is offensive because nuclear bombs disproportionately killed Japanese people. You’ve not only declared an entire method of killing to be racist, but you’ve decided that changing the name makes it better.

I think some of the motivation was that there were no black people in the club’s leadership, just whites and Asians, and people wanted to be more inclusive. But we’d had several black players in our games, and afaik they weren’t the ones complaining. Just hypothetical black people. But to be perfectly honest, I think that if a black person DID feel uncomfortable, it wouldn’t be the club’s fault. Like, one time we were talking about how one combination of alignments could make a player want to kill themselves in game, and I had to leave and cry in the bathroom, because I’d just lost a family member to suicide. It would be idiotic if any game rules were changed because of that, and people are MORE likely to know someone who has committed suicide than someone who’s been lynched.

Anyway, CMV. Is there any reason to avoid using the word “lynch” in games with lynchings?",15.0
416,t3_rha7ds,CMV: I am not currently convinced 'structural oppression' is a thing that actually exists.,"So firstly I want to address some low hanging fruit and clarify something, no I am not referring to laws like  segregation and such. Those are obviously oppressive laws created by a system and is not what I mean here.

Instead what I refer is this claim that I continually read which is about how some structures are innately oppressive. I have always felt bothered by such statements for a long time and recently have kind of worked out that the reason is because I've never felt convinced they actually exist.

One example of this is police structures. In the wake of the George Floyd protests the policing institution in America was rightfully called out as being racist and a push was made to put an end to that. Among these aims was the goal to remove racist police officers from the force and work to put an end to discrimination in the judicial system. All this is in my view good and logical to do, however I kept consistently seeing people claim that even if all these things were done (ie, every racist cop was removed from the force and the judicial system was made perfectly race blind) the American justice system would still be a racist organisation.

It is this claim that I don't understand at all. How is it possible for the American justice system to still be racist in such a scenario?

This line of reasoning is also commonly extended to other things in my experience. For example that college applications or job interviews are inherently sexist against women, (and still would be even if all sexist individuals were removed and they were completely blind to ones gender identity) that certain groups such as disabled individuals will always be disadvantaged at school, employment and in life generally (even if a system was introduced to ensure equity between them and their able bodied peers) and that certain minorities will always be disadvantaged in public/national discussions. (Even if say every board or discussion panel had equally members of each relevant group.)

I simply do not understand these claims because they usually seem to hinge upon something unidentifiable. As in they can't point to any one thing in particular that needs to be changed in order to make a system fair, instead they seem to conclude that by virtue of existing these organisations will always be discriminatory. I can't see how such a thing can be the case.",18.0
417,t3_rh9lgz,CMV: Oil-based sauces and condiments are acceptable in grilled cheeses,"Grilled cheese purists argue that grilled cheese sandwiches cannot contain anything other than cheese and maybe mayo within itself, otherwise it becomes a *sandwich melt*, not a grilled cheese. I disagree and think that one can add sauces and condiments such as pesto, aioli, and flavored mayo to a grilled cheese and still call the sandwich a grilled cheese.

My view is established with the following reasoning:

First, butter and mayonnaise are already an acceptable ingredients in grilled cheese sandwiches. Some use then to toast the bread, and others also use them within the sandwich. Therefore, we infer that the usage of neutral fats/oil-based sauces is acceptable.

Second, there is no restriction on which cheeses can be used in a grilled cheese sandwich. A grilled cheese is still a grilled cheese even if I were to use pepper jack, truffle-oil gouda, horseradish cheddar, etc. We therefore conclude that the definition of a grilled cheese is not based on flavor, but rather its ingredients.

Therefore, it stands to reason that adding additional flavorings to the aforementioned butter and mayo does not compromise the legitimacy of a grilled cheese. Therefore, the addition of any of the following:
- Pesto
- Sriracha mayo
- Bearnaise sauce
- Chipotle aioli
- Garlic aioli
is acceptable on grilled cheese.",11.0
418,t3_rh7g0k,CMV: Govt. mandates on people's personal choices is fascism and people who disagree are dangerous sheep,"I remember when I first became aware of how my own personal choices couldn't be applied to others because that would assume I lack basic intellect or was actively choosing to ignore nuance. 

In my early twenties I was vehemently against people consuming meat and dairy. I was truly in a bubble of my own making where everyone who didn't fit into this box I had created labeled ""good person"" was immediately placed in the other box, labeled ""bad person."" 

It goes without saying that global warming is the greatest existential threat to humanity. The survival of our species depends on being to curtail global greenhouse gas emissions. Granted, most of the damage done to our planet is done by industry, but individuals do still contribute. This [article](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/) from NASA explains some of the devastating effects climate change has our eco-system. Going vegan is something the individual can do very easily that has an incredible impact on global emissions. And the World Health Organization agrees, specially in regards to methane. See [here.](https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/vegan-diet-environment) I was so passionate about this I thought the government should mandate vegans get free healthcare and fat people should foot most of our healthcare bills. 

I was, in short, a vegan asshole. Until I met other vegans who were also assholes. Then I remembered growing up Catholic and realizing how much I hated feeling like I had no bodily autonomy. Finally, I met someone who dealt with food insecurity and it completely changed my perception. People aren't assholes because they aren't vegan. They just aren't where I am at. Some are traumatized and trying their best. Some don't have access to healthy foods. Some don't even know how to cook. I took so much for granted. Once my attitude towards this changed (i.e. I gave up control) suddenly people in my life started wanting to go vegan. I rolled my eyes at the universe and said ""ok ok I get it."" From then on, I stopped believing government should mandate anything in regards to the body. I realized every ""bad"" decision if we think of ""bad"" as something that hurts someone or hurts alot of people is basically a trauma response and the lense at which I looked at issues forever changed. 

In 2021, we see mandates for a vaccine. Some are stlll hesitant to get the vaccine for a variety of reasons. I dont want this thread to become about whether or not the vaccine is effective. Or even if vaccine mandates are effective at curtailing the spread of the virus. The point is ""needle in body"" is ultimately a choice that needs to be made by the person without threat to their livelihood or safety. We now have the government in New Zealand using this latest power grab to issue a country-wide prohibition on cigarette sales for those 14 years of age right now and that limit will be raised every year. Eventually, the plan is to ban them outright. [Here](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/15/1064212737/new-zealands-cigarette-ban-model) is that article that explains it. They are using the same rhetoric that was used for vaccine mandates. More mandates that violate bodily autonomy rights could well be on their way. 

My point is, this is dangerous. I can't fathom how anyone could disagree allowing governments to quite literally mandate what someone else does with their body. Have you seen The Handmaid's Tale? 

I know the argument that ""well people can hurt other people with their choices."" Thats true but the majority of, mostly liberals, who support such mandates are not vegan. Its funny because these same people who have othered the ""unvaccinated"" were once in MY ""bad people"" box. For the sake of this argument, let's say they still are. Imagine a world where government literally banned meat and dairy production and forced you to be vegan because of the threat of climate change. Crazy, rignt? Don't you see the hypocrisy? You might be thinking ""What me? A bad person? I just really like sushi."" YES, YOU. You're a devil. You're destroying our planet with your choices! We must quarantine you immediately until you are ""cleansed."" 

This type of policing on bodily autonomy rights has always given rise to fascist societies. This [article](https://www.econlib.org/a-brief-look-at-why-prohibition-laws-dont-work/#:~:text=Not%20only%20did%20Prohibition%20fail,prison%20population%2C%20and%20public%20corruption.&amp;text=Clearly%2C%20there%20was%20no%20easement,to%20decreasing%20the%20prison%20population.) explains why prohibition has historically never worked. 

Please CMV. I'm interested to hear how mandates could possibly be sane or moral. How could otherwise rational people support them? 

Arguments that I will reject are anything that includes references to operating any kind of machinery or having licenses to do things. Those are not the same as BODILY autonomy. If you can't keep your argument directly centered on bodily autonomy, please don't reply.   Please also refrain from including mandates from private businesses as this is different than government mandating things with the threat of jail time and fines for those that disobey.",0.0
419,t3_rh6oqy,"CMV: ""get vaccinated to go back to normal"" always was and will be a lie. Lockdowns and dead economies are the new normal.","When the vaccine first came out the big slogan was get vaccinated so we can return to normal. And everyone went and got it. But as time went on it became apparent that the vaxxed can catch and spread COVID. The rules for vaxxed people didn't change either, you still have to wear a mask in most if not all settings, 6 feet etc... 

My college is a clear example of this in that you can only go back to school or enter the grounds if you are vaccinated, but you need to wear the mask wash down all equipment and desks, 6 feet and they are still doing modified school schedule 2 weeks (one day per week) zoom one week in class for practical. 

If you catch COVID fully vaxxed you need to quarantine for 2 weeks.

The vaccine only protects the individual from serious hospitalization, not the risk of spreading it. 

The current POTUS went on air to say (paraphrase) ""get the Vax to stop the spread and protect your fellow Americans as your patriotic duty"". Well we've already established the the vaxxed still spread COVID so he and all of the mainstream media are propagating misinformation and those of us who are not vaxxed can see this blatant misinformation and lies clearly. 

There will never be a return to normal, there is too much money and power involved for this to be stopped. Even if you say unvaxxed are hosts for potential mutations I argue that if a vaxxed person can get COVID there will one day come about a superbug version of COVID that is resistant to the vaccine.

Also, since we are already so wasteful in the current day and age, our successors in hundreds of years will likely find reason to mine for resources in our current-day landfills (for things like lithium and copper, as well as to easily obtain petroleum products no longer available from oil extraction).  So it will eventually be recycled anyway.

I also think that recycling paper products is nearly pointless, since paper creation operations have private forests they replant, and paper decomposes. From my understanding, nothing is really wasted here.

I would imagine responses to this would vary based on the recycling program in your locale. if they are putting plastic to good use, go for it. Most recycling operations are not.

I just wrote [an article](https://theconsciousvibe.com/heres-why-there-should-be-a-maximum-age-for-politicians/) (as non-political as possible) looking at the data behind cognitive ability as we age. It seems that the data is fairly clear. I'm thinking that as a member of the general population we want our representatives as sharp as a tack, right?

I don't think it matters whether you're red or blue, but curious what other peoples thoughts are and if there's anything major that I'm missing ?

**EDIT:** based on the feedback below, 70 probably is too old on AVERAGE, but as some pointed out everyone is different - A more unilaterally fair idea is to implement cognitive testing (with public results) for all political offices - I added a section in the article to address this perspective as well - seems reasonable which means it will probably never happen, lol

It's not simply that MGTOW, black pill and incel communities are on the rise, but also that men are falling behind in basically all statistics that can be measured from education dropout to suicide rat. More and more men just simply ""do not care"". 

There can and should be criticism where criticism is due, even against a whole gender if it's justified. However, claims like ""A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle"", or hashtags like ""menaretrash"" and ""killalmen"" would be seldom classed as good faith criticism. When a teacher forces the boys in the class to stand up in a line, and apologise for the supposed wrongdoings of their gender, when we suggest that the inherent need for rough and tumble play and competitiveness is ""toxic masculinity"", when certain views are not allowed to be criticized on the campuses and people lose their livelihood for doing so, when there is a constant claim of patriarchy and male privilege, despite the fact that the ""equality of the sexes"" is achieved across the modern world, we should suspect that something is well off in our society. If the only message is that men are not needed, broken, bad, worthless, men will check out. Take a good look at the media (from Hollywood trough the famous talk shows to Twitter hashtags) and tell me that it's not true that for every one appreciative sentiment, there are ten sentiments, something like the ones above. 

I know it's not so popular to say that men have built  the world, domesticated and basically maintaining it, but it's still stand true, to the extent where men became obsolete on the individual level. The only reason why women do not personally ""need"" a man is because even if they are single, most of their problems will be solved. The only reason why women can spend their youth, chasing their carreer is because they do not have to stay around the home with 5 - 10 kids from which 5 will probably die. 

We only need to wheel out the bin, only own a microwave, and buy the ready to eat meal packs, don't have to take half a day with the laundry, nor walk miles to the closest source of drinking water, nor have to throw out the blackwater trough the window and risk plagues.. Electricity is available with a touch of a finger, and if something goes wrong with the plumbing or the wiers, help is only a phone call away.

Don't get me wrong, in no way, shape or form do i suggest that women are ""second class citizens"" and there was/is no contribution on their part whatsoever. None of the achievements above would have been possible without women covering men's backs at the support line. But this doesn't change the fact that 99% of those achievements were in fact carried out by men, nor that men are in the front line, when it comes to maintaining society, even though nothing holds back a woman today to hop on to the garbage truck, learn plumbing, sign a contract to an oil rig, operate heavy machinery or in the name of equality, fight for being included in the draft.

There are (imho rarely) legit excuses for why a last minute cancellation is needed but we all know that most of our shit gets cancelled for bad reasons. It's like an upgraded version of being habitually late, and it demonstrates the person doesn't care about your time. A cursory google search tells me millenials (including myself) are especially bad about being flaky. I believe this comes from a social shift that started with millenials: basically we've been taught that if we feel bad, it excuses us from responsibility. That's a vast oversimplification, but I don't want to write a novel here, I think you guys get what I'm talking about, and if not we can debate further in comments. When someone flakes out, they've robbed you of your time because if you'd known they wouldn't show up you could've adjusted your plans. Flaking out is often defended by saying ""yeah but their feelings and stuff"" and therefore they are forgiven.

By ""flaky"" i'm specifically referring to situations when someone agrees to do something (such as going to an event with a small group) then at the last minute they cancel, often claiming a legit excuse when they really just didn't feel like it at the last minute.

426,t3_rgzw24,"CMV: Suicide is a matter of bodily autonomy and take-home suicide kits should be freely available OTC for everyone, regardless of their age or mental state.","Inspired by someone else's recent post about how suicide prevention isn't inherently good.

EDIT: view partially changed, the kit should be available at a doctor's discretion to prevent use as a murder weapon. But it still should be freely available with no restrictions.
EDIT2: i now agree that a (short!!!) waiting period should be required before the request for euthanasia is greenlit.

I believe the right to take your own life is the most fundamental aspect of bodily autonomy, and it should be available to literally everyone with no restrictions. 

I understand that other aspects of bodily autonomy are restricted to some degree (like minors not being able to get tattoos, for example), but I believe that 1) the right to die is more important than any other right and should be provided unconditionally 2) the restrictions on other aspects of bodily autonomy should be lowered anyway (i believe abortion should be legal all the way until delievery, for example) so it wouldn't be a compelling argument to say that this is not how we treat other, similar subjects.

Forcing someone to stay alive when they don't want to is an incredibly cruel thing. The fact that we stigmatize and prevent suicide really goes to show that we don't really care about people, just their usefulness in society (cant be useful if you're dead) and our own emotions attached to the person. Many countries allow euthanasia for those who are terminally ill but why are we discriminating against those whose pain or suicidal tendencies don't come from terminal illness? These people clearly are in similar levels of pain as evidenced by the fact that they still attempt suicide. Forcing them to rely on uncertain and painful methods is inhumane. Similarly I don't see why we shouldn't provide a way out for children and minors. Sure, kids don't fully understand the consequences of their actions, but the instinct for self preservation isn't absent in them, it's not something that only develops once they are adults. If their suffering is great enough to override the natural will to live then it is inhumane to keep them alive just because they're kids. 

I struggle to come up with any counterarguments to this, and would love to see why this is not a more popular opinion.",0.0
427,t3_rgxm58,CMV: Preventing suicide is not inherently good and should not be a goal.,"One of the best arguments for this is that we put down animals who suffer too much, but try to keep people alive no matter what.

I think that, in a case where someone has chronic and persistent suffering, they should be allowed to die. I also don't think that we should ever prevent suicide just for the sake of preventing suicide. Sure, there are people who attempt and regret it, but there are just as many if not more people who regret *not* killing themselves. People who continue to suffer are a drain on society *and* it's cruel to put them through that. 

The goal should be to reduce the things that lead people to suicide in the first place, IMO, this is mostly trauma, *not* mental illness. Even if it's the latter, it's typically caused by the former. Suicide is *not* always an irrational, mentally ill decision, and I *deeply* resent people who are either too stupid or too privileged to see that. 

Also, suicide may or may not be selfish, but that's not the point. I don't think that you can ever expect someone suffering that much to treat anyone any better than they've been treated. To an extent, this justifies mass shootings, but that's a separate debate. If you think I should make a post on that, lemme know, cause I definitely have an uncommon viewpoint. Basically, if an individual is in unbearable pain, this is caused by other people the vast majority of the time, and they don't owe anyone basic human decency. It traumatizes their family? Too damn bad. Not their responsibility. 

For context, I will say that I'm personally biased towards this view because of my own experiences. I don't have any particular desire to kill myself right now, but I did come close to it when I was a young teenager. Never attempted, but was close. Anyway, I lived, suffered immensely over the next years, and did a great number of things that were harmful to other people to varying extents. Ultimately, while I did have some good experiences that I'm grateful for, my continued existence was not worth it for me, and a detriment to quite a few other people. I don't believe the latter is my responsibility at all, but again, that veers into a different debate. 

The way I see it, forcing people to continue to suffer is cruel, and there's a high chance those people will also end up making life worse for others, at the very least draining resources for ""mental healthcare"". I also think that there are plenty of cases where suicide is a logical decision, *not* a result of mental illness. If I had died when I was 15, it would have saved us all a lot of trouble. This is kind of a mishmash between several different opinions, so feel free to contest any or all of them.",9.0
428,t3_rgvc4f,CMV: You're better off never getting into an argument on the internet,"I was never a keyboard warrior or anything, but in my time I've debated my fair share of people online. One of the most serious debates I ever found myself in was back when gamers became irate that Epic was paying for AAA games to be exclusive to the Epic Games Store. I held the minority opinion that this was good for the gaming community. I wrote a whole argument and debated people for a few days. Feel free to go through my comment history to see how that went.

&amp;#x200B;

  
**Definition**

To expand on the title, I mean internet arguments where there is strong controversy, high stakes, and ardent believers - things like abortion or video game journalism ethics. The format is seeing a comment expressing something you disagree with, and then starting an argument with that person with the intention of winning. So an unprompted argument.

&amp;#x200B;

**Internet Argument against Internet Argument:**

The person who you're arguing against is obviously not to change their opinion. You've attacked their opinion without their consent - they're not open to the posibility of changing their minds. Neither will the broader audience - on arguments of strong controversy, very few people have yet to make up their minds. For the few people who are open minded to change - the internet argument is not an effective method of coming to a conclusion. It is far better to carefully study the issue by examining the opinions of each side.

I also contend that the people who participate in internet arguments do so for blood sport, which explains why the vast majority of arguments result in personal attacks and accusations of being a certain label. High quality discussions do not come from internet arguments.

Internet arguments are bad for the soul. They lead to resentment and anger. I imagine those who are heavily prone to arguing on the internet suffer from poor mental health. 

Internet arguments hurt your own reputation. For a good reason. They are indicative of a lack of self-control.  


In short, unprompted arguments on the Internet are useless, bad for your mental health, and deteriorate the quality of Internet life. Every time you decide not to engage in such, you're doing yourself and the whole online world a favor.",160.0
429,t3_rgtv9e,CMV: The type of confidence you gain from building muscle / strength is superficial and not true confidence,"Let me just preface this by saying that although I consciously try not to be, I am probably a bit biased: I began working out religiously because of being bullied as being skinny. I thought that by building muscle and getting stronger, that it will solve my low self-esteem. Now that I am regarded as one of the strongest guys in my year, I have realized that I could have not been more wrong and that true confidence has to be obtained by mentally tackling the root of your problems. I have pretty much become that meme where I would stand awkwardly in the corner at a party and think ""they don't know I can bench 100kgs""

Let me also add that **the confidence you gain from acknowledging the discipline and hard work you have put into bettering your body is perfectly healthy**, but the confidence you place into your superficial physique or strength are only temporarily as they will inevitably fade.

If you are insecure about your body and start working out to try and change it, all you are doing is temporarily suppressing your feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. Instead of saying ""I am enough as I am now, and I am only working out because of the health benefits"", you tell yourself that ""I will only be enough once I can bench X amount"" or ""I will only be enough once i reach X weight"". Now I'm not saying that you shouldn't work out - by all means go ahead, but realize that your insecurities will NOT go away just because you gained some muscle or lost some weight. Pride is not the opposite of shame, and just because you have distanced yourself from your insecurities, does not mean that it will not continue to linger on and haunt you. **The only way to truly break free from your insecurities is to tackle and deconstruct them head on mentally**. 

I feel like the greatest example of this is Zyzz. In case you don't know, Zyzz is a bodybuilder that was bullied as a kid all the time for being skinny, and began working out as a result of his insecurities. His hard work paid off and he eventually grew to become internet famous and regarded as an ""aesthetic god"". You would think that after all this he would have finally broken free from his insecurity right? His own brother said this:

 ""Yeah, before his fame and even after his fame. He was very, very insecure, and he was in a lot of pain and a lot of hurt, because deep down, he's still that skinny kid."" 

Basically, you can work out for whatever reason you want, but realize that working out will not solve your insecurities. Only deeply and mentally working on yourself will.",0.0

To be clear, I am not asking to change my view on any current gun law, or to change my view to make gun law more strict or more loose. 

I am of the opinion the primary reason people own guns is because it's a hobby and they enjoy guns.

Many gun owners love to make the fire extinguisher argument on why they own a gun. ""You hope you never have to use it, but you have one in case""  Okay take a picture posing with your fire extinguisher or go to the fire department monthly and practice putting out fires.

I will say shooting guns is a blast, I was once interested in owning a gun but after I took a class it honestly made more logical and safety sense not to own one. 

I was taught in said gun class it take about 3 seconds (heck maybe longer) to get a gun out of a holster, aim and fire (and that's if your insanely good). People can charge 10 feet in that amount of time. I would be stabbed.

I also have mental struggles lately and with covid and my 20 month daughter and father fighting cancer, I know there were days if a gun was in the house I would have used it on myself.

The basis for this belief are based on two facts, that women largely started entering the workforce after the civil rights movements of the 60s, and that since the 80s the cost of living has rosen faster than inflation.


I believe these are correlated. Before women entered the workforce, it seemed that the cost of living was proportional to a single income household. But if the market was flooded with dual incomes, the cost of renting or buying is not based on what a single income can afford, but what two can afford (depending on the percentage of household are dual income).

The German National Socialist Party was a real political entity with a very specific ideology and a very specific platform of ideas. Here were the 23 demands of that platform published by the Nazi party in 1920 (simplified, source:[https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/25points.asp](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/25points.asp) )

 

1. Unification of Greater Germany (Austria + Germany)
2. Land + expansion
3. Anti-Versailles - abrogation of the Treaty.
4. Land and territory - *lebensraum*.
5. Only a ""member of the race"" can be a citizen.
6. Anti-semitism - No Jew can be a member of the race.
7. Anti-foreigner - only citizens can live in Germany.
8. No immigration - ref. to Jews fleeing pograms.
9. Everyone must work.
10. Abolition of unearned income - ""no rent-slavery"".
11. Nationalisation of industry
12. Divison of profits
13. Extension of old age welfare.
14. Land reform
15. Death to all criminals
16. German law, not Roman law (anti- French Rev.)
17. Education to teach ""the German Way""
18. Education of gifted children
19. Protection of mother and child by outlawing child labour.
20. Encouraging gymnastics and swimming
21. Formation a national army.
22. Duty of the state to provide for its volk.
23. Duty of individuals to the state

Don't buy CD's. Make your own vinyl records! Don't buy music. Make your own music! Don't buy food. Grow your own food! I swear, Bill Maher is right when he accuses Zoomers of being the generation that thinks nobody ever lived before they did.

Also, as more and more actors move into the space to create their own ecosystems disconnected from ""big tech"", there will be a power law distribution on who consolidates power and influence with those new ecosystems. In effect, you're trading Google or Facebook for another 3rd party...a 3rd party which will STILL have centralized control over your data and use of their system as a customer.

441,t3_rgjr8l,CMV: Drunk people CAN consent to sex,"It seems common now to say that drunk/intoxicated people cannot give consent. This seems like an absurd claim to me for a couple of reasons.

1. We hold drunk people accountable for their actions in all kinds of scenarios. If a drunk person chooses to get behind a wheel and drive they are legally responsible for the fallout. If they get pulled over, or God forbid kill someone before their able to be pulled over, they go to jail. The fact that their judgment was impaired due to alcohol does not exonerate their responsibility for their choices. 

Yet, if a person drinks the same amount of alcohol chooses to engage in sexual activity then they cannot give “true consent” and they're not responsible for the actions they choose to engage in? That seems widely inconsistent to me. If a drunk person is responsible in their choice to drive under the influence then a drunk person is responsible in their choice to engage in sexual activity under the influence. The regret of either choice after the fact doesn't negate their responsibility for the choice in the moment.

2. Imagine the insanity if this were true. A happily married couple pops open a bottle of wine gets tipsy and heads to the bedroom. Now, under this belief system they are both rapists (cause they had sex with a drunk person) and rape victims (cause someone had sex with them while they were drunk). 

That’s not to say this is a scenario where they are likely to be arrested or prosecuted (due to the improbability of them reporting each other), but if you believe that a) drunk people can’t consent to sex and b)sex without consent is rape, then logically you must believe the married couple are both rape victims and rapists.

443,t3_rgjqe8,CMV: The 'n-word' is worse than the term 'cracker' as a racial pejorative,"\*I use ""worse"" in the title for lack of a better word

Inspired from the recent debacle with Twitch streamer Hasan Piker...

First let me be clear, both words are racial slurs, and should be avoided as much as possible. I will be talking about these two words in terms of the general understanding of their historical usage in the US rather than etymological foundations and \*true\* origin as I don't believe that has much relevance to their contemporary use in the US.

It all comes down to cultural usage and historical context IMO. The N word was used by the oppressive majority for centuries in the US in order to demean, dehumanize, abuse, and murder an already powerless and abused social minority. Even in the years/decades/centuries that followed abolition, the N word continued to be used by white people (who remained the social and political majority) in order to justify/aid in the abhorrent maltreatment of Black Americans.

The word cracker was used by a range of people in early and contemporary America. Cracker was often used a humorous term of self-description in early middle America. As a pejorative, it was often used by enslaved blacks in reference to their white masters, and it has been theorized that the term originated as a result of the cracking sound of a whip although their are conflicting ideas about that so this point isn't all too important.

To me the difference couldn't be clearer. One is a term that was connected with one of the most horrific acts of crime in the developed world, and the other was what I would consider ""verbal self-defense"" (and it didn't aid in promoting nearly the same level of hate, torture, and systematic oppresion)",2.0

445,t3_rgj4hb,CMV: it is impossible to definitively know what is happening in communities other than your own and as a result history has become a bit subjective.,"So truth be told this opinion is a bit half baked and This thought isn’t the easiest to put words to but more and more I am starting to believe modern history is subjective and it is impossible to definitively know why things happen, or in some cases if they happened at all. While there are some things in history that are definitively true, like the existence of the Holocaust or the slave trade, many things in modern history are less clear due to the effects of propaganda and bias in our media. Ive thought about this a lot when it comes to the red scare and the impact of anti communist propaganda. 

Take Russia for example. What Americans are told about Russia post WWII is vastly different than what Russians are told about that time. There is evidence that a lot of people died under Stalin but it’s hard to determine how they died or who is to blame. Another example is Cuba. Americans are told it’s a terrible place with no freedom and that everyone wants to leave but having traveled to cuba that isn’t really accurate. Obviously there are problems there but a lot of people there do like it and are happy with how things are there. Even looking at history there, there are many different perspectives on what has happened in cuba and it is pretty hard to discern exactly what happened and why because of all the red scare bias here in the United States. China too. And in a place like China, understanding exactly what happens there is even more difficult because of censorship. We are taught that Mao was terrible but people in China look up to him. He and his actions are viewed differently there. How can we definitively know what happened under Stalin or Castro or mao. How can we know what is happening in these other communities or what has happened to them in the past. 

More and more modern history is reminding of that saying “there’s 3 sides to every story, my side, your side, and the truth” but it is nearly impossible to know what the truth is. I think social media in many ways has exasperated this because anyone can say anything and evidence can easily be fabricated.

Let me start by saying that I voted against Trump. I am for the removal of confederate statues. I am not for removing the founding fathers of America from anywhere. 

I understand the difficulties with certain historical figures and slavery. Slave ownership was as commonplace as driving an automobile at one time in our history. I know these are in no way equal acts, nor an excuse, but how can we remove figures this integral to our countries history based on this fact? One must understand that at one point owning slaves was legal. It took hundreds of years for this to change. 

It is basically an admittance that America is rotten to the core in my view if we continue to do this. I do not believe this. I believe that in spite of this America overcame and continues to overcome its past ills. America is the freest and most diverse country on earth (debatable, but I believe this is provable to some extent depending on parameters). 

Is anyone from our history immune to this kind of destruction? I want to hear why this was necessary. I understand it upsets some and the article outlines the reasoning “he believed people who looked like me were inferior”

Is he here saying that to you now? Are you required to think that way each time you pass his statue? Do you believe he would think that way now given the benefit of existing in the present?

Where is the line? Are we to erase all of American history and it’s forebears? I do not think there is a line and I’m starting to feel as though it’s open season on American History due to its ugly past. Convince me that Trump was wrong and that we won’t see this trend continue

Edit: I can’t keep up with all the replies here, generally I think my view has been somewhat altered. Some of my view is a bit extreme (America might not be rotten because we remove a statue, it’s not the end of the world). Jefferson maybe wasn’t such a peach so perhaps if removing his statue makes others more comfortable fine, yea, he is still a part of American history even if we do that. I didn’t fully understand how at that time in history slavery wasn’t exactly kosher to everyone my timelines weren’t exactly accurate. I will say though that those commenting that the ancestors of white people are all monsters are a bit off base… Quaker’s evidence that. I do not like the attacking of American history, but perhaps it’s a somewhat ethnocentric view of what is not the prettiest history. Wish it wasn’t this way, but history is ugly. I don’t think I’m convinced this will stop but more that it is okay if it happens and it doesn’t spell the end for society

448,t3_rggwor,CMV: Neither side of the abortion debate has convinced me fully their stance is the right stance. I'm happily indecisive. And that is ok.,"***Full disclosure, I am a white male American in my mid-30s. I have not been in a situation where abortion was on the cards, nor have I had a partner who is/was pregnant. I do understand why some individuals do fall on one side or the other based on past experiences, and I fully respect their stance as a result.***

I would probably put myself somewhere on the left of center in the American political landscape when it comes to many political and social issues, issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, single-payer medical coverage for all, some restrictions in response to COVID-19, universal basic income, and others. I do as well fall on the right in some political and social issues, such as pushback on ""cancel culture"", some restrictions in response to COVID-19, and others. One of the social/political hot-button topics on which I don't have a stance, among many, is abortion.

I have a partner along with a good majority of my friends who are very pro-choice, or what some conservatives like to label, ""anti-life"". I also have some friends, including my partner's parents, who are pro-life, or what some liberals/democrats like to label ""anti-choice"". I've had many conversations with friends on both sides of the spectrum, attempting to understand their views. I get the argument that for a certain time while the fetus is in the womb, the living woman is the one keeping the fetus alive. I also understand the conservative stance that the fetus is technically a living being that will become a living human after nine months. I have also watched many debates from both sides, and done plenty of research. However, neither side has convinced me that their side is the way to go. No argument one way or the other has made me believe their stance is something that I need to believe in. And until a side has such an argument, I am perfectly fine standing on the sidelines. 

I really want to fully understand why my choice is such a bad choice to some people. If I'm asked to legalize abortion, or make it illegal, I'll simply abstain from voting, and leave the boxes blank, as I believe I don't have a well-informed opinion or belief system to vote one way or another on this topic. I'd rather allow those who feel more informed, who have an opinion, to make that determination, and then live with the results. 

Please note that I am not interested in responses outlining why I should be pro-life/anti-choice, or why I should be pro-choice/anti-life. I don't care if you're on one side or the other, and I will ignore these sorts of replies as this is not what I am arguing. 

Please change my view.

EDIT: I have given two deltas, one helping me take a more pragmatic approach to the debate; and the other, how I can hold an opinion on how to approach its legislation, without holding an opinion on abortion itself.",6.0
449,t3_rgez1p,CMV: there seems to be no logical reason for why use of the n word is reserved for black people,"I’m more so looking for a reason that it’s reserved for black people than I am looking to prove my point, so changing my view should be rather easy. 

Just to note: I don’t think that anyone, regardless of race, should ever use the hard r, unless in very specific circumstances, like Dave Chapelle comedy bits. Thus, I’ll be mainly focusing on use of the soft n word 


Arguments that I’ve heard so far: 


&gt;&gt;it’s because of slavery 

Well, not all black people have ancestors that were enslaved, and not all slaves were black people, so this doesn’t really work. If this were the only basis, then many black people would not be allowed to use the n word, while many white people would. 


&gt;&gt;it’s because the word was historically used to degrade them

I particularly don’t like this argument for a couple of reasons. 

1. Again, this would mean that some white people with progressive ancestors would be able to use the n word, which instantly invalidates this argument. 

2. It assumes that everyone is defined by and identifies wholly with their race.  Just as I have no relation or share no bond with Donald Trump, sharing the skin color of someone who was previously persecuted does not automatically grant you the same privileges as them or force you to carry the same burden that they once did.



&gt;&gt;they are systematically discriminated against

Ok…does the magnitude matter? I would assume so, which means that we now need to determine that. 

Inevitably, we would alienate a number of black people in the process, such as Lil Wayne (who claims to have never suffered from racism), while allowing many Asians and other minorities to say it (and possibly some white people).",0.0
450,t3_rgdgoi,CMV: Some facts about consciousness that seem like they have to be true,"There's a lot of theories and explanations of consciousness. But I wanted to start with some observations that seem like they have to be true, even if they don't give us any clear idea of how consciousness works. 

So here's a short list of facts about consciousness that seem like they have to be true. I would love to hear reasons why any or all of them don't have to be true:

* Consciousness happens in the brain, but not all of the brain, there’s part of the brain where things are happening that I’m not consciously aware of. Including parts of my perception. For example, my eyes are made of cones and rods, and that information is combined and ‘processed’ in various ways before I become aware of “seeing” things as a 3D image. I’m not consciously aware of any of the processing that happens
* The experience of consciousness is 4D (by 4D I mean 3 spatial dimensions and one time dimension). I can observe flat surfaces, but I can’t experience things in 2D. For example, there’s no way to experience the two flat images that my individual eyeballs create.
* The experience of consciousness doesn’t seem to have the characteristics of the physical matter that makes up the world. For example, all matter and energy is quantized, it comes in packets or ‘chunks’. But consciousness is experienced as continuous. It doesn’t feel like there’s any seams or bits making up the conscious experience. Using a metaphor a digital camera takes images using pixels that are arranged kind of like the cones in my eyes. And it also processes the image using transistors, which like my neurons take up finite space and are discrete from each other. But the camera creates an image that’s broken up in to bits or individual pixels, which seems to be required by the physical nature of the way it works (even if we can’t always ‘see’ the breaks between pixels). But even though my eyes ‘take a picture’ using discrete bits and process it using discrete neurons, and presumably the discrete matter in my brain creates the conscious experience of seeing the image, it doesn’t feel quantized or discrete in any way. The experiences are always continuous
* Even though the experience doesn’t seem to follow the physical nature of the matter that apparently creates it, it seems like consciousness needs to be a physical phenomenon (at least for any useful definition of “physical”.) Physical light hits my physical eyes that create physical electrical potential pulses in my nerves in my brain where I become consciously aware of what I saw. And then at some point pulses travel out of my brain and into muscles and cause me to interact with the physical world (whether through movement or typing or speaking, etc). It seems like it must form a continuous physical loop. Physical information comes in, I’m consciously aware of it, and information from my consciousness can travel out along physical paths and interact with the world. For example, I can describe a conscious memory, or my conscious thoughts can affect my actions, etc.
* The information transmitted by neurons is largely encoded by their physical location or geometry. If neurons travel to the visual part of my brain, the information they carry will be interpreted as sight, and there’s no physical difference between the neuron attached to a red cone or a blue cone in my eye, except for the point where they make that connection. To put it another way, it’s impossible to tell whether a neuron coming from my eyes is carrying “red information” or “blue information” without seeing their connections/geometry
* I can only ever experience a moment once, at the moment I become conscious of them When I see/hear/touch in the moment I experience qualia of color/sounds/sensations. But when I recall a memory or imagine a scene or think about some object, I don’t experience it again with the same kind of vivid qualia. I’m consciously aware of it, but it’s qualitatively different from the conscious experience of the current moment. Or to put it another way, I can never get the experience of the current moment and a memory confused because they’re qualitatively different.
* At least that’s true for all ‘sensory’ qualia, but for conscious experiences of emotion like happiness or sadness, I can experience those both in the moment, and also have equally vivid conscious experiences of them when recalling a memory.
* Also, all ‘sensory’ qualia aren’t the same. Most of them are interesting because they carry no information themselves, they’re basically just labels for sensory information. Whether I experience one wavelength as qualia ‘red’ and another as the qualia ‘blue’ doesn’t matter as long as my experiences are consistent. My conscious experience could have a completely inverted spectrum compared to yours and it would be impossible to tell because the qualia that create the experience don’t carry any information themselves. And this is true for basically all experiences of any kind, sound, sight, smell, etc. Except for pain and pleasure, these two carry clear and distinct information about what information they’re encoding. In some sense, they are the information they’re encoding, and so it would be impossible for us to have inverted experiences of pain and pleasure.  


That's all the ""views"" I have on consciousness that I want to look at and challenge. But to give a couple of examples of why I like making this kind of list, here's some conclusions we can come to and some questions we can asked if we accept all these as true:

* There appears to be a problem with the physical nature of the information processing in my brain, and the experience of consciousness related to this geometry. I experience information from all of my senses at once. I have millions of sensory cells between sight (rods and cones), sound, touch, smell, etc. all of them capable of sending information into my consciousness. Even if we assume there’s some amount of processing or compression of the information traveling along neurons to wherever consciousness happens, the number of neurons that would be required to move all the information at once would take up a non-trivial amount of space if they all had to go to one place to bring information to single place creating consciousness. And there would have to be pathways of tons of neurons coming from different parts of the brain with auditory/sight/smell/touch/etc. All going to one place, and then there would have to be a lot of neurons leaving that area to take the information out to go to the rest of the body to create actions. This conflict between needing to get lots of information in and out continuously, and to create a single seamless experience of all senses at once,  seems to be in conflict with neurons carrying information based on their ‘geometry’. The denser neurons are packed together, the more difficult it is to keep information from overlapping or interfering. And there doesn’t seem to be any part of the brain that’s physically structured as a hub with lots of information coming in from lots of different sensory processing areas and lots of information leaving to create actions. And yet it seems like consciousness must be created by physical means, but there doesn’t seem to be any physical means that would allow for the kind of information movement and connections necessary to create the kind of conscious experience we know.
* Most qualia are ‘informationless’ and their specific qualities aren’t important except as neutral labels (as long as they’re consistently applied), but the qualia for pain and pleasure are completely different and they create incredibly important information in our conscious experience that would be entirely lacking otherwise. For example, I can’t imagine how we’d have any sense of meaning without pain and pleasure to create goals (or things to be avoided). Is it just a coincidence that all meaning falls along a 1-dimensional spectrum? Whereas most other experiences can have a wide variety of complexity. 
* Do we live in a 4 dimensional universe? Or is our conscious experience something that uses 4 dimensions, so we can only experience and concretely think in 4 dimensions? For example, there’s versions of string theories that predict extra dimensions (maybe lots of extra dimensions) and maybe we just can’t experience them because consciousness is a thing that works in 4 dimensions?",3.0
451,t3_rgd92c,CMV: an (American) president (and maybe other politicians) should be bound by their campaign promises - legally.,"Looking a Joe Biden, during his campaign he promised a $10,000 reduction in student loan debt for everyone with student loan debt, and additional forgiveness for students from public schools from families with less than $125,000 of income. Neither of these things have happened, or any progress towards these promises planned.

What I *think* should happen: a candidate registers their Platform (all the things they say they will do) with the Congress, and 12 months after taking office (or 15, maybe 18.. Washington is slow) the President is eligible for a *recall*. If recalled by the congress, the VP steps in, and has a similar time horizon for starting efforts to implementing the promises that the former president was elected on but didn’t follow through with. 

But how is the start of effort defined? For me it is drafting a bill or executive order for the proposal (depending on whether a legislative change is required or not), and submitting the document for consideration or execution.

460,t3_rg8hcm,CMV: perception should be part of Dexterity in most tabletop RPGs.,"Obviously this doesn't apply to games where it's reasonable to have it be a minor standalone attribute/advantage, like GURPS (though of course it should be taken out of IQ) or where it's actually a super important attribute like In Nomine.

But most RPGs (especially D&amp;D, which is the majority of RPGs by itself) put perception into Wisdom for some reason.  This is silly on a number of levels.

First, who should be good at hearing a whisper or spotting a faraway caravan - the wise monk or the dextrous rogue?  Are scouts more likely to be lithe or to have willpower?

Second, it's totally obvious how perception would be crucial to dexterity, you would be clumsy if you don't detect the world as well, and you would be more agile if you saw obstacles earlier.

Third, http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0218.html
Most games have either lesser age penalties to wisdom than to other attributes, or have bonuses to wisdom with age (which if inaccurate at least matches a stereotype).  But nobody believes old people should have good hearing and vision as a group.

So yeah, make perception its own thing if a game easily supports that, or subsume it into Dex if not.  D&amp;D certainly doesn't need more attributes (comeliness I'm looking at you) and Dexterity is the obvious place to put perception.

462,t3_rg4ttl,CMV: Mythic Fantasy Role-Playing Game (MYFAROG) is not inherently racist (anymore).,"Hello, I am a table top role playing game enthusiast, my preferred system to play is MYFAROG by Varg Vikernes. Most people will not touch the game for its reputation for being “racist”.

I believe most of the criticism of the game is because of the author. Varg Vikernes is a notorious figure in the Norwegian black metal scene who is a convicted murderer and arsonist who also espouses far right (neo-nazi, white supremacist, antisemitic) views. For this, most people will not touch the game and even forbid the discussion on forums on that principle alone.

Let me preface by saying that I do NOT believe in any form of racial supremacy. There is no “master race”. Each race may have minor differences between each other that make them more suitable for different climates, but that does not make one inherently superior to another.

I understand that someone may morally be unable to support something, but I believe the game has shed some of its bad reputation though most people have already condemned it.

In earlier editions (up to 2.7), I can see some examples where one may consider the game racist. I will paraphrase, but I recall something along the lines of “the fairer and blonder the person the more they are favored by the gods.” There also existed “Khemetians” (also described as “foreigner” who are analogues for ancient Egyptians, ancient Sumerians and modern day Arabs. These are seen as less favorable to the gods. And the “Arbî” (also described as “weakling” or “darkling”) who were analogues for sub Saharan Africans who are seen as unfavorable to the gods.

For this I can see their argument of racism, however from version 3.0 onwards, things changed a bit. The Khemetian and Arbî races disappeared. In its place you have “lesser men” which are described as mixed race which has a variety of appearances including fair skin, blond hair and blue eyes. If the game was now still horribly racist, why can a fair skinned, blond haired blue eyed character be considered “lesser”? I will add that the statement that blond haired blue eyed people are more favored by the gods I mentioned earlier is nowhere to be found in books 3.0 onwards.

Also very simply, if the game was a racist manifesto, why would Amazon sell it? If it was so bad they would have banned it from their platform wouldn’t they? They have banned far right material in the past. Why would this be any different if it was?

Other issues included is the treatment of homosexual characters, which is based upon the accounts of how they were treated in Tacitus’ Germania. It’s simply based off of how back in ancient times how homosexual people were treated. Does that mean it’s the right thing to do today? Certainly not, it’s simply trying to be historically accurate. This part of the lore of the game can be overlooked if the mythmaster (the term used for the gamemaster in this system) chooses to do so.

Is this game only supposed to be played by straight white people? Absolutely not, any person can play the game. Any man or woman of any I’ve watched recorded MYFAROG games played and run by a man named Ehsan Hussain who is a Muslim and they accepted him as a player. My current player group has one player who describes themselves as a “femboy” (I have proof if you’d like to see), their Twitter profile contains the trans flag in their profile description so I am unsure if they are in the process of transitioning or what, but nevertheless they portray themselves in that manner. I don’t necessarily agree with it, but I will never cast them out of my group because of it.

So that being said, try and change my view.",0.0
463,t3_rg4bg5,CMV: Door delivery of items bought online should be phased out,"I believe that to the door delivery of items for example purchased on amazon should not be delivered to your house but instead a local pickup location unless it is small enough to fit in your mailbox.

This is for numerous reasons. I am from Sweden where up until recently home delivery was unheard of. Instead we went to a pickup location, which usually was located at the local supermarket or corner shop close by. This worked well and is still my preferred delivery option. But recently home delivery has been introduced and with it a lot of issues have come. I know plenty of people who have become victims to the porch pirates and personally packages delivered to the dorr are in far worse shape, often heavily dented or sometimes torn.
But also for the reson that it is more environmentally sustainable to not have to drive the packages to the door but instead drive them to a location that you normally visit either way.

I understand that some people want to have their package delivered to them as they are unable to leave their house or some other reason. So I am not for a complete ban. Just that maybe the norm once again becomes that you pick up packages centrally.

Edit : I have realised that it is highly area dependent on what is better. For some areas having a pickup location would be worse and I understand that now. But I still think a wider adoption of pickup would be beneficial, at least in densely populated ares",0.0
464,t3_rg1bmg,CMV: I think it's ok to like tasteless media/art.,"I've been really conflicted on this, and wanted some discussion to perhaps tip me over. I don't feel too strongly about either side yet, but currently I feel it's fine to enjoy art/media that others may find disgusting or distasteful.

For my example, I will be using Japanese media, anime. Although I take this stance with all forms of art/media. There is a recent anime airing called Mushoku Tensei. 

**THERE ARE SPOILERS INCOMING ABOUT THIS ANIME IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT**

The controversary surrounding it is that essentially a 40 year old man has been reincarnated into a fantasy world as a baby (who eventually grows up). Currently in the anime, he is 13 years old and exhibits a lot of pervy traits towards the girls in the series. There are a couple scenes of him straight up sexually harassing (some sexual assaulting's as well) these underaged girls. It's also played off as ""humor"" and there's really no consequences for the main character due to these actions. I think this downplays sexual assault/harassment which is really not good or tasteful at all in my opinion.

I'm unsure of the age of the girls in the series, but they are clearly underaged in Western culture. The most recent episode, the main character (40 in a 13 year old body) has sex with one of the girls, who is 15. Throughout the series, he occasionally sexually harasses her/tells her he's stopping himself from doing more dirty things. This is most definitely the definition of grooming an underaged girl. The sex was initiated and ""consensual"" by the girl, but I view it as statutory rape and grooming. Die hard fans will try to convince themselves that the guy isn't ""mentally"" 40 so it's ok. But, I'm telling you like it is, and I certainly believe it was rape and grooming because the dude is literally 40 years old.


BUT. Despite the literal rape, grooming, and sexual assaults of underage girls, I still really enjoy the anime. It's actually one of my favorites. The world building, art, story, animation, music, all of it is top tier in my opinion. Of course, I'm really disgusted by those particular scenes in the anime, but I genuinely think I can enjoy the show as a whole even with those scenes in. I didn't enjoy those scenes, but I think its ok to consume those scenes and enjoy the rest.

Other pieces of media that people may find tasteless might be Lolita and Towelhead (I'm talking about the books, not movies). Both of these deal with sexual assault/rape of underaged girls. I was uncomfortable reading both, but they were *good* stories (Towelhead is a little debatable, but I digress). 

Of course, there are also graphic depictions of rape in lots historical art. 

Another distasteful topic may be racism. Huckleberry Finn could be an example of a book that uses racist language in a vacuum (of course, it could be argued for the period, it could also be argued the book is actually anti-racist). Many of Quentin Tarantino's films use racist language, some may even say in a distasteful way. 12 Years a Slave literally depicts racism (though, unlike Mushoku Tensei, I think 12YaS generally does not downplay racism, whereas MT downplays sexual assault).

I think to put it into words, as long as the art itself isn't hurting anyone (snuff films, actual rape clips, actual CP), I think it's ok to consume it. Of course, my biggest issue with this stance is that I'm scared these pieces of media can propagate rape culture, enable pedophiles, enable racism, etc. But another part of me feels like its wrong to censor art.

Maybe a comparison is you have freedom of speech (to say racist, sexist, etc things), but that doesn't mean you're free from consequence. Maybe in the same way, you're free to enjoy these arts, but that doesn't mean you're free from people viewing you as a racist, rapist, pedophile, etc.

An extreme point of view may be like if someone likes watching racist KKK videos. Just preaching racist stuff, not hurting anyone. Obviously I would judge them as being a racist for enjoying that media, but I guess technically it's still *art* and *media*. In the same way, I suppose people could view me as a rapist/pedophile for enjoying a show that depicts these things. So you can see why I'm conflicted, because I'm definitely not either, and don't want to be labeled as either. But genuinely all the other parts of the show are very enjoyable. Basically very conflicted. Can I or can I not enjoy this anime?",18.0

Money can fix poverty, homelessness, and a plethora of other things but what happens when a person is too far gone that money can't save them?

Incurable Mental illness? Permanent disability? Terminal Illness? These are things money cannot fix. Throwing hundreds yearly at prescription pills and surgeries isn't going to fix it.

There comes a time when people with one of these 3 conditions I mentioned have to choose between physical suffering or death as an instant cure to their suffering. I am glad lots of hospitals have assisted suicide stations which is basically Euthanasia.

I see these stations as more of an instant cure to their suffering that medicine can't provide.

Almost everyday she does something horrible to me. It use to be she'd get drunk blame me for something I didn't do (like taking her phone when she or one of her friends moved it and she can't immediately find it) throw a fit but apologize and try to make it right. But the whole apologizing and trying to make it right part went by the wayside a bit ago and she started going out of her way to hurt me for reasons I still don't fucking understand and surprise surprise I stopped being nice to her and giving her any consideration (like being quiet in the morning or letting her use my stuff that would be reasonable for a roommate to use) this of course made her act like more of a bitch and act like I was being the unreasonable one.

My response is perfectly acceptable but more to the point of this CMV, how many ""nice guy TM"" accusations from girls is this kind insane shit? Like if someone is nice to them and you're a bitch to them yeah they are going to get upset and do something not nice depending on how much of a bitch you are they might even fully snap and do something criminal, while I don't think a criminal response is acceptable pretty much anything legal that's not nice is. It doesn't make someone a ""Nice guy TM"" if they were nice and you're mean to them and they stop being nice, it makes them a fucking human being who get understandably upset when they are trying to be nice to someone who ends up just shitting all over them. 

If a guy holds the door open once, asks you out and you politely decline and they throw a fit that's one thing but I don't think that kind of circumstance is the reality of the situation in the majority of cases. I think most of them is the guy trying to be nice, the girl shitting on them and then when they react like a human would the girl then shits on them some more by using their being upset as kind of bullshit proof they were secretly an asshole... it's perfectly acceptable to be an asshole to someone who has treated you like shit it doesn't mean you're not a nice person nor does it mean you weren't genuinely trying to be nice.",30.0

470,t3_rfup9o,CMV: It is mostly a waste of money to cook an expensive cut of steak to well done.,"The science is simple: Heat pushes out the moisture and fat that makes up most of the flavor in the meat. You can cook a steak without these natural flavors to well done and it would taste similar. This is physics, even the best, most patient chef (or arrogant consumer who assumes they know better than food scientists and physicists who studied for many years) can't defy the laws of science. 

No, even if you cook it on insanely low heat, in order for all of the meat to reach an internal temperature of 160 Fahrenheit, the temperature needed for well done, most of the moisture and fat goes away, and there is no conventional way that doesn't require a ton of time or money to retain the juice and the fat. If you cook on low heat, the steak also wouldn't have a nice crust.

You might say: but I ordered a well done steak and it is juicy! The restaurant probably injected butter and sauces into the steak to make up for the significant loss of flavor. In this case, you can do the same with a cheaper cut and the taste would be very similar. No need to pay extra money for things you wouldn't even taste anyways. 

But what happens when you try to inject the juice and fat back to the steak? The flavor will be quite uneven, and will be much firmer and different from the soft, melty and tender flavor you get when the moisture and fat is merged with the steak instead of artificially mixed together, which doesn't achieve the same effect. You can also buy high-grade steak fat (even the fat found in wagyu) for a relatively cheap price, if you want to simulate the injected flavor restaurants give you when you ask for a ""juicy well done"" steak. 

But what about a very fatty cut like wagyu? It will taste the same as an average steak cooked to rare or medium rare, and most of the delicious melty flavor is lost. You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars to get the same flavor you can get by cooking a 10 dollar steak to another doneness. The structure of the meat also makes it much harder to restore the spongy tenderness through injecting the fat back. 

But what about steak safety, aren't rare steaks raw and dangerous? Scientific research has shown that bacteria and pathogens don't live inside beef muscle fibers.  Most experiments found that any bacteria in rare steak is never on the inside, and the bacteria on the surface came from contaminated tongs, not the lack of cooking. A rare hamburger doesn't work because the outside of the ground meat is on the inside, so it is quite dangerous.

I'm not against anyone who want their steaks well done, for whatever reason. And I know things are not a waste of money when people enjoy it, but there is no point in spending any extra money when the taste and enjoyment would be mostly the same in the end.",24.0
471,t3_rftamt,"CMV: The idea that Jupiter ""protects"" earth from dangerous asteroids/comets is bullshit","This is another one of those ""I know I know I'm wrong, I just need can't convince myself"" posts.

I've heard many times over my life the idea that Jupiter protects Earth from dangerous objects, by sucking them in/diverting them with it's own massive gravitational pull, with the most common example being [the Shoemaker-Levy 9 Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9). So far, I'd considered this to be some kind of popular myth, since I have never been able to make sense of it, until recently, when one of my teachers in my university's astronomy class mentionned it.

# Why I think it makes no sense:

# 1. Jupiter is as likely to divert objects away from earth as towards it.

There is no reason why Jupiter's gravity would have a preference for any direction away from Earth. The chances of deflecting objects away from earth should be exactly the same as deflecting objects towards Earth. Assuming objects enter Jupiter's sphere of influence from random directions and with random speeds which is an ok assumption considering my prior knowledge.

Let T be the set of all possible trajectories any object can take while moving about the solar system, with the condition that they cross Jupiter's orbit. Let Te be a subset of T containing all the trajectories that collide with Earth. Let P be the probability that any given trajectory is part of that subset. We can find P = (size of Te)/(size of T).

Let's consider the probability of any object being diverted away from Earth. We find that such an event requires the object to be headed towards earth (probability P), and then being diverted to another trajectory that doesn't collide with earth (probability 1-P), so we find a combined probability of (P)\*(1-P).

Now, the probability of an object being diverted towards Earth. We need the object to be on a trajectory that will not collide with earth (probabilty 1-P), and then it being diverted on a trajectory that will (probability P). So for combined odds of (1-P)\*(P).

Whatever the value of P, (1-P)\*(P)=(P)\*(1-P), because of commutativity. Q.E.D.

This however assumes that there is no complex astrodynamic process which makes objects more likely to enter Jupiter's sphere of influence from a certain direction. If objects did approach jupiter more often from a certain point, they could leave more often towards a certain direction, however, this wouldn't ""protect"" Earth because:

# 2. Even if objects were more likely to approach jupiter from a certain direction, they wouldn't bemore likely to be ejected towards the Earth.

Let's say such a process exists, if for example, mars often redirects asteroids radially outwards, away from the sun, we find that that the radial direction needs to be the same wherever Jupiter is in it's orbit.

In this case, we find that the increased density of asteroids must always come from ""inwards"". Any such astrodynamic process would be radially symetrical, there can't be a process that consistently puts asteroids on a trajectory where they come close to jupiter, with the asteroids coming from betelgeuse's direction.

This means in this scenario, the only variable that dictates any body's escape trajectory is their relative position. If we use again the radially outwards example, any object passing ""in front"" of jupiter would escape jupiter moving ""backwards"", and any object passing ""behind"" Jupiter would escape moving ""forwards"".

Now, assuming the density of asteroids in the asteroid belt if the same in any quadrant of the solar system, (I couldn't find any research that explicitely backs up my claim, however from [available data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt#/media/File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png) and common sense, that seems be the case) We reach the conclusion that if a process exists that puts objects consistently on a course to cross Jupiter's orbit, it can't make more objects pass ""in front"" than ""behind"" Jupiter.

This means any process that makes asteroids more likely to enter jupiter's vicinity from a certain angle won't make their escape trajectory consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR, We hear often that Jupiter protects the earth from dangerous asteroids. However, Jupiter affects the orbits of objects in the solar system much more randomly, there is no reason to believe there is any preference for trajectories that won't colide with Earth.",12.0

477,t3_rfkb63,CMV: Gift giving as an act of love is consumerist nonsense,"I've made the title deliberately inflammatory.

I've been reading about languages of love, namely:

* Words of affirmation.
* Quality time.
* Physical touch.
* Acts of service.
* Receiving gifts.

The first 4 come across as thoughtful, loving things. My wife's family treats gift giving as a measure of love. Their attitude is that the more expensive your gift the more love you have for them. I've literally heard them complain about how someone's gift was cheap within earshot of me.

It feels like a bastardization of the concept of gift giving as acts of love, but I don't think my in laws are outliers when it comes to using the monetary value of a gift as a measure of your love.

I also don't particularly like holidays being treated like a commercial enterprise instead of it being time to connect with loved ones.

I don't want to feel like this because I love my wife and gift giving seems important to her.  I also have a feeling that my attitude towards gift giving comes from my working class upbringing where my family placed a lot of value in acts of service, and my general dislike of public displays of wealth.

**EDIT: I think I made a very poor OP**

I 100% agree with thoughtful personalized gifts as acts of love because it shows that the person cares. But, the love here comes from the thoughtfulness, not the monetary value.

My argument comes from folks who treat gift giving as:

1. An obligation because the other person gave you a gift too
2. A measuring contest of equating value to love

I see this being especially true around Christmas.

The reason I want my V changed is because we're shopping for christmas for my in-laws, extended family, and their family friends. My wife keeps making arguments like:

* They will think this is too cheap
* They gave us something of X value, so we have to buy something that is at least 1.1X

It's gift giving treated like a consumerist sport that I disagree with. I don't fight it because we have enough disposable income, but I feel like it's become a source of stress for my wife, which I don't like.

My thesis is that this attitude is not out of the ordinary in our consumerist culture, and it's reducing what should have been thoughtful acts of love into a contest.",1.0

The father called 911 and told them he thought his kid was the shooter. This shows a willingness to cooperate with police. 

Reports that they ""fled"" are overblown. They drive 18 miles away, and claim to have got multiple deaths threats. Is it a bad look? Sure. Does it mean they're guilty? nope. 

There's no law requiring them to keep the gun out of reach. While it's smart to lock up your weapons, there's no law that I'm aware of which requires it. That's what personal defense weapons are for. You can sleep with a gun under your pillow if you want.

483,t3_rffzva,CMV: Max Verstappen's Formula 1 victory in Abu Dhabi was entirely legitimate,"I'm British and holy hell was there an outcry of anger yesterday when a series of events contrived to hand Max Verstappen victory and the World Championship over Lewis Hamilton in the final race of the season.

**Skip this wall of text if you're familiar with what happened.**

For those of you that don't follow Formula 1, some context. Yesterday was the final race in the Formula 1 World Championship and was the most exciting conclusion to a season since at least 2008. All year 2 drivers have been neck and neck, the young pretender Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, 7 time world champion and one of the greatest drivers of all time. For much of the season Verstappen had the faster car but a mixture of Hamilton's brilliance and an improving car meant that they went into the final race tied on 369.5 points each and the final race became winner takes all. The race itself was fascinating but by the 50th lap it was clear that Hamilton was the fastest driver on the day having proved his ability overcoming a series of obstacles to hold an 11 second advantage over Verstappen.  Then an incident happened that changed the result of the race and the World Championship and will be talked about for years.

With 8 laps to go Nicholas Latifi spun off the track and crashed into a wall requiring the deployment of a safety car. Often under a safety car drivers will take the opportunity to pit and change their tyres, Hamilton opted not to, if he had Verstappen would have stayed out and taken the lead of the race, with the risk of the race finishing behind a safety car Verstappen would win the race and be World Champion. Verstappen however did pit and put on fresh 'soft' tyres, tyres that, at this point of the race gave him a significant speed advantage over Hamilton's old 'hard' tyres. There was still a lot to sort out however, normally after a crash a number of things happen, the safety car is deployed, then the car and debris is cleared, then (and this is the crucial bit) lapped cars are released to overtake cars ahead of them and the safety car so that all the cars can be in race order, only then can the race be restarted. At first it didn't seem like there would be time to release lapped cars as the priority was to restart the race, if this had happened then Verstappen would have had to get round 5 lapped cars that were between him and Hamilton, they would have had to get out of Verstappen's way but they might cost him crucial seconds to close in on Hamilton.  However, it then became apparent that there was time to release the cars in between Verstappen and Hamilton and still get in one lap of racing before the finish line, there were two things that were controversial about this, one that only the lapped cars ahead of Verstappen were released, not the ones behind him, and two, that there would normally be one lap behind the safety car after the cars were released in order to give time for these cars to close on the back of the pack for the restart.  The result was that when the safety car came in, with one lap of racing to go, Verstappen was right behind Hamilton with much faster tyres. The race restarted, Verstappen's tyre advantage allowed him to go passed Hamilton and he crossed the line first, winning the race and becoming World Champion. Hamilton and his team were not happy.

**Welcome back to those who didn't need the details of the race.**

From Hamilton and his team's perspective the race director had broken official protocol to give Verstappen the chance to win the race, given the dominance of Hamilton and his car over the previous 50 laps this seemed horribly unfair and cynical and Hamilton's team launched a series of protests that have been dismissed. My view is that the ending of the race was totally fair. Why do I think that?

1. It is entirely normal in Formula 1 for events beyond the driver's control to decide a race. It happens regularly, an engine problem, a crash, a badly timed pit stop, these are all things that drivers have no control over which effect the result of the race. Hamilton and his team knew full well that the deployment of a safety car could cost them the race, it was an issue they had been discussing over the radio prior to it actually happening. Throughout the season Verstappen had suffered his own misfortune that had cost him points, points which would have rendered a Hamilton victory irrelevant. On this occasion there is no doubt that Verstappen got incredibly lucky and that the best driver of the day didn't win, but Verstappen and his team also made a series of decisions that allowed them to exploit there luck and that's all part of the game.
2. Despite the fact the race director broke standard protocol in his decision making there are other protocols that allow him to do that. The race director is empowered to use his judgement to come to the best outcome for the race.
3. The race director's judgement was that the best outcome was to finish the race under racing conditions with the restart as standard as possible. He made decisions to bring about that best outcome, that that outcome favoured Verstappen is neither here nor there, if he had made different decisions he would have received criticism for not allowing the race to finish in the best possible conditions.  It is reasonable to hold the view that the final race of the season should not be completed behind a safety car or with lapped cars preventing the two best drivers competing.

Everything that happened yesterday was legal, there was nothing unusual in terms of decision making, and the result was fair, change my view.

Edit: Answering a few comments I've realised what this boils down to for me, I think the race director was right to do everything he could to restart the race, I think that was better than the season ending behind a safety car and was in the interests of the sport. I think that's what you're going to have to change my mind about to get a delta.",21.0
484,t3_rffmkg,CMV: There's Only One Correct Way to See Things,"I slowly started to realize that there's one (or two) correct way of doing/seeing things. That the existence of differences is not a healthy thing, it only breeds more conflicts between people, which means people with a lot of differences cannot coexist (unless they are forced to). This includes religions, ideologies, how society should be, politics. One side will always want to be in charge, forcing their way. Diversity is not a strength

Examples: 

Rights and lefties in the US: where one side is supporting gay rights, trans rights, teaching kids about sexual orientation while the other side is against all of it. How many stories of family members stooped talking to a relative because they were homophobic? Isn't this a sign that they can't coexist? One of them is trying to force their way of seeing things on everyone to accept it (even if it was through legal ways).

Religion/athiest differences: which include the differences within the same religion (branches). Whoever in the government from a branch would be the dominant side and other religions or branches may get discriminated against. The government could not allow for any conflicts, but in the society itself people may not accept one another. 

A kid should have a father &amp; mother: One side is seeing that this is the right way for a kid to grow up, while the other side sees no problem with two dads or moms or single parents. This brings me to the last example.

A man &amp; woman: One side sees that a man/woman should do certain things to be a man/woman in order for society to function in the right way. like dress &amp; behavior. While the other side doesn't care about what a man/woman should do to be called a man/woman. Feminized men for example, one side is accepting while the other refuses it.

These are just examples that I saw over twitter recently but there are more differences.

We all know how bad the government of n.Korea, but one of the things they do is that they keep their people having one way of seeing things and not allow outside ideas, mindset or anything to disrupt them (Hello *Big Brother1984*)  and make a change. So if it's a religion, they would have one religion only, so people won't have any conflicts between themselves.

I know that humans should develop to be better and accept differences, but that won't happen when the core of their differences tells them to not accept the other side differences. There is always going to be two sides wanting to dominate the other.",0.0
485,t3_rfe7at,CMV: Alcohol should become illegal.,"I'm aware that enforcing such a law would prove difficult, but let's talk about why it's worth going through the effort of doing it regardless.

* **Health consequences:** this one should be a no-brainer. Alcohol causes a large number of diseases including liver cirrhosis, acute and chronic pancreatitis, heart disease, dementia, peripheral neuropathy (nerve disease) among others. In addition, alcohol causes several different types of cancer including liver cancer, esophageal cancer, oral cancer, and is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.
* **Burden on health care system and tax dollars:** this point ties in with the previous point, but I think it deserves mentioning of its own. The most common cause of liver cirrhosis in the West is alcoholic liver disease. These patients require costly health-care for a variety of conditions, rehabilitation, possibly surgery for liver transplantation etc.
* **Road traffic accidents:** we always hear that one story every now and again, how someone's loved one was killed due to a drunk driver. Obviously, accidents would still happen, but access to alcohol makes these kinds of accidents much more likely and more often.
* **Domestic violence and abuse:** alcohol is often an accompanying and catalyzing factor for many cases of domestic violence.
* **Rape:** I've known several people who had been out clubbing or going to a bar, only to wake up the next morning with someone they did not know at all. Alcohol can severely impair proper decision making and can leave one completely incapacitated and open to sexual assault and rape (both women and men included).
* **General violence:** alcohol acts as a catalyst to violence in general regardless of the context. Many times a boys night out can start out friendly and by the end of the night someone might have had their head smashed on the concrete after getting knocked out. Similarly, alcohol increases the capacity for violence between different people sitting in a bar or a club or otherwise, regardless of how petty the reason may be.
* **Lost potential:** Alcoholic people become inactive members of society who no longer contribute due to both their addiction and their health condition. Therefore, alcohol related diseases not only burden our healthcare system and economy, they also take away individuals who would've been otherwise productive and contributing by having jobs and paying taxes.

I could go on and on, but I'll leave it here as I think my point is clear. I'd like to answer some possible counter arguments:

*Alcohol can also be beneficial. For example, alcohol can help a shy person be more open and social. Alcohol acts as a social lubricant that can help bring people together or provide a more friendly atmosphere in the context of social events.*

→ Obviously, alcohol can have some benefits. There are few things in life that are 100% negative and disadvantageous. However, alcohol no longer has any sort of health benefit (in the past, a glass of wine was thought to be good for you, but this is no longer the case and recent data has shown that zero alcohol is better than any alcohol). Furthermore, even though alcohol may have some benefits as listed above, these are unbelievably outweighed by the negative effects and disadvantages that alcohol brings with it, not to mention the risk of addiction.

This is a major point that I think will be brought up so I'll answer it off the bat:

*Well, alcohol was made illegal before, how do you think that helped in fixing the problem? The Prohibition failed miserably, and alcohol was just consumed in secret and was bought and sold on the black market.*

→ For sure, the process of criminalizing alcohol is bound to be fraught with difficulties. I am aware that the Prohibition was not effective for many reasons, one of which is that half of the population carried on drinking regardless. However, I think there's room for improvement. We simply need to brainstorm and put our minds together on how to enforce this law. For example, cocaine and heroin are both illegal in most Western countries. It's still incredibly difficult to maintain this illegal status. Cartels and gangs in Mexico exist due to the sole fact that these drugs are illegal. However, the benefit is that we as a society, the vast majority of us, do not lose any sleep over cocaine or heroine, because they are simply beyond our access. Of course, if you try to get your hands on these drugs, you can. But you have to go the extra mile. You have to go to shady places and meet shady people. It's not as easy as walking to the store to buy a beer. So yes, criminalizing alcohol is bound to be difficult both in legislation and in enforcement. But I think in the long run, it's worth it and it's going to pay off.

*Criminalizing drugs has never helped. It never has, and never will.*

→ I wholeheartedly disagree with this comment. I'll reiterate what I mentioned in the previous point: the vast majority of us don't try cocaine and heroin for a reason. It's hard to get. It's expensive. It's illegal. Yet we don't lose any sleep over it our lost cocaine and heroin highs. Criminalizing alcohol would greatly limit access to it. Yes, people would still bypass the barrier and do it somehow, somewhere. But the vast majority (with due time) would not actively seek access to it, just as the vast majority do not actively seek access to cocaine and heroin. Alcohol consumption would become taboo. And with that, all of the negative consequences of its consumption would begin to dwindle and disappear.

*You can consume alcohol responsibly without having to suffer all of the consequences that you mentioned.*

*→* Good in theory, not so good in practice. Alcohol is a drug that has a great risk of addiction. Even if you don't become addicted right now, you might become addicted in the future. For every person who's capable of consuming alcohol responsibly, there's another whose life becomes ruined. Lastly, the negative consequences of alcohol do not affect the person alone, they extend to affect society as a whole.",0.0

Not saying women and men can’t be decent, and civil to one another. I just have seen that when men and women are platonic “friends” one party always wants more in some level.


Someone will always want more in terms of a more emotional or physical relationship. I hold this view because I’ve never been friends with someone of the opposite gender without either catching feelings or friendzoning them because they wanted more. It makes it difficult to be just friends so I hold this belief from personal experience. I’m open to changing my mind, and *want* to, but it feels like all these “friendships” falls into this dichotomy. 

I’m open to what other people think, and this does largely apply to heterosexual people, but I’m curious how differently sexually oriented people view this issue as well.

489,t3_rfcl38,"CMV: If determinism is true, then no person deserves more or less happiness than others on basis of their actions","This is an offshoot of a couple of discussions I've had in r/askphilosophy about free will and determinism. 

If we assume that determinism is true (i.e., everything that happens is inevitable), it seems to me self-evident that _it must never be a goal in itself to punish anyone for their behaviour_. More generally, no one ever _deserves_ more or less happiness as a result of their behaviour. 

This is obvious to me because ""bad"" people were always destined to be bad and ""good"" people were always destined to be good. Even if you go with the compatibilist view that determined people still have ""free will"", the fact remains that they could not have done otherwise. 

This does not mean that no one should ever be punished or rewarded. Punishment and reward can sometimes be moral _if it can be reasonably expected to improve future behaviour_. People respond deterministically to external events, so if we put murderers in prison, it will deter _at least some_ would-be murderers from committing muder. But punishment must never be a goal in itself. 

This runs counter to some of our moral intuitions, and that is to be expected. I take it for granted that moral intuitions are not automatically right; they are merely a starting point.

It is their education or the environment that they are raised in.","The more I think about this the more uncomfortable I am with this idea, so please change my mind. Although I actively wants my mind to be changed, please give rational justification on why my opinion is false.

So there is a philosophical idea called *determinism*. It basically states that all events, including moral choices and human behaviors, are *completely* determined by previous existing cause (at least that is what it is according to Wikipedia, correct me if I am wrong).

The most basic idea is that, at least how I like to think about it, is that if was born as Hitler and experienced the exact same experience Hitler has, I would have become Hitler. There is nothing particularly special between my ""soul"" with Hitler's ""soul"". It is what our experience defined who we are.

The problem I have with this idea is that there is no way to define the liability of one's action with determinism is true. To some extend, determinism makes it so that no one actually has free-will. We might *think* we have free-will, but our way to rationalize our ideas and our motives etc are all pre-determined by the environment.

For example, it is *technically* not a mentally-ill person to accidentally kill someone as they are born with mental-illness that they cannot control. It is also not the Karen who is not willing to wear a mask 's fault as she simply uneducated and raised in an environment that repeatedly feeds her the information that ""I am entitled for my freedom"". It is ALSO, as radical as this might sound, not Hitler's fault as he is simply raised in such a radical environment that ultimately lead him to such radical believe.

This is very disturbing because this makes it very hard to make anyone liable for their actions, so anyone can get away would anything and it is technically not their fault, as they do not have free will. I know this sounds ridiculous but I don't have a good way to refute this. Also I don't accept answers like ""of course we have free will"", unless you can provide non-trivial evidence on why we have free will I am not accepting free-will as an argument, as determinism is based on the fact that we don't have free will.

EDIT: someone might misunderstand my point. My point isn't that the way you raised is the only factor that affects your personality and behavior, is that if you traced all the factors that affect your personality and behaviors, you will ultimately reached the conclusion that those factors are external and out of one's control. If some factors seems like they are internal, the causes of *that* factor will be external.",0.0

493,t3_rf31n8,CMV: Parents who expect obedience from their adult offspring are unreasonable.,"Adults should be able to think for themselves, so one who is obedient to their parents would be a puppet of some sort. Once a person reaches adulthood, they will have to find their own path.

In East Asian culture, adults are still expected to be obedient to their parents, which strikes me as weird. When it comes to making decisions, I see my parents as more like business partners. I will consider their logic, but I ultimately have the final call.

At any rate, the term ""obedience"" when describing someone in their adulthood seems very peculiar. This might be more widespread in East Asian societies, but in the western hemisphere, individualism takes hold. in China, there was a philosopher by the name of Confucius whose ideologies influenced Chinese culture greatly.   Confucianism's guiding principle is social harmony through the means of the cultivation of virtues, filial piety, and being a moral person. This includes establishing a rigid social hierarchy, in which parents usually hold authoritative power over their offspring.

Historically, in China, a large and dense population required strict governance. People were in poor agrarian households and maintaining communal order was a way of survival. From a pragmatic standpoint, Confucianism was necessary in the context of how Chinese societies were back in the day. There were no social or financial safety net such as retirement and Medicaid, so one's offspring would need to care for their elderly parents. This cycle continues and societies were maintained and sustained for centuries.

However, with the Asian diaspora, ones who were born and raised in a western country, often find themselves struggling to accept this tradition. Since they have been surrounded by Westerners since birth, they come to realize the effects of individualism. Their western peers typically have more freedom, both financially and socially. This creates a more envious outlook in life, and as they become more educated, especially through an education system that prioritizes critical and free thinking, they start to challenge Eastern traditions.

As I start to analyze Confucianism more, it is apparent its principles are outdated to people who are living in Western countries.",31.0

My current view is the opposite. I currently believe that not doing so treats the nazis with a reference they don't deserve, and that doing so (especially the fetish aspect) is exactly appropriate because it's precisely what they would have hated.

497,t3_rf01oz,"CMV: Human suffering is not primarily caused by free will, or any other human concept","One similarity I've noticed across many religions, regardless of whether they believe in one god, multiple gods, or no gods, is the belief that the root cause of suffering ultimately comes from within. In Buddhism, it's said that desire is the source of all suffering. In most denominations of Christianity, it's said that suffering exists because the Christian God gives humans free will to commit sins, which leads to bad things happening. The near-universal message seems to be that if everyone follows the correct moral code, believes the right things, and do good in this world, then all human suffering will cease to exist. But if you look at the facts, it seems like that's not true. 

If you look at the most common causes of death throughout history, such as plagues, famine, drought, and other natural disasters, it's apparent that there was very little the people could do to prevent it from happening. Wars could be very destructive, but major wars are actually relatively rare compared to all the other disasters which cause mass death and suffering. Yes, I am aware that some of the deadliest epidemics and famines throughout history were at least partially caused by human actions (Black Death, Smallpox epidemics in the Americas, etc), but the fact of the matter is, if the victims hadn't died from the those disasters, they probably would have lived long enough to die painfully from any number of mundane natural causes. 

This trend continues into the modern day, when illnesses such as cancer and Alzheimer's which kill millions, and there's very little we humans can do to alleviate the suffering. Sure, global warming and environmental pollution claim their share of casualties from disasters. Yet, there are countless other natural disasters which are mostly unaffected by human actions, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 

To me, it seems that as long as humans have the biological ability to feel pain, and the psychological ability to form bonds with other humans, there will be suffering. I don't know if it's caused by a malevolent supernatural deity or the fundamental laws of physics, and whether that distinction matters at all is another discussion.",9.0
498,t3_rezu80,"CMV: Women being ""barefoot and pregnant"" isn't a bad thing.","Being ""barefoot and pregnant"" refers to SAHM's (stay-at-home moms) who don't leave the house (hence why barefoot) and are often-times pregnant because husband presumably doesn't use birth control, wants to have a lot of kids, and/or some other reason. Feminazis use this to degrade SAHM's who choose to have lots of children.   


My justifications for my opinion are that if most women enjoy their children, why wouldn't they want to be with them all of the time? Another reason of mine is that men make more money in the workforce than women (not via wage gap, read further), and that alternatives can impact the health of the children.   


***If most women enjoy their children, why wouldn't they want to be with them all of the time?:***  
Assuming a woman doesn't have some kind of dream or passion in the workforce (which is ok), they should not be shunned for being SAHMs and having as many kids as the husband and her want. My personal opinion is that not having such passion reveals the true passion behind her which is nurturing her offspring. This is simply human nature and has been expressed by women for 4000+ years, whereas the sexual revolution's new role for women feels forced and has only been around for 50-70 years.   


 ***Men make more money in the workforce than women.:***  
It's a biological fact that men are more physically adept than women, and we can observe this in areas such as the WNBA. The NBA and WNBA don't play by the same rules such as goal height. Why? *Because men are more physically adept than women.* This also correlates to the fact that the WNBA doesn't make nearly as much money. Gee, wonder why! Other than that, women make less money than men for practical reasons such as women needing to leave to pick up kids from school or to go watch little Timmy's soccer game, or some other child-related reason. Men don't have nearly as many responsibilities, and it reveals the biological fact that women are better nurturers than men. A wage gap has nothing to do with this either, and if it did, why would any companies hire men at all? If companies could get away with paying women less than men for the same work, *then they clearly would.*  


***The alternatives of kids being raised by their SAHM can have negative consequences on the child's health.:***  


Alternatives such as daycare, babysitters/nannies, and family members watching kids have been proven again and again to have adverse effects on children. Daycares fail to provide an infant/toddler's most crucial need for their development, *to be loved and nurtured by the same adult/pair of adults at a time.* When putting a child in daycare, you are sending your child into an environment where they are at the mercy of whoever parents the other children there, and at the mercy of the intent of the adults watching them. Not to mention, if two parents working is for money-related reasons and they send these children off to daycares, these daycares are often extremely expensive. Not to mention, your child's cries will often be ignored due to so many crying children being around for the poorly paid and trained staffers to look after. It also instills the horrible mindset that children are a ""chore"" and they need someone else to raise them. Such people should not be parents. Another thing to consider is illness runs rampant in these children's concentration camps called daycares. . There is a common proverb thrown around in America that states *""It takes an entire village to raise a child.""* Sorry for the cursing, but that's utter horseshit. It only takes two people to raise a child, a mother, and a father. It has been proven time and time again that separating children from their parents causes separation anxiety, clinginess, and depression. Being separated from your own children also has adverse effects on the parents of said children. ( [https://news.stanford.edu/2018/06/26/psychological-impact-early-life-stress-parental-separation](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/06/26/psychological-impact-early-life-stress-parental-separation/) )  I think what I said pretty much sums up my view on babysitters, nannies, and adjacent family members raising children.   


(This needs a part 2 due to length.) You may be asking, *""What does what you just said have to do with being barefoot and pregnant?""* Like I mentioned earlier, being ""barefoot and pregnant"" is just a pejorative term used by Feminzai sexual ""revolution"" radicals to shame SAHMs. Maybe the post title is bad and slightly misleading, but I think it adds some nice clickbait and shock value, so screw it.   


The reason why I am making this post is I am trying to figure out what I want in life. I want to see how my views on SAHMs can change, and maybe can be presented that working moms are better for the children, the wife, and husband, and for everyone else around them.

Well, both my parents (and a lot of the extended family) are VERY much against the Covid vaccination and after hearing them talk about it so passionately and after receiving so many different videos, articles and ""experts"" (idk) talking about how dangerous the vaccine is,  I must admit that I was (and still am) quite afraid to put it in my body.

I mean think about it, if there's such an outrage around the world and so many people are vehemently opposed to vaccination isn't it safe to assume there's at least SOME basis for it?

Just to be clear, I'm not referring to the ""they tryna chip me"" kinda folk but instead to the ones against the materials in the vaccine and how it functions in the body.

Since the vaccines dropped I've been very much on the fence and had the ""what ifs"" gnawing at my mind all along. I must admit that it has been much easier to simply stay passive and just not take the ""scary foreign stuff"".
Lately tho I've started thinking about vaccinating way more positively (it's still very much frighting to think about tho and I'm dreading every moment of it) for a plethora of reasons: health (obvious I think), social life (also pretty obvious) and job/opportunities (I fear that when it comes to promotions employers would look more favourably on those vaccinated). In addition to all of that, almost everyone around me is vaccinated (most even got their 3rd booster already) and no one I know personally (as far as I know) got any long lasting negative effects.

Here are some of the things my parents have been warning me about since I told them I might get jabbed: 
1. ""The vaccine messes with the cell's normal functions and changes the DNA which often times creates harmful mutations.""
2. ""The vaccine is built with ""spikes"" that get stuck in your blood vessels and clog them.""
3. ""The vaccines are way more dangerous than Corona itself and it is just being silenced by the media and government (specifically the health ministry)"":
 - ""causes deaths and paralysis.""
 - ""many reports of men going infertile after getting vaccinated and women having miscarriages.""
 - ""A lot of people report constant lethargy and a downward spiral in their physical abilities after getting vaccinated.""
 - ""An extremely high number of people get severe myocarditis after getting vaccinated.""
4. They told me about a case where scientists took leftover vaccines at the end of the day and analyzied it in their private labs in order to confirm there's nothing wrong with the vaccines but instead found ""foreign and unrelated materials in it"" (I believe they might have said heavy metals too).

I have been quite conflicted tho seeing most of world sway to the complete other side and I found myself slowly opening up more to the idea they might be right. It has been quite confusing though since I have a hard time believing such a strong opposition from all around the world would just be based on absolutely nothing.

Something that made it even worse: Recently at my job they took me and the other unvaccinated employees to a sort of ""show and tell"" with a doctor... Honestly all he said is pretty much what you can find in those animated 1 minute long YouTube shorts about COVID.

Then during the questions time almost every question that was brought up to him was faced with ""didn't know about that"" or for the questions that regarded hidden infortmation (a lot of the people in the crowd believed the media and government are hiding the true statistics of what the vaccine causes) he just said ""that could be true, you never know"" he also confirmed that the vaccine causes a lot of myocarditis cases but that he doesn't know the exact statistics off the top of his head.

At this point I asked if there were any experiments conducted on people who have gone through vaccination and experienced side effects, in an attempt to pin point their common traits or even pre existing conditions that could've caused that (seemed to me like it should have naturally been the first thing done when claims against the vaccine first started to arise?) to which he said he isn't aware of any such experiment, ""probably because there isn't funding"" (what..),
Wouldn't that be in the interest of the vaccine companies and health ministries around the world though? since it will help convince more people that the vaccine is safe? He had no real answer but a shrug.

He also in general agreed that it's not yet clear what are the complete side effects from the vaccine but that he'd made the decision for himself that he'd rather face them than face Corona's side effects.

Safe to say the manager got angry and no mind was changed that day.

Idk, I'm still very wary but I see almost everybody around me being completely fine and I also have a hard time believing such a huge conspiracy could be kept a secret from the general public..

On the other hand though through this entire time of being unvaccinated I was completely fine and even in better health than some of my vaccinated friends, never even needed quarantine since I was being very careful... So why would I change a ""winning recipe"" now when people tell me the ""new recipe"" might result in long term detrimental health problems?

I still think I might get vaccinated though which is exactly why I came here to try and hear the other side's POV and why you chose to do so for yourself?

Any research papers or articles you might have found helpful will be greatly appreciated.

500,t3_reycww,"CMV: I currently do not believe universal healthcare could be implemented in the United States, but I would love to.","Background: I am libertarian, slightly right-leaning. I wholeheartedly believe the government’s sole authority should be to ensure every US citizen’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I believe that there is a strong argument that having free healthcare falls under the life and pursuit of happiness arguments. I see Switzerland implementing a healthcare “security blanket,” and it seems to work, and I wonder if it would work on the much larger scale of the US, given or size and population (our bigger size leads to more infrastructure costs so find it relevant). 

This is why I do not think that the United States could not implement a similar system, and why I think it would actually be detrimental to our healthcare system. 

Facts:
Since Lyndon B Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law in 1965, Medicare price index has rose at almost twice the rate the consumer price index has. Despite not having universal healthcare, [the United States spends more on healthcare per person than comparable countries.](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries) This [article from hopkinsmedical.org](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/politicization_of_health_care_preventing_real_changes_to_out_of_control_system_researchers_suggest) describes how politicizing healthcare increases cost

Opinions (skippable)
Crony capitalism is inevitable when discussing socializing healthcare, and what should be covered would just be another tool used by Republican and Democrat parties to further divide us and radicalize their extreme supporters. This is one of the few industries you can ask the producer of the good or service what the cost is and they could theoretically reply “well, what’s your life worth?” While this obviously wouldn’t literally happen as people are not that inhumane, the understanding of that concept could lead to higher pricing of medical treatments or supplies based on a perceived threat of a medical crisis. I think United States Politicians on both sides have already displayed disregard for public safety to push their agendas, and they have absolutely shown that they are corruptible through lobbying. I think they have done a horrible job with public education and the welfare system, and I think they would do just as bad with healthcare. 

How could we properly implement a socialized healthcare without fear it’s being politicized or overpriced?",0.0

For example, do you really think if there was no Fox news and CNN, Republicans and Democrats would get along very well considering the difference in their views, and these are most the time social issues not economical.

503,t3_rexk6g,CMV: Confederate monuments and symbols should be left alone and aren’t hate,"I want to preface by saying I do believe the civil war was about slavery and that it was the wrong decision. However when it comes to monuments and symbolism I believe they should be preserved 

First off many people claim these statues were built to intimidate black people with the fact that most statues were not built until the 1900s. However I believe this is nonsense when you think of it logically. First off traditionally there were very few monuments built immediately after a person’s death. The Washington monument started construction 50 years after his death, the Jefferson monument 100 years after, even the Lincoln memorial was not built until 1914 50 years after his death, and around the time when most confederate statues went up. Makes you wonder why there are not charts showing union monuments going up

So the fact it took 50 years for statues for confederates to come up is nothing unusual. It also makes sense economically as it took 30 years for the south to recover after the war, and even the rest of the country

On top of that if the south wanted to intimidate black people why not build statues of the KKK and slaves being whipped? Black schools were horribly underfunded so how would most african americans know about generals and politicians like Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis? This also contradicts the lost cause narrative that southern states rewrote history books to whitewash the confederacy meaning these symbols are meant to intimidate black people while denying slavery or claiming slavery was not that bad? Was the south a blatantly racist society promoting white supremacy or a society denying its racism?

As for the flag itself first off the rectangular “confederate” flag was used in the civil war despite what many people say. It was originally designed by William P. Miles though it had just 7 stars instead of 13 and it was rectangular but rejected from being the national flag however it would be used by several battalions and a square version most famously used by Robert Lee. And as for its use by the KKK it wasn’t until after WWII when they appropriated it due to the association of the STATES RIGHTS PARTY or the Dixiecrats. However i don’t think that makes it a hate symbol nor does it mean anyone who uses it is a racist 

The fact is this. The statues were built to commemorate the civil war and recognize those who died during the war. There simply is no good reason to remove these statues or symbols. If someone personally thinks it’s hateful then that’s their problem. And if we are getting rid of every flag associated with the confederacy [then france better change their flag soon](https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/bonham/bonham--flags_of_louisiana_files/800px-Flag_of_Louisiana_(January_1861).svg.png)",0.0
504,t3_rewusk,CMV: I don't think there's much society can do to help incels. They have to help themselves and many seem very unwilling to,"I was reading a thread about a recent NYT 'The Daily' podcast ([https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/podcasts/the-daily/suicide-investigation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/podcasts/the-daily/suicide-investigation.html) for those interested) which touched on incels. In the comments at least one person brought up that society needs to talk about these people and how to help them, why they're like this, etc and how every time male incels are brought up it's in reference to them being dangerous or a threat.

I'm definitely not in the incel community but I feel like I'm familiar enough with it just by being an internet vet to understand &amp; speak on some of it.

These men (and some women, but mostly men) feel like they are undateable and that no one would ever find them attractive. They think they have little or no chance of ever attracting a partner and that this is often because they were dealt some bad hand of genetics or environment or some other external force.

The problems I have with the community and why I don't think society can or maybe even should help these people is because a large amount of them just straight up reject any advice on how to improve their situation. Becoming 'blackpilled' where an incel just straight up gives up hope seems to be a badge of honor in some of these communities. It's just such a stark example of the crabs in a bucket mentality, these people find each other and just pull each other down more and more until they're completely hopeless.

There are plenty things people can do to make themselves more attractive to a partner: try to take care of your mental health, try to become physically fit, 'looksmax' as they like to say in the community, get a hobby &amp; become good at something, try to become a fully self actualized person by yourself before you look for someone else to complete you, make yourself a person that could bring value to a partner's life instead of dragging them down. There's a million things.... Get a book on small talk and go practice with old ladies. The point is a lot of people in these communities don't want to hear it, they reject it completely and they meme about people saying things like this. They want society to change around them instead of vice versa. They blame women for not finding them attractive instead of themselves for not making themselves attractive to people.

Edit: Oh last minute edit that I meant to put in my OP. I think that almost anyone if they do some of the above things can find **A** partner. One problem with incels and men in general is that they are not willing to date someone *in their bracket* so to speak. Not everyone is going to be able to date a person who is perfect or even good/great in every way but that's okay. Most people are average, average people dating other average people is normal. A lot of these people would benefit greatly from lowering their expectations. 

TLDR: I don't think there's a lot society can or should do to help incels. They need to help themselves. They need to get out of these toxic communities and start working on building their life in a healthy way.",75.0
505,t3_rewdmy,CMV: I find Matt Walsh's book Johnny the Walrus transphobic and an idiotic allegory for transitioning.,"For those of you who are unaware conservative commentator Matt walsh has released a new book called Johnny the Walrus in which a kid Johnny pretends to be a walrus and people on the internet convince his Mom that he's really a walrus and needs to transition and be placed into a zoo. As anyone with a brain can see this is Walsh's clever way of making transphobia paletteable to small children. But worse then his gross attempts to indoctrinate children are the complete lies it tells about the transitioning process.

Transitioning is a process that takes years to go through it tons and tons of therapy before the topic of transitioning physically is ever brought up, and even then doctors don't really do srs surgeries on children at maximum most people get puberty blockers until there old enough to really make these decisions. This book isn't at all saying anything poignant about transitioning it's just another example of the idiotic conspiracy that trans people are out to trans your kids which is pretty ironic considering his choice to direct this message at toddlers even doing a read along",5.0

509,t3_resiba,CMV: Artificial Intelligence would be the best form of government,"Given certain goals/parameters for society such as ""Maximizing the well-being of the population"" and ""equality of opportunity"" for example, an AI ruler would be the best way to achieve those goals.I truly believe that this would be superior to all forms of government that have existed so far.

I am assuming an AI that is more intelligent (problem solving wise) and knowledgeable than the entire world population combined. I am also assuming this is possible eventually in the future.

Some of the advantages of such AI would be:

1. All actions would be purely logic driven ( Not emotional)
2. AI can't have selfish interests in mind. (Cant be bribed) Would always have the interests of the population as the priority ( goals that were previously set )
3. Human error is reduced.
4. Cognitive bias is removed from politics.
5. Power can't corrupt AI.
6. Bureaucracy is reduced.

I am also assuming that there are no bugs in the code that would make the AI act differently than it should.

Ideally this AI would be global but the same applies if its only used to rule over a single country for example.

We can also assume that this AI can the turned off at any point if voted by the majority of the population. (AI will not try to combat this)

&amp;#x200B;

**But what if the AI decides it should kill 100 people to make a million people ""better off""?**

This type of utilitarian extremes could be addressed in the initial parameters when setting up the AI. So for example, you can say that the AI should maximize well being without violating the rights of others.

**But how do we even define the initial parameters to give the AI since large groups of the population might fundamentally disagree?**

Voting is probably the best way to define the parameters.

&amp;#x200B;

**What would change my view?**

If you can show me that an AI ruler is fundamentally flawed and would not work. Or if you show me a better form of government that does not rely on an AI ruler. By ""better"" I mean one that would achieve ""goals"" as set by the population in a more efficient manner.

510,t3_reryba,cmv: There is no moral reason to not criminalize paternity fraud and mandate paternity tests at birth.,"Paternity fraud is one of the most legitimately evil things still legal almost anywhere. No man should be tricked into unwillingly raising a child that is not his own.

It seems that legally, many places are actually moving in the opposite direction on this issue, such as France banning private paternity tests. This was apparently done to stem social issues apparently coming from infidelity being exposed and resulting in the government having to support far more single mothers. 

Morally, those consequences seem far better than the reality of paternity fraud in my mind. Nobody deserves to be stuck in a relationship with a cheater, and removing the option for testing results in far more of these relationships staying together, which may result in less social upheaval, but is extremely unjust to the man in the situation. 
In addition, men who have children by affairs would also be caught by this and be on the hook to support their own child, rather than someone with no relation.

Even if the fraud were criminalized and paternity tests allowed, there would still be a stigma and implied distrust if a father insisted on one, which is why these tests should be mandated at birth. That way, the stigma would be gone, and far more of these cases would be caught.

My statement is based on realistic scenario that would be consistent with motivations of all the warring sides. For example, early in the war Stalin wanted to offer peace in exchange for concessions, but obviously Hitler was not interested in that, as his ultimate goal was total annihilation of USSR.

512,t3_rer93r,CMV: Cigarette bans like the recent New Zealand one will actually cost the public more than what it will save from healthcare costs.,"TL;DR at the bottom

Of course everyone can agree that smoking is bad for you and so is meth, cocaine etc.

I've read a lot of people using the costs on public healthcare as a reason for making, in this case, cigarettes illegal. That just doesn't make sense to me though: any prohibited substance *WILL* be supplied by organized crime, it's just the way it is.
This has several negative effects on society: when drug markets form crime goes up leading to more violence on the streets, the money that would otherwise be made through taxes (that actually offset healthcare costs a fair bit) is gone and ends up in the pockets of the worst people in society.
The result is that the government loses tax money, ends up with increased law enforcement costs, and at the end of it all people still smoke.
This is why by far the most effective policy against substance abuse will always be to educate people and let them choose, because the alternatives only cause more problems.

TL:DR: banning cigarettes (or any drug) will cost the public more than what it would get back from reduced healthcare costs because of lost tax revenue and increased law enforcement costs.


Edit: my point is if a government wants to reduce the damage to society (not just monetary costs), prohibition is the wrong way to go. Let me be clear: I am all for harm reduction and deterring use, but there are much better ways than the ""easy"" way, which is just prohibition.

Edit 2: so far I'm disappointed from these responses, I don't think anyone has gotten the point of what I'm arguing for here and some people seem to be making shit up that I straight up didn't say in the post: I'm not saying laws shouldn't exist, I'm not saying it's wrong to prohibit minors from purchasing cigarettes.

513,t3_req4bc,CMV: Gun Control in the United States is a lost cause and nothing can be done to change it.,"I feel gun control legislation in the US is a losing battle and always has been. The US lost the battle on gun control ever since the country founded independence in 1776 and the Second Amendment became the law of the land in 1791. 

Because gun legislation didn't change with the times, they are simply too accessible for anyone today to purchase without any prior training. Background checking is spotty at best depending on where you live and this comes to my next point: inconsistency. Because states differ in gun control legislation across state lines, the rules around gun ownership and conceal carry differ. The Sandy Hook school shootings always brings me back to this topic because I would have thought Americans would come together to stop this kind of violence from happening ever again. I knew school shootings happen once a week across the US, but the news and sentiment around this kind of shooting stuck with me. However, nothing really changed after all of that happened and I came to accept that the US is too stubborn to change any legislation created centuries ago, that it's ok to let kids be vulnerable to school shootings. If parents are so concerned about protecting their children, they would do everything in their power to give them the best chance of surviving the outside world from these kinds of acts. 

Nowadays, thanks to organisations like the NRA lobbying against gun control and a constitutional right that never changed with the times, gun control is simply a lost cause the American people can't fix collectively. The original context for having the Second Amendment has started to become obsolete in practice given how much has changed in 4 centuries, and gun control needs a massive overhaul to apply to today's climate and simultaneously strengthening the mental health resources and background checking systems, so people don't look to guns as their only resort. 

One thing I agree should remain is that gun ownership is necessary for specific occupations and activities that require it to protect themselves or part of surviving their environment (e.g. hunting, police, etc.).",1957.0

516,t3_renp5s,CMV: Removing someone who only consumes from the economy does not hurt the economy.,"(My point of view is specific to the claim that is made in the video. Not the moral aspect of it.)

I recently watched a Russian video that discusses why we can't just let old people die during Covid.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvQnZTo-xUc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvQnZTo-xUc)

This does not take the moral human angle of this into the equation at all. Obviously just letting old people die for the sake of the economy is extremely questionable from a moral point of view. And it is not something that I advocate for. This is merely looking at the pragmatic side of things. Would letting old people who are living off their pension die actually help or hurt the economy?

His argument is that by letting a bunch of old people die you remove the demand for all the products/services they consume. And even if they will it all to their children the products the children consume will not be the same. He gives the example of a cruise liner, 52% of their customers are pensioners. That means if a large chunk of those people died due to Covid they would simply go out of business.

Again I'm not saying we should actually do this (I keep repeating myself because I know people are going to try to straw man this point). But removing them from the economy does not actually hurt the economy. From a pragmatic point of view it helps the economy.

Why? Because production is what matters not demand.

Say you have a community with 300 people. 100 people are way too young to work and 100 people are way too old. The 100 people who are capable of working spend almost all their waking hours working on the field producing food. They can produce enough food for 300 people. The 200 young and old people are living off what the middle 100 produce. There can't be any other profession besides farmer because the 100 workers are barely producing enough as is. If you were to remove the 100 older people who are no longer producing you would reduce the amount of production required by 33%. Freeing up some of the workers to focus on other tasks such as medicine, teaching, improving infrastructure etc. As it stands the economy is stagnant.

While morally abhorrent letting people who no longer produce die would not be bad for the economy.

I've already thought about some counters that I may come across

1. The 100 people in the middle might be working to provide for their parents. If you removed their parents you could remove their incentive to work/produce.
2. Following on this incentive angle. The 100 people in the middle who are producing who are childless. Would lose the incentive to produce if they knew that once they get old nobody is going to take care of them. The reason we take care of old people is because they raised the current working generation and the next working generation may never come into fruition if we remove the ""one day I will be taken care of"" incentive.

Those are both valid arguments. Incentive is extremely important in the economy. Something socialism always fails miserably at addressing.

But again this doesn't really counter the original assertion that removing demand somehow hurts the economy.

One more counter

3) The cruise liner already spent resources to build the ships. If the people who usually can afford them die then the resources they spent would have been a waste. Waste is bad for the economy.

That is the only decent counter argument I could think of. While technically correct and a valid rebuttal. It doesn't really remove the original sentiment. Yes all those ships and all those resources spent on cruise liners would have been a waste. Just as producing 300 people worth of food when only 200 people need it (if the 100 old people suddenly died) would be a waste.

* **Any Set of Adults:** I mean that everyone that is party to the relationship is an adult^[1] at the time they become party to the relationship.

* **Consenting Adults:** I mean that every person that is party to the relationship gives their informed consent and maintains their informed consent for the duration that they are party to the relationship.

* **Ought to Be Legal:** I mean that for any relationship that meets the aforementioned conditions, there should be no law prohibiting dating, marrying, cohabitating, fucking, and so forth. Further, that any relationship that meets the aforementioned conditions should be treated with legal equality to any other relationship to the extent that is possible.^[2]

519,t3_reekn1,CMV: League of Legends has a visibility problem.,"I’ve been a Dota2 player since 2013. Many if not most of my friends play LoL, so I’ve tried to get into it many times in the past(since 2011). However, I noticed my problem with it has always been that I can’t distinguish the characters from the ground or mobs or each other.

I think it’s partially due to the artstyle(shading and border) and partially due to the game having too many human shaped characters.

So as an result, when I see an enemy player approach me in LoL, I don’t react or don’t respond correctly even if I know what skills that hero has, because it takes me a second to notice them and then even if I haven’t died, I can’t tell what hero that is so I don’t know what to do.

In the long run, this will create compiling issues where more will try to transfer and therefore fewer will be able to transfer successfully.

""crash"" means that the S&amp;P 500 must attain the value of 900 and NASDAQ 2000 just once, not that the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ must remain at these values forever. For reference, on 10 Dec. 2021, the S&amp;P 500 ~ 4710 and NASDAQ ~ 15.6K.  `My view has two reasons.` 

1. The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is canny, crafty, foxy. **It is blindingly obvious that CCP do NOT want — and will endeavor not to let — their own stock markets and economies crash.**  If Chinese stock markets crash, their citizens will fret and grouse.  Citizens can even rise up and insurrect against CCP! Foreigners will not invest in China. Foreigners and even Chinese will withdraw their investments from China. Chinese are already known to transfer their money overseas, e.g. by buying up real estate in Australia, New Zealand, Canada! Foreigners may criticize distrust China even more. Undoubtedly the CCP has nothing to gain from Chinese property companies crashing any stock market!!!

2.  CCP is exceedingly affluent! `CCP has MORE THAN enough money to pay for all these defaults!` I'm quoting merely their gold and foreign exchange reserves. ***I have not even considered their other reserves!!!! Just edit my post to add their other moneys and reserves, if you know how much and what they are.***

523,t3_re9dkm,CMV: Schools should be allowed to have guns on the campus to protect themselves against school shooters.,"USA poster here. One of the reasons why school shooters (SSs) target schools is because no one will shoot back until the cops arrive. In the time between the first shot fired by the SS and the cops arriving at the school, the SS can kill many people. If teachers or other qualified people have guns, they will be able to shoot back immediately and the SS will not want to shoot up the school because he knows that he’ll got shot at right away (I say “he” because the vast majority of SSs are male).

I understand that effective mental health resources or other counseling would help prevent such an event and I support their implementation, but we should not depend on only one method for guarding against SSs (it’s risk management). This is America, and guns will always be a part of our culture, so we should work with that, not against it. Why not let people at schools have the chance to defend themselves effectively and immediately instead of being sitting ducks?

525,t3_re8l3u,cmv: Biden isn’t doing a bad job as president,"This is an unpopular opinion, and very much so. According to 538, only 42% of the nations approves of Biden’s job. According to RCP, it’s lower. But I Stan run the minority who thinks that he’s actually doing pretty well.

First of all, one of the main arguments I hear against him from those who disapprove is that Biden said he had a COVID plan and didn’t. But thing is, he did. Get everyone vaccinated, and have people social distance and use masks. Problem is, those same people who criticize Biden’s COVID policy are the ones refusing to get vaccinated, or get masked, or social distance. Biden has a science based COVID plan, and the people criticizing his lack of a plan are the reason his plan isn’t working.

Another argument I hear from those who disapprove of Biden is inflation; this argument seems flawed in a lot of ways. Firstly, the inflation here is predictable and can be simply explained through supply and demand; during COVID, there was less demand for things like gas and restaurant food, and companies weren’t able or willing to produce as much. But recently, as the pandemic (seemingly temporarily) started to die down, people started doing stuff and buying stuff more, and we had high demand with low supply. This can be seen in increasing inflation worldwide. And a side note; on gas prices specifically, Biden can’t control the raising. But IMO, he has helped with the current lowering by issuing the investigation into oil company’s, who it turns out we’re withholding products so that they could raise prices.

Besides that, Biden’s had a good deal of other accomplishments:

The infrastructure bill

The rescue plan

An incredible amount of various executive orders

And drastically reduced unemployment (4.2% rn)

So, in conclusion, I approve of Biden’s job. But I want to hear some opposing viewpoints. So please; cmv.",1245.0
526,t3_re8524,CMv: Second Degree Murder is often Worse than First,"I will preface this by saying that I am not American but am using American terminology and referring to American juristicial practice as seems to be the norm here. 

First and second degree murder are differentiated by the premeditated or planned nature of the first. From Wikipedia:

""First-degree murder
Any intentional murder that is willful and premeditated with malice aforethought.""

""Second-degree murder
Any intentional murder with malice aforethought, but is not premeditated or planned.""

Generally first degree murder is punished more severely in America and across the world. I believe there is an argument to be made that it sometimes should be the opposite.

------------------------------------------------------------
If one of the meanings of a juristicial system is to keep people safe from being murdered, wouldn't it make more sense to give a longer sentence to someone who commits second degree murder? For instance, I would argue that someone who cannot control their anger in an drunken rage is more dangerous to society than someone who carefully plans a murder and clean-up of one specific person who they believed has wronged them.

I believe the first person would more likely to be a repeated offender than the second. 

This argument does not apply to people who commit first degree murders of people otherwise unrelated to them or siamply because they enjoy it.

In the last few years we have seen increasing amounts of right leaning and fascist leaders gain power all over the world. France has no Leftist leaders, the UK has basically no opposition to the conservatives and are massively increasing police powers so much so that even just carrying glue near a location that might have a crime committed could get you 51 weeks in jail, Brazil has elected Bolsonaro who idolises the military dictatorship, the Belarusian dictatorship is only gaining power, Poland is becoming less democratic, Czech republic just barely voted out an blatantly corrupt and authoritarian leader, Venezuela is still ruled by a dictator despite all the protests, Ukraine is at high risk of being invaded by the Oligarchy of Russia, the Philippines are still ruled by the insane Rodrigo Duterte, the Arab spring failed in 90% of countries, the Taliban has taken Afghanistan and millions are starving, China is supporting fascist leaders across the world because they only care about power not morals, Hong Kong has pretty much already lost all freedom and democracy, Taiwan might be next, India is quickly falling down the religious fascist rabbit hole, Africa has had so many assassinations of political leaders and civil wars that democracy has gone from already crumbling to being demolished and the most terrifying to me is the blatant push against democracy by the republicans in America. 

Despite all logic and despite all the investigations that all found nothing 60% of republicans actually believe that the last election was rigged despite republicans actually doing really well. I don't even know how to approach people who believe something so obviously false. And yet it only gets worse with republican law makers taking gerrymandering to a whole other level along with voter suppression laws. They are not even pretending to play by the rules anymore and yet there is no punishments for them. The republican party is purging all its members that are not trump loyalists which will only make them more extreme and insane. 

What scares me the most is that now with the technology and resources available I don't believe that it is possible to break free from an fascist state once it is established. So once we lose our democracy we might never get it back

529,t3_rdzt8n,"CMV: As a story, the Bible actually sucks","I can never understand why the Bible is so popular. It's not even that good of a story and lacks any deep insight and relies solely on the higher power fallacy. Take that away and the story has no power.

I'll focus on the New Testament. When people claim to follow ""the teachings of Jesus"", just what are they referring to? Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you? That's not profound. It's very basic.

The story is about a guy who questions authority and is tortured and killed while being mocked by everyone he was trying to help. But there's a twist. Her did that to save your soul from a God that no one else could talk to.

Meanwhile, the bad guy in the story, Satan, really didn't do anything wrong. He simply told Jesus to challenge this God character that Jesus spoke of. He wasn't wrong to do that. Had Jesus listened, he would've avoided being tortured and killed, which apparently was ""God's will"", yet God is the good guy for some reason and the person trying to help Jesus is not only bad, but unforgivably so. Child rapists are forgivable, but Satan isn't? What did he do that was so bad?

People call the Bible the word of God, but don't you think the person who created the universe could come up with a more compelling story that was actually coherent?

And lastly, what makes the people who wrote the Bible special? Don't people think that nomads living in the desert thousands of years ago could've gotten things wrong, written rumors and gossip mixed with y'all tales, or just outright made it up?

When it all boils down, the only reason people like the Bible is because of the appeal to a higher power. They think there is a God who rules over the universe and that God only told people the rules thousands of years ago and never bothered to update the end user agreement in that time. The story itself sucks and is in no way profound. CMV.",5.0
530,t3_rdxuxx,CMV: Game companies like EA are highly unlikely to improve their practices because people will never take a stand for quality.,"Everyone looks for any chance they get to hate on companies like EA for their shady decisions with microtransactions, copy-pasting of sports games that they have a monopoly on, and ruining promising studios. But why is EA voted [the worst company in America](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/04/09/ea-voted-worst-company-in-america-again/?sh=589daca67aeb) twice simultaneously the [9th most profitable gaming company](https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-25-companies-game-revenues/) of all time? 

Although the title may come off a bit hyperbolic as obviously there are people who have standards for the games they purchase I am simply speaking to the more casual audience of people who play video games. Every year when the annual sports games come out you see universal criticism of EA overpromising and underdelivering and charging users for their ultimate teams. in the 2020 iteration of the game it cost depending on your luck around [$2000 to get a good team together](https://www.dexerto.com/fifa/fifa-pro-reveals-how-much-it-costs-to-make-a-good-fut-squad-1042769/). Fifa 2020 has a [meta critic score of 1.3](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/fifa-20) yet just in ultimate team alone it netted EA $1.5 Billion in 2020 alone.

Obviously, this is a very much a rock in a hard place situation with many of EA's biggest titles relying on the fact that they hold the rights to be the only one making Madden, Fifa, in the past star wars etc; and the only one way to change this is if enough people don't buy these games they won't be able to play their favorite franchise but their favorite franchise will continue to suck if they just keep throwing money at EA.

The issue is not only does this mindset of buying terrible EA games and throwing money at them and then complaining about them just to repeat the process doesn't just affect EA for example [Bethesdas Creation Club](https://www.pcgamer.com/its-great-that-bethesda-wants-to-pay-modders-but-the-mods-should-still-be-free/), [Ubisoft adding microtransactions locking off content in a $60 single-player game](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/9lnuji/assassins_creed_odyssey_microtransactions_are/), the existence of a season pass in every FPS after Fortnite came out with it; you get the point.

As to my point of people being unwilling to take a stand which has what led to this problem getting worse and leads me to see it as a when and not an if microtransactions will become a standard part of every major game in addition to an acceptance of bugs and worsening of quality. I believe due to the fact that words and complaints mean nothing to a multi-billion dollar games company. The only thing that matters is hitting a company in their revenue but bar a few rare examples of a company going overboard with shadiness. This is the point is more of a personal opinion but I believe a perfect example of this to be Fallout 4, it had every issue of the point I laid out and sold around 14 million copies. Fallout 4 is in modern Bethesda fashion filled with bugs, [has microtransactions](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-fallout-4-creation-club-goes-live-with-3-horse-armor/) in a fully single-player full-price game, with a [5.6 user score on meta critic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-4) due to many vastly underwhelming features compared to previous installments.

532,t3_rduzh5,"CMV: Hitler, nor any other infamous dictator of your choosing, are not the 'most evil' men in history, as they are commonly titled. Their atrocities had the largest scope, but there is nothing superhuman or unique about their own personal capacity for wickedness.","I like to express this idea in the form of a thought experiment: 
 
Let's say I lock Hitler in a jail cell, just before the Night of Long Knives in 1934. Let's also say that by doing this, the trajectory of events in Nazi Germany that would eventually lead to World War 2 stops, dead in its tracks. As long as I keep him in jail, everything is paused. As soon as I let him out, he goes right back to being Chancellor, and the series of events leading to war resumes right where it stopped.  
 
The question is: would Hitler be *less evil* if I kept him in the jail cell forever? 
 
If he's kept in the cell, World War 2 never occurs. That's some ***eighty million people*** whose lives will be saved. The negative impact Hitler has on the world shrinks a thousandfold if he's never released. But in that cell, *Hitler still* ***wants*** *a World War to occur.* Given the *opportunity* - i.e., being released from his jail cell - he *would* act to ensure World War 2 occurs.  
 
It is this that makes me answer a strong *no* to my original question. Hitler is not any less evil if he's kept in the cell and his actions that make in the war occur are stopped. He's just as evil either way, because the thing that determines evil-ness, per se, is not the objective outcome of your actions, but the conscious intent of your actions. It's not what you *do,* it's what you *want* to do. It's what you *would* make happen, ***if you could.*** 
 
If I go to shoot up a mall, but my gun jams, I'm still evil, despite the fact my actions have resulted in no deaths, because I *wanted* to kill. Likewise, if I bake someone a pie but they die of a bad allergic reaction I didn't know they had, I'm not evil, because I didn't *want* to hurt them.
  
Somewhere in the world right now, there's an incredibly anti-Semitic hobo living under a bridge that absolutely hates jews with every fibre of his being. If someone gave him a briefcase with a big red button inside that would kill all jews, he would press it instantly. To me, that makes him as evil as someone like Hitler ever was. The fact the hobo will never be in a position to commit genocide is irrelevant; the only difference between Hitler and the hobo is the objective impact they make, and that is a purely circumstantial distinction. Their intentions are as vile, and this means that all these reviled names we hear are in no way the *most evil* people to have existed.
 
I suppose I just dislike it when we refer to these people as *the most* evil people, because it suggests that there is something uniquely unattainable, something grossly alien, about just how black-hearted they are. I think it's much more important to recognise that really, they were no more evil than any other dime-a-dozen fascist supremacists. We all have the capacity to do disgustingly evil things, but these men just happened to be born in a place, time, and standing, that they could act on those really not-that-rare prejudices, to horrible effect.",1752.0
533,t3_rdp2tb,CMV: Gaining weight is more difficult than losing weight,"Assuming the person who needs to gain weight is underweight, the person who needs to lose weight is overweight, and both are looking to do so in a healthy manner. 

I won’t factor in psychological factors since each person is different and may have more or less willpower. 

Gaining weight that isn’t mostly fat requires time throughout your week to exercise, as well as more money and time to afford the caloric surplus and eat. 

Losing weight is the exact opposite. At its core, all that’s required is to cut down to a caloric deficit. While it helps, exercise is not *required* since body fat is the first to go regardless. Cutting down the amount of food you eat would save both time and money. 

Another major point I have is while both require willpower to accomplish, the action required to gain weight is fundamentally harder. Unlike not eating or eating less, gaining weight requires you to perform a specific, conscious action against your body’s signals. Actively picking up the fork and eating is not the same as the absence of doing it.

534,t3_rdmsjw,CMV: Delivery drivers who use wifi jammers to avoid being recorded should pick a different job,"Edit: I want to clarify that I don’t necessarily think delivery people are doing anything wrong aside from potentially using a jammer. I rarely even open up the video feed. I work from home, so literally all I want is for my Ring to notify me that it’s detected a person on my front porch so that I can then immediately go retrieve my package and prevent opportunists from stealing it. The driver is not responsible for what happens to my package after they’ve safely delivered it, _provided_ that they’ve made best efforts to inform the recipient (which in my case would just be not actively interfering with my being notified that it’s here). Most drivers wear masks as well, which could help in the rare cases of weirdos who decide its cute to upload a video to social media.


I get it- Ring video camera doorbells have become ubiquitous, and some people have sorely abused them to upload funny/ embarrassing/ “wholesome” videos of delivery people to social media without your consent. But it is fundamentally your job to safely transport a product from a company/warehouse to the customer, and using a personal WiFi jammer to prevent video systems from detecting you delivering that package means that in many cases, it gets stolen. 

I live in a city where package theft is incredibly common, especially around this time of year, so I always make a point of being home when a package is due to be delivered. Delivery people who use wifi jammers (so that my Ring doesn’t detect a person at the door) also tend to not ring the doorbell as that triggers an automatic recording of the event. Within the period of time it takes to get ab email notification that my package has been delivered, I’ve had countless items stolen. Thieves often follow UPS/FedEx/Amazon delivery vans so they can sneak onto doorsteps and grab packages right after they’ve been dropped off. The most jarring part is pulling up the order and seeing the picture taken of the package on my doorstep (protecting the driver from accusations that they just didn’t deliver it) and consulting my Ring to find absolutely no video record. Frequently, I think the jammers protect thieves following closely behind the delivery people, meaning I also have no evidence that the item was stolen. 

I think it’s wrong to screw over people who just want their damned Blue Apron or medicine for their dog or WHATEVER because delivery drivers have decided they don’t want to be captured on video. Pick a different job.",1465.0

It's a low key super power that he gets away with blaming on technology and I don't think it matters how many times he runs out of it on critical missions it's the most powerful substance in the Marvel universe and he has been backyard chemistry concocting it since 1962, provisionally.

There have been many iterations of the character but for this debate we have to allow he first made it in 1962 with beakers and a bunsen burner out of common ingredients like household bleaches and cleaners because he is almost always portrayed as poor.

This sums up its many, many properties:

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Web-Shooters

There are so many magical abilities here even spraying it out of a tiny CO2 like cartridge without making a mess or webbing himself I will take my view even a step further: Peter Parker could've saved more lives selling his web product than as Spiderman and the webs are more powerful than vibranium.

I want my view to be changed: I'd enjoy his character a lot more if it was believable and he is going to be a major player in the next cinematic wave but I'm always bothered by the inconsistency.

If webs went commercial everyone would be wearing that instead of clothes. It would replace all baby diapers. Think about all the industrial waste and effort that goes into all that stuff and it's all organically replaced overnight and it can be strong enough to be bulletproof.

How amazing would it be to web yourself up some form fitting clothing every day and then just throw it in the garbage or the toilet where it dissolves into water droplets. All created from household product.

There are a lot of let's call them fan made abilities where he can electrocute or ice or acid his webs and if you allow that then every manufacturing process now includes webbing. Even the computer chips might be webbed first as a first draft then the metals added to that frame work.

Automotive and all mechanical work would all be webbed before it's bolted or welded together.

Your tool belt would be webs and your shoes too and we'd never have to pick cotton or skin for leather.

Webs alone would put the average soldier on par with a empowered individual. Bullet proof cheaply made disposable armors made from webs and you know what the most powerful weapon in the entire marvel universe is?

Launching web cartridges. There are miles worth of web in every cartridge so just shoot them out of a shotgun and you could immobilize even The Hulk in a few shots.

In the video game his web powers are taken even further where anything you can imagine he can do. That would mean every single manufacturing process humans ever do would include webbing. I can't think of anything - even bushcraft - where instant spray roping wouldn't come in handy let alone all the other fantastical properties added to it.

Compared to vibranium or adamantium or whatever the Asgardians cook up webbing is intensely more powerful. For every Mjolnir wielding Thor they could put up the webs could have an army of cheaply outfitted soldiers shotgunning web bombs.

What if you dropped a web bomb from a plane? Even giant Hulk would struggle with that and it would still only cost $1000 or so in ingredients.

An entire suit of vibranium would only protect you from being webbed a few times: it has that auric explosive effect but only when it takes damage. The web army would never even hurt you they could be pacifists and with that the whole super power menace has been solved.

I want my view changed but it seems like with a bit of imagination the webs are the most powerful substance and super power in the non-cosmic Marvel universe and Peter Parker could've saved the world many more times over if he had just made his product commercial.

Even in the hands of bad guys webbing is a less lethal option than guns. Where is the downside of him going commercial?",5.0
537,t3_rdchmp,CMV: I do not feel there is anything particularly wrong with the practice of serving meals on naked human bodies.,"Serving meals on naked, live human bodies is a traditional practice in some places, the most famous one of this being the Japanese *nyotaimori*. Some parties have criticized this practice as humiliating, exploitative, or unhygienic.

However, when such practices as stripping, prostitution, and pornography exist in full legality, I find paying a man, who of course consents, to simply lie naked as food is eaten of his body to be relatively mild in comparison, and of course these are all paid professionals who consent to this, much as strippers are.

Hygienic reasons also seem far-fetched to me, as cooks often handle food without gloves and simply rely on well-cleaned hands.

If some people wish to eat food served on naked bodies, and some people wish to be paid to have food served on their naked body, then I don't see the problem in a world of legal prostitution.",77.0
538,t3_rd5xna,CMV: Cutting sales tax on used goods would be good for the environment and economy,"The government does many things to try to encourage efficient use of energy, but there aren't really any incentives to buy used products instead of new ones. You have to pay sales tax on both (if the used goods come from a 'professional seller').  That's a shame because there are very few things that you can do that save as much energy and pollution as simply *not buying new things*.  When you buy a used product, you save the materials and energy required to manufacture a new one. If the new product is to be made overseas, using dirty energy, and must be shipped to you - all the more savings.

Re-use is a much more effective way to save energy than recycling or using clean energy in a manufacturing plant. A lot of recycling ends up in landfill anyway, and using clean energy may be taking that energy away from other uses.  Re-using goods bypasses all of this.  No energy needed.

But as it stands, buying used products is often not worth the extra risk and effort. Many perfectly good items end up in landfill.  Giving people a tax break would make used goods cheaper, or free up more proceeds to go to the buyer or seller.  This would make used goods more competitive against new goods and encourage more re-use, and as an added benefit - it would keep money form the transaction local, not sent to distant manufacturers.

\*\* I know that in some cases, newer goods are more energy efficient.  Let's set those aside for the moment for the sake of this discussion.

\*\* EDIT For those interested in this topic, I'll paraphrase the notable counterarguments and my thoughts about them:

1. A **VAT tax** (common in European economies) achieves the same effect, but would do so in a more organic way.  Good point.
2. 'There wouldn't be much impact because used goods already have an **equilibrium price** and the missing sales tax would just yield a reset to this equilibrium price w/ more profit going to the seller.'  I don't buy this argument so much, but you can read the posters comments and decide for yourself.  My feeling is an incentive is an incentive and it seems to work in other product categories.
3. 'Other forms of energy incentives are **more effective**.' It may be true, but my hunch is that used goods are really effective.  My feeling is based on something called a ""**carbon efficiency index**"" which gives you a units of mass of carbon emissions required per units of product manufactured.  So a 50 Kilo sofa x 5 CII would yield 250 Kilos of CO2 emissions to manufacture and ship somewhere.  I don't know that the CII of a sofa is (these are calculated for specific products painstakingly) but I assume it is something like that.  So if a $6 tax credit on 50 Kilo sofa resulted in the sales of said sofa, instead of a bran new one, then that $6 would yield 250 kilos of emissions savings - which I theorize would be a better ROI than the same money invested into recycling etc.

539,t3_rd9x5m,CMV: Lying to your kids about the existence of Santa Claus is unethical.,"Since I feel like I need to say it, this is meant to be a low-stakes debate. Plz don't think I'm saying anything akin to considering this ""child abuse"" or some such thing. It's Friday, yo, so let's have a Friday-esque discussion.

That said, I do consider it unethical to essentially lie to your children that this mythical bearded man exists and is giving presents to everyone. As a parent, you are essentially approaching the subject with ""since you are too dumb and have too little knowledge of cultural context to know otherwise, I'm going to look you right in the eyes and tell you that this fairy tale is complely, 100% true.""

Sure I guess it's cute, but you are essentially exchanging trust with your children for something cute that only exists because your kids are not smart enough to know better. We know kids believe anything we tell them and for some reason collectively decided we're all just going to lie to them about this.

When I put it together that Santa is fake and that all of this was bullshit, I still remember my first thought: why the fuck did my parents tell me it was true? I genuinely did not understand the point, and I felt taken advantage of. I've promised myself that I won't lie to my kids the same way, because it's not worth pushing the limits of their trust of me just so I can do something that society in general thinks is cute, which I remind you is essentially smiling to ourselves about kids believing this bullshit story because they are kids and they are total idiots.

540,t3_rdad39,Cmv: Surface fleets are largely becoming obsolete with a few exceptions.,"I was recently listening to a couple US professors talk about the United States navy and they were pretty sour on it. Aside from corruption/kick backs they noted that in a war game a US admiral representing Iran was able to completely destroy the US surface fleet by simply launching all their anti-ship missiles at once to overwhelm US ships defenses. The entire US surface fleet was destroyed with casualties in the thousands.

Similarly, they noted that in recent war games with India, that Indian submarines were undetectable to US surface ships.  US surface ships were unable to respond to attacks and the US fleet was completely destroyed.

One of the professors also noted that he had spoken to US submariners and they jokingly said that surface ships only exist to be picked off by submarines.

Now this conversation was more or less off the cuff and neither of the professors specialize in anything related to modern navies but it planted the idea in my head that anti-ship missle technology and submarine technology has made surface ships largely obsolete in warfare.

The obvious exceptions would be aircraft carriers, troop transports/logistic ships and possibly smaller escort ships. Overall though, really any  sort of surface ship is at a huge disadvantage when up against submarines or land based missiles.

541,t3_rd59zi,CMV: The first country to introduce π &lt;currency&gt; coins or bills will have my utmost respect.,"Yes, I know it's irrational. No need to tell me. But I'll try to defend it anyway.

First, it's cool. Aren't you bored with all denominations being divisors or multiples of 100? Haven't you ever wanted to have 6 dollar coins or 64 euro bills? Well, π dollars is even greater. I'm not sure you can change my mind here, honestly.

Second, sure, it will be confusing to a lot of people. Hell, some apparently think π symbolizes infinity, they'll be bewildered. But it won't take long to get used to. I realize it will still be annoying for most even after that. But it's a minor inconvenience, and there is a big upside. Namely, the kids who get introduced to interesting mathematics early, and get a chance to become curious about it, learn some, and begin to like it before bad teachers ruin it for them with endless drilling. And this I believe to be really important.

**Update**: Answering some common arguments.

**A. It's impossible.**

You are wrong. It's irrational and you're not used to owning irrational amounts of money that cannot be precisely changed into lower denominations. It's still possible.

Let's say we have no such denominations, and I ask π euros for a watermelon. It's in no way an ""impossible"" price, just inconvenient. We'll simply have to agree on a price that's close enough to be acceptable for both of us (maybe we'll use other currencies, maybe you'll give me 3.15 and I'll return you a cent in a few years when the approximately 0.0084 euros I owe you inflate, maybe I'll feel generous and accept your 3.14).

**B. It's terribly inconvenient.**

Duh! I know. If you want my mind changed please give me a concrete estimate (it could be back-of-the envelope calculation with explanations) how bad it would be. Let's say the US issue $1 billion worth of π dollar bills, if you demonstrate that it's so inconvenient it'll effectively cost another billion per year, then yeah, it's worse than I thought.

Note that I am not proposing to adjust banking and accounting systems. I guess you can pretend ""π dollars"" is just a different currency and circumvent a lot of problems, but it still looks pretty inconvenient. At some point rounding has to happen, so banks and accounting systems can use rounded values.

**C. It's too expensive.**

That's a good argument if you provide an estimate how much it's going to cost. Without the estimate I'll probably work it out myself at some point, and maybe retroactively award deltas to those who brought it up first.

**D. It won't actually make kids more interested/will make them less interested in math.**

Clearly no country ever tried it. Probably there isn't even research into anything similar enough. So I will necessarily use low standards for evidence, but ""I think so"" just doesn't cut it. IDK what it can be, sufficiently similar situations that already happened? Somewhat related research? Pure logic? Maybe, maybe, maybe.

There were other good arguments (and must be more, I haven't yet read all), thanks to everyone.

**Update 2: My view is changed**:

1) My main argument that the denomination will get kids interested is dubious: I didn't fully appreciate that it's annoying and that applies to the kids as well, if they are forced to use it. 

2) The UK apparently paid quite a lot to get rid of shillings and £1/240 pence in 1966-1971. So it's possible that adding an inconvenient denomination will cost more than I expect, and it's probable that the inconvenience and annoyance matter more than I think.

3) And it looks like within a decade some countries will get rid of their cash altogether. It's probably where all developed world is headed.",0.0
542,t3_rd1fh6,CMV: It would be hypocritical to support tobacco phase-out if you support drug decriminalisation.,"This post is inspired by this news article: [New Zealand's Smokefree legislation to ban people born after 2010 from ever buying tobacco](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-09/new-zealand-smokefree-2025-plan-ban-tobacco-sales/100686806). The news article mentions that one of the parties supporting the phase-out is the New Zealand Greens, [which themselves support cannabis legalisation](https://web.archive.org/web/20161220205927/https://www.greens.org.nz/page/drug-law-reform-policy).

I personally support drug decriminalisation. It has been shown to [reduce drug-related HIV and AIDS, drug-related deaths, and reduced social costs of responding to drugs - without the expected drawback of increasing drug use rates](https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/blog/australias-recreational-drug-policies-arent-working-so-what-are-options-reform).

Back to the original news article, it says:

&gt;Dr Verrall said non-Maori live eight years longer than Maori New Zealanders on average. Two and a half years of that gap is attributed to smoking.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We want to make sure young people never start smoking … if nothing changes it would be decades till Maori smoking rates fall below five per cent, and this government is not prepared to leave people behind,"" she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The government will consult with a Maori health task force in the coming months before introducing legislation into parliament in June next year, with the aim of making it law by the end of 2022.

I do not want more people to smoke and die from smoking. Indeed, back in high school PDHPE class, we were taught that a cigarette company executive once said ""[*We don't smoke this shit, we just sell it. We reserve the right to smoke for the young, the poor, the Black, and the stupid.*](https://truthinitiative.org/research-resources/targeted-communities/tracing-racist-tactics-tobacco-industry)"" - While the cigarette company executive was specifically referring to African-Americans, cigarette companies have also been targeting other disadvantaged minorities. I do not want to see the Maori get exploited by the cigarette companies into destroying their health, but I also believe that an outright tobacco ban instead of decriminalised status will only result in a situation like what we have in Australia, [where we have an extremely high incarceration rate of Indigenous Australians](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/indigenous-australians-more-likely-to-be-imprisoned-than-african-americans/a674e77a-c5be-41c6-b196-9c756c7e18eb) and laws against drug use are inconsistently followed, [to the detriment of Indigenous Australians](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/10/nsw-police-pursue-80-of-indigenous-people-caught-with-cannabis-through-courts).

543,t3_rcwczr,CMV: it is harmful to the economy to normalize investment properties as a means of income.,"I’ve seen a lot of content, specifically on TikTok of people outlining their process of obtaining investment properties and encouraging other people to do it as well to generate “passive income.” It usually goes something like:

“I bought a duplex with a mortgage of $1600/month. I renovated it then rented out both of the units for $1200/month. I then used that income to purchase a 4 unit building…” it ends with them glorifying their now passive income and encourages other people to grind it out and do the same. 

This type of capital venture affects different communities in different ways. The general trend we’re seeing in most midsize cities is that first time home buyers are being undercut in their offers by property investors. The average buyer can’t compete with an investor providing a full cash offer. Because people need a place to live, these potential homebuyers are being forced to rent units for a greater amount of money than what their mortgage payment would be. Wealthy individuals or property investment companies then have a monopoly on these communities, (cheaply) renovating units and charging rent that allows them to generate a profit from the property. This increases property taxes and cost of living in these communities and when children who grow up in these communities become adults. they can’t afford to purchase homes there and are forced to rent or go elsewhere. 

Having an investment property is exploitive. It’s worse when it’s a company but it’s also not an ethical income for an individual. It creates a false housing shortage and perpetuates the housing crisis.",2150.0

I haven’t seen evidence that the boosters are sterilizing or 100% prevent infection, and so far the 2 doses (Moderna at least) are still very effective against serious disease.

But coupled with the fact that I’m already low risk of serious illness to begin with, I am completely unmotivated to get a booster. I’m 26F.

I understand that antibodies have waned and that is the main bullet point when they’re trying to sell boosters to the general public. But if antibodies can wane once, why wouldn’t they wane again?

545,t3_rcv1pz,CMV: Healthcare isn't a right (nor are there any other positive rights),"A negative right is a right not to have something done to you or taken from you. A positive right is a right to have something done for you or have something given to you. If healthcare were a right, it would be of the second kind, since people don't naturally have medicine and it must be given by others.

Rights imply obligations. Negative rights imply only very minimal obligations, namely not to interfere with someone else's life (which is why negative rights are sometimes called 'liberty' rights). Positive rights imply stronger, more robust obligations. It means you have to go out of your way to do something (if you were a doctor, it would imply that you can be forced to provide treatment if you're the only one available).

That's the most troubling part about healthcare or any positive right. Just where exactly did the rest of us obtain an obligation to maintain the health of others? What contract did we sign that says 'I agree to pay for your healthcare'? What wrong did we do that would oblige us to pay restitution? I can see none.

This is someone who is very unlikely to be as emotionally mature as a 30 year old. Even if they are not in high school, what exactly is the difference between that 18 year old and someone even younger?

18 is not a magic number. There is little phenotypical difference between them and many 16 year olds even, and that relationship would be clearly deemed inappropriate. So why do we feel differently just because someone is 18? I do not believe people who are fully grown adults who would have sex with an 18 year old wouldn’t go even younger if the law would allow it. In some states it even does, where the age of consent is 16. 

This is someone who cannot legally drink, cannot purchase cigarettes in some states, still is likely to live at home and has never lived independently, does not yet have a career or their own money/savings/assets. There is so much opportunity for manipulation. An adult could easily groom someone until 18 and then have sex with them when it is legal, evading legal consequences but still being predatory.

I don’t believe just because something is legal, it isn’t creepy, predatory and inappropriate. It just means the adult is able to recognize how to evade legal consequences.

But at the same time, while people identifying as bisexual nearly tripled from 2008 to 2018, the leap was greatly dominated by women.

To me, this is hard to explain only in terms of remaining stigmas on male sexuality, since the numbers of men identifying as gay and transgender have also greatly increased in the last recent couple of decades.

One explanation sometimes given in evolutionary psychology circles is that women (more then men) have benefitted from having intimate relations with the same sex in terms of having more help in raising children.

On the US census they ask you what race you are which include: Caucasian, Black &amp; African American, Asian, American Indian &amp; Alaskan Native, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Then they ask if you are Hispanic or Latino. My question since hispanic is an ethnolinguistic group since it relates to people who come from a Spanish speaking country, why don't other ethnolinguistic groups get this option? A big one I can think of should be Arab, since there are black and caucasian Arabs just marking down white or black for these people erases their identity and lumps them with every different groups. The same could be said of really any ethnolinguistic group like slavs, francophones or anglophones. 

On the flip side why are hispanic people all lumped together as one ethnicity when there are hispanic people of all different races? Like you can't tell me Paulina Rubio and David Ortiz are the same race. It seems quite arbitrary. It is like saying Lebron James and Reynolds are the “same ethnicity” despite being from truly different countries just because they both are from Anglo cultures. 

I really think the only reason is since lots of Mexican Americans are mestizo, caucasian Anglo Americans didn’t want them to be lumped up with them as the same race. So they had to make a new racial categorization which they disguised as Latino or Hispanic. But that’s the thing: many hispanics are not mestizo.

552,t3_rcnef0,CMV: The dozenal system would have been better a better standard than the decimal system,"OK, let's get some terminology out of the way right at the top: the **decimal system** (base 10) means that our default grouping in units of 10. We've got 10 unique numerals (0-9), and whenever we get to '10', we add a zero. Adding or removing a zero multiplies or divides the number by 10. e.g., 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on.

This is the default systems for most cultures today either because they adopted it organically (you've got ten fingers to count on), or because some other dominant culture was already using it, so they switched.

With that said, it's not the \*only\* natural counting system, and it sure as heck ain't the best. For instance, the Babylonians used a base 60 system, and proto-Germanic and old Norse cultures used a base 12 system (a 'dozenal' system), which is still evident in English counting (you've got unique words for 1-10 ... but also for eleven and twelve).

In a dozenal system, each time you add or remove a zero, you're multiplying or dividing by 12, not 10. If you're used to base 10 (as literally all of us are), it can seem counterintuitive ... but if we'd grown up with base 12, we'd wonder why *anyone* would use a decimal system. Here's why:

* If you use a dozenal system, you can [count to 12](https://medium.com/@n.patti/using-the-duodecimal-system-will-make-your-day-to-day-life-much-easier-9cf174109ddb) on one hand. You've got five fingers, but (using your thumb as a pointer), you can keep track of 12 knuckles. Click the link for a picture.
* Division is a bitch in a decimal system, and it's much easier in a dozenal system. Why? First, because **10 is  not a very divisible number,** e.g.,:
   * The number '10' can be divided by just 2 and 5, meaning *any* multiple of 10 is divisible by 2 or 5. Whereas:
   * The number '12' can be divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6, meaning *any* multiple of 12 is divisible by any of those 4 numbers. Vs. base 10, base 12 is only harder to divide by 5.
* Second, because **12 requires very** [**little additional effort**](https://medium.com/swlh/life-would-be-simpler-if-we-counted-in-base-12-do-you-agree-with-this-statement-f88b7805fb78) (vs. 10); a base 60 system is SUPER DUPER divisible, but you need 50 more characters to memorize. That's nuts. But with base 12, you only need two more characters. It'd go something like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, X, Y, 10, etc; that's not much more to remember.
* Third, **base 12 aligns much better with the natural world and the longest standing measurement systems.** e.g., its affinity to groups of 12 and 60 means it's easier to think about months, years, angles, arcs, minutes, hours, and so on.

**Final note:** I am not suggesting that it'd be practical or desirable to *switch* to the dozenal system. That ship sailed at least 500 years ago... we are much too ingrained, and the benefits (especially in a digital era where we don't actually *do* most of the calculation ourselves) are just not big enough. My point is that we'd be better off if we were already using it, not that we can make the change now.

To change my mind, get me to understand the benefits the base 10 system has (aside from already being in use) that outweigh the ones I've laid out for base 12.

**Edits:**

**First**, I've already updated my post to remove the 'any multiple' verbiage. Hopefully that's easier.

**Second,** please take a moment and read through at least the wikipedia article for base 12. **The concept of zero is not unique to base 10.** To be absolutely clear, a 'dozenal' system **does not** remove the ability to use 'decimals' (they become 'dozenals'), nor does it remove the ability to use '0'. This is how it works:

* ""1"" means one.
* ""0"" means zero.
* If you remember the 'tens place' and the 'hundred's place' and so on from grade school, the next part is pretty straightforward...
   * 1 followed by 0 means ""twelve""
   * 1 followed by 5 means ""twelve and five""; what we'd call 17 in base 10 is written 15 in base 12.
   * 1 followed by 00 means ""twelve twelves""; what we'd call 144 in base 10.

If we don't do our individual part we will 'fail together',"When on a team, working together, you can rely on a team mate to have your back.

Covid spreads through the weakest link(s).

It requires individual efforts from every.single.person to beat it. Individual efforts working concurrently or simultaneously is different from the takeaway from when people are told 'let's work on this together'. As soon as people say that, some people will automatically tune out and rely on others.

In a team sport, if a coach comes and says 'go team!' before the game, it does not hold each individual accountable.

As opposed to...

If the coach had an individual discussion with each person, looked them in the eyes, and said 'im counting on you to do what you need to do'.

554,t3_rcl7ki,Cmv: Why does everyone hate China? I don't.,"Yes, China is an authoritarian state and has a poor track record on human rights, but at the same time, it's made huge advancements and most of its citizens lives have improved dramatically. They get things done quickly, and seem to care more about their citizens than many western countries do. For example, they build and operate railways at a loss, whereas here in the UK, all our railways have been sold to private companies and they extort us with disgusting prices and provide a shitty service.

It seems to me like the western era is over and the Chinese and Asian era is moving in and the west, especially America, can do nothing but cry like babies about it. 

They complain about Chinese human rights abuses whilst people die on the streets of America with no health insurance. 

They whine about China trying to exert their influence in their own back yard like Taiwan while they themselves travel thousands of miles away and invade far away countries in the name of democracy.

They cry about China's belt and road initiative over the globe whilst Western companies are busy exploiting African countries through neocolonialism.

I for one, am happy that China is on the rise. Not because I support China, but because there needs to be a counterweight to American hegemony. I definitely don't want China to replace the USA as the sole world superpower, but that's not likely to happen as China doesn't have any strong allies or much soft power.

People need to stop crying about the Chinese becoming a superpower and accept that America is on the decline or at least, can't throw their weight around like they used to. This is better for the balance of international power.

Edit: Wow, didn't expect this to blow up. I've given deltas to a couple people, whose arguments mainly go along the lines of being able to criticise both countries.

I also could have clarified my post further by emphasising that I was targeting more the people who criticise China without even caring about the problems of their own government, I had just expected that to be obvious from my post description.

There were a couple Fox news types who came along to assert that America is the best and that American domination has improved the lives of everyone, to whom I just chuckled and blocked, but I have also received some very comprehensive answers.

All in all, I wouldn't say my view has changed, rather balanced. I understand that most people who criticise China aren't Fox News nationalists who love America, and that they do criticise America too, but that they criticise China more for reasons that they've explained. I can agree that China does need to be criticised and I never asserted it shouldn't, but this post was intended to question hypocrisy, and I think most of the comments demonstrate that most people aren't blind nationalists who hate China but love America.

1. Each groups candidate and 2 supporting advisors would be elected by the people in support of them to represent their cause


2. Will be curated by an unbiased court


3. It will be televised and heavily broadcasted once a month especially on social media which would turn our greatest problem into our greatest weapon.



Why do I believe it would work? The argument, information, and discussion would only rely on the highest kind of debate form. You want to win. In this form irrational logic just falls apart and simply put there is little room for error.

There would be no Facebook misinformation. It's a clear way to showoff to everyone where your position really stands.

1)It minimizes confusion because when the rest of the world talks about football they are talking about the one with the two goals and teams of 11 players with a spherical ball. America just confuses things by calling their sport football.

2)Some parts of Canada already call it gridiron. 

3)Gridiron is a cool name and actually is related to the sport itself (the field is called a gridiron) instead of the word football which doesn't relate to it. The foot is rarely used if ever to kick the egg-thing and the egg-thing isn't even a ball. Hell the egg-thing can even be called a gridiron and no one would mind.

4)I watched a video about why American football wasn't successful in Europe and I think the main deterrent is the name. At least if you promote the sport as Gridiron instead of football it would be able to get more traction. Also it would just be a small name change to the NFL and other American football leagues by just calling it the NGL.

My position is that:

 IF your salary/income keeps pace with the rising inflation

OR you are able to change jobs to increase your salary/income

AND you are carrying any substantial debt like a mortgage or a student loan

THAN inflation can actually be beneficial by lowering the overall value of your debt.

In overall terms of negative impact, inflation primarily affects those on a fixed income and the poor. But in terms of overall loss in value the true biggest losers are the wealthy that are sitting on a pile of cash, either stuffed in a mattress or in a bank account earning next to no interest.

In terms of debt, this is from Investopedia: “Inflation also makes it easier on debtors, who repay their loans with money that is less valuable than the money they borrowed. This encourages borrowing and lending, which again increases spending on all levels. Perhaps most important to the Federal Reserve is that the U.S. government is the largest debtor in the world, and inflation helps soften the blow of its massive debt.”

I get the feeling that while inflation disproportionately impacts the working class, it has been co-opted by the wealthy to serve as a boogeyman to the masses to influence economic and political reform that may not be in the working class’ best interests.",0.0

562,t3_rc4frt,CMV: The expectation that one should lower the toilet seat after urinating is unjustified.,"Unless you're closing the toilet lid entirely, there is no general reason to change the orientation of the toilet seat after using it. 

###1: Efficiency

If each person adjusts the toilet seat to fit their preference for standing/sitting before using the restroom, the seat is adjusted exactly as many times as necessary. 

Always lowering the seat will create inefficiencies in cases of two consecutive standing urinators, where the seat will be lowered and then raised again unnecessarily.

###2: Equity

The social norm of always lowering the seat after use puts a disproportionate portion of the toilet seat adjustment (TSA) burden on standing urinators to both raise and lower the seat. Consider a large facility with a single standing urinator. Under a prior-adjustment model, 50% of all TSA will be done by the standing urinator, and the other 50% distributed among whoever visits the restroom after them. This is disproportionate enough as-is without expecting the standing urinator to lower the seat again afterwards, tasking them with 100% of all TSA.",24.0
563,t3_rc3oi6,CMV: Doors to public restrooms should open outwards instead of inwards,"I'm talking about the doors to get in and out of the larger restroom itself, NOT stalls. There are *a lot* of people including myself who will do everything to avoid touching bathroom door handles, because they're disgusting. In an ideal world everyone cleans their hands adequately before leaving a public restroom but we all know that's not the case. 

**It's** **Unsanitary:**

Door handles are highly-touched surfaces that provide an excellent method of transmission for viruses and bacteria if not cleaned, and given what restrooms are for, door handles are now the perfect surface for nastier bacteria and viruses to get transmitted. There are very few surfaces in most recently-built public restrooms that a user must touch (given all the automatic toilets, faucets, and paper-towel dispensers), but most still force the user to grab the door handle in order to leave since the doors swing *into* the restroom instead of outwards. This essentially guarantees the user will come into contact with bacteria or viruses lingering on the surface unless they use a barrier. 

**It defeats the purpose of handwashing:**

The purpose of handwashing, is to *sanitize* your hands before handling food, touching a wound, or partaking in some activity that creates a situation with higher-than-normal vulnerability to infections. It's been proven that while sanitizing your hands with rubbing alcohol or some other cleaner *is effective,* handwashing is optimal. You wouldn't want your surgeon just throwing some *Purell* on their hands before operating on you! Forcing the user of a restroom to interact with a highly-touched surface that is extremely dirty *after washing their hands,* even with a barrier like paper towel, just defeats the purpose of handwashing! 

**Why doors that open outwards are superior:**

The user can push the door outwards with their body to leave, instead of being forced to pull the door open using the handle, meaning their hands can stay ""clean"". Furthermore, since people of all different heights, the **average** concentration of bacteria in one particular spot on the door should theoretically be *less* than on the door handle as the surface area of the door handle is obviously much smaller than the surface area of the entire door, so people who insist on using their hands will be pushing from a larger variety of locations on the door itself.

565,t3_rc1a8a,CMV: The 3/5 compromise wasn’t racist and was beneficial to our country.,"If you are American, you probably know what the 3/5 compromise is, but Ill give a brief explanation for anyone who may be unfamiliar. This is a part of the original constitution that came about when states’ representatives couldn’t decide how to count slaves when rallying the population of a state for purposes of apportioning representation and tax burden. Free states without slaves wanted slaves to count in the population when determining tax burden, but not for representation in Congress. Slave states wanted slaves to count for representation, but not for taxes. The compromise reached reads as follows: 

“Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.”

If you learned about this in school, it was probably held up to you as an example of racism in the original constitutions. And something along the lines of “the founders thought slaves were only 3/5 of a person” or some other implication that this statement indicates slaves as less valuable or less of a person than free white people. I think it’s important to note the actual language used, which explicitly states that black slaves are people. “Three fifths of all other persons” directly and explicitly recognizes full personhood for slaves. It’s not about each slave being 3/5 if a person, rather it’s 3/5 the number of slaves counts is added to the free population. While the slave owners certainly didn’t see it that way, this part of the original constitution is not a reflection of that racist view that slave owners held. 

I think the clearest example of why this isn’t racist is to look at which states were on which side of the argument. If this was about racism, we’d expect that the slave owning states would be in favor of slaves not counting *at all*. But that’s not the case. Slave States wanted the full number of slaves to count towards the population so that they would have higher representation in Congress. It was the free states that wanted slaves not to count in rallying the population. 

Furthermore, the 3/5 compromise ended slavery faster in this country than if it hadn’t been reached (assuming the union still is created in the first place without such a compromise). The states with slaves had less representation in Congress because much of their population were slaves, thus limiting their representation. If more seats in Congress go to slave states, that makes it harder to pass abolitionist legislation. Even better, if your goal is to end slavery, would be to not count slaves at all when determining representatives because that would even further limit the representation of slave states. 

So that’s how I understand it and how I’ve come to conclusion that the 3/5 compromise was a good thing and it is not an example of racism.

Edit: I don’t think I made this clear in the original post. People claim the 3/5C is racist because it only counts slaves as 3/5 of a person or as 3/5 the value of a free person. This implies that the solution is to count slaves in full. However, this would actually give more power to the slave states.",0.0
566,t3_rc0l71,CMV: Giving a homeless person cash is ultimately the best way you can help them,"I know this is a touchy topic but as the holiday season rolls around there have been more and more homeless people in my downtown area and so often I see people either refuse to give them anything or only give them food. I know a popular view is that you shouldn't give them money because they may go spend it on drugs or alcohol, but honestly I just don't understand why that is such a valid concern.

First of all, the more I have learned about how people experience homelessness is that often they are plenty fed but need supplies such as tents, socks, period products, underwear, etc. However, they often are less able to access these items because people are less willing to give them money. I think people forget that food and water are not the only necessities to survive in life. These people are the ones on the streets and ultimately know what they need more than somebody who is just coming up to them who leads a completely different life, probably not homeless. 

I think a lot of people feel that when they are giving money or anything to the homeless they are in a morally superior position simply because they got a better lot in life. But just because you are not homeless does not magically mean that you know what these people need better than they do.

Also, the argument about drugs and alcohol doesn't really speak to me. If I was on the street I would like to think that I wouldn't get addicted to anything, but let's be honest eventually you might need something to numb the pain. I mean I spend my own money on alcohol and drugs sometimes so why not them. If that is what they need to get through the day or the night then I would rather them have it. Once I give them that money it is no longer mine and it's up to them what they need.

Obviously, I am all for donating to causes that help the homeless and shelters, but ultimately I think if an individual comes up on the street or is just sitting on the corner and is causing no problems and they ask if you have any cash, sparing a dollar or five dollars is probably the best thing you can do for them.",15.0
567,t3_rbzqjc,cmv: The Roman Empire was doomed from the start,"First I’d like to say I’m not an expert in history or anything really, just some guy with opinions who’d love to be shown new ideas

What I mean by this statement is that the Roman imperial system was inherently unsustainable and would inevitably collapse under incompetent leadership.

Let’s break this down: I defined the Roman Imperial System as being the political structure of the Caesars that was born from individual political opportunism within the oligarchy of the Roman Republic. Beginning with Scipio, continuing with Sulla and Caesar, and finally coming to a head under Augustus, the Emperor was the most popular politician, chief military commander, top religious leader, godfather of all bureaucratic institutions, and like a custodian for greater Roman society. This is different from any other king of kings only in how the position of emperor developed, which was gradually; both society and the political ecosystem shifted over time to accommodate the position of sole leader of Rome. 

From what I understand, Rome fell for the following reasons: Constant power struggles stemming from succession crises, palace coups and tyrannical leadership created a late roman society that was constantly devastated, and cynical towards its administration. The position of emperor was not as prestigious as it once was, the elites refused to pay their taxes, society became less martial and more dependent on mercenaries, and strong institutions became harder to centrally operate. This resulted in barbarian settlement/coups, and abandonment of the west by the intact eastern governments. Rome as a whole society was permanently fractured and transformed into what would become medieval europe, and pre islamic africa and asia. 

However, I think that this process began not because of a series of individual failures by emperors and other political leaders, but because of failures inherent to the early Roman imperial system. 

Working backwards, what ultimately began the political crisis was the inability of the Julio Claudian dynasty to consistently produce effective leaders, which I will concede to be personal failures (banishing a potential heir for example was probably not the best idea). This was especially an issue for the Roman Empire because Augustus’ position of Princeps (and the political system that adapted around it) required that a competent leader be in charge and was especially vulnerable when a weak leader was in charge. Not only did the Emperor have to maintain control of the military and Praetorian Guard, but he needed to keep control of the senate and make sure his patrons’ interests were guaranteed. Although he had control over Rome, the Emperor still functioned like a politician. This I think makes the position of Roman Emperor especially vulnerable when a weak or despised emperor is in control. For example, Tiberius was Emperor after the divine Augustus, inheriting the position at its greatest prestige, but ended up smothered in his own bed because the powers that be considered Caligula a better leader (regardless of whether he was going to actually die of natural causes). 

I believe that it was easier for dissenters to challenge the emperor in the Roman Empire than other empires like those in China, because of its republican roots. Because it was necessary to maintain the republic aesthetic, the early Roman emperor was beholden to more special interests than other emperors for various reasons, mostly financial. As a result, unstable emperors or unstable times were greater threats to the Roman political system, so ultimately the entire government was determined by whoever controlled the loyalty of the palace guard and/or a plurality of the army. Because of this reality and dynastic succession problems, the crisis of the third century would begin Rome’s decline. Imo Augustus should’ve centralized the position of the emperor through the strengthening of the imperial institutions beyond the personal patronage networks but in a way to maintain a republican veneer. Whether it’s possible, I’m not sure. This is why I believe that the Roman Empire was destined to fail from the beginning 

(Also I don’t think size or lack of cultural homogenization played as much of a role in Rome’s downfall, I see Rome’s borders as more a result of technological limitations such as communication and troop movement than because of political weakness. The Roman Republic was diverse to begin with and had limited Italian citizenship, let alone provincial. The Empire was simply a scaled up version of this model)",0.0

There was a lack of a cohesive attitude, especially in the US, of ""Stand and fight together"".  While a large portion did just that, other factions showed misunderstanding and/or mistrust which was arguably projected from the highest levels.  When vaccines became widely available not enough people were vaccinated fast enough.  Because there was a sizeable subset of people who either would not or could not get vaccinated COVID has continued to spread and mutate.  It would've continued infecting people had everyone gotten fully vaccinated simultaneously, just at a much slower and lower rate and with much less severity.  Consequently this would've slowed further mutations.

Now the Omicron variant is here with several mutations to its spike proteins that may enable it avoid existing antibodies created by current vaccines or antibodies from having a different variant of COVID.  Its still being researched though.  Even if a booster is made that is highly effective against Omicron, that same sizeable subset of people will remain a playground in which the COVID virus can mutate further.  Continuing mutations will keep COVID going until what will have to be the most advanced vaccine ever created can effectively neutralize the virus as well as any possible future mutations, which may not be possible.

Just as with Influenza, we may end up with ""COVID/Flu season"" and yearly boosters to try to mitigate the spread.  Masks will and should continue to be ""highly encouraged"" for everyone unless research (the real kind, not the Google kind) can prove vaccinated people are at minimal to statistically no risk of carrying and transmitting COVID.

Back in late 2020 to mid-2021 I didn't like people saying ""This is the new normal"".  I really believed it was just a temporary shift in the norm.  Now I think that shift will be with us longer than I or others anticipated.

Things I am not trying to say surreptitiously or unknowingly:

1. *We're too far gone so why bother getting vaccinated or boosters now?*  Everyone who is able to should get vaccinated and available boosters.  Quite frankly its about the only way we can hope to rid ourselves of COVID some day.
2. *Everything should revert back to pre-COVID ways.*  I'm grateful to see everyone who continues to do what they can to prevent possibly spreading COVID.  Pretending like it's not here and reverting back to pre-COVID behaviors and days would just enable new variants to spread across the world.

Now as per my opinion on abortion, the woman should have complete right on whether to keep the child or not. But at this stage, if she does decide to keep the child, I think the man should get a choice to be involved in any way at all or not (financially or otherwise). 

I say this because of the following:

1) If it was the opposite case, that the man wanted the child and the woman didn't, since I am pro-choice, the man has no place to repeal. It sucks but that's it. Men just have to suck it up. So in the other situation, men should get some choice because they are sucking it up here. 

2) For the case under consideration, first remember that the pregnancy is the result of consensual sex so both parents are equally responsible for the child. Now if the woman wants it and the man doesn't, it should still be the woman's choice to bring the child into the world. But provided the pregnancy was discovered at a stage at which it is not complicated to abort, the man should have a say in whether he wants to be involved or not. Now the woman has to decide between aborting (which I am assuming is not a huge deal for this case in particular), and raising a child without a father or financial support. It's a choice and if the woman chooses the latter, they have to suck it up. Like men did in (1).


Now this assumes that a lot around the abortion. Limited research of mine in asking a couple of my female friends, I learnt that these meds are supposed to cause miscarriage and the woman bleeds for a few weeks in the best cases and there are very minor chances of serious side effects like infertility and cancer. I am arguing that the difficulty of the best case is definitely not even comparable to how much financial stress child support is, and the worst case side effects chances are less than the chances of financial ruins for the average man. 


While writing this I did come up with a possible argument and my rebuttal for that. If the woman chooses to bring the child into the world, the kid has to grow up without a father and that sucks. But it was the mothers decision to let that happen. Again remember, we are asking the woman to suck it up in this case because she did have a real choice for abortion while in case (1) the father didn't even get a choice and he had to suck it up. So it still is more favourable for the woman.",49.0
571,t3_rbtpyy,CMV: People who make their own birthdays a big thing a narcissists.,"Ever since I was a kid I always found it very weird (and annoying) when somebody makes it very well known that it is their birthday, birthday week or birthday month. And when that information is tossed around as an excuse to either be given something or to not do something is pretty annoying and off putting for me.

Of coarse people should celebrate their birthday! I believe celebrations are a great thing! But when I hear someone say “I can’t believe I’m working on my birthday” or “I don’t wanna do that because it’s my birthday” I immediately get annoyed. If it’s so important for you to do absolutely nothing on your birthday then you should have asked for the day off, not walk around work all day complaining that you’re doing something you don’t wanna do on a random day not too many other truly care about.

I don’t get it. 

I once had an Aunt who refused to watch my sister and I while my mom (her sister in law) was in the hospital because “it’s my birthday and I don’t do anything on my birthday” which may have left a sour taste in my mouth. With that being said I still run across these people at work and in my personal life as well so these people do exist.

I’ve been working since I was 14 and my birthday has fallen on a work day for me every year for the past 15. It’s not like we don’t celebrate my birthday just because I’m at work that day, we just celebrate early or later in the week. 

Sure, birthdays are cool and all. But are they really an excuse to be self centered all day and be a burden to others",49.0
572,t3_rbsksm,CMV: the “over exposure” argument is a crappy argument and a piece of media gaining mainstream popularity or being plastered everywhere shouldn’t effect how much you like or dislike it,"I see this argument a lot, with stuff like marvel, frozen, Star Wars, and trendy indie games where people either begin to dislike things like these that they once enjoyed or judge them negatively without having experiencing them for themselves because of “over exposure” people complain about how they see these things everywhere and how annoying it is that it’s all over the place and I get that it can certainly be a little much but I never understood why it sours their perspective of the thing in question. At times it kinda feels like some people are just trying to be contrarian or are bitter that something they don’t like gained popularity. For my entire life Batman and Spider-Man have been super overexposed to the point where you can’t go to a public place without seeing them to some degree but that doesn’t stop me from liking them. I remember in 2015 you couldn’t look at YouTube without seeing a million obnoxious clickbait videos about five nights at Freddys but that never impeded my enjoyment of the series. The two biggest surprises in the movie alien that were heavily built up throughout the movie have been completely and thoroughly spoiled by pop culture but that doesn’t stop it from being my favorite movie or being a beloved classic to this day. From my personal perspective if I enjoy something and it gains extreme popularity I’m happy that it’s getting a lot of recognition and that there’s no shortage of people to talk about it with, and if something I hate becomes widely popular I’m not really bothered by it because I’m glad that other people can get something out of it that I didn’t and in the age of the internet I have no problem just finding online communities to talk about the stuff that I do like. I’m not meaning to imply that other opinions are wrong or invalid at all, I just personally never understood why overexposure effects peoples opinion on things but it’s a viewpoint I hear a lot and maybe there’s something I’m missing here and I hope to gain a new perspective :)",0.0

Sure there's nothing wrong with that. It is more expensive than buying a used car from a certified dealer that has been inspected by your mechanic or even a new car. Although the used car bit doesn't necessarily apply in recent times given the used car shortage. 

Also if that is the case you could easily make more money if you buy a new car and then resell it in two years. 

That is more inconvenient which is why the only benefit of leasing is the comfort of knowing that you don't have to go through the trouble of selling the car back to someone, even though this would save you more money in the long run. 

When you lease a car you are paying money to not keep the car. Renting is always more expensive than buying, because at the end of your rental period, you have 0 assets. At the end of your financing you at least still have a car left, even if it is a depreciating asset.

578,t3_rbgean,CMV: Moral realism is true,"**The process of elimination argument for moral realism:**

Premise 1. Moral realism is one of four logically exhaustive alternatives. Either at least some moral claims refer to a property or nothing does, and either the property depends on observers or it does not. 

Premise 2. The logically exhaustive alternatives to moral realism are false. At least some moral claims refer to a property, and the property does not depend on observers. 

Conclusion 3. Therefore, moral realism is true. 

**Premise 1** is trivially obvious. If we say moral statements don’t purport to refer to a property at all, then we have ethical non-cognitivism (NC). 
If we say moral statements purport to refer to a property, but nothing has that property, then we have nihilism. If we say moral statements purport to refer to a property, some things have that property, but the property depends on observers, then we have subjectivism. Finally, if we say moral statements purport to refer to a property, some things have that property, and that property doesn’t depend on observers, then we have moral realism. Those are all of the possibilities. 

I recommend breaking the question up into its discrete stages and evaluating each claim on its own in order to decide on your meta theory of morals. That is, first try to decide whether you think moral statements refer to something, then try to determine whether anything has the property in question, then whether it is observer-dependent.

**Ethical Non-Cognitivism** 

i. Ethical statements do not purport to refer to a property/attribute/characteristic. Ethical statements are neither true nor false. Eg., to say ""Murder is wrong"" is really to say ""boo murder"" or ""ewe! Murder!"" (Ethical Non-cognitivism)

*The Problem With Non-Cognitivism:*

Pleasure is good. 

How should we understand that statement? The most straightforward answer is the cognitivist one. Ethical cognitivism is the view that evaluative statements like 'Pleasure is good' assert propositions, which can be either true or false, just like the statements 'The sky is red' and 'Weasels are mammals.' Given this, the most straightforward account of what the word 'good' is doing in the sentence is this: there is a property, goodness, which the word refers to, and the sentence ascribes that property to pleasure. 

Non-cognitivists deny that 'good' denotes a property, and they deny that 'Pleasure is good' asserts anything in the way that 'Weasels are mammals' does. It is thus up to them to give us an alternative account of the meaning of 'Pleasure is good'.

I begin with a simple but crucial observation for the debate about ethical cognitivism. The observation is that the issue at hand is empirical. Cognitivism and non-cognitivism are competing claims about the current meaning and function of evaluative language. Noncognitivists are not advocating a change in how we use language-that would just amount to an effort to change the subject. 

They are trying to describe how evaluative language actually works. And claims of this sort are empirical. Imagine someone maintaining that the word 'duck' means 'four-legged animal'. This hypothesis has testable predictions: for example, that typical English speakers (competent in the use of these words) would not call anything a 'four-legged animal' unless they would also call it a 'duck'. We can test this prediction by, for example, asking some competent speakers whether they would call a cat a 'four-legged animal', and also whether they would call it a'duck'.

My methodology is roughly this. There are some sentences that are uncontroversially assertive-sentences that ethical cognitivists and non-cognitivists alike would take to assert propositions. There are other sentences that are uncontroversially non-assertive. We can identify features of the former that do not belong to the latter, and see whether evaluative statements have those features. The evidence I shall cite is straightforwardly available to any competent English speaker. Nor can its relevance be easily disputed. Doubtless some will dispute whether the evidence is sufficient to reject non-cognitivism, but even non-cognitivists admit that it counts against their theory.

There are several features characteristic of proposition-expressing
sentences, all of which evaluative statements have: 

**(a) Evaluative statements take the form of declarative sentences,** rather than, say, imperatives, questions, or interjections. 'Pleasure is good' has the same grammatical form as 'Weasels are mammals'. Sentences of this form are normally used to make factual assertions. In contrast, the paradigms of non-cognitive utterances, such as 'Hurray for x' and 'Pursue x', are not declarative sentences.

**(b) Moral predicates can be transformed into abstract nouns**, suggesting that they are intended to refer to properties; we talk about 'goodness', 'rightness', and so on, as in 'I am not questioning the act's prudence, but its rightness'.

**(c) We ascribe to evaluations the same sort of properties as other propositions.** You can say, 'It is true that I have done some wrong things in the past', 'It is false that contraception is murder', and 'It is possible that abortion is wrong'. 'True', 'false', and 'possible' are predicates that we apply only to propositions. No one would say, 'It is true that ouch', 'It is false that shut the door', or 'It is possible that hurray'.

**(d) All the propositional attitude verbs can be prefixed to evaluative statements.** We can say, 'Jon believes that the war was just', 'I hope I did the right thing', 'I wish we had a better President', and 'I wonder whether I did the right thing'. In contrast, no one would say, 'Jon believes that ouch', 'I hope that hurray for the Broncos', 'I wish that shut the door', or 'I wonder whether please pass the salt'. The obvious explanation is that such mental states as believing, hoping, wishing, and wondering are by their nature propositional: To hope is to hope that something is the case, to wonder is to wonder whether something is the case, and so on. That is why one cannot hope that one did the right thing unless there is a proposition-something that might be the case-corresponding to the expression 'one did the right thing'.

**(e) Evaluative statements can be transformed into yes/no questions:** One can assert 'Cinnamon ice cream is good', but one can also ask, 'Is cinnamon ice cream good?' No analogous questions can be formed from imperatives or emotional expressions: 'Shut the door?' and 'Hurray for the Broncos?' lack clear meaning. The obvious explanation is that a yes/no question requires a proposition; it asks whether something is the case.

A prescriptivist non-cognitivist might interpret some evaluative yes/no questions as requests for instruction, as in 'Should I shut off the oven now?' But other questions would defy interpretation along these lines, including evaluative questions about other people's behavior or about the past-tWas it wrong for Emperor Nero to kill Agrippina?' is not a request for instruction.

**(f) One can issue imperatives and emotional expressions directed at things that are characterized morally.** If non-cognitivism is true, what do these mean: 'Do the right thing.' 'Hurray for virtue!' Even more puzzlingly for the non-cognitivist, you can imagine appropriate contexts for such remarks as, 'We shouldn't be doing this, but I don't care; let's do it anyway'. This is perfectly intelligible, but it would be unintelligible if 'We shouldn't be doing this' either expressed an aversive emotion towards the proposed action or issued an imperative not to do it.

**(g) In some sentences, evaluative terms appear without the speaker's either endorsing or impugning anything,** yet the terms are used in their normal senses. This is known as the Frege-Geach problem and forms the basis for perhaps the best-known objection to noncognitivism.

**The ""Error Theory"" (""Nihilism"")**

ii. Ethical statements refer to a property, but nothing has this property. All (first-order, positive) moral statements are false, even though they try to assert what is the case about the world. Ethical statements really are trying to talk about what is positively the case about the world, but they are mistaken to do so because there just isn't anything moral that is positively the case about the world. (Error Theory / Nihilism)

*The Problem With Nihilism:*

If something appears to be the case, then in the absence of specific reasons for doubting it, one is entitled to believe that it is the case. This is the thesis of ""phenomenal conservatism"" in the philosophy of knowledge, and I think that when it is interpreted charitably we can see that it is the only possible basis for knowledge that exists. 

Think about how you actually form beliefs when you’re pursuing the truth. You do it based on what seems true to you. Now, there are some cases where beliefs are based on something else. For instance, there are cases of wishful thinking, where someone’s belief is based on a desire; you believe P because you want it to be true. But those are not the cases where you’re seeking the truth, and cases like that are generally agreed to be unjustified beliefs. So we can ignore things like wishful thinking, taking a leap of faith, or other ways of forming unjustified beliefs. 

With that understood, your beliefs are based on what seems right to you. ​You might think: “No, sometimes my beliefs are based on reasoning, and reasoning can often lead to conclusions that initially seem wrong.” But that’s not really an exception to my claim. Because when you go through an argument, you’re still relying on appearances. Take the basic, starting premises of the argument – by stipulation, we’re talking about premises that you did not reach by way of argument. 

To the extent that you find an argument persuasive, those premises seem correct to you. Each of the steps in the argument must also seem to you to be supported by the preceding steps. If you don’t experience these appearances, then the argument won’t do anything for you. So when you rely on arguments, you are still, in fact, relying on appearances. ​Notice that all this is true of epistemological beliefs just as much as any other. For instance, beliefs about the source of justification, including beliefs about PC itself, are based on appearances. The people who accept PC are those to whom it seems right. The people who reject PC do so because it doesn’t seem right to them, or because it seems to them to conflict with something else that seems right to them. ​

Now, in general, a belief is justified only if the thing it is based on is a source of justification. So if you think that appearances are not a source of justification, then you have a problem: Since that belief itself is based on what seems right to you, you should conclude that your own belief is unjustified. That’s the self-defeat problem. ​If you want to avoid self-defeat, you should agree that some appearances (including the ones you’re relying on right now) confer justification. If you agree with that, it is very plausible that the appearances that confer justification are the ones that you don’t have any reasons to doubt – which is what PC says. ​You might try adding other restrictions. Suppose, e.g., that you said that only abstract, intellectual intuitions confer justification, and sensory experiences do not. (External world skeptics might say that.) 

You could claim that this view itself is an intuition, not something based on sensory experience, so it avoids self-defeat. It is, however, pretty arbitrary. If you accept one species of appearances, why not accept all? There is no obvious principled rationale for discriminating. ​Some philosophers hold that appearances provide justification for belief, but only when one first has grounds for believing that one’s appearances in a particular area are reliable. E.g., color appearances provide justification for beliefs about the colors of things, provided that you know your color vision is reliable. ​I disagree; I don’t think one first needs grounds for thinking one’s appearances are reliable. I think we may rely on appearances as long as we don’t have grounds for thinking they aren’t reliable. If you require positive evidence of reliability, then you’re never going to get that evidence, for the reasons given by the skeptic (the threat of regress or epistemic circularity). 

**The main reason for rejecting nihilism is its extreme initial implausibility.** Take an uncontroversial moral statement, the most obvious you can think of – say, “You shouldn’t torture babies for fun.” That is extremely plausible on its face; it is indeed difficult to think of any statement that is more plausible. The nihilist wants us to reject that statement – he says it’s false that you shouldn’t torture babies for fun – on the basis of the sort of arguments discussed above. No philosopher has come up with any premises that are more obvious than that that could be used to argue against it. Suppose the nihilist uses the premises “Moral values are weird” and “Weird things don’t exist”. Well, those are much less obvious than “You shouldn’t torture babies for fun.” So they couldn’t be used to refute the proposition that you shouldn’t torture babies for fun. Which should we reject? Whichever one is the least initially plausible (the least obvious on its face).

Anyway, PC is a good epistemological theory because it provides a simple, unified explanation for all or nearly all of the things we initially (before encountering skeptical arguments and such) thought were justified. It accounts for our knowledge of the external world, our knowledge of mathematics and other abstract truths, our knowledge of moral truths, our knowledge of the past, and so on. These are all things that philosophers have had a hard time accounting for, and it is very hard to find a theory that gives us all of them. At the same time, it is not overly permissive or dogmatic, because it allows appearances to be defeated when they conflict with other appearances. 

**Subjectivism**

iii. Ethical statements refer to property, some things have that property, but it depends on observers. Ethical statements are sometimes true, but their truth depends on the attitudes of observers. (Subjectivism) 

*The Problem With Subjectivism:*

The main argument for subjectivism is **the argument from disagreement**; namely, people seem to reach different conclusions about morality in different societies. It's worth pointing out that **there is disagreement about the argument from disagreement**; that is, most people appear to believe that disagreement *does not* undermine mind-independent moral facts, so to whatever it counts for, it counts against itself. 

There are two other problems with this argument (or maybe a single, two-part problem): First, there has actually been very wide disagreement about many non-moral matters of fact. Different cultures, in addition to having different practices and norms, also have drastically different views about things like medicine, the origin of the Earth, the structure of the cosmos, how many gods there are (if any), what the gods want, and so on. (Examples: They might think that diseases are caused by evil spirits, rather than by germs; that Earth was created by some gods, rather than by gravitational accretion; that the Sun orbits the Earth rather than the other way around.) 

No one concludes that therefore all those things are entirely dependent on our attitudes and that there are no objective facts about them. ​Granted, there has been more convergence on scientific beliefs in modern times – that is, societies that are exposed to modern science and under its influence tend to agree on the origin of the Earth, the structure of the cosmos, and so on. 

But this brings us to the second problem for the relativist’s argument: The same is true of morality. The same societies that have converged in their scientific beliefs (technologically and economically advanced societies) are also converging in their values: They are moving toward liberal, democratic values. E.g., they have been moving and continue to move more toward belief in equality, respect for the dignity of the individual, opposition to needless violence, and so on. (Most primitive societies are extremely illiberal.)

The societies that continue to have very different values from ours tend to be primitive societies – those are the ones that anthropologists are always raising to show widely different cultures – and they have very different descriptive beliefs from us as well. So if you don’t think that descriptive facts are subjective or relative, you shouldn’t conclude that moral facts are subjective or relative either. ​The above doesn’t prove that subjectivism is false. But it shows that the leading arguments for it don’t work; they don’t give us any good reason to believe it.

We turn now to the case against subjectivism. Imagine that you live in Nazi Germany. Your society approves of rounding up Jews and sending them to concentration camps. According to cultural relativism, what is morally right is what society approves of. Therefore, according to cultural relativism, it is morally right for you to help round up Jews to send them to concentration camps. Meanwhile, people like Oskar Schindler, who tried to save Jews from the concentration camps, would have to be judged as villains. 

This, to put it mildly, does not seem correct. **It is in fact hard to think of how a theory about morality could go more wrong than that.** ​A similar point applies to a more individualistic subjectivism which holds that what is right for an individual is whatever that individual approves of. Just add to the above example the stipulation that you yourself happen to be a Nazi at the time. 

Then the subjectivist view implies that it is morally right for you to round up Jews, and it would be wrong for you to instead try to help them. ​The point can be generalized to any subjectivist view. Suppose the subjectivist view says: x is right if and only if: G takes A toward x. where G is some person or group and A is some attitude. Then imagine a case where G takes A toward something horrible – say, torturing babies for fun. 

The theory implies that in that situation (when G takes that attitude), it is morally right to torture babies for fun. But obviously that isn’t right. So the theory is false. ​Notice, btw, how the Nazi argument above is just an instance of this: Cultural relativism says that x is right if and only if society takes the attitude of approval toward x. Then for x, you could plug in the act of sending Jews to concentration camps, and the theory says: If society approves of sending Jews to concentration camps, then doing so is morally right.

**Moral Realism**

iv. Ethical statements refer to a property, some things have that property, this property does not depend on observers, and the property is reducible. So, ethical truth exists, but it is reducible to natural facts. (Ethical Naturalism)

v. Ethical statements refer to a property, some things have that property, this property does not depend on observers, and the property is not reducible to natural facts. (Ethical Non-Naturalism)

(iv. and v. are only stated for context. Whether you think these observer-independent properties consist in—natural features or non-natural features—is technically another point of divergence, but that would be a disagreement between moral realists). 

**Further Objections to Moral Realism:**

**Q1:** *What would it even mean for something to be wrong? I have a hard time imagining it.* (Extreme practical skepticism)

*Reply:* Should you torture a man who is unable to react due to a paralytic drug on an island somewhere that you won't get caught? 

Let's consult the possible reasons not to: is it aesthetically revolting or appealing to do so? Let's say no. Okay, then is there a practical, self-interested reason not to? Well, presuming I'm not a sadist, I can't think of one. I guess I should be indifferent to whether I do or don't, in that case. But wait. It still seems like I shouldn't, that I should not merely be indifferent to whether I torture this person. Strange. There must be some other-regarding reason not to.... I wonder what that could be.

Moreover, even if I *did* think it would feel good, or be beautiful, it still seems like I shouldn't. But why? I think that if, at this point, you still sense that there is a reason not to, what you are sensing is a moral reason. We could say there is a preferential reason not to, but in that case, it seems we would still have a reason not to do it if we happened to prefer to do it anyway. My mere preference to cause immense suffering to a defenseless person seems insufficient to justify doing so. 

You could say ""perhaps there is an emotional reason,"" but it depends on what we mean by ""emotion,"" which I think will collapse into either of the three types of reasons (practical, aesthetic, and moral). If we mean ""to prevent guilt,"" then I'm not sure what ""guilt"" is except a reaction to one's perceived failure to conform to the right moral rules; and if it is something else, like a negative state you don't want to experience for your own benefit, then I fail to see the difference between this and a ""practical"" reason. 

If what we mean by an emotional reason is ""to prevent sadness on my part,"" we can imagine that I won't be made to feel sad (perhaps the paralytic agent depersonalizes the experience, or I had a lot to drink recently and can't seem to feel sad even if I felt like I ""should"" or wanted to), and notice that it still seems like we shouldn't. Moreover, when we imagine someone else doing this (torturing the man because they don't feel sad by doing so), we still sense that that person has done something they shouldn't have. 

But in that case if by ""emotional"" we mean ""some other reason beyond practical and aesthetic reasons not to torture the man, including the practical reason of not wanting to feel bad about ourselves or to feel negative states of consciousness, such that it is still something we shouldn't do even if we were not to feel those things or felt their opposites,"" then I think we are just talking about moral reasons for action. **An other-regarding reason for action that is not merely a matter of practicality or beauty or a personal preference** *just is* a moral reason, and something to which that reason applies would be something with a moral property. This is what is meant by the claim that some things are wrong. 

**Q2:** *But what even is ""goodness/badness/wrongness/rightness""?* 

Let's say there are two orders of moral claims: proximate and ultimate ones. Proximate claims are claims like ""X is wrong because the morally relevant factors characterize X"" (which just depends on your normative theory--consequentialism, deontology, and whatever factors are thought to have moral significance within either). If you ask ""what happens when X is actually false,"" in this case it's because those factors aren't actually present in the ways one thought they were. Factors like suffering/pain/self-ownership/whatever. 

The second-order, ultimate claim would be ""When those factors apply in such and such a way, X is wrong/right,"" of which you could ask ""well, why is it that when the factors are arranged in any particular way, things can be wrong or right?"" That's what I take to be meant by someone asking ""why is goodness good?"" or ""what is goodness?""

If you are asking it in the second sense, the sense of ""what does it mean for anything to be wrong at all,"" then the only possible answer is to produce examples of wrong things and hope that they will engage your intuitions in a way that allows you to see what is meant. **I think that's the only psychologically possible way you can conclude that a discrete category of things exists based on experience.** If you comprehended my reply to Q1, then you have already identified this category of things in your own experience. 

I believe this is true of everything, from ""what is redness"" to ""what is sensory experience"": once you strip it down into its most fundamental formulation, a category will merely refer to a pattern of examples in the world which an observer will either recognize or fail to recognize. What are physical objects? They're things we know about through direct experience of our senses. What is logic, or mathematics, or memory? Things we know through direct experience that happens to be non-sensory. 

**Q3:** *But we can't ""check"" intuitions.*

Some object that intuition is not an acceptable way of forming beliefs because there is no way of checking a particular intuition to see whether it’s really true, and thus no way of knowing whether intuition in general is reliable. (Some would say this about intuition in general; others would only say it about ethical intuition.) ​This is false in one sense but true in another. If you’re allowed to consult other intuitions – both your own and other people’s – then you can check on a particular intuition. For instance, if I intuit that murder is wrong, I can “check’ that by asking whether other people also intuit that. I can also see whether my intuition that murder is wrong is consistent with my other ethical intuitions (say, my intuition that it’s wrong to cause harm for no reason, my intuition that life is valuable, and so on). 

So it’s just false that you can never check on an intuition. Many intuitions can be tested in these ways and will in fact pass the tests. ​Of course, some would object to the idea of using intuitions to check other intuitions. If you’re not allowed to consult other intuitions, then indeed you generally cannot check on a particular intuition. That’s the sense in which it’s true that you can’t check intuitions. However, in that sense, you cannot check on any of the other basic types of cognition that we rely on either. For instance, there is no way of checking on observations made by the five senses, without relying on other observations. 

If you want to check on the reliability of your senses, you could, say, ask other people whether they perceive the same things you do. But that would depend upon your perceiving those other people, perceiving the answers they give, and trusting those perceptions. A similar point applies to basically any test you might try to do. ​Similarly, if some skeptic comes along and doubts whether memory is reliable, you have no way of settling that doubt without relying on memory. Let’s say I want to test my memory. I seem to remember where I live. So I go to the address that I remember my house is at, and, lo!, I find a house there that looks just like the one I remember. I go inside, and there is a bunch of stuff there that looks just like the stuff I remember. Etc. This suggests that my memory is reliable. 

The inability to check intuition without relying on intuition is not a major problem, since **we similarly cannot check on memory without relying on memory, on observation without relying on observation, or on reason without relying on reason.**

**Q4:** *But moral values are really weird.* 

Okay, I think this might be what is really motivating nihilists and other anti-realists: Objective values are weird. In fact, one famous argument against moral realism is officially named “the argument from queerness”. If there are objective values, they are very different from all the things that science studies. It’s weird that they’re not part of our best scientific theories about the world. It’s weird that we can’t detect them by the five senses, nor by any scientific instruments. People will say stuff like this in conversation, though usually not in print (actually, they usually give even less explanation than I just did).

Aside: Variations of the argument from weirdness appear all over philosophy. People say that moral value is weird, the soul is weird, libertarian free will is weird, abstract objects (numbers, sets, etc.) are weird, synthetic a priori knowledge is weird – and therefore, that these things don’t exist. This sort of “argument” seems to have an enormous impact on the prevailing philosophical views. I personally think it’s an embarrassment that philosophers rest so much weight on such a vague, inarticulate “argument”.

Let’s think about what the charge of weirdness really means. First interpretation: Maybe it means “counter-intuitive”. In that case, the premise of the argument from weirdness is just false: Objective values are not counter-intuitive at all. You can tell this from the fact that almost all societies throughout history seem to have regarded values as objective, most thinkers in the history of ethics have done likewise, and even the nihilists themselves admit that moral realism is built into ordinary language. (The standard nihilist view is that words like “good”, “bad”, “right”, and “wrong” are intended to refer to objective moral properties. That’s why the nihilists think that all moral claims are false.) 

So it’s hard to see how you could claim that moral realism is counter-intuitive. By the way, you’ll find lots of much weirder things if you start studying modern physics. ​Second interpretation: Maybe weirdness just amounts to being very different from other things. But then, lots of things are weird in that sense. Matter, space, time, numbers, fields, and consciousness are all weird (different from other things). Why should we believe that weird things don’t exist? This is just a very lame argument.

Intuitionists like to compare ethics to mathematics. **Note: This does not mean that ethics is exactly like mathematics in all ways (if that were true, this wouldn’t be a comparison; ethics would just be mathematics).** Rather, we draw the comparison to highlight certain specific points. People sometimes ask, for example, where goodness is, or where it “comes from”. Goodness is not located anywhere, nor does it come from anywhere, any more than the number 2 is located or comes from somewhere. ​More importantly, people sometimes find ethical knowledge weird because it is not based on observation. But mathematics is not based on observation either. Mathematics starts from certain self-evident axioms, from which you can then infer further conclusions.

What is a “self-evident” proposition? Basically, it’s one that is obvious when you think about it, in a way that doesn’t require an argument; you can directly see that it’s true. For instance, that 3 is greater than 1, that the shortest path between two points is a straight line, or that if a=b and b=c, then a=c. ​Similarly, perhaps the field of ethics rests on self-evident ethical axioms. For instance, maybe it’s self-evident that enjoyment is good in itself; that one should not cause harm for no reason; or that if a is better than b and b is better than c, then a is better than c. ​Now, what is an “ethical intuition”? 
 
Essentially, an intuition is a mental state that you have in which something just seems true to you, upon reflecting on it intellectually, in a way that does not depend upon your going through an argument for it. An ethical intuition is just an intuition that’s about ethics. All the above are examples of intuitions. E.g., when you think about [3 &gt; 1], you should have a (mathematical) intuition that it’s true; when you think about [It’s wrong to cause harm for no reason], you should have an (ethical) intuition that that’s true. ​

Why should we believe our intuitions? In an earlier chapter, we discussed the principle that it is rational to assume that things are the way they appear, unless and until one has specific reasons to doubt this. This, I argue, is the foundation of all reasonable beliefs. That includes the beliefs that we get from perception, memory, introspection, and reasoning, as well as intuition – in all of these cases, we believe what we believe because it seems correct to us and we lack sufficient reasons to doubt it. So, that’s also why it makes sense to believe, for example, that it’s wrong to cause harm for no reason: That seems true, and we have no good reason to doubt it. 

I suspect that the main reason why many people are not comfortable embracing ethical intuitionism is that they vaguely sense that the view is “weird”. I think that is lame – I think that feeling of weirdness has no evidential value. So we should feel free to embrace the view that coheres with common sense ways of thinking about morality.

**TL;DR** Moral realism can be established by process of elimination because the set of (4) possibilities is knowable and exhaustive. The first of the three alternative theories of morals at the meta-level makes objectively false claims about the function of moral language (Non-Cog.). The second denies the thesis of Phenomenal Conservatism without offering an alternative account of how knowledge is possible, including the knowledge that PC is false (Error Theory). The third theory lacks motivation because disagreement does not impugn moral realism (after all, people *disagree* about whether disagreement matters to the truth of moral realism), it rests on premises more non-obvious than the conclusion it tries to cast doubt on, and it fails to capture widely shared and uncontroversial intuitions about the content of morality without explaining why counter-intuitiveness is acceptable (that is, without explaining why we should reject PC). The only alternative, moral realism, does not suffer from these fatal flaws and withstands other popular objections. Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that weird things do not exist, or that all categories of experience must have nonreferential, irreducible definitions--in fact, many weird things exist, and all fundamental categories refer to examples rather than stipulative criteria. As a result, we should conclude that moral realism is true until presented a specific reason to doubt it.",6.0
579,t3_rbf8u7,CMV: The cities we live in impact the outcomes and lives we have more than we realize," Hi All!

I occasionally write essays  to reflect my current thinking. One of my favorite things to disect is success and achievement. As I recently moved to New York from Canada, I thought about the role cities play in the lives of people. It is heavily influenced by Paul Graham.

In short, I think the cities we live in impact our lives and outcomes more than we realize. As such, picking where you live should be a deliberate choice. Curious to see if you all agree. 

\----

A city can be thought of as a living thing.

Each city has its own unique message, characteristics, and ambitions, and these make up its “personality.” ***Cities’ personalities should matter to us because they influence our behavior, shape who we are, and impact what we accomplish.***

Take New York, for example.

When you go to New York, you can feel the energy and buzz of the city. People walk around with a distinct ambition and as if they are always late. The grit, the hustle, and the idea that anything is possible are ever present. This energy is contagious, and you subconsciously begin to mirror it after spending a few hours in New York. This is one reason why people move to there to make their fortunes.

Let’s compare this to Maui. The subtle message you get from spending time in Maui is relaxed, casual, and slow-paced, which is mirrored in its energy. Someone who desires peace would feel at home in Maui but out of place in New York.

The cities we live in matter.

# What Makes a City?

When we think of the great cities of the world, what we are really thinking about are people. Cities are dense, messy, uncontrolled, and cosmopolitan gatherings of people. They are the collective personalities, ambitions, and values of the inhabitants who give each city its unique energy.

The great cities of the world have energies that are self-reinforcing. The energy and personality of each city are signals. These signals resonate with some people, who end up moving to these cities, but repel others, who find the energy unattractive. This strengthens the signals over time.

Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, highlights this beautifully by comparing Cambridge (Boston) to Berkley:

&gt;*“I’d always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place—that it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life in Berkeley is very civilized. It’s probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But it’s not humming with ambition. In retrospect, it shouldn’t have been surprising that a place so pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of life. Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge. The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.* ***You have to make sacrifices to live there. It’s expensive and somewhat grubby, and the weather’s often bad. So the kind of people you find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive, grubby place with bad weather.****”*

The notion of sacrifice is what makes a city’s energy self-reinforcing. By choosing to live in Cambridge, you are choosing education, access to world-class universities (MIT and Harvard are a stone’s throw away from each other), and learning over warm and sunny weather, sandy beaches, and a laid-back lifestyle. The odds are that the people who already live in Cambridge also share this value system, and if you’re deeply interested in moving to Cambridge, it’s because this message resonates with you.

**Cities and What We Accomplish**

How important is the city you live in with regard to achieving your goals, desires, and ambitions?

Our ability to transcend our environment through our own character and strength of mind is limited. Most people who accomplished great things were grouped in select cities over specific periods.

Let’s look at fifteenth-century Florence as an example.

Something was happening in Florence that was unique to the city. During this time, its inhabitants included Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Donatello, Brunelleschi, Verrocchio, and numerous other genius contributors to the Italian Renaissance.

The success and achievements of these Renaissance men are no longer happening now, so they couldn’t have been due to heredity. There are roughly 1,000 times more people alive in the United States right now compared to the number living in Florence during the fifteenth century. If DNA ruled, we would be witnessing thousands of Leonardos and Michelangelos walking among us. But we aren’t, and the reason is that you need more than innate talent—you need fifteenth-century Florence.

A community of talented people working together is incredibly powerful; genes count for little by comparison. Musician and theorist Brian Eno has a specific name for this: *scenius*. Scenius is defined as the intelligence and creativity of a community that are required to bring out individual genius. Eno describes it as follows: “If genius is the creative intelligence of an individual, scenius is the creative intelligence of a group.”

History is filled with numerous examples of scenius at work.

C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien frequently met at The Eagle and Child pub in Oxford, where they created three of the five best-selling fantasy novels of all time (*The Chronicles of Narnia*, *The Hobbit*, and *The Lord of the Rings*). A musical scenius was formed in eighteenth-century Vienna, where Mozart and Beethoven produced masterpiece after masterpiece. The most notable modern scenius is San Francisco/Silicon Valley, where ambitious people gather hoping to create the next billion-dollar company.

# City–Ambition Fit

The concept of scenius highlights that creative genius requires being in the right city with the right people at the right time. But what does this mean for everyday people like me? I am clearly not a genius, but what can I take away from the concept of scenius?

It’s clear that no matter how determined I am, the city I’m in will impact my outcomes. Each city will provide me with a different set of people to interact with and unique opportunities to capitalize on. Accomplishing my ambitions will be easier if they are aligned with the ambitions of the city you live in.

Consider if you had an idea for a crazy start-up like Airbnb. While it is commonly accepted now, inviting strangers into your home was initially off-putting for people. What city would be best to help you accomplish this seemingly ridiculous idea? Obviously, San Francisco.

The inhabitants of San Francisco have learned (sometimes the hard way by passing on crazy ideas) that ambitions people with big ideas can create billion-dollar companies. So, they are more likely to help you out—make a key introduction, write a cheque, or provide some much-needed encouragement. If you value working on your crazy ideas over everything else, you move to San Francisco and deal with the numerous drawbacks of the city.

The same idea applies to other great cities. If I told people in Vancouver that I wanted to start a hedge fund, I’d get funny looks. In New York, I might get a few LPs.

**Finding Your City**

Paul Graham thinks that you don’t need to be in a great city your whole life to benefit from it. It is in the early and middle stages of your career that you get the most value from a city. This is when you need similar-minded peers and encouragement the most. He highlights that the great Impressionist painters followed this typical pattern: “They were born all over France (Pissarro was born in the Caribbean) and died all over France, but what defined them were the years they spent together in Paris.”

**Where do I want to be?**

This is a question I wrestle with often. Especially as I weigh my ambition in one hand and quality of life and family responsibilities in the other. I suspect that others in my demographic—career-focused city dwellers—do as well.

I don’t have an answer for where I want to be in the long term. But for now, I am looking for my version of Paris.

580,t3_rbeyeu,CMV: Pirating media (mainly games) that is no longer in circulation isn't a crime,"My friend and I were recently having a conversation about some of our favorite games from the late 90s and early 2000s, reminiscing about the old days. Most all of them are no longer in circulation and many don't even have rumors about being remade or re-released. The consoles that they were sold for have since been discontinued. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now online, you can find so many emulators for Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, Playstation 1, etc. and you can find ROMs for various games that are no longer being made. You can even setup something like RetroPie on a Raspberry Pi and play all sorts of old games. However, if not mistaken, under copyright and trademark law, it is considered piracy to copy and use something without the proper license (e.g. you bought it).

I often wonder, why does anyone care? Like, I could see if it was a PS4 or PS5 game, a game still in circulation that the publishers can still make a profit off of. But a game that is no longer in print for a system that has long been discontinued, they've made all the money that they are going to make off of that property. 

I guess this could also extend to things like movies and maybe other media that has since gone out of circulation. Thoughts?

EDIT: to be clear, I know that it is considered a crime. I guess I should have worded it stating ""It Shouldn't Be Considered a Crime""",74.0
581,t3_rbbqwu,CMV: it is reasonable for engineering professors to occasionally include (exam/homework) problems they have not worked examples for.,"Edit: replace ""occasionally"" with ""regularly"", per the first delta awarded.

I'm not sure how clear that one-sentence summary was, but hopefully it'll be clearer here.  It comes up fairly frequently on r/EngineeringStudents, and I remember seeing it a few times in class, that a professor had an exam/homework problem where they hadn't worked a similar example in class; this seems to be regarded (by the students) as unacceptable.  Note that I'm *not* referring to problems where the relevant material hasn't been covered--just where the professor hasn't worked examples.  (The major time I recall seeing it in class, the relevant concept had definitely been covered in class--I had it in my notes, and I only took notes during lecture--and was on the equation sheet, but there was so much uproar that the professor ended up giving everyone full marks on that question.)

The implicit assumption seems to be that it's unfair to ask students to solve a specific sort of problem they haven't addressed before, even if they do have sufficient background to handle it.

This seems strange to me since applying known principles to novel problems seems to me to be the only way one can demonstrate genuine understanding (in this context).  With only problems where students have seen worked examples, one can plausibly just remember the steps to solve that specific category of problem, without necessarily understanding *why* they work.  A novel problem (within reason) requires students to reason about how the principles apply to the problem.

Three major caveats:

* This would be way too much work for an entire exam's worth of problems; I'm not saying *every* problem should be novel.
* This is mostly applicable to courses that are more focused on general principles; it could have some place in heavy applications courses, but those principles are often too complicated to work out on the fly in an exam setting.
* I don't mean a huge shift from what students are used to, just a moderately new thing.  In the major example I saw, it was ""take this thing you know how to do when the stresses are equal, but what if they aren't equal?"".

I'm reasonably confident in my reasoning, but there are enough people who disagree for me to suspect I might be missing something, and I've worked in research for a few years so that could skew my perspective (I'm used to novel problems).",31.0
582,t3_rbaust,CMV: Fixed prison sentences should be abolished in favour of a tiered system,"  I don’t know about other countries, but currently the prison system in the UK is broken. We have people being released that are in a worse state than when they went in with 29.2% of offenders reoffending within a year in 2018.

The system at the moment seems to be focused more on just removing people from society rather than rehabilitation or even any form of punishment (other than loss freedom). A lot of people are actually better off in prison and I’m sure that is true worldwide.

The idea of a fixed sentence is also a little strange. So, if I murder someone tomorrow and get lets say 25 years in prison. At the end of those 25 years, sometimes less with good behaviour, there is nothing to say that I need to be “cured” or have to prove in any way that I am safe to enter society other than not getting in trouble whilst in prison.

I suggest a system that aims to rehabilitate offenders so that those who get released have the best chance of being productive members of society and not ending up in the revolving door that so many get into.

I would have a tiered system of say 3 tiers (the details aren’t exactly important, it’s more the general idea):

Tier 1: Everyone enters on this level. This is almost like maximum security level, you are confined to your cell for 23 hours a day with an hour for exercise. As part of your sentencing you are given a set of therapies that you need to undergo. So drug or alcohol related therapies, anger management etc. This level is basically about working out level of risk and starting the road to rehabilitation.

Tier 2: Medium level security. Still undergoing therapies, but starting to have more freedom. Small groups of people grouped on their offense type so that group therapy can be a part of the process and those just entering can get encouragement from those about to move up.

Before moving to the next tier I do believe that there should be a minimum sentence served in either tier 1 or tier 2. So for example, there is a different length of time for someone who committed a petty crime compared to someone who committed a violent series of murders. Whilst I want to focus more on rehabilitation, punishment should also not be forgotten and is still an important part of this.

Tier 3: Looking at release. Tier 3 offenders are those that have finished their therapies and shown a real desire to change and move forwards with their lives. They will have access to larger groups of people and towards the very end of their time rather than just being released they start with day release, weekend release, work placements etc. to get a taste of what it’s like surviving in the real world.

Release: As partially touched on above, people won’t just be released from prison one day. It will be a gradual return to the community to make sure that everything is in place and regular check ups after release slowly lessening until say a year after the release date. 

There will also be a big assessment process with a seris of related professionals to judge whether someone is safe to move up a teir or to be released or if they need more time (similar to when someone is leaving a psychiatric hospital). This would also try and include a diverse group of pressionals to avoid as much as possible things like racism and other discrimination that is a big part of the prison system currently.

I think this would really help with recidivism rates as well as keeping the rest of society safer. I have thought of a few counterarguments already below and listed my reasons why I don’t think they are an issue.

What about wrongly accused people?

I actually think this system is more beneficial to wrongly accused people. Yes you will still have to go through the system, but at the moment you would anyway and if you went along with all the therapies and stayed out of trouble, you would probably be out sooner than if you went to prison for a fixed term.

What about people that cheat the system and get released early for “playing well-behaved”?

Again, this happens in the current system. There are people who will behave very well whilst in prison to then go straight back to offending once released. No system is perfect, and there will always be people that try to cheat it, doesn’t mean that we can’t try and make it better for everyone else.

I am interested to see what you think about this. I know in reality, a complete rehaul of the corrections system even in one country is probably not doable, but if it were, would something like this be a better option.",1.0
583,t3_rbaex6,"CMV: Without understanding basic economics, you're extremely likely to be wrong about policy","""Extremely likely"" requires some qualifiers:

1. Economics is about scarce resources that have alternative uses / consequences. 

2. Almost any policy is about scarce resources (I can't think of any that's not)

Examples: 

\- Climate change: if energy wasn't a scarce resource, we wouldn't burn fossil fuels and have to deal with the problem

\- Immigration: if you don't see how labor is a scarce factor in production, you wouldn't be able to understand benefits or costs to national welfare

\- Minimum wages: if you don't know what a downward sloping demand curve is and why it is important, you won't be able to understand nuanced arguments for and against

3. If you don't understand economics, you therefore won't be able to understand the potential consequence of most policies (or any I can think of)

4. If you can't understand consequences of policies, your judgement on whether or not a policy is desirable is much more likely to be mistaken

5. You can still make some moral arguments. But many moral arguments (e.g. different forms of consequentialism) require looking at consequences. If you can't look at consequences, you can't say whether other people invoking consequentialist moral arguments are right or wrong.

5.1. In practice, it seems to me almost anyone wants to make moral arguments and believe they are sufficient; but in fact most people don't know why or how these arguments lead to consequences

&amp;#x200B;

To CMV you can try to persuade me that ...

\- Economics is not NECESSARY to understand consequences. It's not enough to show that it's not SUFFICIENT. You can show e.g. that by using other sophisticated methods, you're able to understand the consequences of e.g. climate change just as well or better. Try to anticipate my point that a climate scientist saying that we shouldn't put more carbon into the atmosphere needs is coming short: he also has to say something meaningful how we prevent too much economic damage by doing so

\- Some kind of pure empiricism is enough to judge the consequences of policies, and this particular version of pure empiricism you like doesn't require any kind of economic theory 

\- Examples of non-economists that have been demonstrably right about policies that have large consequences, for systemic reasons that didn't require them to understand economics. 

\- There is something wrong with some of the basic concepts used, like ""economics"" or ""policy"".

\- The argument above is fallacious (e.g. proves too much, begs the question).

\- I'm missing something else that puts enough caveats on my use of the word ""extremely""

Caveats: 

\- I am not saying that economists get those questions right all or even most of the time. I think they are also likely to get those questions wrong most of the time (almost anyone gets abstract questions wrong most of the time), but they are far more likely to get them right than non-economists

\- There are lots of different kinds of economists (e.g. Marxist, neoclassical, Keynesian, behavioural). They all count to me insofar as they analyse the world in terms of material consequences; so if you're a Marxist economist who might have a totally different answer about what is the correct policy than a neoclassical economists, that's no principal objection against my proposition. 

\- I don't think you need to be a trained or academic economist; by reading the right books (it has to be systematic textbooks), you can get a basic understanding by investing about 50-100 hours or so 

\- I don't think people who don't know economics don't have anything interesting or relevant to say (I think e.g. David Graeber doesn't understand economics and is therefore extremely unlikely to be correct about policy, but he nevertheless has highly interesting and observant things to say)

\- It could be true that economists are the even greater danger than non-economists because they think they get things right where in fact they don't (""It's not what you don't know that kills you. It's what you do know that just ain't so.""). In practice, it seems to me though that non-economists have far less hesitation to propose woefully bad policies than economists. Economists rather try to prevent bad policies from happening rather than having any mistaken believes in ""good"" policies 

\- I do expect exceptions to the above, for example highly observant practitioners that don't need to learn economic principles from the book, but get them from ""real life""

\- I wouldn't post it under CMV if I wouldn't want to be proven wrong, I want to learn

a) what other powerful explanatory models are out there, and b) hear how policy wonks that don't make the effort to learn economics justify why they're not learning economics

\- Please don't get offended if I use strong language, just see it as an invitation to prove me wrong (the stronger the language I use, e.g. ""extremely unlikely"", the more likely I am to be wrong)",27.0
584,t3_rbaaor,CMV: Additional items that are included in food orders should not be charged to the customer when they decide not to order them,"So to sum everything up, I believe that when I pay for an item (specifically food) I should only pay for what I order. Here’s an example that I will continue to use throughout the post. Let’s say I order chicken wings. They come with sauce and ranch or blue cheese. But what if I want them plain (no sauce) and without ranch or blue cheese? The price does not get discounted for the stuff I take off. In addition let’s say that I want to order a burger and only a burger. But it comes with fries which I don’t want. It does not seem fair that I am getting charged for something that I am not paying for. Now I’m going to go through a list of counter arguments to make sure that I have addressed everything.

CA: Why should this only apply to food and not something else… say rent where utilities are included and I may want to opt out of them?

To me, I see food as being more likely to have different preferences whereas with rent, pretty much everyone needs electricity, heat, water, etc. It is also part of the agreement beforehand and in this case would be included as a convenience or it can attract people who may want to pay fixed costs for utilities for any reason. When it comes to food, I am effectively subsidizing those who like sauce/ranch with wings by ordering mine more expensive. Another example is if I need to order a table that I need to put together myself but I already have one leg. It doesn’t make sense to order a table with one leg missing just because I don’t need it. The extra effort to remove it from my order would not be worth the effort even if it means saving inventory.

CA: It’s cheap so why does it matter?

The specific wing example I gave is cheap. And even if it is that doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter. The cost of the extra items that come with can be removed easily. Even if it is like a 5 cent difference, then it is fine since it doesn’t take any extra labor to put the order in since most things are automated today. Sure when you pay for food you are also paying for labor and fixed costs which don’t change. That’s not to say that an item with less things included would be the same as one with everything included in it.

CA: Menu prices would be too confusing with this implemented

Menu prices should include what is most commonly ordered at the shop’s discretion. The option to remove things that are included are not necessary to include in the price. So the menus would look the same.

CA: But couldn’t someone order a pizza with no crust?

Some items should have things required so that customers don’t try to pull something like this.

CA: But what about the cost of labor and everything else that goes into the food?

Simply the cost of the unwanted items should be taken off the order as the labor is not measurable and fixed costs remain the same. So hypothetically if I order a pizza with nothing then I still pay for the oven, labor, brand, etc.

CA: But what if someone orders extra items or orders something well done? Should they also be charged for that?

Yes. And I don’t see a problem with that. Sauce and oven watching cost restaurants money too. It would likely be cheap, but the price is also automated so it doesn’t take extra labor to adjust the price.

CA: what about non-automated pricing?

This can remain the same. As right now there exists small restaurants that don’t have special requests coded into their pricing system and would be more of a hassle to adjust the price than to let it be.

585,t3_rb906r,"CMV: Star Trek Next Generation was the first mainstream US television show to explicitly embrace non-binary gender (as well as gender transitioning) in the 1992 episode ""The Outcast.""","In this episode from the 5th season, nearly 30 years ago, the USS Enterprise crew assist an androgynous, genderless humanoid species on a rescue mission. This species, the J'naii, evolved away from binary genders to reach a point without any male or female distinctions. Their way of life is described with full respect and seems to be fully embraced by the Enterprise crew, without any sense of prejudice or discomfort (except for Lieutenant Worf, who grows more open-minded by the end of the episode).

On this mission Commander Riker becomes emotionally and physically intimate with Soren, a member of the J'naii who identifies as female. This is frowned upon by her species, who view binary sex as ""primitive,"" and so she has had to live a life of secrecy to avoid cultural shaming, punishment, and psychotectic therapy (a kind of conversion ""therapy"" that would make someone no longer identify as male or female).

When her society learns of her affair with Riker, they bring charges against her for violating their way of life. Riker attempts to defend her by saying that he was the only one who made advances, but Soren stands up for herself in the court and says she is a woman and no longer wants to live a life of shame and secrecy. She says explicitly that she and others like her deserve respect---not a ""cure"" for their ""sickness.""

The overarching plotline shows compassion for both a nonbinary life as well as a person's journey of transitioning across the gender (or genderless) spectrum.

If there was another mainstream tv show that dealt with these issues prior to 1992, then it should be easy to change my view!!

Edit: Nobody has mentioned this yet, but I found a Jeffersons's episode, ""Once a Friend,"" in 1977 that also seems to engage the issue of gender transitioning.",19.0
586,t3_rb8n0p,CMV: Pro-Choice seems more evil and selfish compared to Pro-Life,"I feel so ignorant honestly, I genuinely want to know why pro-life is the worse alternative to pro-choice.

Pro-choice honestly seems a lot more selfish and evil than pro-life. Here's why I believe so.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Why should you be the one to decide another's life? From a purely logical standpoint, isn't that just stupid that you deem the child's life too ""harsh"" to continue while the child in question is completely unable to give their own thoughts or feelings? Especially when there are other options such as adoption that will give that child a chance to live their own lives despite your own lack of financial/mental stability?

\-Using the argument of rape and death. From my standpoint, if you have to use a very small sample of worst-case scenarios in order to justify your viewpoint, it already means your argument is flawed. This is the most common rebuttal to pro-life, which doesn't make sense to me because the most common reason for abortion is mostly purely selfish reasons, such as body changes, sickness, or even just wanting your normal food cravings back. Even in the most recent popular abortion posts I've seen, the most emphasized point was that they just didn't wanna struggle with the side effects of abortion, such as food aversions or illnesses. Seems kind of selfish you'd kill off a baby because you didn't want to be sick, but that's just my viewpoint and why I'm wanting to be enlightened.

\-Another point I see a lot is that people just cannot mentally handle giving away their baby, but my rebuttal is that, you can't handle giving away your baby but killing it is fine? I just don't understand

\-One last common point I see is that well it's not exactly alive yet, but it's not the lack of life you're looking at but the potential for life it has. It's the same reason the death of a baby is viewed much more tragically than the death of an old man, it has the potential to live on a long life and you started that chain of events, the process already started so by ending that process, you've basically killed the baby in my own view.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I'm asking the question so I'm completely open to what you guys want to add. Also, you can do whatever you want, I just want to know why pro-life is viewed so negatively despite it seeming that pro-choice is much more evil and selfish. Thank you

I am sorry if I'm taking forever to respond, there's a lot of you guys and I'm trying to give the proper full responses you all deserve  


Edit-  
I was able to be convinced and educated on pro-life vs pro-choice

587,t3_rb7yak,CMV: Blockchain has a very limited use,"I can say I'm quite familiar with blockchain, how it works and operates. Both my previous and my current jobs are with the blockchain, and I have some thoughts.

Although, there are really important features that blockchain provides (decentralization and smart contracts) it's rather limited, and it's often misused. For example, on my previous job we used blockchain platform to store and share documents. There is a huge flaw, there's just one miner. That means it's controlled from one place, and it's not decentralized whatsoever. At that point, it's easier to use plain backend to store and share documents in a much simpler way with the same level of decentralization. And this is how blockchain is often used. 

But even more importantly, blockchain is stupidly inefficient. You need tons and tons of computing power, consumption of electricity for blockchain to operate. It can be somewhat optimized by proof of stake instead of proof of work, sure, but there are other downsides, and it's still crazy inefficient. There is no way for it to be efficient. There should be no such thing as investment in crypto, just because all crypto is net negative. It doesn't produce any value, but wastes a lot of energy and computing power to operate. Although it does solve some problems, it does so in such a inefficient way, there's no point of using it. Nowadays, transactions got so expensive that even transferring money is too expensive. Well, it is designed to be this way. Secure, decentralized. But so inefficient that it's barely even useable. I don't see a lot of future of crypto. I imagine there are some use cases where blockchain is the best solution, but for most cases, blockchain isn't a solution.",20.0
588,t3_rb7ec1,CMV: pursuing Socialism or associated left-wing ideologies out of a desire to work less is missing the point of what those ideas are about,"**Edit: To clarify, I'm not saying that left-wing ideologies shouldn't advocate for better conditions for workers as that would make no sense, just that it is misguided to have as your main goal for supporting left-wing ideas the possibility to contribute less than what you are capable of.**

The word can meant a ton of different things, but to simplify, let's define our terms as a type of society where the means of production become collectively owned.

I obviously don't have hard stats but I don't think it's too controversial to say that many people are interested in left-wing ideas largely due to the prospect of not having to work or working far less. I agree with the argument that work is not inherently a good thing, but so long as we live in a world where it is an ugly necessity, it does not make sense to advocate for collective action while having as a fundamental goal the desire to escape from contributing your share.

One of the main guiding purposes behind socialism and associated ideas is to free people from the negative effects of capitalism and the alienation from work that occurs as a result. This isn't done so that people no longer have to contribute, but rather so that there is an alignment between effort, incentives, and contribution to the community. Instead of working to pay off landlords and owners as part of a treadmill, you work in a way that is socially useful. Instead of having to compete against workers to survive, and basing your efforts on how to extract the most profit, you engage in labor that serves a long term and collective purpose. Socialism is there to help make work rational and decrease economic parasitism from the higher classes, not replace it with a different sort of parasitism from the lower classes.

Of course, we can point out that this is rarely how it worked out (no pun intended) in the past, but that's not the point of this CMV. **I really** ***don't*** **want to discuss capitalism vs. socialism, but rather question the idea that socialism favors working less on a theoretical basis. Having better working conditions and a better work life balance can be a laudable goal and/or consequence of socialism, and ultimately technical progress can erase the need for work, but that is not the same thing as pursuing that ideology so that you don't have to work as much or can have a nice life without contributing much.** Solidarity is a two-way street, and if you get back from the community you should also endeavor to give as much back to the community, which includes proactively getting educated or trained in a collectively valuable skill and exercising it.

There's an important exception to my view: if you are no longer physically or mentally able to contribute, I don't think you should be expected to and I don't see an issue with the collective helping you out. But if you are of sound mind and body and refuse to contribute, then neither shall you eat.",9.0
589,t3_rb53qi,CMV: Not Allowing Religious Clothing In Schools With Uniforms Should Not Be Categorised As Discrimination,"Hello there. 

&amp;#x200B;

A while ago, I posted a CMV about hijab and other religious clothing being  allowed in schools with uniforms. I have changed my view on this and now I think they definitely SHOULD be allowed in schools with uniforms. 

However, this has raised another thought in my mind. Should banning religious clothing in school be categorised as discrimination on the grounds of religion? 

As per Merriam Webster Dictionary, the definition of discrimination  is ""the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of people"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I agree that it would be discrimination if the headteacher/principal told a student they cannot be enrolled in the school because they are Muslim. Jewish, Hindu etc, but is not allowing a person to wear a religious item of clothing discrimination? Because you are not discriminating against the person's religion when banning religious items - they can still hold their theological belief and attend the school, but their PRACTICE of religion would have to  change in order to attend, not religion itself, so if anything you would be discriminating against religious practice, not religion itself. 

TLDR - Saying you can't come to a school because you accept certain theological claims is religious discrimination. Banning religious items in school is wrong, but shouldn't be categorised as religious discrimination, but religious practice discrimination.",0.0
590,t3_rb4dsp,CMV: Life is not worth procreating due to the extreme unfixable suffering and tragedies of the unlucky.,"So basically this is a CMV for antinatalism/efilism/pro-mortalism/antilife.

1. Extreme suffering and tragedies that make someone wish they were never born will always exist, suicide is often one of the end results. Regardless of what subjective benchmark we use, someone will always be suffering so much that their quality of life is zero and we will never be able to fix it, regardless of technological progress, because extreme suffering is subjective to the sufferer, we can never say they dont suffer enough to not want to exist unless we live in their brains. Even a utopia with no physical pain or diseases could still have people suffering mentally and do not want to continue existing.
2. Therefore, it is morally indefensible to procreate because someone will always get the short end of the stick, statistically. It doesnt matter if its one person or 1 million individuals, because its unpreventable till the end of time. Even if billions are happy, that one person in living hell is enough to make procreation immoral. It may sound absurd, but to be consistent and coherent this must be the argument, otherwise critics can simply say these philosophies are invalid since the majority is happy with their lives.

In short, procreation is never justifiable due to the unpreventable and unfixable extreme suffering and tragedies of the unlucky. My conservative estimate is that we have millions of such sufferers every year, if not more and not existing would definitely be better for them, because it doesnt matter if they die now or of old age, statistically speaking their lives would be hellish no matter what.

The only way we can justify procreation is if we value the ""decent"" lives of some more than the ""hellish"" lives of others, basically the Trolley Problem where you let the Trolley kill some to save more people. I dont think this is moral or justified, thus we should not reproduce and continue to play this **statistical Squid Game** that we know **cannot be prevented.**

**Important Edit Note:** 

Two examples of perfectly healthy, smart, well to do and happy people suffering from incurable mental torture, victims of sheer unpreventable bad luck, unless they were never birthed.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWWkUzkfJ4M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWWkUzkfJ4M)&lt;-- the case of Emily, Belgium, perfectly healthy, good life, well off, mental torture, exited at 28.

This is the main reason why I have my views on procreation, pure compassion for these unlucky souls living in hellish torture, it would be better if they were never birthed and since we can never be sure who will be next, the only solution is to not birth anyone, hence antinatalism.   


I hope this makes my views and justification clearer. I do hope someone can change my view though, in good faith, please dont treat my views as a personal attack on your reason to live/procreate and DONT tell me to kill myself, because it will get you banned......and its very rude. lol

591,t3_rb1b2t,"CMV: The US is actually a pretty good place to live, with a decent welfare state","I see a lot of people call the United States a bad place to live, and they bring up rich European countries as alternatives.

Now, undoubtedly, the United States is not the #1 country on a number of metrics, but it is still a very good place to live, and easily in, say, the top 25 of countries in the world, which means it is actually a very very good place to live.

**What Problems Do People Talk About**

First, I think it is important to take a step back, and look at the issues that are often talked about in the United States. I hear a lot of complaints about health care, about the stagnation of wages, the shrinking of the middle class, unequal policing, structural racism, etc.

What do all of these have in common?

None of them are signs of basic failure of a state. We talk about ""food insecurity"", not hunger. We talk about ""lack of health insurance"", not a lack of hospitals, doctors or medicine. We talk about ""aging and insufficient infrastructure"" and not a lack of infrastructure altogether. We talk about ""structural racism"" and ""racist police policies"" not usually about individual, interpersonal racism.

America has the problems of a developed nation that has done a lot of things right, not the problems of a failed state that has been unable to provide for the basic needs of most of its citizens.

Now lets talk about a few:

**Healthcare**

In 2020, [91.4%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200958/percentage-of-americans-with-health-insurance/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20around%2091.4,health%20insurance%20as%20of%202020.) of people had health insurance. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States), of the 27.2 million uninsured under age 65:

* 4.5 million had an employer's insurance offer (making them ineligible for ACA/Obamacare coverage) but declined it;
* 6.4 million were eligible for Medicaid or other public healthcare program but did not pursue it
* 5.3 million were eligible for ACA/Obamacare tax credits but did not enroll in the program.
* Nearly 12 million (43%) of persons were eligible for financial assistance (Medicaid or ACA subsidies) but did not enroll to obtain it.

So almost half of the uninsured have programs that are designed to help them obtain insurance, but they do not pursue it. This is barely a failure of US policy, and more a failure of individuals taking advantage of the options available to them.

As for all the bankruptcies supposedly caused by medical debt. [This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865642/) examined that, and found that:

&gt; we estimate that hospitalizations cause only 4% of personal bankruptcies among nonelderly U.S. adults, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the previous estimates described above [of it causing 60% of all bankruptcies]

Now don't get me wrong, we should try to make those 4% of bankruptcies not happen, but healthcare is much less of a problem than it would be if it caused 60% of all bankruptcies.

It's also worth pointing out that [EMTALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act) is the law of the land. If you go to an emergency room with a serious problem in the United States, you will be treated for it, regardless of ability to pay. Therefore, we have universal emergency health care already.

We just lack universal preventative health care. That would certainly be a good thing to pursue in the long term, but it's worth pointing out that, whatever disadvantages having employer-provided health insurance as our core form of health insurance might have (less ability to quit, be self-employed, etc.) we actually have a very good system overall.

**Inequality, and the Shrinking Middle Class**

[This post](https://putanumonit.com/2016/06/01/inequality-part-1/) talks about the problem with the shrinking middle class narrative:

&gt; Using the “0.5-1.5 of median wage” definition, the middle class has indeed decreased from 53% in 1967 to 51% in 1979 to 45% in 2012.
&gt;
&gt; In ’67, the 24-87th percentiles earned middle class incomes. In ’79 it was 24-85. In 2012 it was 24-79. The percent of households earning below half of the median wage has not changed one iota in half a century. The median wage itself could be dropping, which would be an actual problem, but the entire “decline” in the middle class is entirely caused by middle class people achieving escape velocity and becoming rich. Imagine the horror!

So, far from the American dream being over, more people are richer than ever before, and the middle class has not been shrinking due to more people being poor, but due to more people being rich.

Now look at [this chart](https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/world-disposable-income.png?w=768&amp;h=644) of disposable income by country. Quoting again:

&gt; Despite wildly varying social expenditures, income-wise the US looks remarkably like a Finland or a Norway except with a bunch of millionaires added on top of everyone else (it’s true that this chart doesn’t account for quality of public services). Is having a bunch of millionaires in your country a good or a bad thing? Whatever it is, it’s the single issue everyone in the US seems obsessed with.

The other aspect is that a lot of statistics making arguments about the American poor fail to take welfare and other cash transfers into account. When you [factor those in](https://fee.org/articles/the-poorest-20-of-americans-are-richer-than-most-nations-of-europe/), you get the following:

&gt; After accounting for all income, charity, and non-cash welfare benefits like subsidized housing and food stamps, the poorest 20 percent of Americans consume more goods and services than the national averages for all people in most affluent countries. This includes the majority of countries in the prestigious Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including its European members. In other words, if the US “poor” were a nation, it would be one of the world’s richest.

People underestimate how rich the United States is. Look at [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_sovereign_states_by_GDP_per_capita) comparing the GDP per capita of US states vs. sovereign states. Even a poor state like Mississippi is almost as rich as the *countries* of France and the United Kingdom, and richer than Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary and Russia.

And if you [take PPP into account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)) things look even more favorable.

The United States is not a bad place to live by global standards, or even by Western European standards.",52.0

Once they cross another border, they're no longer refugees.","I'm generally quite left wing, but I hate dishonesty and people bending the rules to gain a benefit.  


So I'm here because my view on refugees/asylum seekers is at odds with my other political views.  


Ideally if you are in a country where you aren't safe, then you should receive all the help you need to get somewhere safe. I have a pretty broad view of unsafe (e.g. I don't think American diabetics are necessarily safe - people who can't afford medication due to the political system's lives are in danger).  


But that expires once you're somewhere safe. Maybe the first country a refugee arrives in after fleeing isn't safe for refugees, but that should be firmly established and directly experienced by the refugees fleeing.  


I understand that countries bordering unsafe regions take on a disproportionate amount of refugees, but it should be up to those countries (and the treaties they enter into) where the refugees end up. I would hope that countries do their bit to take in appropriate numbers of refugees directly from camps.

Refugees taking it upon themselves to end up in their preferred country are taking advantage of loopholes, in my view. They are country shopping while relying on the excuse that they are technically fleeing persecution.   


People respond to the term ""queue jumper"" by saying there is no queue. I think there should be a queue.   


Most of the time this issue gets discussed, people say ""they just want a better life for themselves"". I don't accept that this principle is enough. Someone robbing a bank and getting away with it would be creating a better life for themselves. Illegally entering a country isn't doing as much harm as robbing a bank (of course), but countries should be able to set their immigration policies as they see fit. If a country would benefit by taking in immigrants, it should be reflected in their official policies, not be forced upon them because they have opted to show compassion to refugees and sign a treaty.  


In fact what this refugee loophole encourages is for countries to do their own persecuting so they don't have to spend any money on refugees. It's a race to the bottom.  


Maybe you want to argue that there should be no borders anywhere (and if you do that's great, at least you're being honest about it).  I don't think that's feasible without unprecedented levels of international cooperation and harmony, and the global flow of asylum seekers definitely isn't helping the world work towards that.  


So I'm fine with policies like boat turnbacks, refugees arriving through unauthorised methods being permanently barred from settling in the country they try to enter, temporary visas, restrictions on work and living areas, etc.   


I don't support offshore processing and indefinite detention. Those are expensive and designed to show cruelty, rather than being based on any valid concerns a country might have when setting its immigration policy.  


But if they resettle in a village in the global south, as long as they aren't being persecuted, the country won't refoul them, and the country doesn't present proven dangers of its own, job done.

594,t3_rapvvr,"CMV: Explanation on why ""Delusional Disorder"" should be removed.","The reason why ""Delusional Disorder"" should be removed from diagnostic manuals, is because in order to have delusions, you need to have hallucinations. The hallucinations is what gives you evidence that does not exist in the external reality, leading to one or more fixed false beliefs.

Examples of sings that causes delusions:

* Your mind playing tricks on you
* Your mind  is showing any media-like proof that does not exist
* Your mind is lying to you into believing things that are clearly false

All of those signs are actually hallucinations.

My conclusion, there is actually no difference between Schizophrenia and Delusional Disorder with subtypes.

I hope my view can be changed if I am wrong, but I made my point that there must be some kind of hallucinations in order for there to be delusions.

In fact, it would be helpful if we remove all the subtypes of psychotic disorders and make one unified diagnosis of psychosis, as a spectrum, with different levels of severity. Because, subtypes of psychotic disorders and Schizotypal Personality Disorder is included part of Schizophrenia Spectrum, comes from the same phenomena.


Psychosis Spectrum Disorder:

A mental disorder that includes symptoms that causes distorted view of reality and/ or not recognize what reality is.

Symptoms of psychosis level 1:

* Unusual or bizarre fantasies or believes
* Unusual social interaction
* Unusual speech patterns
* Unusual sensory experience

Symptoms of psychosis level 2:

* Mixing fantasy with reality, but not to great extent of delusions and hallucinations.
* Confusion
* Bizarre social interactions
* Bizarre speech patterns
* Unusual patterns of emotions
* Bizzare sensory experience
* Some impulsively, due to severe distortion of reality


Symptoms of psychosis level 3:

* Failer to recognize reality, leading to delusions and hallucinations, or both
* Bizzare speech patterns
* Bizzare patterns of emotions
* Acting on impulses due to delusions and hallucinations, or both, that can lead to legal issues in extreme situations

\- It would cost money for a company to make their shoes longer-lasting (two opposing forces since people would buy fewer shoes)

However, I would be willing to buy more of a company if I knew they were longer-lasting, one of the main reasons I don't buy nice shoes is because I know they will get ruined so quickly, however, I would be willing to pay a higher price for premium shoes if they lasted longer and looked pristine for longer.

Also, the price of hydrophobic material could be greatly reduced since a lot of it is wasted in spray, if you had it in liquid form you could dip shoe after shoe with minimal wastage and also use very little simultaneously.

Also, the longer people can wear your shoes the more they will talk about how long they last and how good they are creating free advertisements.

**Edit: I never said all shoes, I said there should be an option of pre dipped hydrophobic shoes, the reason for this is because any attempt with spray or anything else is imperfect and tedious.**

600,t3_rage5z,CMV: Difficulty sliders in games are bad,"So I've been thinking about video games recently and somehow got onto the idea of difficulty sliders, or what I call difficulty sliders anyway—the ability for a player to raise and lower the difficulty of a game. When I was discussing getting STALKER with some of my friends, one of the first things they told me was ""play it on the hardest difficulty,"" because the game was better balanced that way. The on lower difficulties, the enemies were damage sponges, and that while you did faster on the hardest difficulty you also did more damage. Then I wondered why we even had difficulty sliders in the first place. So many games include a difficulty slider, but I've never understood why. It's in Doom, Minecraft, Halo, Thief, and in pretty much any other modern single-player game, and in almost none of them does it drastically change how the game is played. In Minecraft, you have six different difficulties, but only three really change how you play the game in a meaningful way. Except for creative, peaceful, and hardcore game modes in Minecraft, where it is meant to bring out different styles of play.

But even when it does change the gameplay in a meaningful way, it feels like the developers have kneecapped themselves. Like in the original Bioshock, where the game was a slog at the hardest difficulty and the enemies felt threatening and imposing, but change the difficulty, and suddenly most enemies are a cakewalk—destroying the atmosphere that the game was imposing on the player. What is gained by giving the player the ability to effectively nerf your game? Either it does nothing, and you've wasted hours adding a feature into your game that doesn't have much of an impact, or it does something and you're effectively making it much harder to tell a story through the combat/gameplay making it more likely to not mesh with the written story of the game.

The only reasons I can think of are accessibility and replay value which can be accounted for in other ways.

TL;DR: I think that difficulty setting essentially serves no purpose.",0.0
601,t3_rag4ex,CMV: Convicted murderers should not be eligible for parole unless they disclose where the deceased’s body is.,"I have just watched When Missing Turns to Murder on Netflix and there is a family who campaigned for “no body, no parole” legislation (“Helen’s Law”) after their daughter, Helen McCourt, was murdered. The killer was convicted based on DNA evidence and to this day refuses to disclose where Helen’s body is. 

I’ve done some very brief reading around both the case and the subject, and it seems that the law has now been passed in the UK, although Helen’s killer was released beforehand. Despite this, the chief exec of the Parole Board has said that even with the new law, the lack of disclosure doesn’t definitively mean “no body, no parole” as the board is still obliged to release prisoners who no longer pose a risk to society.

The obvious thing that sticks out to me in opposition is that if the law did simply mean “no body, no parole”, wrongly convicted murderers would never get out. With that being said, I do support the family’s campaign.

So, in the Youtube comment sections of the trailer(now disabeled), just about every comment was from an antisemitic troll: [https://i.redd.it/x896e53xv0381.png](https://i.redd.it/x896e53xv0381.png)(a small sample of what it was like). These trolls also sent antisemitic comments directly to Seth Rogan on twitter. 

On just about every single post in a right leaning subreddit mentioning this series, the users of those subreddits seem to have come to the consensus that if your a Christian and you feel insulted by this movie, it's actually ok to respond with unironic Jew-hatred, endorsements of the Nazis and holocuast denial. Not only that, but this stuff is actually funny, according to them. This is also the consensus of every anti-SJW community on Youtube that isn't pretending that the antisemitic trolling didn't happen. 

The right frequently claims to be less antisemitic then the left but after such a massive wave of people went mask off recently, I don't see how they could claim that again

605,t3_raaj1w,CMV: Halo Infinite's monetization isn't any worse than any other free to play FPS and doesn't detract from how enjoyable the game is.,"I'm a long time Halo fan (have played every game in the series) and I'm having a great time with Halo Infinite so far. I feel like it's probably the best that Halo multiplayer has been since Reach and I'm pumped to see how the game will continue to grow and change as time goes on. I was disappointed when I went to the Halo subreddit and saw that almost all of the discussion there was complaining about monetary systems. 

Don't get me wrong, I think skins for games are way overpriced and I won't be buying any for infinite beyond the battlepass, but people there are acting like this is somehow worse than what literally every other FPS on the market is doing right now, and also forgetting that Halo 5 had loot crates! Halo has never been a series where customization was the main drive for playing the game, to me it's sort of in the same vein as Quake or Unreal Tournament, just an arena shooter you play because the gameplay is too good to put down.

606,t3_ra8i43,CMV: The 14th Amendment only tied the 4th-8th amendments to the states.,"When trying to figure out what the 14th amendment actually meant we have the text of section 1. The culture at the time, and the definitions of due process and privileges' and immunities at the time.

**1- Text of the 14th amendment and defining it**

&gt; All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

&gt; All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.

This is simple everyone who is born in the united states whos parents aren't ambassadors or foreign diplomates are citizens of the united states and of the state which they reside in.

&gt; No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;

What are the privilege's and immunities of the united states? *The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.* This means you can't give your states citizens more rights then those form other states when in the states jurisdiction.

&gt; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;

Due process amendments are the 4th 5th 6th 7th and 8th amendments.

&gt; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

This means universally all laws must protect all persons equally. Including non citizens.

**2- Why the 1st amendment doesn't apply**

English colonies were founded with their own religions. There were laws on the books requiring the practice of religions and the states sponsored specific sects of Christianity. Hence the ""Congress shall make no law"" part. The states didn't want a repeat of the church of England.

As such if the framers of the 14th amendment wanted to the 1st amendment on the states they would have been clear. They didn't it wasn't until civil rights act of 1965 that it ever came into question.

**3- why the 2nd amendment doesn't apply**

At the time the constitution was written the US was an agrarian society. Everyone had guns to hunt and protect their home. There would have been no reason for them to put a specific right to own firearm's that would be like saying we have the right to own shoes. It was about the states being able to defend themselves against the federal government.

The drafts of the 2nd amendment make it clear.

&gt; And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms

&gt; The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.

&gt; A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.

&gt; A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.

&gt; A well regulated militia, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed

&gt; A well regulated militia being the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

If the militia is the states then the state has the right to regulate who can be armed and who thus fights with the militia. The federal government has no say in the matter.

**4-People saw themselves as state citizens first**

By the time of the civil war people still saw themselves as state citizens first. The north fought to keep the American experiment going, and then to free slaves, but that didn't mean they saw themselves as Americans.

They were still called Union Solders not American Solders. Why is this important? Because the Northerners writing the 14th amendment wanted to preserve their state culture, which could be done easily by simply requiring due process and equal protection. They only wanted to protect the freed slaves in the south, and then continue life as normal.",0.0
607,t3_ra7cpj,"CMV: Large modern companies (e.g Google, Amazon, Boeing, Samsung, etc..) are too large and valuable to fail, at least for a long long time.","Okay so i understand that huge companies and Empires in the past have failed so there is no reason to think these companies wont fail at some point in the future, but...

In the last 100 years humanity has seen unprecedented change in our technology, systems, and societies. Never before in human history has such a rapid change been witnessed. In the past we had kings and queens, now we have democracy, capitalism, Global Trade, mega-connectivity, more reliance on each other than ever before, Information flows as if our life depends on it, heck we even have some type of World Peace now. 

These companies are in every market, they can outcompete any competitor that arises. Doing a brief Google search you find things like this:

'' The world’s largest corporations raised more money than most countries in the world combined collected in taxation last year, a new study by campaign group Global Justice Now has found.

The ten biggest corporations, including Walmart, Apple and Shell, have combined revenue of more than 180 countries in a list that includes Ireland, Indonesia, Greece and South Africa.''

Doing some quick maths, Apple itself is almost 3% of the Total market cap.

In what scenario does a company like Google shut down? Objectively, when do (we let) these companies fail? Would it be total collapse/apocalyptic if we reach that point?

608,t3_ra4w5m,CMV: The state should never force you to give your body to someone else. This includes pregnancy.,"It is my belief that the state should never force you to give your body (or any part of it) to anyone else for any reason.

This relates to the debate about abortion and thats what I would like to focus on. A woman may decide to terminate her pregnancy at any point for any reason. She should not be forced to give her body to the baby even if it causes the baby to die in the process.

Here's a hypothetical:

You shoot someone while intending to kill them. However they survive but now they need an organ transplant. A new kidney. Lets assume no one else can donate the organ at that time. **Should you be forced to donate the kidney since you were the one that caused the problem in the first place?** And it was not an accident since you wanted to kill this person.

But surely, deciding not to donate an organ (inaction) is not the same as deciding to terminate a pregnancy (action) , right?

Ok fine, then lets look at another hypothetical:

Exact same thing happens. You shoot the guy, and he is bleeding out. But now you regret what you did so you take him to the hospital and the doctor has to perform a blood transfusion where you have to be connected to a machine giving blood to this person for a few days. He dies if you unplug the machine. **Should you be forced to give him blood until he recovers? Or can you unplug the machine and leave at any point?** Remember you were the one that caused this situation since you shot him. He relies on your body to live for a certain period of time.

In both scenarios I'm assuming intent to kill but the same applies if it was an accident.

The state should never have this kind of power in my opinion. I want to be as consistent as possible. You should never be forced to do it. So the same applies to pregnancy, since the baby is literally using the mother's body as a host. The mother should be able to opt out at any point.

Let me know if you find any inconsistencies in this logic that might question my stance on abortion.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT1: When I say ""forced"" what I mean is compelled by law. Meaning that if you dont do it then you can be fined/imprisioned. I didnt mean that the state will send their goons to make you do someting.

EDIT2: I feel like the most compelling arguments so far are Prision and Upholding Labor Contracts. Im not sure how much the state can restrict freedom before it counts as ""giving your body"". Imprisioning someone surely must count somehow... Either these are exceptions to my rule or I should define ""giving your body"" in a way that does not include things like prison or labor.

EDIT3: Would be awesome if you could address and respond to my hypotheticals in your reply. Makes the following conversation more interesting. Thanks :)

609,t3_ra416u,CMV: There is no issue with Multiculturalism,"Hey guys! I hear online (especially in things relating to the 2015 refugee crisis) how Multiculturalism is ""destroying"" culture and is some insidious force that must be stopped, however I believe that Multiculturalism (MC) is a good thing that promotes tolerance and the exchange of ideas. For the purposes of this post. I am defining MC as ""2 or more cultures interacting."" So if you took a guy raised in Mexican culture and a guy raised in Swedish culture and shoved them in a room together, that's MC as far as I'm concerned.

My first argument is actually a refutation to the idea that MC is some insidious force that will destroy a nations culture and promote division. I would argue that introducing new ideas and other cultures into a dominant one is a good thing and improves both cultures. For example in my town there are a lot of people from Mexico so there is a blend of both Mexican food like tacos and tamales like American food like Mac 'n Cheese. I would argue this is a good thing because ideas about how to cook get exchanged and the best ideas from both form into their own thing (Tex-Mex, Hawaiian food)

I would also argue that culture is not some static sacred thing and that changing it will not ruin a nation. For instance the culture in the US has changed DRASTICALLY from just 50 years ago, imagine coming out as gay or trans in 1971... good luck with that. And even culture across the US is wildly different to the point where the US barely even has a unified culture at all, yet the nation is trucking along just fine. 

I mean the culture in New York City is so different from, say, Hawaii that you could make a good argument that someone from HI visiting NY or vice versa is MC! That's not to mention how much American cultures comes from immigrants in the first place, hamburgers and pizza were invented by immigrants. Overall I just don't see how speaking a few words of Spanish or wearing a headscarf or eating a Kebab or whatever are going to ruin the US. In fact it's contributed greatly to the US and given us many good things. I just don't see any downsides to MC and many upsides, however I am open to changing my mind so please CMV!",0.0
610,t3_ra04uf,CMV: Graham Norton is the underrated and best talk show host of the past 30 years.,"I feel like most late night talk show hosts(at least the ones in the US) are too focused on whatever current movie or book or TV show the celebrity is promoting.  Graham seems to dig into the celebrity's past for funny stories.  You get a sense of the real person behind the celebrity rather than some facade they put on for the public.  When I watch I feel like I'm watching old friends get together and chatting up a storm.  Even the guests who might have just met that night seem to get along instantly.  I love how he mixes up the guests too like different age ranges and genres of entertainment.  You could have like Snoop Dog and Dame Helen Mirren on the stage.  And they'd get on like old friends.  He doesn't just have American celebrities either.  He usually has at least one celebrity from England.  It's how I got to know Stephen Fry tbh.(I knew him from Bones but had no idea how funny he was).  Graham tries to give each celebrity equal time as well no matter how famous they are.

The show seems to encourage drinking to loosen up the guests.  I mean excessive drinking is bad but a glass or two of wine to feel comfortable isn't too bad.  I feel like American talk shows would be better if they did this.  His talk show reminds me of the old Johnny Carson days where he'd have all his guests there together on stage instead of individually.

Graham's interactions with his audiences seems genuine and off the cuff most of the time.  He can be genuinely surprised at some of the answers.  Also the guests seem to be allowed to curse on screen there.  It just has a more natural flow.(maybe that's bcs I mostly watch clips on YT and they're not censored idk)

To the last point it takes alot of surprise Graham.  He generally goes with the flow.  He's also not afraid to ask his guests to do crazy things.  I watched a clip of him getting Stephen Merchant to do a cartwheel for the first time.

He doesn't do many gimmicky things like doing a version of pictionary or water wars.  The closest thing he does is the red chair stories.  Those can be genuinely funny.  If not they get flipped!(literally they flip the chair over lol)

I'm genuinely curious if anyone thinks Jimmy K or Jimmy F or even Letterman/Leno are on the same level as Norton.  And if you do, why?  I've tried watching those guys.  I can watch most of the show and be left unsatisfied.  I dont think I've ever watched a Graham Norton show without laughing at least once.  I do think Letterman is a good interviewer.  I enjoy his show on Netflix alot.  I never cared for his late night show.  The only person that comes close to Graham Norton in the US is Conan.  He has that same free spirited go with th flow interview style but even he is formulaic like the other US hosts.  I'm also open to other hosts/interviewers outside the US and England.  These are the ones I know of and can speak of from experience.  If there are some from other countries I've never heard of then I'm open to it too.",25.0
611,t3_r9ya77,CMV: The Supreme court isnt getting more partisan. They’ve always been partisan. Their partisan lean has just changed.,"This is something I’ve come to realize after taking constitutional law this year. There are a long line of terrible decisions (both morally and logically) throughout the the court’s history that makes it ridiculous to claim any level of nonpartisanship. Additionally, many times there are instances where the courts explicitly took political ramifications into account when making decisions. Cases that standout to me specifically as ridiculous on its face and partisan are korematsu v. United States,  Hirabayashi v. United States, Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona independent redistricting commission, Roe v. Wade, and Citizens United. 

Additionally, I think people are extremely inconsistent when it comes to their view of the courts and precedent. Precedent seems to only be important when it is protecting things we like. A good example of this is Brown v. Board of education. Plessy v. Ferguson was precedent for even longer than Roe, yet we all agree overturning it was the right decision. Protecting precedent I think would be a good thing in a non partisan court but in an often times explicitly partisan court, precedent as a guiding doctrine just makes no sense.

Edit: so far the only response I’ve gotten is references to the increasing partisanship during the nomination process. I will fully agree that the nomination process has gotten more partisan. That isn’t necessarily relevant to my point though. My point was on the the court itself. It’s fine to say the increasingly partisan nomination process is how we got to a more partisan court but that in and of itself is not evidence of a more partisan court. Alito for example would not be a less partisan justice if he was approved with unanimous consent in the senate.",12.0
612,t3_r9y1w2,CMV: The College Football Playoff Should Not Expand,"This seems to be becoming more of an unpopular opinion as the years go by but I believe the CFB playoff is more than adequate at 4 teams. Here are just 3 reasons why:

1) The common issue seems to be with the SEC's involvement in national championship games. I've been a college football fan for a while, even before the 4 team playoff. Throughout the season teams used to be ranked by polls, coaches, etc. At the end of the season the top 2 BCS teams played in the national championship game. The common complaint was that SEC teams were being favored for the national championship game while other polls didn't have them ranked as highly. The solution seemed to be a 4 team playoff with a committee to determine playoff seeding. Now the common complaint is still ""Too many SEC teams are being favored for the CFB playoff to make it to the national championship"". Let's say the playoff expands. I see that most people want a setup where conference champions qualify, top seeds get a bye, and a few other schools are chosen at large. That would lead to the SEC being the top seed every year and 1 or 2 other SEC teams being chosen as wildcards. Georgia and Ole Miss would be examples from this year. The common complaint would still be that too many SEC teams are being favored to get to the National Championship. Playoff expansion beyond 4 teams wouldn't solve that issue. 

2) The enjoyment of college football, even over the NFL for some people, comes from the importance of the regular season. Before the 4 team playoff, to me at least, it seemed like the regular season mattered a whole lot more. Bowl games mattered more as well but that's a different argument. I can remember from 2000-2010 before the 4 team playoff was implemented. The national championship game was always played between 2 undefeated teams or an undefeated team and a 1 loss team. A 2 loss team made it to the national championship once in that decade and that was LSU in 2008. I have memories of Tebow crying on the podium after his team lost a single game. Winning every game in the regular season mattered more to the teams and to us as fans. Expanding the playoff would diminish the importance of the regular season even further. Hey Utah, you have 3 losses but who cares. You would still make the 12 team playoff to be considered the best team in college football. At that point it seems like a March Madness type of thing where every casual fan skips out on the regular season and only a month of playoff football games matter. That changes the foundation of college football drastically and I don't think people realize it.

3) Lastly, but most importantly, whenever I hear about an expansion of the playoffs I hardly ever hear anyone consider these student athletes. We often forget that these kids are students first. They are not professional athletes. We recommend more games which heightens their injury risk, more travel, and less free time on the weekends that they could be spending going home to see their families. Why? Because we would be entertained by it. The vast majority of these student athletes will not make it to the NFL. Even on top 10 ranked teams most of those students athletes need to be focused on their studies. It would not be very beneficial to them to be playing more games in cold December-January weather when they should be focusing on final exams and projects. We often forget to consider these kids' needs.

613,t3_r9wxt6,CMV: No QB should ever be taken as a top 10 pick,"Plain and simply no matter how much a QB looks likely to succeed and has great attributes (arm talent, accuracy, etc.) There is too much of a high risk with low reward of drafting a QB with a top 10 pick. It seems to be such a normal thing in the NFL which in reality has been the reason certain teams have never had much success. Arguments could be made that these quarterbacks are meant to be project QBs as their success will not show immediately. However, that’s not and should never be a purpose of a top 10 pick. Which is why some teams have never been successful. 

The gray area is determining how a QB is successful. Which I believe the ultimate goal is helping your team win a Super Bowl. However, there have been great QBs who have not won a Super Bowl and have given their team. So my criteria for determine who have been busts will be based on team success and individual stats. 

Since 2000 there has been 65 QBs picked in the first round. We can take off the current rookie class as there has not been enough time to evaluate. So 60 QBs I think you can fairly evaluate. 

QBs taken in the top 10 with individual and team success. (Mahomes, Matt Ryan*, Newton*, Eli Manning, Wentz*, .  8%

QBs taken in the first round with individual and team success. (Rodgers, Roethlisberger) 3% 

Top 10 only individual. (Rivers, Vick*, Stafford, Luck, Murray, Allen, Herbert) 12%

First rd only individual. (L Jackson, Watson, Cutler*) 5%

Top 10 team success. (Goff) 2%

First round team success. (Flacco) 2% 

Top 10 busts. (Alex Smith*, Carson Palmer, Mayfield, Tannehill, Sanchez, Bradford, Darnold, Winston, Young, Mariota, Leftwich, Trubisky, Bortles, RG3, Harrington, David Carr, Gabbert, Daniel Jones, Leinart, Rosen, Locker, Tua, J Russell) 38%

1st rd busts. *(Pennington, Bridgewater, Grossman, Campbell, Freeman, Boller, Ramsey, Losman, Ponder, Weeden, Manuel, Tebow, Haskins, Manziel, Quinn, Lynch, Love) 28%

*people I think could easily be moved to another list but they fit the criteria. 

To me it should be every NFL GM’s job to pick a QB to help their team win. 10% of top 10 picks have led to their team making a Super Bowl (the ultimate goal). On average 2 QBs get taken within the top 10. (37/20). With a 10% chance to pick a QB to ultimately lead your team to a Super Bowl, your odds to pick one is once every 5 years. 
Is the risk worth it? Such a high risk pick seems almost ridiculous to actually believe they will instantly turn around a franchise. To me the best value picks are just more worth it. 

I understand that an argument might be that there are plenty of busts with other positions but I would be shocked if the statistics are as high as 38%.",0.0
614,t3_r9wklv,"CMV: Abortion should be legal, change my view!!","I'm gonna jump right in as I see no reason to stall and I'm going to be listing some of my best pro choice arguments...please be respectful!

Argument no. 1- While it's true that a fetus is technically alive all living things are! That includes worms, squids, elephants, etc. So, if you are against killing a baby fetus (that has a very limited and small amount of consciousness) you must also be against killing pigs, sheep, cows, etc, for their meat also. All the animals that I just listed have a higher level of sentience than a human fetus.

Argument no. 2-  If you are against terminating a human fetus you must also be against male masterbation and the process of having a child in general as billions of sperm are killed in the process of conception of a human fetus. This is all assuming that you are pro having children which most claim to be that are so called  ""pro-life.""

Argument no. 3 - The mother may also be at risk of dieing during the birthing process which can result in not just the loss of a human baby but also in the loss of a mother. These numbers increase if the mother is young which is important considering that not all children that are born are born out of consentual sexual interactions but rather sometimes rape so by making the mother (who may have been raped) give birth you are putting not only an ACTUAL baby's life in danger....but also the mother. This could also lead to a bad life for the child if it is born into a home where the mother is not financially able to meet the needs of the child. While some may argue that adoption is an option, there is also the possibility that the child ends up with less than great adoptive parents, while I do acknowledge that this is rare it is still a possibility, especially considering that choosing an adoptive parent is usually the mothers final say as long as it's legal.

Argument no. 4- Making anyone do anything against their will is usually a bad idea especially considering that this is such a delicate issue in society. While I'm not saying we shouldn't make anyone have to do anything, I am saying that we should be cautious when it is such a big issue with a large majority of people consider it an government overreach into ones bodily rights. It doesn't take a historian to realize that people get upset when a government system makes them do something that a large majority of people would consider a basic human right (including me) and while I'm not advertising violent protests, there is a possibility that something of that measure may happen and could possibly lead to harm and deaths of humans, which as one should know have WAY higher a level of sentience that a human fetus.

615,t3_r9wde5,CMV: Letters of Recommendation are an outdated practice," **This is the information age**. They have my résumé, my GPA, my standardized test scores, my statement of purpose, my answers to their prompts, my LinkedIn profile, my college transcripts, heck if they google me I am sure they will find my Facebook and Twitter to ascertain that I am not some con artist, serial killer or vampire. I get that pre-internet you'll want to confirm someone's true identity, but with the internet and its accompanied cancel culture, it has never been easier to access someone's reputation or to acquire a first appearance.

**Selection bias.** If students are choosing who write them letters, you can be they're choosing professors that they know already like them.

**Systemic bias**. I can't identify a common practice that perpetuates old boys' networks more than letters of rec.

**It is either a great inconvenience to the recommender or their recommendation is unoriginal**. Professors have told me they have a 'template' for recommendations - that alleviated my guilt in asking them to take time out of their day to advance my own personal goals, but also highlights the lack of sincerity used in a process that has become mass manufactured for those in higher education.

There's no point in nursing giving low sodium and calorie controlled meals to these patients if they don't eat them and order something online instead. At a certain point morbid obesity needs to be treated as a mental illness, almost a form of suicide through self-neglect.

617,t3_r9tzu2,CMV: Climate change is a 'solved' issue and humanity and the economy will be just fine.,"ok what do I mean by solved: the technology to convert our entire grid (by entire I mean 99.999%) to carbon free energy already exists or will be invented in the next 5 - 10 years. 

The price of solar power is already lower than all other sources of power and it is continuing to get cheaper and cheaper year by year. [source](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth).  Solar power is already very cheap and it is projected to get even cheaper in the future. [source](https://www.iene.eu/irena-forecasts-59-solar-pv-price-reduction-by-2025-p2740.html).  The story is exactly the same with wind where prices continue to get lower and lower and show no sign of stopping. 

Battery storage is showing exactly the same trends as the price of solar and wind where the cost is declining exponentially. [source](https://ourworldindata.org/battery-price-decline). 

Even if you think that in 2021, the whole solar + wind + storage system is more expensive than what we have now, by 2030 or even 2025, it should be clearly cheaper across the board in all countries around the world. 

Electric cars are already as good as if not better than gas cars, and they continue to get better and better, new insulation materials are being invented and newer buildings can be made far more energy efficient.

The overall point is that within 5 to 10 years, the technology will be clearly there to economically transform the entire energy grid on the planet to renewable. And it would be made without the need for subsidies or any government action. If you want to save money, switch to renewable. 

I can see some issues with agricultural emissions since they are about 20% of the total and we don't have any tech to create meat in a carbon free way. These emissions will have to wait for a bit. But we can absolutely have say 50% of our energy coming from renewable by 2030, and something like 90% by 2035. (at least in the developed world). This is already happening. [source](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/renewable-share-energy?tab=chart&amp;country=~USA). That jump from 4% to 8% was only made in 10 years and that pace will only get faster and faster. 

tl;dr: the technology to transform the entire energy grid along with most other sources of emissions (notably except for the agriculture) in an economical way already exist or will be invented in the next 5 to 10 years. From there on, market forces will automatically fix the issue without any grand plan or massive government spending.

618,t3_r9tczh,CMV: I don't see the point in wanting to identify yourself as something other than male or female,"I'd say I'm rather forward thinking, but I don't really agree with the non-binary movement, or rather I don't understand it. I can't seem to understand why people feel the need to be called they/them for instance. Or identifying yourself as ""another gender"" than male or female.

I fully understand and respect if someone wants to change their gender from the one they're born as. So I can understand why a man would want to be referred to as a woman or vice-versa. In that case there's a mismatch between your ""brain's sex"" and your genitalia (from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong). So for instance your brain is biologically female, but you have a penis. As such it makes sense to me why someone would want to be recognized by the ""sex of their brain"" rather than the genitalia they have.

But if someone doesn't know whether or not they identify as male or female, or feel like they're a little bit of both, why not just refer to yourself as whichever sex you have?

I understand that there's an idea of what a man/woman should be in society and you might not want to categorize into one of those. But I (and it seems like most people today) think you shouldn't have to fit into those norms to be considered a man or a woman, your biological sex or sexual identity is what matters.

I mean, wanting to wear a skirt as a man doesn't mean you can't call yourself male. Likewise, being a tomboyish woman doesn't mean you can't call yourself female. If there's no mismatch between your brain and sex, why feel the need to be addressed as something other than your sex?",516.0

The most common example of this topic is the salaried employee who automates his 40h work week into 5h of work. They submit high quality work on time every week, and slack off for the other 35h. 

I think there are two key aspects to the debate. First, Utilitarian versus Virtue ethics. Is overall happiness maximized? Is it okay to be lazy and withhold truth if so? 

The second is what duty is owed to an employer. Many people I have discussed this with believe that an employee is hired to give their best effort to the company, and as such is under an ethical obligation to tell the employer if they could be doing more work.   I was under the impression that you are hired to do a particular set of tasks, and thus as long as your employer is happy with your performance the number of hours you work is irrelevant (assuming you are salaried).

Additionally, the amount of unethical selfish practices employers regularly engage is enormous. But does eye-for-an-eye work here? How does the power dynamics play into that? 

Clearly, we can't be expected to work at 100% capacity all the time, but where is the line? 

My current position is that employers are self interested and, in our capitalist system, employees should be too. As long as both parties are happy with the arrangement, you are fulfilling your part of the contract and it does not matter if you could be doing more. As such, it is not unethical to do less work that you could be.

622,t3_r9opsc,CMV: A %100 solar/wind energy economy would be more expensive than a mix including nuclear,"This was directly inspired by a thread on Friday. I'm interested in the engineering and economics, not so much the politics, of the situation. Particularly in the US, but this isn't to say other energy grids are irrelevant so long as it's not a special case like Iceland

I don't dispute some of the raw generation costs, ie., that producing a kw from solar, wind, geothermal, and so on, is cheaper than nuclear. It's the actual costs involved turning an energy economy into %100 renewables that concerns me. I hope information exists somewhere, but it's not something I've been able to find and appears to be generally absent from discussions on renewables.

100% renewables (edit: I meant net zero emissions here) would mean electrification of heating, transport and so on. I'm assuming we don't want a hospital to lose power, or for people to freeze, whenever there's a snowstorm so some sort of always-on power is needed. How much would this cost given 100% renewables? We would need excess supply on the grid to keep batteries charged, have power to move from one area to another, or to otherwise handle peak demand. How much and what would it cost?

From some reading on the topic, it seems really, really expensive to resolve these issues. Many areas just can't move enough power, its expensive over long distances, and prices for energy storage are hundreds to over a thousand dollars per KWh. But I haven't seen anything really thorough about it. The lack of this information makes me somewhat suspicious of 100% renewables; if it was *still* cheaper after all that, wouldn't every pro-100% renewable think tank be advertising it? That it isn't makes me think it doesn't look good.

On balance I can't help but think it would cost not just more, but a lot more. Really I don't know though which is uncomfortable for me.

edit: bleh because I suck, I'm trying to compare renewables to renewables plus nuclear. It seems like the mix would be cheaper as far as a net-zero emission economy goes.",7.0
623,t3_r9mxam,CMV: consoles have become low rent gaming PCs. They should go away and likely will go away with in 2 console generations.,"Context for my post: I got a PS5 and I am trying to play Marvel's Avengers on the PS5. Even the the save file transferred over from the PS 4 you can play your save file from ps4 on your ps5. You need to download and fully update the ps4 version onto your ps4, then use their ""upload save data feature"" to upload the save data onto the square Enix server. When I did this it said it was unable to upload and to try again later. 

This is an issue with the operating system. At least I assume. Feel free to give me the technical issue since I had a 7th grade 1990s understanding of computer literacy. I have never had a save file issue on steam because windows works. Sonys does OS however is very basic.

With consoles there used to be an ease of use to them that PCs did not provide. Once set up you stuck in the game and started playing. There was no patch, no day one dlc, nothing like that. It was plug and play.

PC gaming in the 90s on the other hand could be extremely difficult. I remember getting street fighter 2  (I know this is coming off as an old nerd  ranting on the internet) on PC and you had to run it through msdos. Mind you, there was no easy source on the internet to look up the dos commands to go off of if you were a kid who didn't know dos. You often had update a driver, your computer frequently crashed etc. People uploaded viruses on the internet not for personal gain, just for hatred of society. Lol. Now I am really just ranting.

Also, there are less porting issues for games for PC because they are on the same operating system. Obviously there are issues with games running slowly but I recently played Gaurdians of the Galaxy on my PS4 before I got a ps5 and that game frequently went to basically 0 frames per second. My friend was like well yeah, you don't have a ps4 pro. My response was, why would I need a ps4 pro? I have thr current generation console. If the games are not optimized for my ps4, how is that even still the same generation console?

Every time I turn on a new game on a console I need to download an update. This doesn't happen on PC because I use my PC on most days so games get updated automatically. You also don't have to pay a subscription fee to play games online on PC. You also get to pick which controller you want instead of having all the games on the console geared toward one that may or may not work for you. In that way, consoles very much exclude people with disabilities even though they have gotten much better in recent years.

I imagine in the not to distant future you will just have a strong enough connection to play games on your TV via wireless connection between your TV and your PC. This may already exist. Let me know.

 Imagine deciding you want to buy a new game at work, going on your phone, buying it and having it fully installed by the time you get home. 

I'm more interested in the my gaps of understanding with this stuff than ignitinf another console war debate. I assume Microsoft is already headed in that direction with the Xbox app on windows 11. If they put the effort they have to put into Xbox into windows,  they could probably compete with steam. 

I think in 1-2 consoles and 1-2 versions of windows, consoles will be completely obsolete because of advancements in wireless functionality. If Valve. Sony, or Microsoft don't put in this work, I think a different company will.

Even Nintendo has made it clear, they are only releasing products that have more functionality than just a console attached to a TV at this point. It's pretty obvious that the reason is because that concept is becoming obsolete.

625,t3_r9kqkw,CMV: There shouldn't be such division of genders. The definition of male and female could have changed.,"We should have worked towards the dissolution of gender, instead of creating 100 labels and pronouns. The term ""androgynous"" does actually exist. It could've been rebranded (if offensive), and been a single term that includes everyone together. We could be the gender of the sexual organ we have, with traits of the opposite gender. Why is that so fucked up? The aversion towards ""heterosexual standards of relationships"", is pretty bullshit. I've heard it often lately.

If gender has always been a societal construct: why not change the definition of? Definitions of words can change over time. Instead of complicating the entire system, in the name of freedom. Again: I see this as severe aversion to ""hetero normative standards"". I know it's nice to have your own thing.

I see too many people attempt of doing sarcastic jokes, but fail to do so because it's not ""obvious"" that it's a joke, so they just respond with ""no but it was a joke!"". And people use that, when making an actual statement, they watch for the answers, and depending on what they see, they can decide to say ""no but it was a joke!"" even though it wasn't.

And nowadays, with the QAnon, anti-vaxx, flat-earthers and groups like that, a lot of people are trolling them, by going into they direction, but with a very obviously flawed reasoning. Instead of taking it as an attack, some easily influenced, ignorant and foolish people actually believe the reasoning is correct and start to spread it.

All of that makes some people believe a lot of things that was a troll or a joke to begin with. I would bet that the flat-earth movement started like that, just one person saying something along the line of ""the horizon is flat, so the earth must be flat!"" and people actually believing this without critical thinking ""he is right!"" and with time and spreading, the idea became widely known as people without critical thinking just take the information without any filter.

Then, comes the part where ""omg the government is lying to us about the shape of the earth!"". They started expanding on that idea where the government is ""manipulating"" us to believe stuff. So we are all ""sheeple"", etc... With just one joke and one foolish person on the internet, conspiration theories arise.

Same goes for the anti-vaxx; if I'm not mistaken, the part where ""the vaccine makes you magnetic"" started actually as a joke because people were making fun of the fact that some people believed that there were 5G chips in the vaccine. And so some people actually believed it, tried to get metal stuff stick on their skin, and voilà, here we are today.

Anyway, all of that to say that, people should stop making troll or sarcastic jokes. I know, some of the time it's very funny and very appropriate, but they have to understand that some people are easily influenced and can believe everything they read without questioning it.

There has been no other. Yes, occasionally some rulings have been a touch of liberal activism (like Obergefell and Roe), but those courts were still primarily Republican appointed, and were substantially more conservative. And Roe was 7-2.

The Warren Court gave us Brown v. Board of course, the only court case I learned about in High school. There;s a whole bunch of other decisions along its lines, making discrimination in all kinds of forms illegal. 

But the Warren Court also gave us New York Times v. Sullivan, Brandenburg v. Ohio, and Tinker v. Des Moines, cases that basically gave us what we consider to be free speech today. You could be sued by government officials for slightly inaccurately insulting them prior to this. 

Know why you have Miranda rights? Warren court decided that in Miranda v. Arizona. You know why they say at the end that if you don't have a lawyer, one will be appointed to you? Warren court got every indigent person the right to a lawyer in Gideon v. Wainwright. Why does the prosecution have to turn over exonerating evidence? Warren Court in I forget which one. 

And of course. You like having sex? You like to buy contraceptives legally? The Warren court got you laid with Griswold v. Connecticut.

But most importantly of all, it gave us democracy. Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v. Simms started ""one person, one vote,"" decisions that mean congressional and state legislature districts have to have the same number of people. Without these rulings, we wouldn't have a semblance of a country run ""for the people.""

All of these decisions were ""activist"" decisions. No, they do not really come from the Constitution. The Warren Court played fast and loose with the rules, and they just straight up created everything that we think is a foundational right of an American. Yet, whenever I hear an average layperson talk about the court, they're scared of the liberal activist boogeyman. Why? I get that a lot of that has to do with Roe, but I really doubt that people would think this way if they actually learned about some of these cases in school.

South Carolina's document briefly mentions State's rights, but then says that the issue (concerning a tarrif that SC didn't want to enforce) was resolved 10 years earlier and the point was moot.

SC does make it clear in their secession document that their chief concern was that the federal government was not strong enough and not doing enough to crack down on Northern States that were nullifying federal law.  By this point, Northern States were openly ignoring the law requiring them to return fugitive saves (which was in the Constitution at the time), which although the High South was on the fence, it really ticked off the Deep South enough to fight about it.  When an abolitionist government was elected as Republican's took control of the House , Senate, and Presidency for the first time, SC gave up on ever getting the feds to crack down on Northern States and exited the Union.

1. Northern States were arguing ""State's rights"" and ""nullification"" against laws they beleived to be unjust.  SC's knew that the Republicans did not legally have the power to stop slavery in the South, and Pres Lincoln and acknowledged the same, so they were not in danger of losing slavery.  Their beef was that the feds were not using their power to force Northern States to comply.  An argument squarely against ""States rights"" and for a stronger federal government.
2. Take any scenario, and the war still happens.  If the South is allowed to peaceably secede, then the new majority left in the US eliminates any requirement to return slaves to a (now) foreign power and they don't even have to pretend anymore like they would comply.  That doesn't solve the South's chief concern about the return of slaves, and the new Confederacy would be forced to take action to attempt to get the United States to comply which they wouldn't, which escalates to an ultimatum, which the Northern States were already clear they would not comply with.  War ensues.If a Democrat majority was elected that would try to force the Northern States to comply with a law that we now know they were willing to go to war about, then it would have been the Northern States that either secede or are kicked out of the Union, and war follows to force them to comply.In any scenario, the South demands a stronger federal government because Free States are in the Union and ticking them off.  But whether they get the stronger government or not, it doesn't solve the problem.  Even if Northern State governments caved and agreed to enforce the law, far too many regular people in the North refuse to follow it (See John Brown) and some type of rebellion and war ensues.
3. Although the issue behind the tension and the war (slavery) is now universally condemned in the US, the reasoning and argument behind South Carolina's secession as argued in their document, isn't a horrible point.  They argue that in a contract, if one (or more than one) party violates the contract, then the contract is void and the other party is no longer bound to it.  And that is a fair point.  for example, if you contract pay for service and you service isn't provided, then pay can't be compelled.  If you are part of a club that requires dues and the club doesn't fulfill it's obligations, then you don't have to pay.I am in NO way defending the root cause of why they had an issue, which is most definitely slavery.  But I am saying that the argument they used to defend their exiting of the union is a sound argument.  The return of fugitive slaves was in the current compact that that States made between each other (US Constitution).  It was immoral and was worth the heavy heavy price to get it out of the compact and I'm glad it's gone.  But SC does make a valid logical point about the compact.  (Although it ends up being inconsequential because war is inevitable anyway, and the the victory of the Northern States is also inevitable)

(To change my view on #1 might require a good argument that SC's secession document wasn't completely honest, which is fair in diplomacy.  They're trying to appeal for recognition in the word community.  I've never heard an argument for that, but I'm willing to listen.)  


EDIT:  
Delta awarded for point #3.  I'm not completely changed on this, but I'm in doubt now where before I was more sure the argument was logical.  Here's why.

SC's argument is logical UNTIL they participate in the election.

SC Carolina is saying:  
\-The States entered into a compact.  
\-The Northern States violated certain parts of the contract and have no intention of keeping up their ends on those parts anymore.  
\-Therefore, the contract is no longer binding on SC.

And that's valid.  
    
But AFTER that, they go ahead and participate in the 1860 election, implicitly affirming the validity of the contract, which doesn't go with the previous logic.  And, had VP Breckonridge won the election, SC wouldn't have seceded.  If they contract was invalid and the compact dissolved, then they have to secede no matter the result of the election.  Hmmm.

I'm not completely sure that follows, but it's enough to give me some doubt on my original view on #3.  It's participation in the election that casts the doubt.  Although participation in the election is a rational move, it casts some doubt on the logic of the later argument.",0.0
635,t3_r9a8vn,CMV: Subreddits and Facebook groups serve redundant purposes and we would be better with only one of them,"The aspect of Reddit that I enjoy most is its core functionality: creating communities centered around interests. The more obscure the interest - let's take Turkish coffee, which is relatively obscure - the more valuable internet-based communities become to me because the less likely I am to know other enthusiasts with whom to share my passion in real life.

The *only* aspect of Facebook that I enjoy, by contrast, are Facebook groups. To my mind these serve essentially the same purpose.

This means that the online communities I participate in are in one network or the other for totally arbitrary reasons: an excellent community for a health condition I have is a Facebook group whereas there are some subs that I don't think exist on FB.

And why I think this situation is undesirable in my opinion: it splinters the discussion for no good reason. To return to the Turkish coffee example, let's say 100 people are in a Turkish coffee sub and another 100 in a Facebook group, wouldn't we be better off with one fuller more-rounded community with a greater diversity of voices? People are unlikely to have time to monitor communities with the same purpose on multiple platforms which is another reason why... I think we'd be better with one or the other. 

Conclusion: although this isn't the kind of thought that keeps me up at night, I think that the frequent overlap we see between subreddits and Facebook groups is a bad thing and that online community would be a better experience if only one of these things existed.",0.0
636,t3_r96j71,"In new grid development driveways should abut alleys/laneways, and front yards should not be allowed curb cuts.","This is a really specific thing, so bear with me.

Currently, when you build a house in North America, the overwhelming norm is that there is a driveway leading directly onto the street with a curb cut. 

I think this is bad for road safety and walkability, and we should revert to an older norm of alleys behind the houses which are used for accessing parking and for garbage collection and the like.  For an example of what I'm talking about, the Leslieville neighborhood in Toronto is a good example if you want to poke around a satellite map or street view of the residential bits of that area.

So why do I think we should go to this planning system?

First, it greatly reduces the risk of crashes when people are coming in and out of driveways.  There can still be parallel street parking, but that's much easier to see and avoid crashes than driving down a street where there's 100 driveways that at any time can make an intersection.

Second, it allows streets to be nicer and more walkable.  Because you need less space for turning, you can make the street narrower.  And putting garbage in the alley makes the sidewalk space nicer and not obstructed with trash cans all the time.  Narrower streets also encourage people to speed down them less, which is safer.",10.0
637,t3_r962ts,CMV: Car headlights are becoming too bright,"They blind people who are driving in front of and behind cars, as well as pedestrians. This is based on my personal experience and talking to other people, but it seems to have gotten worse in the past few years especially.

There need to be new regulations on maximum brightness settings and light positioning. You should not be seeing spots for so long after a car passes you.

638,t3_r94ivv,CMV: IQ doesn't measure of general intelligence and is pseudoscientific,"For context, I sat a Mensa IQ test today in the hope I could put it on my CV if I score high. I haven't received my score yet, but don't feel as though my intelligence depends on it.

For me intelligence means being able to arrive at conclusions accurately, produce new information, and think consistently/logically about things. The sorts of things I consider academically or generally intelligent:

* Solving a difficult logic (or maths) problem
* Spotting contradictions in your own thinking
* Interpreting evidence consistently; being aware of the type of evidence you value and why
* Developing original insights
* Reading a few chapters from 15-20 books about a given topic each and then writing a structured essay
* Being able to understand multiple different points of view and draw your own conclusions

This list isn't intended to be exhaustive - just an overview. Anyway, my IQ test basically measured solving verbal and non-verbal reasoning problems under time pressure.

I think efficient reasoning can help with any of the bullet points I listed, but they're not essential by any means. You can solve a maths problem slowly if you need to. Absorbing lots of complex info to write an essay, is different to absorbing small, simple information really quickly. I actually often value the perspectives from people who are slow, considered, and really take their time to think. On the other hand, I've met lots of people who are great at IQ problems, but are very inconsistent with their political opinions, and don't appear to understand criticism.

You also get people who can reason their way out of any inconsistencies in their opinions. They use their creativity and efficiency to disregard evidence.

\------------------------------------------------------

The world sees IQ as more than just efficient reasoning problems. They see it as a summary of your intelligence, and even as indicative of your worth as a person. I personally know two people who call low-IQ people ""f\*\*\*\*\*\* useless"", and say things like ""what can society actually do with people *that* inane and low-functioning?""

They're spoken about as if their thoughts are completely worthless -- as though it's an indisputable fact that they have nothing to contribute. But their ability to reason quickly/efficiently doesn't say anything about reasoning deeply, expansively, or rigorously, in my eyes. It's an extremely specific skill.

I've heard claims that scoring well on one IQ test generally predicts your score on others. However, are these all 1-D level reasoning tests? (""1D"" as in, ""the problem only has one step, rather than say 20 steps"") If IQ can be linked to the other skills I've mentioned, I'd be interested to hear.

There is *a* correlation between IQ score and life outcomes, but I have a few issues with this. Firstly, life outcomes are shaped by the society you're in. A few centuries ago, the hardest working physical labourers were probably better able to accumulate resources. These days, people who can work efficiently in offices do. There's nothing fundamentally special about the ability to complete office work quickly/accurately. I think there is an intrinsic good to humanity though, when people are able to think rationally (i.e, evaluate evidence consistently and consciously, evaluate multiple points of view, think through hard problems rigorously).

Relatedly, I call it ableism but perhaps you'd call it a fact of life, lacking any skill that most people have puts you at a disadvantage. I have ADHD which means my attention span is dysregulated. This doesn't make me ""stupid"" and I have many other skills, but because my entire life people *assumed* I had a skill that I lacked, I was constantly expected to perform that skill and it led to significant unmet needs.

If anyone is taught information at a faster pace than they can process it, they won't learn. Kids with ""low IQs"" will obviously function in schools less if the pace is set for median-IQ kids. Couple that with, they're made to feel like failures for being ""behind"" their peers, shame, anxiety and trauma may get added to the mix. Also, all of the problem-kids are usually put in a single class, despite having wildly different needs. Kids with ADHD need *speed* \-- their brains are running super fast and they need an intense challenge to capture their attention. A kid with low IQ, I'd imagine, would probably need to focus hard and take things slow/silently. Schools take kids with opposite needs, put them in the same space, and then use their lack of success to justify further lack of investment.

It's purported many ""geniuses"" have high IQ, but the same is true of olympic athletes and physical dispositions (e.g, height). However, we don't say that being tall is a measure of athleticism. If IQ is overrepresented among those with peak intellectual performance, then that doesn't mean the IQ itself is even 5% responsible. Their high IQ might simply have been the tie-breaker between them and their competitors.

\-----------------------------------------------------

In summary, there's definitely a relationship between intelligence and IQ but I currently don't buy that:

1. Societal factors don't exacerbate performance gaps
2. IQ tests measure all the other aspects of general intelligence
3. IQ makes you more rational
4. IQ is a primary contributor towards the common good",8.0
639,t3_r94db9,"CMV: Minors should be charged the same as adults. There should be no difference, if you are old enough to commit the crime, you are old enough for the consequences.","I find it very silly that often times, minors are charged with crimes much differently than adults. Except when it’s convenient at the time. For instance, Ethan Crumbly is being charged as an adult at 15, which I 100% agree. However I don’t agree that sometimes a minor is charged as an adult, and sometimes as a minor. It should all be equal. I see it as, you were old enough to understand what you are doing, you know that it’s wrong, and you should be punished like an adult would. Why does age matter? A 15 year old should get a less severe punishment than an 18+ year old for the same crime? Why? There was recently an armed robbery near where I live and all the suspects are under 18 and are being tried as minors. Why though? It was an armed robbery and they shot back at police. They should be charged as an adult.

640,t3_r92z89,CMV: The world should end.,"When I say that the world ends, I mean that all life perishes, that no conscious creatures are left whatsoever. Most people think that living is good, and it’s assumed almost axiomatically. I am here to say that this natural intuition is bogus. We’re being deceived by our brains telling us to live when it’s not in our best interest. 

In making this case, I will primarily be arguing from a utilitarian perspective. 

Consider what the best reasonable case for a human being is. They will be born into a world of loving parents. They will go to school, graduate, and find a career that (most likely) will be bearable, but not something they actually want to do for its own sake. They will start a family and grow old, then retire. 

Amongst all of this, they will struggle with stress, nightmares in their sleep, social relationship problems (divorces, bad friends), probably financial hardship at some point (even in developed countries). They will grieve after the loss of loved ones, run into health problems, and experience physical discomfort on a regular basis (weather is too hot, too cold, physical labor at work or sitting at a desk most of the day). They will spend their time off work towards more obligations they don’t want to have to deal with: cleaning their home, going grocery shopping, health care visits, cooking, managing their finances, etc. Some might like a couple of these, but I doubt most people truly enjoy most. 

The picture I’m trying to paint is that most of the time we spend is dedicated towards sustaining ourselves, our careers, and our homes. Most of what we do is something we’d rather not be doing. But that’s not happiness. That’s endless work, and very little time to relax and truly enjoy life. And there’s no getting out of this unless you die.

Now notice that is the BEST reasonable case for a human. Most humans have it worse. The global median GDP per capita is 
[under $13,000.](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2021/03/measuring-global-inequality-median-income-gdp-per-capita-and-the-gini-index/). That is not enough to live a comfortable lifestyle at all. This is where you have to worry about keeping a roof over your head and getting food. 

And what’s even worse than that is the lives of animals. They suffer immensely in the wild, from incurable diseases, predator attacks, starvation, injuries that won’t heal and leave them decapitated, etc. And animals easily outnumber humans. 

The state of the world is predominantly made up of creatures that are born to suffer most of their lives. That is not a world that should exist. And it’s more than likely that if it continues to exist, that’s what we’ll have. 

People usually object to this by stating that we want to live, biologically, and so our lives must be worth it. I think this is nonsense. We HAVE to believe that. It’s an evolutionary necessity. A species that wants to die won’t reproduce, so of course we have a drive to live. That doesn’t mean that drive is rational. I say that evolution has favored a trait that traps people in a life of tragedy. The reality is that we are taking on a wall of suffering so that we can press forward towards a future that, while possibly better in some moments, will basically be more suffering in the aggregate. e

I submit that the world is tragic at its core, that nearly every sentient creature lives a life not worth living, that their biological drive to live is irrational, and that it would overall be for the best if the world ended. Change my view.",0.0

642,t3_r90bv9,CMV: Having a wishlist for holiday gifts defeats the purpose of gift-giving entirely.,"As the title suggests--I believe that providing a wishlist for holiday gifts to your friends and loved ones defeats the purpose of gift-giving. The holiday season is over-saturated with consumerism as it is, but the spirit of gift-giving is still salient if it is done well. Gifts are an opportunity for friends and loved ones to express their thoughtfulness; this sentiment is best expressed when the gift is carefully selected based on the giver's knowledge of the recipient and their prediction of things that the recipient might enjoy. Creating and providing a wishlist of gifts shifts the act from an expression of thoughtful care to one of consumerism--the recipient is essentially shopping for themselves through another person. The element of surprise is removed entirely, and instead of being grateful for the care with which the giver has put into gift selection, the recipient is grateful that the giver spent their own money on their shopping list. In my view, the holidays would be less consumer-focused and more special when gifts are given as thoughtful surprises. 

Along the same lines, asking what someone wants for a gift also defeats the purpose of gift-giving. If a gift is meant to show the recipient your love/appreciation/celebration, it requires careful thought. To put it simply, asking someone what they want for a gift makes the process too easy and therefore less meaningful.

I found multiple Bible passages that seem to describe the Bible showing complete disregard for the unborn and children’s lives. It doesn’t seem like the Bible should be used as a source to defend against abortions. I am open to being wrong about my view and I look forward to hearing what your options are on these passages and the topic as a whole. 

To start off the Bible claims that all life starts at first breath. Genesis 2:7 states “Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being”. New born babies don’t breath air and sow it follows that they aren’t actually alive before birth according to the Bible.

The Bible then goes on to state that unborn babies lives are not equal to human life based on the punishment of the civil offense. “When men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no harm follows, the one who hurt her shall be fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth…“–Exodus 21:22-24”

God makes women miscarry multiple times in the Bible. In Hosea 9:11-16 Hosea prays for God’s intervention.  “Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  Give them, 0 Lord: what wilt thou give?  Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. . .Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.” Clearly Hosea desires that the people of Ephraim can no longer have children.  God of course obeys by making all their unborn children miscarry. 

“God” again shows complete disregard for human life when he kills David’s innocent newborn son for the sins of his father (2 Samuel 12:14-31).

There are dozens of other passages where God directly kills children or commands their death. He commands child sacrifice with Abraham and Isaac and kills all of the innocent firstborn boys in Egypt. The Bible doesn’t seem to be “pro-life”, in fact it seems like it is quite the opposite. It’s my view that the Bible isn’t a good source to back up the “pro-life” argument. Especially when this directly affects women and their bodies. I am interested to see what everyone thinks about this topic. I intend for this to be a civil and respectful conversation.",201.0

Personally I believe it is true that most people are stupid, and we see evidence of this by the decisions that people make in their lives, which are well-documented: Going deep into debt, engaging in behavior that requires abortions, being hyper-skeptical of things that don't warrant the skepticism, believing in certain forms of religion, etc. In my opinion these kinds of things are evidence of sub-optimal intelligence.

And also in my opinion we can see evidence of how politicians are required to pander to lower-intelligence people in order to maintain their positions. They espouse support for concepts which have been thoroughly debunked. And so this creates a strange system where people of obvious intelligence must pretend to believe things that clearly aren't true in order to appease their base of supporters.

Most if not all occupational licenses in the US require some amount of continuing education in order to maintain the license and I think the same should be true for a driver's license. The classes could cover road rules and vehicle maintenance, but most importantly they would cover the reasoning behind road rules. They could also look at the dangers of unsafe/distracted/impaired driving. Basically I'm describing a high school driver's ed course, but mandatory roughly every five years.

Effective arguments will dismantle one or more of these three beliefs, though I am open to other arguments as well:

*  ""Bad drivers"" are bad because after a decade or more of driving, we naturally become complacent and lose sight of both the rules themselves and the danger of a moving vehicle at highway speeds

* There needs to be a way to ensure every driver on the road is fit to be there

* Repeating the driver's test alone is an insufficient way to achieve the above point",0.0
649,t3_r8tk87,CMV: If the Supreme Court overrules Roe it will lose its legitimacy.,"The Supreme Court has been made the final arbiter of law, justice and equity by the creation and adoption of the constitution.

From nothing has become everything. No decision was made in a vacuum. Each decision built upon previous court precedent to reach the most correct answer at the time based on best understanding of all the factors.

If justices overturn something like Roe because they believe it was decided wrong then all previous decisions that used precedent to guide them too can be overturned based on any or no reasoning at all. The court will effectively serve as just another political law making body.

I want to use an obvious counter example to prove my point.

Brown v Board

When the court overruled Plessy v Ferguson  with Brown v Board they weren’t simply overruling it because the case was decided wrong, they were overturning it because the central fact that the court relied on in Plessy was wrong. The fact that separate but equal is ok as long as it’s equal was proven to be false.

Separate can never be equal. 50 years of segregation had proven that fact to be true and it was this new understanding that the court relied on to overturn Plessy.

There is no similar premise that can be proven wrong in regards to Roe.

I have heard the statement that, the right to an abortion isn’t in the constitution. Perhaps this would be an example of how Roe was decided wrong because that was a false premise.

However the court has found before that personal liberties can be constitutionally protected despite them not specifically being enumerated.

Griswold v Connecticut 

The right to privacy especially when it relates to the intimacy of a bedroom is protected by the shadow cast by many different amendments that all seem to value and protect privacy.

How can rights that are implied but not enumerated be protected?

9th Amendment

&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Therefore the court concluded from precedent and from the constitution that the right to an abortion was a right of liberty and perhaps privacy while not specificity enumerated but guaranteed none the less.

To prove in court that Roe should be overturned the prevailing justices must show how one of the underlying premises or precedents in Roe was wrong, which they can’t.

What do I mean by the court will have lost its legitimacy?

They will be ignored or accepted based only on political expediency.

Perhaps someday in the future a Governor or another body from another branch of government will ignore a ruling from the Supreme Court probably because it’s a popular thing to do unless something drastic is done to restore the court’s legitimacy.

To change my view you must convince me that the principle of Stare Decisis would withstand such an affront.

That somehow overturning Roe is not abandoning the principle of Stare Decisis.

Or somehow convince me that Stare Decisis is not actually important to the court’s legitimacy.",1487.0
650,t3_r8saxr,CMV: The patriarchy does not cause the sex market to exist.,"Here is an article for reference on the feminist view of this issue:

https://medium.com/the-political-economy-review/onlyfans-is-not-empowering-607b2c2f11f4

Basically, they think the popularity of onlyfans is driven by the same forces which made prostitution popular since the beginning of humanity.

That the patriarchy objectifies women, and implants into the hearts and minds of all people, men and women alike, the idea that women are sexual objects. For reference to the woman's perspective, the article details how women have the concept of a man gazing upon her physical body and beauty inside her own mind, and thus, she is subject to the will of the patriarchy, even inside her own head.

To me this seems to imply that a different mode of being could exist. One in which men do not crave to see the naked bodies of beautiful women. To not experience the physical nature of women alone. Where prostitution would cease to exist, if only the patriarchy were to cease to exist.

If the patriarchy were to cease to exist, men would no longer feel desire to view naked beautiful women. Men would no longer feel the desire for sex with women without the need for interpersonal and emotional closeness. That men would no longer be attracted to women physically. But rather the proper mode of attraction, one guided only by the character of the woman, would finally be set free as is man's true nature.

This would eliminate the market for female beauty, as it would cause men to be more like women are now, desiring character as a baseline rather than physical beauty.

To me this seems to go against everything science has ever taught us. That men are attracted to fertility, which means, physical beauty, youth, as a baseline. We are born biologically with this kind of sexuality. We are attracted to young women who possess indicators of fertility. Indicators of fertility, are beautiful, because evolution dictated for us to be attracted to said indicators of health and fertility.

And that women are born with a sexuality that causes them to be attracted to status, resources, physical prowess. Basically those things which pass on genes which are good for survival. But also modes of being or personal culture which is good to be passed down to children. Such as hard work ethic or good interpersonal skills. Woman's sexuality is based not only on the man's physical genes, but also the attitudes and mores which will be passed down to his children as a result them seeing and learning from his actions in real life. 

The feminists reject this mode of female sexuality, and explain that it only exists due to the patriarchy. That men value these traits, as dictated by the history and development of human beings across time and across cultures. That since the division of labor during the earliest days of human life, surviving in the wild, has been carried on through to today, by means of the patriarchy. That the division of labor, where men went to hunt, and women foraged and raised children, put men in the position of authority.

We divided labor initially because men are more physically able than women. Said division of labor has developed the patriarchy and thus it is a deeply rooted as biology. But ultimately, can be changed.

Though I don't know what the correct and 'true' or 'moral' secuality is. If sexuslity is purely dictated by culture, what culture must arise to replace our current immoral culture.

To me, it sounds very wrong to imagine that men could ever be how women are today. Only caring about character rather than physical beauty. It sounds like a theory with zero scientific backing.

What I imagine would change my mind. Is evidence that there are cultures in which men are not attracted to women for physical reasons. But rather, emotional reasons aimed at the woman's personality and character traits, rather than by physical beauty.

Basically, I'm looking for whatever scientific or other scholarly levels of knowledge, where evidence shows that they are correct. That men's desire to consume with his senses, the physical beauty of women, only exists due to the patriarchy. What scientific evidence is there? What are the scholarly arguments to support this?",3.0
651,t3_r8rdre,"CMV: most people in the West who claim to care about the Palestinians care far less than they claim, and are motivated by anti-Semitism.","Do I think that the Israeli state treats the Palestinian population equitably? Certainly not. Do I think that people are right to advocate for justice for the Palestinians? Yes, of course. I do not personally believe the Israeli government is actively trying to commit genocide. But some people do and if they believe that, they should have the right to use evidence to demonstrate this and make a case if they genuinely have the evidence. That’s their right. 

But the very people who are extremely vocal about Israel have little, nothing, or at my most charitable, far less to say about other similar situations:

1. Turkey is built on land which was ethnically cleansed of its Greek and Armenian populations and settled by people from Central Asia. The Turkish language isn’t native to Anatolia but is closer to Mongolian, Korean, Japanese etc. Unlike in Palestine there are no Greeks or Armenians left in Turkey because they were systematically and actively targeted for genocide and the remaining population at the end of WWI was expelled via population transfer. Turkey is everything people claim Israel to be.. built on stolen land, genocidal, imperialist. Yet utter silence about it. 

2. The treatment of the Uyghur population in China. These people are being systematically targeted for cultural genocide and their freedoms are severely restricted. Palestinian culture is not undergoing this level of suppression. 

3. The genocide of the Rohingya population of Myanmar. They are considered to be among the most oppressed populations on earth and are actively targeted for physical violence. 

I believe the lack of caring about other situations demonstrates that anti-Semitism motivates much pro-Palestinian discourse. 

Additionally their criticism of Israel often includes anti-Semitic talking points once you scratch the surface.",0.0
652,t3_r8hcdj,cmv: history as an academic discipline is useless,"I'm about to get a degree in history and after every paper, article or academic book that I go through I cannot escape this feeling of having absolutely wasted my time. I think this happens for the following reasons:

1. Articles and books are often written in a peculiar form of academic language that does not even try to be precise. Often it strongly appears to obfuscate the lack of real knowledge (based on primary sources) or tries to impose a perspective on the past that really cannot be justified on any basis. Criticism of writing style or lack of substance is often dismissed as not having properly understood a text or not having the language skills to fully comprehend.

2. Research is focused on the most negligible questions. The relevant questions in history, whether it's political, social or cultural, have already been answered. We have a good understanding of how different social and economic classes lived and interacted with each other; we know about the major ideas of particular times; we know the ""great men [and women]"". Contemporary research really seems to be filling in the microscopic dots.

3. No one cares about academic history. I'm currently writing a paper and I noticed an inconsistency between primary sources and how the story is told in more popular works. No one really cares because it's a detail of a detail in a sea of details that's part of an ocean.

If all three of these arguments are ""disproved"" I consider my proposition void.

Arguments that I don't consider having any substance:

1. Clichés like ""those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.""
2. That negligible questions are somehow relevant, e.g. queer perspective on the sexual attitudes of 14th century female peasants in south Somerset.
3. That academic history is necessary for the production of other forms of history (e.g. public history, popular history works etc.)

654,t3_r88zhx,"CMV: Bullying isn’t bad— on the flip, it’s necessary and a good thing.","With that eye-catching title, let me clarify one thing. Bullying, *in moderation,* is good. 

If you’ve been beaten up or verbally assaulted, you weren’t a victim of bullying. You *were,* but that’s extreme bullying. That’s the far, far end of the spectrum. That kind of activity is b-r-u-t-a-l, and that’s the kind of shit that should be stopped. In fact, there should be added punishments for that kind of behaviour. It ruins the psyche of a developing adult. Actually, have that behaviour happen to a fully developed adult and it’s still traumatic. It’s unnecessarily cruel and undeserved. 

That’s the far end of the spectrum, that’s the extreme type shit you hear about on the news. The kind of bullying that leads to someone killing themself— yeah, let’s shelf that extreme behaviour for now. I’m not talking about it. It’s rather hard to separate *this* kind of bullying from the kind I’m going to present, and to that extent, I’ll concede to almost any point you’ll bring up. But hear the rest our first:

Bullying in moderation and not to the extreme is good. In fact, it’s almost beneficial. Societal norms are enforced through bullying. I’d say it even allows individuals to understand what is acceptable appearance and behaviour and what isn’t, because often times that stuff isn’t spelled out right in front of you. There’s no notice board that addresses this stuff, but I suppose you could always just look around you and see what others are doing. 

If an individual is dressing strangely or behaving strangely, they’re going to get bullied. I’d assume they’d be just lightly picked on, or whatever— but it seems kids beat the absolute fuck out of other kids for less nowadays. Here’s the thing, if you make one too many social faux pas, you’re inevitably going to be bullied for it. In the long run, as long as you’re not getting extremely harassed or beat up, which id like to think is the normal bullying that occurs and not always this crazy wild shit you see in the news, then you’ll realize that your behaviour or appearance has something wrong to it. 

Essentially, I feel like it’s one of the only ways your peers can reinforce the idea that you’re behaving incorrectly that has immediate, direct consequences and also allows itself to be correctable.",0.0

656,t3_r8969d,"CMV: George Orwells most famous works: 1984 and animal farm, are boring and pretentious.","I first read them when I was in high school, and I thought they were profound and enlightening. After rereading both books ten years later, I thought it was a snooze fest. 

First:
All the characters in his books have no real personalities. Their whole identity is simply a symbol of different parts of society. There’s nothing wrong with that, but come on, are these people this one-dimensional? 

Second:
While his writing style is very polished and well put together, he does nothing but smell his own farts throughout both books. He uses the main character in 1984 to preach against the evil dystopia, which is a bit cheap. Why is the main character always against the dystopia right off the bat? Why can’t we have the main character love the dystopia and see why it is tolerable before tearing it down?

Lastly: 
After reading his books, I looked George Orwell up. He's some posh rich kid that pretty much lived in privilege. No wonder he paints us, peasants, as mindless idiots who are unaware of the world around us. One of the strangest phenomena about his works is the feeling that you get after you’ve finished reading.

657,t3_r87ros,"CMV: If you are fortunate enough to be a young college grad in today's job market, there is no such thing as a glass/bamboo/whatever ceiling - and any failure of promotion is due only to your own personal failings in the workplace.","In my opinion, there are currently no systemic barriers to job promotion as a white-collar individual in today's workplace. I believe any smart, driven, charismatic person (regardless of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation) will be able to showcase their skills on the job and be promoted quickly if they wish. The ""unfair"" barriers I commonly hear claiming that certain classes of people will be skipped over for promotion are as follows:

&gt;**Lack of ""culture"" fit** \- maybe your office is filled with ex-fratboys who all talk loudly about football, and go out for happy hour 3 times a week. Maybe they all play golf together, or poker, or spend their time on whatever extracurricular activity, and by choosing to opt out of these events you will be seen as a ""non-team player"" and thus dismissed come promotion time. In my opinion, it is your own *personal* responsibility to ingrain yourself with your co-workers, and to learn to participate in the activities they enjoy - if you want to be considered part of the in-crowd.  People hire and promote people who they like. Whining about this fact does nothing to further your career goals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously, you are free to not enjoy or want to learn to play golf/poker/fantasy football. If you believe the cultural barrier will indeed be insurmountable, you should have done your research on the industry/company culture prior to coming on board, and perhaps selected a different line of work which will be more appropriate to your personality type and hobby preferences (see point 2).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Conflicting personal goals beyond career advancement** \- a common point I hear in this regard is that women are unfairly disadvantaged due to societal pressures to have and raise children as the primary caregiver. I also believe this point is moot. Currently, many of the top companies (especially in tech) are *extremely* encouraging towards planning around their female employees' family + career goals (e.g. FAANG companies often offer long maternity leaves, plus subsidized fertility/family planning programs like egg freezing, as well as an ingrained and emphasized culture of acceptance).  
&gt;  
&gt;In other industries that may not be so progressive (e.g. finance, consulting, law), once again your individual research needs to come into play. If you want to make $150k/year formatting cells and aligning Powerpoint logos as an investment banking analyst, you will necessarily need to commit to 70-80hr work weeks, plus a managing director who calls you on weekends and holidays. This is true without regard to the analyst's race or gender - everyone suffers equally. Similarly, if you are introverted to the point of anxiety, you might want to consider jobs that do not require a ton of presentation skills (like management consulting). If you want to choose these career paths, you need to be ready for the sacrifices they demand. But once you're in, it's anybody's ballgame and everyone has a fair shot at promotion, granted your performance meets and exceeds the standards of your role.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Personal biases within your organization -** finally, I've noticed this argument directed at specific members of an individual's organization i.e. the (predominantly) older, white, cis males who tend to currently sit at management roles might demonstrate ingrained biases against minorities or women no matter how many diversity seminars they're forced to attend. In this regard, once again the onus falls on the individual - politics are a real and necessary skill for a hopeful future manager, and getting someone to like you is one of the skill's primary goals. If you are unable to tip the scales in your own favor by manufacturing situations that showcase your charisma in a positive light, maybe you don't deserve to be promoted after all (based on the merit of your weak politicking skills). Furthermore, you can always request a switch in teams, job locations, or even companies (job hopping is verified to be the optimal strategy for a candidate seeking rapid advancement). If things get so bad to the point where your current asshole manager is blackballing you throughout the industry and impacting your chances elsewhere, you can file suit against the repeated instances of malice and seek to move on after the resolution.

\---

Please change my view by demonstrating instances in which an individual was powerless to affect their own career path due to systemic bias. Secondly, please show that the examples you describe are common occurrences or repeated patterns instead of one-off anecdotes in order to demonstrate that the ""X ceiling"" effects are a serious and ongoing barrier against promotion for minority candidates.

**Note** \- I'm excluding emergency situations that may incapacitate an individual like a debilitating accident or personal tragedy.

The reason Takeshi Kovacs was in a different sleeve was actually explained, at the end of the last episode, he had cleared Ryker of the charges he was framed for and Ryker would be spun back up and want his sleeve back which Takeshi was riding. 


People had become attached to Joel Kinnaman and his performance of Takeshi Kovacs, and didn’t like the sudden change to him being portrayed by a totally different actor. Anthony Mackie did a good job, and the second series was good in it’s own right, people just didn’t like the change from season one.

661,t3_r7vojx,CMV: Grades destroy learning,"I am a college student majoring in STEM. In my journey going through a bachelor's, I have been the A-student, the B-student, the C-student, and D/F-student. I have passed with flying colors, been the average, barely scraped by, and utterly failed.

I have come across many other students who have had the same or similar paths; as well as those who have always been the B/C/D students; and those who have always passed with flying colors. What I've come to find is that the grade is highly dependent on who you take, under what circumstance, who the TA is, and whether or not you're learning or memorizing.

I recall in one semester I was tutoring a student from another STEM subject for a technology course using a programming language. This student I had known for over a year before then. They were a straight A student. Come to find out in this semester, the programming language course they were taking was a bone-crushing defeat. They couldn't grasp or rationale that there were more than one 'right' ways of solving some problem; and so much to the point, that there were so many ways of doing the 'right' thing that it was impossible to determine just how many there were.

This lack of constraint on the number of 'correct' possibilities in a given source program, along with a lack of direction given by their professor, made that student's life a living hell for a semester. As I held tutoring sessions, I observed them being talkative in the beginning, to less receptive in the middle, to giving up in the end and being silent each meeting. Each meeting then and thereafter was about 'just getting shit done', not about understanding.

While I was taken aback by this because I love technology and do think learning about it is fun, I understood their point. They were a straight A student. They were not getting the results they wanted. They were struggling for the first time. And in any other circumstance that was of lower risk to their transcript / reputation, they would've given experimentation a shot. But since all of that was on the line, and they clearly didn't know what they were doing, they were afraid to take the risk and learn, and so they constantly asked for help with everything; expecting me to take it away and 'solve' the issue for them.

I thought that would be the last time I would come across that situation. But since then two years have passed. I have revisited the same situations over and over and over again. Great student. Great grades. But doesn't want to put in the work. Likewise, interestingly I have met the opposite. Student who just gets shit done, doesn't care about grades, but does know what they're doing as well.

Grades are a point of measurement in a particular point in a student's life in time. They do not dictate what the student knows, doesn't know, nor is capable of knowing in the future. But they do certainly cast a shadow of doubt and fear in students who put them on a pedestal in my experience. They are capable of making a student the happiest person in the world and the lowest person in barrel. Whereas, not caring about grades as much, leaves you as you; nothing more, nothing less. It seems like less of a risk to partake in doing so, mentally and emotionally.

In addition, outside of academia what is the most tangible analogy of what a grade represents?

A transcript is to a student, as an inode is to a file, as a reputation is to someone with a career. It is a descriptor for what something is but is missing what that thing actually is. Only that can be found by digging into the subject directly.

I think the LGBT community should support two spirits and Native Americans, since two spirits tend to form same sex relationships and two spirits existing gives more credibility to the transgender and nonbinary movement.

664,t3_r7to4b,CMV: White American culture does not exist.,"Hispanic American culture exists. Asian American culture exists. Black American culture exists. But white American does not exist. The reason why the other cultures are able to exist is because they are minorities and the rest of the American population does not follow through with everything they do. Here’s an example of what I mean: 

Hispanic Americans are into low riding, Edgar hair cuts, and tlakuache culture. But the rest of Americans are not into that kind of stuff. So I would call low riding, Edgar haircuts, and tlakuache culture “hispanic American culture.” Tex-Mex food originated with Hispanic Americans. But I would not call eating Tex-Mex food “Hispanic American culture” because they are not the only ones who eat it. I would call Tex-Mex food “American culture” because all Americans eat Tex-Mex food.

Whenever something reaches mainstream American culture and all Americans start to do it, that thing becomes “American culture.” This means that I would not call eating fried chicken “black American culture” but “American culture.” Fried chicken did originate with black Americans. But since all Americans eat it and not only black people, it’s just American culture. Rapping would be “black American culture” but not “American culture” because most Americans rappers are black.

For white Americans, there’s no “white American culture.” Because they are the majority and the ones with the dominant culture of the USA, their culture just becomes the culture of all Americans.

When I say that there’s no white American culture, please don’t confuse this as me saying that they don’t have a culture. They do. They just don’t have a culture that’s exclusive to them only. 

One more thing: American culture is anything that’s mainstream (meaning “everyone does it.”) no matter who it originated with. As long as it enters the mainstream, it just becomes American culture. All Americans share American culture. But white Americans are the only ones who don’t have a culture of their own since they are the majority of the USA and set the culture for all Americans.

The center point of the episode is that we need to build massive infrastructure to move wind/solar power from central US to the coasts. However, as he states himself, the cost of doing so is quite expensive: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBpiXcyB7wU&amp;t=1060s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBpiXcyB7wU&amp;t=1060s).

A whopping 2.5 trillion dollars is a massive price tag. When I heard this number I immediately went and did some back of the envelope calculations. Right now a 1.1GW nuclear power plant costs 6-9 billion dollars ([https://www.synapse-energy.com/sites/default/files/SynapsePaper.2008-07.0.Nuclear-Plant-Construction-Costs.A0022\_0.pdf](https://www.synapse-energy.com/sites/default/files/SynapsePaper.2008-07.0.Nuclear-Plant-Construction-Costs.A0022_0.pdf)). Let's say that's $9 billion per plant (it should get a lot cheaper if we build a lot, due to economics of scale, but let's take the max estimate anyways), That's more than 275 nuclear reactors, with a total output of more than 302.5GW of power, or 2649 billion kwh of energy per year. To put that into perspective, ***that's more than the entire amount of fossil fuel power produced by the US in 2020 (2427 billion kwh)***: [https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3)

So in summary, the cost of making wind/solar *viable* (not including energy storage costs and actual costs for solar/wind farms), is more than the actual cost of completely de-carbonizing the US grid with nuclear energy. Wind/solar is a distraction, possibly promoted by big oil to lock us into a partially-carbonized future.

FAQ:

\- *What about other forms of renewable energy?* I'm not against most other forms of renewable energy but most of them are location dependent so they also suffer the same transmission problem if they were to be massively upscaled

\- *What about nuclear waste?* If we can trade the carbon problem for the nuclear waste problem we'd do it in a heartbeat. In fact if we currently have the nuclear waste problem and not the carbon problem we'd barely talk about it. The truth is the amount of waste generated by nuclear power is so little (in terms of volume), and the fact that it doesn't go anywhere by itself (unlike CO2) means it's a very manageable problem.

\- *What about Chernobyl/Fukushima?* These are accidents that happened to very old first generation reactors in the worst circumstances. Even so, the amount of casualties is fairly low for both events. Armed with 10x the knowledge we have today, these accidents are extremely unlikely to occur. Even if they do, the way climate change is destroying Earth today in reality is probably worse than having one Chernobyl every year.

\- *What about Thorium/Fusion/Whatever?* These are only hypothesized and we shouldn't depend on future tech to solve problems for today.",6.0
666,t3_r7q44y,CMV: Abortion rights should not be protected by the supreme court in the US,"Hear me out: I am strongly pro-choice and I believe safe, legal abortions should be available to all people.  *However*, I don't think those abortion rights should hinge on a supreme court ruling, and it's probably better in the long run if Roe v Wade gets overturned.

I think this because:

1. The supreme court is not really supposed to make policy.  They're not properly accountable to the democratic process so it's not great if they are the ones deciding policy like this even if it's something I like.  The problem with this becomes really obvious when they make decisions I *don't* like such as citizen's united.

2. Roe mostly acts as a political football.  People feel like they have to vote their party even if they hate the candidate because losing the supreme court is a doomsday scenario because of Roe.  As a result legislators get away without delivering anything else since they have this juicy wedge issue to scare people with.

3. By the same token, it's probably actually better to decide this at the state level.  I might think it's horrible, but why should I get a say in how people live in Mississippi.  I would not want them to say gay marriage should not exist in my state.  And forcing everyone to make the same decision about this allows national politics to be diverted towards cultural issues instead of pocket-book issues which are probably more important.

4. If republicans actually did enact anti-abortion legislation in red states, they would have to recon with the political consequences of that.  A lot more people would probably reconsider their position if it was their own self or their own daughter affected by this.  In the long term you would probably see abortion prohibition become less popular nationwide.

I do acknowledge that the short term consequences would be horrible as a lot of women will have to deal with unwanted pregnancies in red states.

668,t3_r7ml4o,CMV: Certain subjects like Critical Race Theory or the cold winters theory or holocaust denialism should not be taught in school because of the potential harm they could cause.,"I've heard people argue that schools are supposed to instill students with knowledge. 

While I understand where people are coming from I think there are certain subjects that students should not learn about whether they are true or not because even just having knowledge of them could create conflicts between students. If students learn about holocaust denialism, Jewish students might be targeted. If students learn CRT, white/jewish students might be targeted. If students learn the cold winters theory, students of color might be targeted.

College is trickier. On one hand, many students start college at the age of 18 and the brain isn't fully developed until 25, on the other hand people can't be shielded from this stuff forever. So I'm less sure how I feel about college. But certainly K-12 I think there are some subjects that even if students just learn about them are harmful and schools have a role in preventing that harm.

The cold winters theory, for anybody who doesn't know, is basically the foundation of white supremacy. It posits that Europeans lived in colder climates and were thus forced to develop intelligence, while tribes living in warmer climates were not. It's widely recognized as racist pseudoscience, although some argue otherwise.

669,t3_r7mka2,CMV: buying physical books instead of digital copies is immoral,"my view only applies to new books which are readily available in electronic formats as well.

when printing physical copies, the marginal carbon footprint is much higher compared to distributing electronic copies. for a certain number of books, a certain number of trees have to die, not to mention ink, electricity used when printing, transportation, and storage, while electronic copies only consume whatever electricity is needed to process the transfer.

it can be said that the initial marginal cost may be higher, but the lifetime costs would be higher with digital because every access requires the use of electricity. i would say that if you store offline copies of your ebooks on your phone, as I do, using an efficient ebook reader would allow you to access them without much additional electricity consumption, i. e. your phone would use a negligible amount more when reading compared to when not in use.

if you have to buy physical copies because of your professor, fair enough, but i think most people buy physical copies for the 'feel', the cost, or to show other people, which I think is insufficient to offset the environmental impact.

in developing countries where electronic devices are not accessible to many, i would say that, being an important part of education, buying recent physical textbooks would be ok. 

regarding used books, i think buying them would not be immoral because their sale would not bolster the 'new physical book' industry, and in some cases actively hurt it. the environmental sin has already been paid, and the only associated carbon footprint would be no different to the trade of most other similarly sized goods.

lastly, this post is meant to be a thought exercise more than anything. i do believe that buying physical books is worse for the environment than buying digital, but im not actively advocating for people to stop all book printing worldwide. i just think that if you have the choice you probably should go digital :)",0.0
670,t3_r7mis4,"CMV: Political ""safe spaces"" are counter-productive","When talking about issues like sexuality and mental illness, ""safe spaces"" make sense, but when it comes to politics I find it to be incredibly counter-productive.

I won't name specific subs, but there are quite a few political subs on both ends of the spectrum that are ""safe spaces"" for followers of whatever ideology. I've noticed in these subs that they tend to start out fairly reasonable and innocent, but end up devolving into an extremist echo-chamber with no willingness to hear any viewpoints that contradict their own mutated views.

When you shut out everything except for what you want to hear, you only prolong issues and create new ones. Creating a space that literally translates to ""echo-chamber"" just doesn't sit well with me.

It doesn't matter what political beliefs you have. If you shut out everyone that disagrees with you, or has a different opinion, then you only hold your own ideological development back. You become the extremists by hyping each other up and steadily escalating reactions to those deemed ""unsafe"" or ""enemies"" or ""outsiders"" or whatever label you want to give those who aren't invited.

I'm sure plenty of us have tried to have a genuine conversation with someone who doesn't follow the same beliefs as yourself, and all of the sudden your comment is removed and you're banned from the sub, no matter how civil you were trying to be.

It makes sense with social issues, but when it comes to politics, the last thing you should be doing is silencing your opposition while listening to what you already agree with.

Sorry for being so long-winded, it has been bothering me more and more for the last few years.

671,t3_r7ll04,CMV: Any idea which can be potentially profitable should be able to get patented .,"I know that the above statement is valid for new inventions , but should  it be restricted to just that?..

Shouldn't we extend patents to include ideas for a novel or a movie or any Idea that is profitable for the right person?. 

If we analyse a bit we can see that patents for inventions exist as the right idea in the hands of a company (with capability to manufacture the invention on mass)  can make profits and no one other than them will be able to get a piece of that pie. 

Same with Ideas for books.. A good idea for a book in the hands of the right author is potentially profitable for both parties.(the author and the original creator of the idea) 

Let me explain.. I have a great idea for a novel right now but I don't have the skill/time for writing that novel. So alas.. This idea is destined to be buried in my head.. But If I could sell it to a professional author who lacks ideas... It can maybe produce a decent book which is profitable.. Which inturn can make both of our lives better.

So I propose that we create an e - market for ideas...
I name it 'INC.PIRE' .Where people with potentially profitable ideas can sell them to a buyer.. If it's profitable the the buyer is liable to pay the original creator of the idea an initially agreed upon sum. 

Yes scams can happen but what matters is putting the idea out there for prospective buyers as I don't have the ability to fulfill that idea.. By putting it out there my idea gets recognition and may even earn me some money.

An idea may not have any value for all of you .. But what if there was an author/anyone , in need of the same.. And what I want is an e-market built on this chance.

The e-markets sole purpose is to inspire an artist/buyer who needs that idea.. Sometimes you get paid some times you don't.. Sometimes you can even get scammed.

Please note that It's purely the authors choice if he wants to pay the guy or not. I just want a platform where people can just put their ideas 'out there'. 

I used the word *patent* because of the lack of a better word to use instead of that.. But what I want is a platform where people can just put it out there.No one can sue others just for a flimsy idea. The main motive of inc.pire  is to inspire others. Sometimes the creator of the idea gets paid, receives recognition, both or gets scammed(It's a scam as the authour doesn't pay the benefactor, in this case ... The original creator of the idea..An idea which played a crucial part in making a best selling book... But the idea it self received the recognition of the masses which in it self is a partial compensation.. So by scam I don't mean a full fledged scam but a partial/ a half -scam.) 

But anyone of those is better than leaving the idea buried inside your head.

PS : In this case I was the original creator of the idea for e-market for ideas.. So I should get a share of profits if someone creates such a thing in the future. Such a site doesn't exist as far as I know. If it does please enlighten me.

One guy asked me my idea(for the novel) : I have many ideas but I will give you the worst one... It's a novel where the mc is just another random kid but he's very observant and well into high school he realize some  patterns happening around him... Plot continues and he finally discovers his life was a simulation and he can do what ever the fuck he wants end of book 1 

Book 2  how he goes about using his power


Book 3 : End of simulation and the beginning of realization



See..? This plot is better than most scifi movies/books I have read.

For people asking if it isn't the matrix : No it's not the robots using humans scenario but humans using advanced technology to make simulation like games.. By book 3 mc finishes the game and wakes up to his original life realizing that 

1.his rich parents made him into a poor guy in the simulation so he could learn truths about life and value of money. He realizes the parents and friends he had in the previous life never existed.. And he is  in a dilemma. 

Or 2. It could be like he's stuck in an endless loop of simulations... the final truth he finds out is that he is a prisoner of a futuristic prison where death penalty was banned and simulations were used to pacify prisoners.

675,t3_r7k6zk,"CMV: Opposition to neopronouns from the Left isn't really motivated by the problems with neopronouns. They're embarrassed by non-binary people, and are doing damage control to make their general view on trans acceptance seem less absurd.","[I have people like this in mind.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/r7dpit/cmv_neopronouns_are_unnecessary/) I'm unconvinced that there is a strong reason to oppose neopronouns, once one has already embraced transgenderism in general. Most of the arguments for trans acceptance strike me as being open to a parallel argument for respecting neopronouns. Arguments like:

1. ""You should use someone's preferred pronouns \[but only if they're conventional\] because that will make people happy, and failing to do so could make people unhappy or miserable."" Won't it make non-binary people happy?
2. ""You should use preferred pronouns \[but only if they're conventional\] because gender is a matter of self-identity rather than biology, and in principle a 7-foot tall lumber jack with a deep voice, a long burly beard, XY chromosomes, and a dick and balls can be and literally is a woman if she says she is, the very second she says she is."" Why isn't self-identity sufficient to motivate acceptance of neopronouns?

As far as I know, those are the two major arguments for trans acceptance: #1, gender is a social construct and is therefore malleable, so it ought to evolve based on what people want from the construct. #2, trans people will be rightly devastated if you don't use their pronouns.

**So, what are the trans-positive objections to neopronouns?**

**Objection 1:** Accommodating neopronouns is just too impractical/unreasonable/unconvenient/etc.

*Reply:* Since when was this an issue for the pro-trans view in general? It may be very counterintuitive or  inconvenient for someone to fight the urge to say ""sir"" to the most non-passing female-identifying lumber jack, but since when does that excuse misgendering? And, in principle, if you had a bad memory, you would still be expected *to do your best* to use the right conventional pronouns. Why are neo-pronouns too much?

Also, the trans-acceptance movement has already called for a wide variety of accommodations that are all potentially inconvenient: refrain from using pronouns when tempted until you have confirmed they are correct; when greeting someone, state your pronouns and request those of the other person; when signing off an email, consider listing your pronouns; when organizing an administrative meeting, ask everyone to list their pronouns with their names (I'm thinking of when, in college, our RA meetings and a number of my classes began with this process on the first day).

**Objection 2:** Neopronouns don't serve the purpose of pronouns because pronouns are supposed to be general rather than idiosyncratic.

*Reply:* Says who? On what principle could you possibly say that gender and conventional pronouns are flexible social constructs open to revision based on the desires of human beings, but neopronouns aren't? And even if you think this, can you at least accept the neopronouns which aren't idiosyncratic? (That is, the Neo-pronouns that are widely used?)

**Objection 3:** Non-binary people can just use ""they/them"".

*Reply:* Well, yes; technically they *can* use the pronouns they don't want. But that's the point: they don't want to. Why should they, in that case? Presumably trans people could just desist and use their former, sex-stereotypical pronoun; but the mere existence of an alternative doesn't justify the alternative. Is the idea that ""they/them"" is less demanding or socially costly, so it ought to be *imposed,* unwillingly, on non-binary people who don't want it? If so, see **Objection 1.**

**Objection 4:** Non-binary people just don't make up a big enough group to count yet.

*Reply:* [1 in 4 LGBTQ+ youths](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/beyond-he-she-1-4-lgbtq-youths-use-nonbinary-pronouns-n1235204) identify as non-binary, and 25% of those use neopronouns. If that is any indication, there will be a fairly sizable minority of Neo-pronoun using LGBTQ+ people in a few decades. Sure, it's a small group now, but what group size counts? If someone managed to kill all but 1,000 of the trans people alive today, would you consider that sufficient to invalidate the movement?

And, presumably, the reason size would matter is that language is a democratic thing, and the ""right"" number of people have to ""vote"" before your norm change is valid. If so, then it seems like the opinion of *all* the Neo-pronouns *accepting* people is what counts in the final tally here, not the number of people who use them.

All of these people can be considered linguistic voters asking for a norm change--when will you acknowledge them? As far as I know, that number has to be at least as large as the number of people who are trans (whether because trans people tend to endorse Neo-pronouns also, or that there are just enough left-leaning people to net a large enough social vote.

**Objection 5:** Pronouns and genders in general are unnecessary.

Sure, be gender critical all you want, but until society moves to that point, certain non-binary people are going to want to feel accepted in the meantime by being included. Come back to me once you figure out how to get everyone to stop thinking in terms of gender, and I will get on board.

So, the arguments are pretty weak. As a result, I suspect that the strain of Leftists who voice doubts about neopronouns regularly on this sub, with titles like ""neopronouns are unnecessary,"" are really trying to alleviate their doubts about trans ideology in general by closing the door to a legitimate subgroup with every right to change the relevant social norms as trans people.",1.0

Taking aside ""It's just entertainment"", ignoring ""history"" hurts my enjoyment of new entries.

&amp;#x200B;

One recent common example is that of Star Trek, specifically with Discovery S1-S2. I'll use it (and some other things) to clarify my view.

It's also frustrating, because it seems to either make no sense, or to cheaply play on the thing in name only to get views. I'm constantly asking myself:

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, why bother to spend money to license a property and then barely use it at all? If all you  want is sort of the look, Black Mirror S4E1, Orville, Galaxy Quest, Andromeda and probably others all pulled it off fine without pissing off fans, because it was its own thing and without spending the money. However, it's also true to ""everyone"" knew it was an homage to Star Trek. So if you just want to do your own thing, and chafe at the history / cannon of the show - look at how you can do your own IP, and only take the bits of Star Trek that you actually like. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this leads into the other hand - the cheap use of names only to get ""clickbait watches"". I.e. ""Ohhh, I remember Spock, so I'll watch this show"". I'm not convinced that sort of person is a huge part of the audience for any SciFi, but I might be wrong. But you run the risk of seriously pissing off fans, and having all your writers and producers feeling like they \*hate\* the ""straight jacket"" of canon. If you didn't care about the fans, look back to \*what are you even doing\* - why not do your own IP. And in the long run I wonder if you actually keep many of the fans of the older canon watching. And if it's not for fans, does it really help pull in \*new\* fans vs your own IP?

OR, if you DO believe in the movement, and change your mind or question it, most of the relationships you've been invested in for years would become moot if you came out and changed your mind. You would look like an idiot and be mocked/shunned by your peers.

In relation to this, I recently watched the Netflix Documentary ""Beyond the Curve"", most of these flat earthers, especially Mark Sargent and his girlfriend (?) when they explain their theories/evidence about flat earth, their faces, body language, and tones of voice seem unnaturally ""empty"". Like bad acting and/or unemotional. Fake enthusiasm and unenthusiastic. Their eyes don't light up when they talk about flat earth, something they are apparently very fond of. It gave me the impression of pretending to like a gift that you secretly hate.

Also, Mark does lie several times throughout the documentary, and its very obvious. He claims that he has people come up to him all the time and tell them that they admire his work and think he's on to something. He says he was stopped in the airport and a guy came up to him and told him that he's a flat earther because of Mark. This clown has 100k followers on YouTube, gets an average of 5k views a video, and his is very generic. PewDiePie probably doesn't even have people come up to him that much like Mark Sargent claims. Also, these lies have a similar body language/voice as when he talks about flat earth. He wants so much to be special.

 However, when around each other, their expressions change and their body language is more open and their eyes and smiles and tones of voice are more genuine. But it switches back when talking about flat earth, like the Nasa (?) museum.

Even the other people. Like they sound like they're reading off a script at times. I know like, documentaries are weird and they might not be used to a camera crew, but doing youtube videos and podcasts should help right? And the specialists they interviewed sounded natural, confident, and like they knew what they were talking about.

It's easy to see these people as being dumb and using them as scapegoats for false information spread on the internet but I genuinely think they don't believe it. For comparison, if you look at Trump supporters being interviewed and hit with real facts or questions even if they're not angry or emotional its clear that they believe what they're saying.

683,t3_r79izt,CMV: The belief that the sexes are biologically predisposed to particular white collar careers is embarrassingly ahistorical,"Some white collar industries have a pretty big disparity between the sexes. A lot of people chalk this up to biological differences in the way men’s and women’s brains are wired. They mostly do this in the context of decrying diversity initiatives, saying that it’s not oppression or societal expectations that cause disparity between the sexes—it’s simply biology.

The basic premise is this: men are more interested in tinkering with things and machines, and women are more interested in talking to and understanding people. That’s why men make up the majority of computer programmers and why women make up the majority of psychologists.

But that theory has a pretty big flaw. It is true that the majority of computer programmers today are men, and it is true that the majority of psychologists are women. However, these distributions were reversed as recent as 80 years ago. In the 1940s, it was women who made up the majority of computer programmers, and men who made up the majority of psychologists.

This fact should lead someone to one of two inescapable conclusions:

1. Either the biology you’re referring to somehow evolved in the last 100 years. The gene that predisposes male people to computer programming wasn’t present in humans born in 1900, and the gene that predisposes female people to the field of psychology wasn’t present in humans born in 1900.

2. Or you have to accept that something other than biology drives the disparity between the sexes in these careers. It wasn’t biology that decided that computer programmers were women. It wasn’t biology that decided that psychologists were men. It was something else. It was societal expectations and industry cultures that can be, and in fact were, curated and changed.

So when people try to argue against diversity initiatives on the basis of biology, it’s instructive to take a look at the broader historical picture and realize that 80 years is not a meaningful evolutionary time. Animals do not biologically evolve that significantly in 3 or 4 generations. 80 years is a meaningful time to change societal expectations and industry cultures though. We’re living in one tiny segment of human existence that believes computer programming is a manly discipline and that psychology is a womanly discipline. Those are not hard biological facts. They can be changed.

For all we know, these distributions will be flipped again in the next 80 years. Maybe the majority of computer programmers in 2100 will once again be women, and maybe the majority of psychologists will again be men. If that sounds crazy, the people in the 1940s certainly wouldn’t have predicted the distributions we have today. Computer programming was some girly glorified typist job, and psychology was a highly respected manly discipline.

If you don’t think equal representation is important, then that’s fine. Do whatever you can to counteract it. But don’t act like it’s somehow biologically impossible to achieve parity. It’s been done before.",53.0
684,t3_r79hgz,"CMV: There's Nothing Morally Wrong with ""Catcalling""","I haven't actually experienced catcalling often, there's two instances I can remember where I was a passerby and witnessed someone catcall another person (Make a sexual comment / whistle).

It is my view that there is nothing inherently wrong with this. There are plenty of instances I've heard of where it went too far, which can become harrassment, I'll agree with that; but simply whistling or saying ""Damn you look good today"" or something like that? I see nothing ethically wrong there. I see it as a compliment. The only two women I know who've experienced it did not mind it at all, but I see reddit comments all the time equating it to sexual assault.

I can't imagine getting upset at someone for basically expressing their attraction to me, and I think if a girl automatically assumes a catcaller is someone who's going to assault them after, it's not the fault of the catcaller. If a catcaller does catcall someone and then follows them around all creepylike, well, that's not a problem of catcalling, it's the behavior after that is wrong. If you simply whistle and move on about your day I see nothing wrong with it. If anything it seems like a positive thing to me, but maybe that's because I am comfortable with sexual topics and some aren't?

Tell me why it should be wrong to simply whistle a tune that is socially known as a ""I think you're attractive"". Why is it any worse than a non-catcall compliment, such as ""You have beautiful eyes"" or something? Am I just a dense male redditor who doesn't properly understand the effect that catcalling has? If so that's fine but please try and explain what exactly is ethically wrong with catcalling.

685,t3_r79h7r,CMV: LeBron doesn’t deserve the criticism he’s getting for not speaking out against China.,"I’ll give a quick rundown of the situation: NBA superstar player LeBron James has a sneaker deal with Nike, who allegedly has their shoes made from sweatshop camps in China. People like Enes Kanter (a much, much lesser known NBA player) as well as a lot of the NBA fans and commentators (like Max Kellerman) criticize him for that too. It definitely gets a lot more precise than that, but that’s a very broad description of the scenario at hand.

There’s many problems with only criticizing LeBron over this:

1) This issue is way bigger than just fucking LeBron James or NIKE. They’re not the one who’s running these sweatshops. Who is? The Chinese government. 

2) Many people profit from sweatshops. You, me, and most people. Enes Kanter singles out LeBron when a shit ton of athletes and some of his own teammates have sneaker deals with Nike (ex. his teammate Jayson Tatum). *Enes Kanter  himself wears Nike clothes every single day he plays an NBA game*. He could quit playing for the NBA and live on a farm somewhere, but did he? The answer is no; he’s still getting paid millions by the NBA.

And we all profit from sweatshops in some way; not just LeBron. If you have an iPhone (a company that’s been repeatedly accused of violating human rights), by the logic that’s being used, you’re supporting Chinese sweatshops. It’s not “unavoidable” either; that’s just the excuse that people make up to feel like they’re justifying themselves. You can live your life free of these corporations, like the Amish do. It’s not easy, but when has any positive societal change ever been? If you believe strongly enough in what you’re doing, you’d do it but yet many people choose not to do it or even attempt to do it. So, as Socrates put it, “*nosce te ipsum*”. Don’t judge people for doing the same things that you are doing; it’s not a good look.

3) To pretend that these companies are just watching this all unfold and doing nothing is ridiculous. For example, Nike had a code called “SHAPE”, a guideline designed for adhering to human rights, and they spend millions to uphold that ordeal. This has been going on since the 90’s. As a matter of fact, Michael Jordan had actually endured heavy criticism for his partnership with Nike too back in his prime. History repeats itself. 

I’m not going to pretend that Nike is a super ethical company, that’d be dumb, I’m just pointing this out. I’m just saying that the issue isn’t nearly as black and white as many make it seem. There are lots of nuances to it, and anybody who actually cares about the issue rather than just expressing “outrage” over it on their iPhones are aware of some of them. 

“LeBron only speaks out about social issues when it doesn’t effect his paycheck.” 

For starters, the contradiction here is hilarious. In 2020, NBA finals reached an all-time low viewership record (a finals that included LeBron James). Instead of looking at the many contributors to why the NBA was tanking, the same crowd that’s calling LeBron a sellout decided to equate it to the fact that the NBA was supporting BLM by putting “Black Lives Matter” on the court, jerseys, and everything else. And honestly? That’s probably a big reason why they lost a lot of viewers, and I thought it was a rather dumb move, and that’s coming from somebody who’s in favor of BLM. So, in this scenario, LeBron and the NBA did sacrifice money over their beliefs. Of course, they removed it now supposedly as an attempt to avoid alienating conservative fans, but my point is still valid. 

Secondly, the idea here is that you can’t care about one specific issue more than another which is dumb. LeBron is a black man who grew up in poverty. Of course he’s going to give back to his community and hyper focus on the issues that he feels is effecting black people. Why does this mean that LeBron also has to have his nose stuck in a billion other different things that isn’t effecting him?

“LeBron criticized Darl Morey for saying ‘Free Hong Kong’”

Wrong.

What LeBron James was saying was when you have employees working in China (a place with a billion citizens and an absolutely terrible dictatorship), maybe you shouldn’t tweet negative things about China. That put lives in danger. He said the tweet could’ve waited until they left China. And he was 100% correct in that regard. 

I’m not saying that the NBA or LeBron isn’t afraid of losing China as a market (they have hundreds of millions of fans over there and China has pulled certain games from being broadcasted already due to criticism from NBA figures). I’m just saying that the entire thing has been blown out of proportion. You’d think that LeBron was Adolf Hitler himself if you only listened to these conservative echo chambers.

687,t3_r76rjh,"CMV: If men got pregnant and gender roles stayed the same, then abortion would probably be illegal and child birth probably mandated.","I've regularly seen a sentiment online like ""If men got pregnant, and gender roles stayed the same, then abortion would be free and cheap for all"" presumably because men have group power and group consciousness, and will exercise their group power to stop themselves from having unpleasant and painful obligations. 

But I don't think this is true. Whenever in history there's been a political choice between men having autonomy and men being forced to sacrifice themselves for the state, men have been forced to sacrifice themselves. 

Militias? Men were summoned. Wars? Men were conscripted. Taxes on being childless? Men. Work levies? Men. Obligation for Marital debt? Men. Even with childbirth, women tend to have financial abortion options with the chance to adopt the child at birth without parental consent, and men don't.

Whenever there's been an unpleasant public job to do, the state has been happy to sacrifice men, and men haven't freed themselves from it. 

If a magical alien came and waved a wand on society and everything else stayed the same except men got pregnant, and so gender roles were the same and such, I would expect the opposite. 

Pregnancy would be mandated for men, for the national good, with fines or imprisonment for men who refused, or in more liberal democracies simply strongly encouraged with fines and social pressure. That's what has happened in the past when men went against the public good to protect their bodies. 

Opposition groups would likely be like anti war protestors. Mostly ignored so your side can wage righteous wars, except when it's politically expedient. 

This is because people tend to care less about men, and want them to sacrifice themselves for the state more. 

To change my view, show that society has on other matters let men go free when there was a choice between bodily autonomy and state benefits, or show that this is a bad comparison for some reason.

Edit. Since people have really pushed the boundaries of this hypothetical scenario, a clearer statement would be something like ""In countries where there are strong anti abortion groups, if men got pregnant and gender roles stayed the same otherwise they would tend towards anti abortion laws, and when the state benefited from child birth, men would likely be forced to give birth, or strongly encouraged, as they are with military service.""",17.0
688,t3_r755qm,CMV: Access to Safe Abortion Services is a Human Right,"My view is that absolute and unrestricted access to safe abortion services is a human right. This view includes access to comprehensive reproductive health services and access to preventative birth control methods. Any restrictions, limitations, stigmatization, or criminalization of these services is morally wrong and a violation of human rights. States have a positive obligation to provide these services as well as other comprehensive reproductive health services, access to preventative birth control methods, and evidence-based sexual and reproductive health information. Anything less than this is a violation of a person's human rights.

This is my view because comprehensive reproductive health services, including abortion, are necessary to guarantee the right to life, health, privacy, and non-discrimination for women, girls, and other people with wombs. That these rights are violated when abortion is restricted is evident from the elevated rates of bodily harm, health complications, disability, and death experienced by women, girls, and other people with wombs. Forcing women, girls, and other people with wombs to give birth against their will is on its face a violation of bodily autonomy. Limitations on access, such as having to travel significant distances to receive care, are a massive waste of time and resources, having sharp and discriminatory economic repercussions for women, girls, and other people with wombs. I cannot fathom a justifiable reason for any restrictions or limitations to be imposed upon access to safe abortion services and I would like to better understand those points of view.

689,t3_r7559c,CMV: The death penalty is morally wrong,"Hey guys! There are many statistics proving how the death penalty doesn't deter, is insanely expensive and how innocents are still sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit. All of these are reasons I oppose the death penalty. However I would like to argue it from a morality perspective, I believe that the ONLY justification for killing another person is if you need to defend yourself or another from imminent, lethal harm. That just doesn't apply in maximum security prisons where breakouts are so absurdly rare it's not really worth consideration.

Since death row inmates don't cause imminent lethal danger for anyone, I believe it's wrong to kill them. I'm also coming at this from an absolutist position, so yes I believe (if they were brought to trial) Hitler, Mao, Stalin, &lt;insert criminal here&gt; should not be executed unless they are in immediate danger of causing lethal harm to another person. The reason I believe this is because I believe all human life is worth saving and that 99.9% can be rehabilitated back into society. DP is just hollow and mindless revenge IMO.

Before someone mentions the victims family and closure, keep in mind the accused has a family too. And the hard truth is that killing the perpetrator will not magically resolve any harm done by their actions, a murdered person is not coming back, a raped person will not have their trauma wiped away, an old man will not get his retirement fund back after a collapsed Ponzi scheme. The closest you can get is having the criminal seeing the error of their ways and apologizing. If they still just *have* to have the perpetrator killed to feel ""closure,"" I'm sorry but that's tough luck to them. Feeling angry does not entitle you to take away another person's dignity.

I come from North Europe where weather can be rough, we are closing our fur farms and promoting to use synthetic. My family always tried to have products that are natural. (talking about clothes)  
Leather products always lasted me the longest and were more durable. For example shoes, I have 2 pairs of leather shoes that cost 3x more than synthetic ones, they were warmer and sturdier than synthetic shoes that I needed to change with each season.  
Even if producing  of leather  needs chemicals to process it, it will last you longer than synthetic ones that need constant replacement and are harder to recycle. Also leather keeps the warmth better.  
I have a fur coat from my grandmother. Nothing fancy but it lasted us already generations. We also keep pieces of furs that we apply on the hood of the coats and sleeves.  
If I purchase a fake fur it will barely last 1 season.  
Wool is better and environmentally healthier than synthetic counterpart. Cotton is better to make your skin breath and is more recyclable than synthetic.  


We end up killing animals in both ways, the synthetic and plastic production is still damaging the planet and killing more life in a long run, especially if we need to constantly replace it and the items that end up in nature don't decompose.   


I will agree that there are few synthetic coats of very good quality that can last you years. But they are too few in comparison of commercial mass production that is meant to least only 1 season.

Believing so is arrogant and potentially dangerous.,"There have been dozens of civilizations in the past throughout the world at various points through history, which, at their time, would have been considered the peak of global civilization as we (they) knew it. 


Many of these civilizations lasted for centuries and conquered great swaths of land, and or held their own land, became vastly wealthy for their time and probably felt more or less immune to collapse, yet they did, for various reasons. Climate, draught, famine, war, reduction of primary resource(s), disputes over government or social policies.

It does not matter whether a fetus has a heartbeat or can feel pain. Pregnant women feel pain due to their pregnancy along with the potential for countless medical issues caused by pregnancy. Pregnancy-related deaths and permanent health complications still occur which indicate pregnancy is risky. 

Pregnancy can occur even if a woman is on birth control or a man uses a condom.

In my opinion, we have the technology we need to ensure an Internet-based election that is secure enough to encourage public confidence in the system AND increase voter turnout.

First, the YouTuber Tom Scott alleges that attacking one electronic voting machine is as easy as attacking thousands. This is technically false. It's computationally easier to attack one.

Second, we can have a secure election system that is easily auditable and that preserves your vote while keeping it secret. The answer?

1. Give each voter a token that pseudonymizes or completely anonymizes them. This token would be generated by the elections office upon verification of identity. Then the blockchain ""ledger"" could say: ""Person #1234 voted X, Y, and Z.""
2. Open the network to potential auditors. The best part of blockchain is that literally anyone granted access to the network can verify &amp; validate the votes. So they can verify that - yes - I voted for Joseph R. Biden, Jr. for President.
3. I guess similar to 1): If only verified individuals are allowed onto the blockchain network, and their votes can only be counted once, that reduces the risk of foreign interference via posing as a legitimate voter that doesn't exist (for example, there's no Vladimir Putin that is registered to vote in the US)

Examples included:

&gt; Not surprisingly in the slightest, they are brothers after all its the sort of thing I would do for my brother.

&gt;Shitty situation, but family comes first.

I can accept some of these posters may just be trolling, but the ""family always comes first"" mantra is one I've seen several times in real life. However, it always rankled me for two reasons:

1. It supersedes basic ideas of equality and fairness. Your own family is not inherently more worthy of leniency, support, or enablement than any other. If you'd be against sexual harassment in general, knowing your own brother sexually harassed a bunch of people shouldn't change the situation. I absolutely understand giving the benefit of the doubt to someone you know well, especially if the accusations are out of line with how you think of them. Or being in denial about the accusations against them, or even pushing for leniency and rehabilitation over strict penalties and punishments. But I cannot condone supporting someone solely because they are family.
2. In my experience (granted, a sample size of less than a half dozen), the people who espouse these kinds of views always seem to have really messed up childhoods with abusive, narcissistic parents. The emotional abuse they suffered made it so they always try to get the approval of their parents, and they were raised with a ""the family against the world"" mentality. Their parents are either narcissists or enable a narcissist in their life, and the kids pick up the same behavior. ""Family comes first"" serves to reinforce that the (abused) children can only rely on their (abusive) parents, and either enables a narcissistic child or pressures a non-narcissistic child into enabling their siblings' terrible behavior. 

So that's why I'm here. I really can't see there being any doubt that the first point is true - ""family always comes first"" means you de-prioritize ideas of equality or fairness once family members are involved. The second one is probably more open to challenge - although I have never encountered a situation where someone espousing these views hasn't been raised in a family that, from the outside, is blatantly abusive(\*), I imagine there may be cases where such views arise where a healthy family inspires the same values without abuse to enforce them. It seems pretty unlikely to me though, and I'd like someone to explain why they feel this way and how they were raised. It's pretty clear none of the comments above came from people who thought their views were controversial. 

*(\*) By abusive, I mean examples such as parents constantly criticizing their children, yelling at them, threatening them, telling them they are worthless, physically hitting them (spanking, slapping, shoving), mocking them, ignoring them despite their child's pleas, or telling them no one could ever love them except for their own family. Yes, sadly, I've known several people who had childhoods like this.*",0.0
699,t3_r6m36i,"Cmv: To realistically meet renewable energy targets, we need big energy companies like Shell and BP.","Totally. Totally. Fine with having my view changed here. 

But I was having this discussion with a friend recently. And we both came to the conclusion that as much as these oil and gas companies are to blame for the current situation. In order to facilitate a switch to renewables in time to prevent 1.5 degrees warming, we need to do this through existing infustructures. 

Large energy companies already have downstream infastructure in place. And many are (at least saying) they are switching their upstream sources to renewables. If this can genuinely be facilitated, this is the best, maybe only, way to meet energy demands and switch to renewable.

I don't realistically see arms of government or new companies developing the expertise to source and disseminate energy effectively, within the next decade. It's a monumentally complex system. And the only companies with the best part of a centuries experience in this area, are the existing oil and gas companies.

Many are even rhetorically saying this is their strategy. I struggled to even name Exxon as they're clearly one of the most dishonest offenders out there... To an unforgivable degree. And shell and BP are hardly a shining example of virtue. 

But the latter two, amongst a few others. Do seem to genuinely be putting their money where their mouth is. And despite past offences, seem to have moved away from their disinformation campaigns.

Don't get me wrong, that doesn't sit too well with me. As there feels like there should be some sense of justice here with companies that have offended so gratuitously in the past. But whilst we have limited time to cut emissions surely we should just take every quick win we can. If a existing provider can easily pivot on how they source energy, I'd say go for it. We can play the blame game later... When we're out of the woods. 

Anyway. As I said, totally happy to have my view changed here... So go nuts...",3.0
700,t3_r6l9n5,CMV: there is a lot of unwarranted doomerism about poverty in developed countries,"Median income by PPP about 30K in most Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Belgium. Contrast this with what is equivalent to a middle class income not in developing or extremely poor countries, but Greece, turkey, Russia, Bulgaria and the Slovak republic: on average figures are around 10-15K. So around one third or half as much as richer countries like the Netherlands and Denmark, but not even anywhere close to Brazil where middle class means around 7-8K or India where it means less than 3K. If you’re curious, you check out my source right here: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=IDD

A few things to note here: 

1. This is *median* and **not** average income. While averages tend to be skewed by a few outliers (in this case, very rich or very poor people), medians do not suffer the same criticism.
2. This is by *purchasing power parity*, **not** absolute income, and thus accounts for cost of living.

In other words, this is actually a pretty damn accurate measure of your average person’s *actual living standards*. 

Bottom line: *Poverty is all relative*.

Are we really saying that someone who is middle class in Greece, Russia or Turkey is somehow living an extremely shitty life and can’t even function day to day? Of course not. Yet someone who is middle class in Russia is quite literally at the poverty line in Canada. In fact, the person in Canada making the poverty line is actually slightly *better* than our middle class Russian dude.

Now, to be clear, I am not saying that capitalism is some sort of deity or that we don’t need taxes, welfare, unions etc. 

What I am saying is that much of the doomerism in my generation (Gen Z) about how nobody can afford to survive is coming from the right place, but just objectively wrong when it comes to the actual data.

What I am **NOT** saying is that global poverty is not a problem. It absolutely 100% *is*. Please don’t change my view by saying “but what about India”, because I’m not saying that it isn’t appalling that the average living standards in India don’t even come close to the poverty line in Greece, or well below the poverty line in Canada.",12.0
701,t3_r6kinl,CMV: Calzones are way better than pizzas.,"So for the past 5 years I’ve worked at a New York style pizza restaurant. I started off as the dishwasher and worked my way up to the kitchen and I’m now one of the head cooks. If there is one thing that I’ve learned over the years, is that calzones for so many reasons IMO are just better than a pizza. 

For starts, the portion size is perfect. It’s super easy to consume too many slices of pizza, but a calzone is perfect because it’s always one ur plate in one portion. And 9 times out of 10 it’ll leave you full. Vs a pizza we’re you’ll only realize you were full on you’re 5th slice, you sit there and realize “I was full 2 slices ago.” 

Next up is sauce dose. On most Northern American inspired calzones, you can control the sauce dose. Sometimes when eating I want a little sauce, or I want a lot of sauce. With a pizza you can’t control that, you just get what you get. With a calzone you will always be able to control the amount you want.

Lastly, it’ll stay hot for a long time. Calzones are a pocket of cheese ricotta and other stuff. It traps all the heat. Vs a pizza that’s got a ton surface area for heat to escape.

703,t3_r6j5w3,cmv: God exists.,"EDIT: I changed my mind, yet I'm still very confused. Please read the following:  


/u/xmuskorx said:

\&gt;Then who created God?

Nothing. My argument leads to the conclusion that through a certain amount of regress, one must arrive at a beginning, since the universe certainly is not infinite in the negative direction.

The question to ask is ""how much will one have to regress to find this so called God?""

I've thought about it just now. This leads to an infinite regress in causality. It means that there is no starting point when it comes to cause and effect, and as such, no ""God"".

But at the same time, it does not disprove my reasoning about how the universe did not exist always. How do I reconcile these two notions?

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I'm not religious, nor am I a member of a sect.

    My argument is purely philosophical. If anyone is knowledgeable in the field of Limits and calculus, please correct any technical mistakes or misunderstandings I could've made. Everyone else is welcome to try and change mind regarding this issue, because while it relies on Math (in general loose terms), it's still very philosophical in nature.

I've managed to convince myself of the existence of God. By God, I mean the originator of the universe, it could be anything: A thing, a phenomenon, a conscious being, Jesus, Allah, YHWH, etc.

My argument is based on the conclusion that the universe MUST have had a beginning. This is a proof by contradiction. Now please, imagine a timeline:

* Our reference time is 0. If I state that event E happens at time +inf - in other words, event E is infinitely far in the timeline away from our current time reference - then we can ascertain that event E will never happen.
* In other words: ""Event E occurring in +inf seconds means: Event E will never occur, as an infinite amount of seconds cannot pass, logically speaking""

Now, take that timeline and rotate it 180 degrees.

* Event E occurs at -inf seconds from our reference (0). Meaning that since the occurrence of event E, an infinite amount of time must have passed.
* That is nonsensical, because in the first place, we cannot state that event E occurred truly, as it lies infinitely away from our state of reference. And if it did occur, the conclusion is that there will be an infinite amount of time separating the date of E to our reference time (0).

This leads to one conclusion: The assumption that the universe has always existed, in other words, that such an event E that represents a limit at -inf exists, leads to an incongruity: There can be no ""now"".

If indeed there has been an infinite amount of time, then ""now"" cannot be defined. Just as the first timeline shows, any event E defined at +inf cannot happen. As such, there can't be a now, and we would simply not exist.

I've thought hard about a counter argument to this. The thing that comes to mind is that 0, 1, 2,3, pi, etc still exist in the number line even if real numbers are infinite. But my counter counter argument to this is that time only flows in one direction, and that t=4 cannot exist without the existence of t=3. That means instants have to flow into each other, continuously, IN ORDER. meaning that an eternal unverse implies our nonexistence.

another argument that reinforces my thinking is entropy of a system must start at 0.

The universe has a beginning and whatever lies at the start of the universe is what represents God. My opinion is that we're part of a computerized simulation, which you're free to discuss as well but isn't the point of the CMV. Just my 2 cents.",9.0
704,t3_r6it16,CMV: I am not crazy for not wanting a credit card,"Recently, someone asked me if I had a credit card and I said no and explained to them that I'd prefer to save up for the things I want rather than use credit to get them. I would prefer to to avoid debt if I can. The person then gave me a weird look as if I was crazy. They mentioned that credit cards can protect your money better than a debit card in the case that your account gets stolen. It helps you build your credit score so that you can finance a car and get a mortgage, etc. All things that I've heard before.

I see the cash back and rewards as an incentive to get you to use the card. To quickly summarize my view on this, ""If something is free you are the product."" Also, Credit Cards are aggressively marketed, it's the only product that I've ever had sent to me in the mail. They are also offered at stores that have nothing to do with finance, like retail. While I worked retail we had quotas for the amount of credit cards we had to sell to customers. We didn't do that for any other product, no other product in the store had a quota. That's very suspicious. 



When it comes to security of a debit card vs credit card, I don't see why you couldn't find a way to mitigate that risk. You could just keep small amounts on a debit card and make transfers as needed via mobile banking. Also, it's not as if the bank doesn't care at all if you money is stolen, it might just take a bit longer to recover it, is what I've been hearing. In that case, again, keep smaller amount on in your checking and make transfers as needed. 

When it comes to financing a car, why can't you just save up and/or buy a used car? If you absolutely had to take out a loan then I'm sure you'd be able to, you might just have to pay a higher interest rate, which I'd personally be willing to do to avoid the unnecessary stress and debt of a credit card.

When it comes to a mortgage why can't you just rent until you've saved up enough to buy a home? Again, if you absolutely need to take out a mortgage I'm sure there will be someone who can manually underwrite it for you, you might just have to pay a higher interest rate, which again I'd rather do in order to avoid the stress of credit cards.

Also, recently I've learned that credit cards are largely a U.S phenomenon. If you go to a subreddit like r/askEuropeans  for example, and search credit cards, you will see that many Europeans don't have or use credit cards. They just take out loans when they need them, mostly for mortgages. This leads me to believe that credit cards are just another dumb cultural norm, like tipping in the U.S (Gratuity &gt; Tipping, businesses should be the ones paying their staff, it shouldn't be up to the customers discretion.) This makes me want to stay away from them.

When you borrow money you pay more in total than you would have if you had just saved up the money, not taking inflation into account. The difference is in how long you're willing to wait.

Don't you guys think it's a bad thing that the U.S runs on credit and not saving? Does that bother you at all?

If you need a credit card then I have no problems with you getting one. But I'd perfer to avoid it if I can.

While I understand the human side to want to see bad punished, harsh punishments from a logical standpoint are not effective.

Still, I have seen even within the bounds of the fucked up American justice systems incredibly long sentences people asking for even harsher ones. While I understand incredibly harsh punishments are a standard, from a logical POV there is no sense to drive for even harsher punishments on top of the high punishments.

Think a guy on the news talking about beautiful girl killed by *x* cause, or someone commenting about someone else’s daughter , or a talk show host presenting someone as ‘the beautiful’ so and so. It’s much less common for dudes to be complimented as handsome in the scenarios above. The fact that people feel the need to bring up a women’s physical attractiveness at every occasion, seemingly just because, strikes me as creepy and objectifying, but such statements are rarely checked in any way. There are so so so many characteristics about a person unrelated to their physical appearance you can use if you wanna compliment them, many don’t take much longer to make out than just the observation that they ‘are beautiful’. And it’s clear people don’t mean this in the more general  ‘life is beautiful ’ sense of the word, they’re talking about physical beauty.

Freed from all but the most limited standards, one will find all sorts of opinions, but the ones that will take hold are those that bypass one's capacity for reason and insinuate themselves aboard the vehicle of fear and outrage. Further, of these sorts of opinions, the ones with the largest platforms to reach the most people will be the ones that most take root. From these opinions will sprout forth a divide in nation that sets it into conflict with itself, civil war.

To be particular, it is the commitment to freedom of speech that enables propaganda outlets, like FoxNews, to spread lies and sow division unimpeded, which will (or has already) culminated in a total breakdown of the public discourse where truth has no value. This compounds upon itself and will accelerate the division until [there are people murdering their fellows in the streets](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville_car_attack) and [politicians creating laws to protect their rights to do so](https://www.vox.com/2021/4/25/22367019/gop-laws-oklahoma-iowa-florida-floyd-blm-protests-police).

When looking for this on reddit people seem to think latino is an ethnicity or a race when both of them are wrong.

For a start i would like to put the spanish, english and portuguese definition of ethnicity in here

Acording to the RAE ethnicity is

**1.** f. Comunidad humana definida por afinidades raciales, lingüísticas, culturales, etc.

Oxford dictionary

2. the fact of belonging to a particular ethnic group (= a group of people that share a cultural tradition)

3. an ethnic group; a social group that shares a common and distinctive culture, religion, language, or the like:

4.  Grupo de pessoas concentradas na mesma área geográfica que partilham as mesmas condições económicas, habitacionais, sociais e culturais, tendo também em comum a língua nativa.

None of this apply to Latam

84% of Uruguayan population is of  European descent, 6% of african descent,9 % of amerindian descent and the rest are mostly asian in 0.5%.

Black Uruguayans are still Latinos as well as White and Asian Uruguayans, other countries like Brazil have more african descent and countries like bolivia have more amerindian descent, all of them are latino.

Latin america does not use the same language, Brazil speaks portuguese and Haiti speaks french.

Cultural traditions in america vary wildly (i know it may be hard to believe but we don't all use sombreros and listen to mariachi) even for countries in close proximity like chile and argentina traditinons vary a lot.

Even more comparing to brazil since it's portuguese influence and the bigger african influence gave it really different cultural traditions, food, customs, festivities, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The main religion in latin america is catolicism, but countries like argentina has the 5th biggest jewish population in the world, brazil has one of the biggest muslim communities, almost 60% of uruguayans don't believe in anything.

Cultural traditions on the southern cone can't be associated with religion.

Even between Uruguay and Argentina we have cultural differences.

719,t3_r62d58,"CMV: Capitalism isn’t just exploitative, it’s anti-democracy (and republicanism).","Capitalism is a system that relies on authority and hierarchy. Every form of capitalist enterprise, from big corporations to small businesses, are wholly reliant on oligarchic control. Whether that’s an owner or shareholders, it is power and decision-making concentrated in the hands of a small minority of people that are served by people that quite frankly make nothing close to what the owners of the enterprise make. 

Regulations are a method of circumventing this, of course. But they’re exactly what they say they are: regulations. Attempts to restrict the influence of business owners over the populace. They are, as many conservatives will tell you, against the spirit of competition in a capitalist economy. The government is expected to prevent particularly egregious examples of capitalism run rampant, such as monopolies, but business owners in a capitalist system are constantly attempting (and expected) to exploit loopholes and avoid these restrictions. As such, only extremely vigilant, intrusive governments are equipped to limit capitalism, thereby further reinforcing a more hierarchical, authoritarian society. 

This problem is further exacerbated by the most capitalist capitalism of all capitalism: marketing. People are easily swayed by psychological need fulfilled by short term rewards, which marketing exploits to the fullest. Marketing is by nature about changing how people think. Coincidentally, this is very effective for political campaigning. As someone who’s worked in both industries (and campaigning is absolutely an industry), they’re incredibly transferable skillsets. Knowing how people think and will react based on the analysis of previous reactions and trends is a key component to both. And while this wouldn’t be a problem on its own, in a democracy with non-govt funded campaigning, private entities with the most money to feed into their chosen candidates are king. What this means is that, in a capitalist democracy, many will willingly vote people into power that will reduce the same regulations they should enforce. Another way to undermine the regulations against them. And once again, the only way to defend against this is to specifically limit the ability of someone to financially contribute to a political campaign. A regulation which capitalists attempt to thwart through a things like Citizen’s United in the US.

Finally, as an aside to the fact that regulations, the answer to capitalism in a democracy, are specifically anti-capitalist by design and are constantly tested for weak points by owners, capitalism also heavily undermines equality under the law, another key tenet of democracy. The wealthy are basically immune to many low level forms of punishment that take the shape of financial penalties, i.e. Jeff Bezos choosing to pay 10k parking tickets rather than move his car. If I got a 10k parking ticket I would not be able to make rent that month, whereas that’s a tiny fraction of Beso’s wealth. As such, while such a ticket is an insurmountable barrier to me, it is no such thing to him. It’s barely an inconvenience, to the point that while his parking spot was being fixed (or something like that) he chose to pay the fines rather than walk a little farther than normal.",0.0
720,t3_r614p4,CMV: The term “theory” in scientific discourse should be replaced with the term “model”.,"I'm sure most of us have encountered the inane argument from the anti-science crowd, “that's just a theory!” What largely originated with young earth creationists dismissing evolution as “just a theory” has become a staple of the science denial crowd in general — from germ theory denial, to those who deny quantum mechanics and general relativity. It's a frustrating argument, because the scientific term “theory” doesn't match up well with the vernacular sense of the word — this makes it easy for the average joe to get confused about the term, and an uphill battle for those of us with a better understanding of science to explain it to them.

And look, I get it — people in specialized fields of study or inquiry often need their own technical jargon with specialized meaning in order to efficiently and effectively communicate among themselves about their field. This is understandable — common language is generated in an intersubjective and haphazard way that often makes it unfit for technical use. So why should established science terminology bend to the common vernacular?

Because science is supposed to be for the public good, not merely the gratification of experts and academics. And if it is to be for the public good, then it is vital that the public be as educated in science as they can be. And if the public is to be educated in science, then we should remove barriers to that education where we can. The whole purpose of language, including specialized terminology, is to clearly pass thoughts and ideas from one person to another — so if language is not adequately serving that purpose, if it inhibits the transmission of ideas more than it facilitates it, then it should be clear that we need to change the language.

I see this confusion happen in more than just the science deniers — even among people who are more science inclined, I have seen confusion about the term. Hell, *I've* been confused about the term in the past — it is shamefully recent that I really acquired a solid understanding of the difference between a theory and a hypothesis, beyond just the general idea that a hypothesis is what you have before experimentation and a theory is what you have afterward, which is not at all an accurate way to define a theory. And yet, this was about the best my science teachers in school could come up with.

So what is the essence of a theory, in scientific terms? It's a useful model of how something works from which you can make predictions. That's it. So why not just call it a model instead? “Model” doesn't have the connotation of being unproven that “theory” does in the common vernacular. A model *can* be unproven, inaccurate, or just plain wrong — or it can be thoroughly proven, airtight, and factually correct. And the term “model” much more readily implies the definition of “theory” above than “theory” itself does. This would seem to be the superior choice of terminology with zero downsides, apart from some textbooks and encyclopedias having to be changed, and scientists and academics having to get used to the new terminology.

So, where am I wrong here?

To head off the slippery slope counterargument of “does that mean we should change all scientific terminology to make it public-friendly?” — no, because sometimes that's not feasible, but it does imply that *some* other terms could potentially be subject to such change. Language is not static — it is the nature of language to constantly change. If we do not change to match changing language, then we may increase the probability of miscommunication. We have a long history of doing this already — such as with the words “moron” and “retarded”, which have rightly fallen by the wayside in medical terminology because of the way language has changed. Because language is ever-changing, we are already on this slippery slope — there is no getting off it, we can only adapt.",9.0

722,t3_r5ydwo,"CMV: The ESRB (and similar international equivalents) shouldn't exist, or at least should be disregarded by the industry.","For those unaware, the ESRB is the American board that rates video games. It operates independently of government, and is enforced by various parts of the industry.

My opinion is that the ESRB (going forward, this will generally refer to all similar entities overseas unless otherwise stated) only exists to censor content, and thus should be disregarded in favor of greater artistic liberty and personal responsibility in evaluating games.

Let's start at the beginning. The ESRB itself was created in the 90s in response to backlash over games being tOo vIoLeNt, like doom and mortal kombat because of mounting pressure to indepently regulate, preempting government regulation. This threat of government intervention is why I believe the ESRB is bad. It has undue power over artistic liberty because of the threat of government censorship. While government enforcement has been ruled out in the US, other countries are stuck with legally enshrined rating systems.

ESRB ratings are literally just projecting entirely arbitrary moral standards onto art, and forcing it to display their opinions of it. While I respect their right to provide their opinions on games like any other reviewer, I believe it should not be forced onto games uninterested in the system, much like how metacritic and ign reviews aren't listed on the box.

I hold this view because there are many instances of games being censored specifically to fall within rating categories, and more broadly, bring created with those categories in mind because they can significantly effect sales. For example, getting an AO rating immediately gets you out of many stores, solely because of the rating. It's often considered as game killing to get that rating because of how much it limits distribution.

Remember earlier when I said these standards are largely arbitrary? That's because of their usage of concepts like mild/moderate/severe to determine the rating. It's entirely a matter of opinion whether or not something, especially sexual content, is mild, moderate, or severe. How is this something we allow to be forced onto art? I see no movements to have art galleries placed under age restrictions because there's pictures of tits, but pictures of tits get games placed in M at a minimum.

As an example of how these ratings can be entirely arbitrary, I'll give an example of some games I've played: persona 4 golden (p4g) and persona 4 dancing all night (p4d). Both of these games contain pretty serious topics including death and numerous sexual references, but p4d is only rated ""T"" while p4g is rated ""M"". Is the difference simply amount of content? Are long rpgs simply stuck with higher ratings because they have more of everything?",14.0
723,t3_r5y5vo,"CMV: If humanity ends and I was the last person alive, and able to restart humanity, I wouldn't","So, yes, I understand this is extreme, however, I think this is a stepping stone for me to understand the views of 'not having human populations go down'. 

So what came about this thought experiment is people keep going on and on about the low birth rates. I fail to see how that's a problem, supposing after my death. 

So lets say somehow I was a vampire like human and can live a long time but not 100% immortal. Suppose EVERY human is dead, but I have 1000 frozen fetus (or however many required so that in the future, breeding wouldn't be a problem with incest) that can, with a push of a button, start their growth. The question is, why should I? Suppose I have a drug that will kill me and a bomb to blow up the fetuses. Lets suppose it's just you and me. Suppose you are an AI. Convince me why I should start their growth. 

I think if my view changed here with this thought experiment, my other view will change. But for background, people talk about how 'humans' will die if we don't keep population above replacement level. I think that's stupid. Eventually, humanity will cease to exist. We didn't exist even when life started, why shouldn't the further progression of evolution be any different. I also don't see why I should be worried if we are dipping below even 1 billion. I have learned that humans historically had less than a million world wide at some point. I think us not having kids isn't suddenly gonna collapse us humans as i'd be a slow decline. Like, lets assume fertility rate gets reduced first 1%. The population goes down, say 2% worldwide. Lets say by every generation we go smaller. The reduction would probably be significant only afte 6 generations, long after we are dead. 

Humans have adjusted to population booms, why can't the reverse be the same?

Now, maybe I'm misunderstanding people. Maybe people are saying replacement should be for the country, and that's what they are worried about. Maybe, but I think people argue badly then. And anyways, I'm address those that genuinely think that humans having fewer kids is a bad thing for me. I'm not convinced I should care.",0.0
724,t3_r5wg6b,CMV: Transathletes should NOT be allowed to compete in their nonbiological group.,"I know trans topics are a frequent occurrence on this sub, and I credit some of these to helping me understand more and develop a fuller and somewhat educated viewpoint on the whole gender complexity and transperson progression happening in current society.

One issue I can't get past, however, is society allowing transitioned athletes to compete in their nonbiological group. Particularly men who have transitioned to women competing against biological women when it's absolutely very clear that males have marked biological advantages in strength, power, and endurance (among other things) over females. I don't understand how it's fair to sports, competition, or biological women to allow this. It comes across as almost disgustingly narcissistic of transathletes who would think that the injustice of them not being allowed to compete in the gender group they've transitioned to, despite well understood biological problems to this, would be worse than the injustice done to the countless biological athletes who have none of the natural advantages these transathletes carry. Gender is a result of social organization to the most degree, however biology is not - and professional sport competition, at it's core, is not an arena of social play, it's a battleground of talent and competition to see who is the best. This is why we don't let people cheat.  It's supposed to be a level playing field where talent, strategy, and experience sets people apart. This is why men and women are separated in the first place. 

This is a biological issue not a gendered one. It's called Men's Basketball, but really it's Male Basketball; and Male Transitioned to Female athletes, dominating in Female sports, is not at all a good thing, and I would love to understand why some people think it is and potentially change my view on this.

To be clear, because this is Reddit, I have no issues with transpeople in society. People who switch gender for any sort of reason couldn't bother me less. As with much of my personal philosophy, people can do what they want, who am I to judge or tell them otherwise. I agree with the idea that gender is socially constructed, but as far as I am aware and from what I understand, it's not possible to completely change a male into a female, or vice versa, and this is where transathletes become a problem. 


*One caveat to my view would be if we could completely negate biological advantages in a male transitioned to female athlete. The only was I see this happening though, is if a male transitioned at an incredibly young age to female (prior to puberty), perhaps the biological advantages male athletes carry over female athletes would be negligible in this case. However, 1) I don't believe we have the data yet to be confident in a sufficient understanding of this detail - due to the newness of the conversion technology and hormone therapy; and 2) I don't believe children or adolescents possess the necessary amount of life experience nor just flatout understanding to truly make the decision for themselves to undergo such permanent biological tinkering. Furthermore, I don't believe adults who have authority over these adolescents should be allowed to control a child's destiny in such a manner. These two caveats to my original caveat mean that I stand with my original view that transathletes should not be competing amongst their nonbiological group.

As a bonus idea to my view - I think transathletes should have their own categories. MtF sports and FtM sports. This would keep the integrity of sports and competition alive while still allowing transathletes to live their best life without being selfishly detrimental towards other athletes and the spirit of competitive physical events. They should have their own groups!

EDIT: when I refer to ""nonbiological group"" I mean there are two biological groups people are born into - male or female - and transathletes should not be allowed to participate in the one they were not born into.",32.0
725,t3_r5vhqu,"CMV: Long nails (i.e., beyond a specified length) should be banned – especially in the service industry and/or educational institutions (where you interact closely with other people)","I’m all for self-expression and the right to dress the way one sees fit. However, like with everything, it’s best done in moderation. I’ve seen the most impractical nail lengths over the last few months – so long that they’re practically claws. If you can navigate that length and/or find it attractive, that’s a personal preference but in certain scenarios, I think they need to be banned.

The biggest reason for this is how unhygienic it is. Nails harbor all kinds of germs and bacteria. The longer they are, the more space there is for germs to get stuck in. Long nails are also much tougher to clean, making it more unlikely that the germs will be constantly removed/killed. Furthermore, germs aren’t necessarily visible. Even if your nails “look clean”, they’re not! Every surface has germs and the more surface area you make available, the more germs you provide shelter for. In the service industry, as an educator, or any other profession where there’s intimate contact with food and/or people, having a hub of germs at your fingertips should be a hard no. This is becoming more and more of a concern with the spread of diseases like COVID-19.

Of course, some people with long nails will ensure they’re well-maintained and appropriately cleaned. However, should we be comfortable having faith that everyone with long nails will be hygienic and put our health, quite literally, in their hands?

**edit(s):** I agree with comments that talk about it being necessary in the food and service industry but probably not in education.

Quick clarification for context: I come from a country where, although it's a ""rule"" to wear gloves in the service and food industry, it's not enforced to the point that the rule is merely a suggestion. It's with that context that I believe it should be mandatory to maintain hand hygiene or simply mitigate the problem at the root.",0.0
726,t3_r5uyyr,"CMV: The only path way for an average American to GUARANTEE an eventual spot in the top 1%, is to be a hard working freshman in high school that is aware of only 3 career paths"," 

What is the most reliable and safe way to launch a career that lands you into the top 1%, without taking on massive risks such as entrepreneurial endeavors, or becoming a criminal?

There is just about 3 careers: high tech(FAANG), consulting, investment banking/private equity

Get into any of the above careers, and follow the typical career progression? You will be a guaranteed 1%er

These careers, are not like medicine or law, where at any point you decide in your life you want to work hard, you can achieve. These are meritocratic careers. The ones listed above, are anti-meritocratic, as they selectively choose applicants only from top universities. Sure, getting into those top universities is a meritocratic process, but past that, there are large disparities in the life outcomes of these graduates vs any other graduate below at top 15 university.

These careers require 1 thing: for you to understand that not only these careers exist, and that all you need to do is maintain a competitive highschool GPA to enter a top 10-15 university. Assuming you are not already a top 15 undergrad student, you simply cannot be a junior in college and realize you want to pursue one of these paths. Its too late.

Upon achieving that, albeit difficult at the time,, you then have access to those 2 aforementioned careers. (I am leaving tech out because it is a new field, and consulting/IB have been around for a VERY long time)

These are the only careers where if you follow the traditional track, do what your peers are doing, you can expect to reliably make 500k-1M+ by the time you are 40. Yes it takes alot of hard work from age 15-25, but that is a decade of time. Compared to 99% of Americans who work their butt off from 25-50 (25 years) and will never see that kind of money. In fact, most even continue to work just as hard from 50-65, and STILL wont get close.

While your banking and consultant buddies are out there with a 1M+ nest egg by the time they are in their mid 30s. Yes they worked hard, but at the end of it, me and you will work much harder from 25 and onwards.

The difference is that they worked hard early on, for a meager 10-15 years, while the rest of us will work hard for 25 years+ and not even get close to their level.

Once you get to the end of college, you realize just how easy highschool was, and just how much the college you attend dictates your future outcomes.

Issue being, is most of us are not aware that there are actually careers that net you 1M+ by the time you are in your 30s.

727,t3_r5udqz,CMV: The onus of sustainability is excessively placed on consumers and the obligation should instead be placed on corporations.,"Much of the media we read today about sustainability is focused on what consumers should be doing to move the needle. This includes things such as recycling food containers, composting food scraps, repairing and reusing clothing rather than purchasing new, etc. As corporations continue to produce these items, the proper disposal and thus environmental impact, is placed on the consumer. 

On the other hand, corporations are publishing lofty goals about recycled materials and reduced carbon footprint by 2050 or other far-off timeframes. Yet, there is little regulation to ensure that these goals are achieved. There isn’t a single governing body which is responsible for measuring the attainment of these statements, which doesn’t hinder the goodwill of creating the goals, but does little to hold corporations accountable for achieving them. 

At the end of the day, large corporations are responsible for much of the waste which harms the environment and should have a greater obligation and more enforcement of sustainable methods and materials. While end users are also responsible, humans fall victim to common errors and shortcomings which make true environmental impact, one that moves the needle, nearly impossible for individual users, even collectively as compared to large businesses. While the responsibility for sustainability and carbon footprint is often targeted towards consumers, the narrative should instead be on large corporations and how to hold them accountable to finding sustainable solutions.",2820.0

I'm here to discuss his intention and the narrative going around that he's a Black Supremacist. 

Ignoring how insignificant the history and damages behind ""Black supremacy"" is compared to white supremacy or how ridiculous it is to compare the two, folks have a habit of mixing it with basic common sense. Being aware of systematic racism for example, or being rightuflly wary around with people due to past experiences, alot of right wing trolls and tabloids see that and shout ""Black supremacist!"".

To boot they take the assertation he's a black supremacist and push that into the Black Lives Matter movement. There's no evidence he even supports BLM beyond him simply being black, and even then there's no credible evidence he or BLM itself are terrorists or want to slaughter whites en mass.

I've tried speaking to people but none of them have rational arguements, they keep pointing to his social media and facebook (Which itself is just described as a shitposting account) and I've looked through them. All his posts chalk up to is ""Racism is bad and I hate it"", frankly, it's less extreme than the things I was taught in a basic public school.

I feel like him simply being aware of and having no tolerance for systematic racism is what folks are really afraid of. MLK and Malcom X were more blunt than this man ever was, and likewise folks are still calling them black supremacists.

I'm perfectly willing to post links to his social media posts but I'm not sure if posting them will cause this post to be auto-removed or not. All of this can be true, and he can still just be a nutcase that wanted to kill people/beats his wife. I won't accept any arguements that bring that up because that's a given, he's crazy for it.

The narrative is just dumb and I can't help but feel it's another effort from Russian/Chinese trolls, since it seems to come right after the Kyle Rottenhouse verdict which had alot to do with the Black Lives Matter movement and race, and alot of the folks obbsessed with Darrell Brooks seem to want to discredit the entire movement

729,t3_r5tvep,"CMV: There are four genders (man, woman, trans man, trans woman)","i'm deriving this line of argumentation from the following premises:

1. social constructs are fuzzy categories that comprise of elements complying with some subset of properties (for gender that'd be a set of passive and performative cues).
2. the definitions of a social construct are determined by social consensus. they cannot be personally bargained for. (in the same way that i can't ask someone to believe that a green object is blue, i cannot ask someone to believe that a man is a woman. intuition is not a choice.)
3. {man, woman, trans man, trans woman} are all social constructs. as such, they are determined through consensus of perception.

based on these premises, because ""trans men"" and ""trans women"" are perceived socially as separate categories from their counterparts, they are in fact their own genders.

the best example of what this means in practice is the statement ""trans women are women"".i can make several statements regarding that assertion, all based on the above premises:

A) ""trans women"" are socially understood to be separate from women, otherwise the sentence wouldn't make sense. we all know what the sentence means, and that wouldn't be possible if we didn't hold ""trans women"" as a social construct in our collective minds. hence ""trans woman"" is a gender unto itself.

B) the statement is correct for trans women which will generally be perceived by society as women (ie ""passing""). these women will be viewed by society as women and as such are women. this again comes from the definition of social constructs being consensus based categories. those who are not perceived by society as women, are trans women. they are such because society perceived them as such. this position is not personally or politically negotiable.

C) the political assertion ""ALL trans women are women"" can become correct in the future through the evolution of gender categories. at that point the above sentence will no longer make sense because ""trans"" will be rendered meaningless as a qualifier. it'll just become a tautology: ""women are women"". until such time, the statement may be situationally descriptive for an individual, but categorically incorrect.

some final general thoughts:

\-i make the above assertions with the context that, as fuzzy categories, the level of certainty can vary for individual cases while not harming the soundness of the category as a whole. think ""[pile of sand paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox)"". difficulty in placing a state doesn't invalidate the fuzzy categories it could reasonably be placed in. so androgynous people, for instance, do not invalidate the gender categories just because they are difficult to place with confidence.

\-ofc everything stated here can be applied to the alternative case of men and trans men.

\-social constructs are, obviously, society dependant. every society will have its own consensus based on its specific social interpretations of reality. as such we must keep in mind that when we say that make a statement about something based on it being a social construct, that also means that our statement may be definitionally untrue for a different society. basically, it's a boundary condition.

730,t3_r5ti3k,CMV: Legalizing all drugs would not significantly reduce the number of people in prison for drug crimes in the US.,"EDIT/UPDATE: I've changed my view *slightly* due to learning more of the facts. If we eliminated all drug possession charges (which I was already in favor of), we could at most reduce the state and federal inmate population by 4.25%. That is better than nothing, but still not great. I'm still not convinced we should legalize meth production and recreational use.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in favor of legalizing marijuana, and live in a state with legal pot in the US. And I used to be in favor of legalizing all drugs until I learned some surprising facts about the issue.

People in favor of legalizing *all drugs* argue that doing so will solve a problem in the US. The problem is people--especially people of color--being imprisoned for drug crimes, especially drug possession which doesn't harm anyone else.

I recently learned however that [99% of people imprisoned for drug crimes in the US are for drug trafficking](https://www.drugpolicyfacts.org/chapter/drug_prison) (EDIT for source) (i.e. selling or intent to sell drugs). And of those people, [\~50% are in prison for meth specifically](https://www.ussc.gov/research/quick-facts/methamphetamine-trafficking). **That means \~50% of people in prison for drug crimes in the US are for selling or cooking meth.**

Meth strikes me as a totally different thing than pot. Meth labs produce 6lbs of toxic waste for every 1lb of meth. The chemicals used to produce meth also have a tendency to explode. And meth cookers often straight up boobytrap their meth labs with improvised explosive devices.

If you had a meth lab in your neighborhood, you'd want to be able to call the cops and get specialists with hazmat suits to take care of the situation. By contrast, if someone has a room full of marijuana plants with some purple grow lights in it, who cares? Doesn't hurt anybody.

If we wanted to prevent people from going to prison for drug crimes, we could consider legalizing meth. But legalizing drugs does not mean making all production and consumption of the drug legal. In CO for instance, it's legal to buy pot, but illegal to consume in public, illegal to have too many marijuana plants for personal use, illegal to resell what you buy at a dispensary, illegal to consume if you're under 21, illegal to have more than 2oz, and so on. To sell it legally, you have to have a storefront. Hotels can ban smoking pot, as can AirBnbs. Employers can randomly drug test for pot and fire you even though it's legal. So legal does not mean no laws, if anything there are *more* laws around pot now.

If we legalized meth, the first things we'd need is strong environmental regulations on disposing of toxic waste safely and properly, preventing lab explosions, and purity (not ""cutting"" the product with baking soda or something else cheap). Zoning laws would prevent meth labs from being in cities or even many rural areas, just as zoning laws prevent dispensaries from being too close to schools etc. Legal meth dealers might need to have storefronts and have large sin taxes, like how pot is taxed at a 15% rate in Colorado. This would make manufacture of legal meth many times more expensive than illegally produced meth, and illegal meth labs could continue to compete on price.

You'd basically get 2 categories of meth product: cheap commodity meth produced in illegal labs, and premium meth produced in legal labs. That means we'd still be needing law enforcement to shut down illegal meth labs and arrest meth cookers and dealers, and hold them in prison so they don't do it again.

It seems unlikely that legalization of all drugs would therefore make much of an impact on the number of people in prison in the US for drug crimes.

Since I've never heard anyone talk about these facts who is pro-legalization, I don't know if I'm wildly off here or not. So I encourage people who know more about the issue to present arguments or facts that could change my view.

Arguments I can anticipate:

* **People are sometimes jailed for ""trafficking"" that are not intending to sell.** I don't know how common this is. I can see it in certain edge cases, like having 3oz of marijuana instead of 2oz. If you have a lifetime supply of a drug though, chances are you are selling. But perhaps this is much more common than I realize.
* **Legalizing could allow harm reduction.** Meth harm-reduction clinics could be opened, like they have in Canada for heroin, where users can get clean needles and free drugs so they don't overdose. I'm actually in favor of harm reduction. But I don't see how that would reduce prison sentences for illegal meth production and sales, only for possession for users. Perhaps it would reduce sales if you can get the product for free though, reducing slightly the number of illegal dealers. On the other hand, it would do the same for legal dealers, outcompeting on price and making it harder to run a legal meth business.
* **Other reasons for drugs to be legal, like personal liberty.** Perhaps we should allow people to ruin their own lives with drugs. Or perhaps there are responsible meth users who use small quantities for other purposes. That's a reasonable argument except doesn't address the issue of prison sentences for meth cooking and selling.",4.0
731,t3_r5snrz,CMV: The Godfather is severely overrated along with its entire genre,"The Godfather is severely overrated along with its entire genre

I enjoy watching films and have been trying to watch as many critically acclaimed movies as possible. 

One thing I’ve noticed is that the genre of organized crime completely dominates in the IMDb top 250. Some of the movies are…

The Godfather I (9.2)
The Godfather II (9)
The Godfather III (7.6)
Goodfellas (8.7)
Scarface (8.3)
Once upon a time in America (8.3)
The Irishman (7.8)
The departed (8.5) - this is by far the best of the lot for me
Gangs of New York (7.5)
Pulp fiction (loosely fits this description but I also enjoyed this one 8.9)
The untouchables (7.9)
Casino (8.2)

And probably a ton more that I’m missing along with The Sopranos but that’s a TV show. 

The thing I don’t get is that the movies are dull. I understand the symbolism in the movies and the cinematography is exceptional and they’re overall fine films but for them to dominate the rankings like this confuses me. I understand the commentary they make about power, family, corruption, and collapse and it doesn’t seem like there’s anything major going over my head. Yes the montage at the end of The Godfather was a great film moment but the rest of the movie felt the same as how I feel about the rest. 

There’s many more unique and interesting movies with better character development, better messages, creative plots, etc. The plot and concept have been done repeatedly over and over and it still draws critical acclaim with the Irishman being the most recent example.

732,t3_r5rzmh,CMV: Removing the dislike button on youtube sounds like a good thing.,"I know a lot of people are strongly opposed to removing the dislike button and I'm curious to know why I should want it back. 

My main problem with the dislike button is how it encourages **negative engagement**. If I ***HATE*** something, hitting that dislike button is a net positive for the content creator. The person I hate and would like to drive traffic away from is actually being rewarded by my engagement. 

Content creators are rewarded for engagement, not their dislike ratio. The dislike button encourages channels to pump out content designed to generate negative engagement which is extremely toxic to the whole platform and counter-productive to the goal of anyone who wishes to register their dislike. The dislike button absolutely contributes to the endemic of low quality *designed-to-be-bad* youtube content.

What am I missing?

733,t3_r5qq9u,CMV: There is no rational reason to believe that the world we pass to future generations will be better then one we currently live in.,"Trust me, this is an opinion I actually really want to be convinced otherwise, but I think there are a lot of solid arguments for why the world will get worse for future generations as a whole.  


Reasons why the world is going to be worse.  


* Destruction of our environment: It's no secret that Industrialized Society has systematically destroyed the environment. Forest's cut down, Oceans Polluted, Global Temperature Raised. Most Scientist believe that even if all international policy was committed to specifically mitigating or reversing harm, that the damage is already done.   

* Increasing Wealth Gap: I believe this to be a universal bad thing. Although I understand wealth gap is not necessarily the only way to judge economic prosperity, I think it is a good measure of how the recourses of the world are being utilized/distributed. And let me tell you folks its bad. According to a U.N. study the 26 richest people held more wealth then the lowest half of the global population. This trend can be seen in my country the U.S. as well as tones of other countries around the glob. Although you can argue wealth inequality is not inherently bad, because even if economic growth is unequal as long as growth exists its good, as long as there are limited resources and inflation, it will always result in the poor being worse of then they were before.  

* We are running out of energy (and other resources too): Energy resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas are running out. These are not renewable resources, and we already know where running out of these things. We've already implemented things such as fracking in order to get as much as we can from the natural world. But its not just energy. Are helium supply is diminishing, are natural water supply too. The Jerusalem Post predicts that at the current pace of human consumption we will begin to run out of natural resources in 20 years.  


Why technology won't save us  


* Technology will fix our problems: People claim that technology as a force of good, will fix the problems we have. Not only does this not acknowledge the fact that technology has limits to the type of problems it can fix, but it also assumes that innovation is an inherently good force, which it is not, its a neutral force. There is no question that there are technologies that have saved and help peoples lives, vaccines, tools that make peoples life easier,  but there is also no doubt that there are technology can be used to hurt people too. Machines of war, Facial recognition in china to moderate its population, computer viruses. In order for technology to even have the possibility of solving these problems we need to decide as a global society that these issues are worth the time investment, which as a whole we have not done.  


Now i'm not saying this apocalyptical future is inevitable. Maybe all the world 1% decide to donate all their money to making a more sustainable future. Maybe we invent a technology that gives us unlimited energy. Maybe aliens visit us, abduct all of humanity and we live in some sort of alien paradise. These are all possibility. What I'm saying is that if you look at the way humans have been existing for the past 200 years, and then you look at humanities current trajectory, It appears very likely that humanity is going downhill fast. Millennials and generation z are already starting to feel the effects of this negative downturn, why would it be any different for the next?",0.0

Personally, I feel anyone and everyone needs to take a full complete drivers exam every 2 years (maybe 3) on the road for a minimum of 30 minutes. Which should include, city streets, residential roads, highways, and a large emphasis on parking lots and parallel parking. I feel if we did this it would help motorists become more aware of themselves.  especially if you’re a poor driver. Now, if you should fail this test your license is revoked for a week and then two weeks and then it goes up until you pass. rescheduling it every week. If you’re past age 70 you should be required to take it every year. Also, all the extra money that the DMV would make from this after paying a fair wage to its staff, should go directly and only to repairing the roads and buying up places to make more FREE public parking. This is my view because people suck dick at driving. (myself included at times) but the lack of turn signals and sense of entitlement on the road is wild and I feel we need less motorists that suck.",3.0
736,t3_r5oiti,CMV: archery students should be allowed to rent out genesis bow and arrows if trustworthy students,"I just joined my high school archery program and the coach said not to buy a bow. And that tickled my brain so I asked one the other caches if I could borrow a bow and they said no because they need an adequate supply of right/ left hand bows and there’s no guarantee it will ever come back at all. And they recommend me to go see if this pawn shop that most archery students pawn their gear at had anything used. They didn’t but they had new ones so my dad got me one for 211$ including arrows. And got wax at Walmart and I bought myself a 3D deer to shoot at for 74$. And I hate to say it, I feel stupid buying it just so I can practice on the weekend. That’s the only reason. It’s like me spending hundreds of dollars on damn squishmallows for them to just sit on my shelf. I also contacted the sports director and they said the bows that are school property aren’t allowed to be rented out/borrowed. And to ask the coach if they’d hv any personal bows I could borrow since they been doing it for a decade. That didn’t work either. So I’m assuming if archery coaches hv their own bows from over the years that aren’t school property that’s the only bows that can be rented out. 

My point is I think only trustworthy archery students should be allowed to bring a bow home. Bc I think the pros outweigh the cons. The only cons I can think of are what if gets in the hands of a psycho student(future school shooter, criminal) and they decide to use it as a weapon. And what if there’s a freak accident setting up a target that could probably shut down the entire program permanently. And if the gear gets damaged who’s gonna pay for it. That’s the only 3 I can think of. 

I’d let this one girl, my moms friends with her mom, borrow my bow bc she’s been in the program since elementary school. Heck yeah but someone who’s new like me I understand why they wouldn’t if they do it bc who knows what I’m like. The coaches known that one girl since elementary bc they taught elementary, middle and now this year high school. I think she falls under that category of trustworthy students. 

The pros would be students wouldn’t have to spend 150-200$ on a bow alone. They would be able to practice on the weekends and make trips to a fun 3D archery range if they wanted to. They can prove they haven’t destroyed it by taking it to practice each time and letting the coaches inspect it to make sure no damages. They’d only need to buy the cheapest gear like wax bc I don’t think they’d give you wax for the bow. And arrows. 

If I was a coach with the 3 cons. I’d make sure that the student knows how to set up a proper shooting ground. What I do, I hang mine on a tree facing the woods at my dads bc we live near no neighbors. And at my moms in my front yard so I don’t shoot into the field or my neighbors. And I think that’s the biggest concern of would students be novice minded when setting up archery targets. On the psycho student issue this is the only thing I know that can help https://theconversation.com/school-shooters-usually-show-these-signs-of-distress-long-before-they-open-fire-our-database-shows-111242. Idk if the link works but teens show warning signs before becomings murders. And I think anyone associated with school are trained to notice these signs and get the student help. And when I look it up it says estimated 138 incidents of gunfire in 2021 at schools. I’d be concerned if the student couldn’t get ahold of a gun they’d use the bow to kill. Or the bow would make them move to deadlier weapons like a gun for violence. Or what if they killed someone’s dog with it. I’d make sure the student isn’t showing warning signs, and I don’t know if this is allowed of athletic coaches but ask their parents if the kids have dangerous risky behaviors or if they think they wouldn’t harm with the weapon. And last con I could think of was damage to the item. If I was a coach and the bow was damaged beyond repair and it was the students fault make them pay for it by a deadline. Say in 2 weeks you better hv 175$ or it’s handed over to your parents to pay. I think in 2 weeks, non working students, can come up with it somehow. I sold my baseball chair on marketplace locally for 145$ in 2 days. Ppl will give money for the craziest stuff on there. It’s worth a try if you hv junk you don’t need that can make a big profit. For working students idk bc I don’t hv a job rn since I’m 15. And then the parents pay if they can’t. If they can’t then delay it until they can but make them sign an official date of when they can. Like if they sign I can hv the money to you by December 1st. I don’t think coaches would be that lenient tho but if they gave it to a student who’s been with the program years and I’d trustworthy with equipment I don’t think this would happen bc they r responsible with weaponry. And I don’t think they’d do it on purpose. If it was an accident like they got hit by a drunk driver and the bow was in there with them that isn’t their fault. But since it’s not school property the school wouldn’t hv to pay for it. Maybe the 175$ would be shortened to 150$ since wasn’t their fault. Or they’d hv a longer deadline to pay so they can recover after the wreck. 

Idk this is just my view on this. And I understand why the school, archery program doesn’t want to take the risk of lending out bows. But if it’s a redneck town in the back hills of Kentucky I’d think it’d be safer. Not nowhere like Chicago.",0.0
737,t3_r5m2nt,"CMV: ""Xenobots"" are not robots","[A current article on CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/29/americas/xenobots-self-replicating-robots-scn/index.html) is touting the achievement of a group of scientists attempting to make a self-replicating ""living robots"" out of stem cells, which they have named ""xenobots"" after the genus of frog used in the study. I've got several problems with this classification:

**(1) A robot, under common usage, is manmade**

This is probably the weakest part of my view, and the lead author of the study has directly commented on this:

&gt;""Most people think of robots as made of metals and ceramics but it's not so much what a robot is made from but what it does, which is act on its own on behalf of people,"" said Josh Bongard, a computer science professor and robotics expert at the University of Vermont and lead author of the study.

&gt;""In that way it's a robot but it's also clearly an organism made from genetically unmodified frog cell.""

Under classical definitions, a robot is manmade, and that usually involved metal or plastic. This is really the ""hot dog/sandwich"" situation. If you tell someone you drew a picture of a robot, they won't picture this xenobot even if it's technically correct by meeting some loose definition of robot.

**(2) Robots should be able to perform more than one function**

The xenobots only perform a singular function - producing more xenobots from stem cells. We would think of a thing that performs only one function as a tool or a machine. A robot should be able to perform more than one function, and could be programmed to perform another function when desired. The xenobots can't be programmed as they have been designed specifically for reproduction, and any other function would need to be developed through the AI programs they used to create these xenobots.

**(3) The alternative definition provided is too broad to be useful**

By the author's own definition of robot, animals who would currently be in use by for tasks humans want them to perform would also be considered robots. A horse being ridden would be a robot. Dogs have been bred for centuries to become more friendly/submissive to human commands and to hunt/retrieve wild animals. Are dogs then robots?

If so, then the study has not produced the first self-replicating robot, because dogs and horses have been able to reproduce. Nor have they invented self-replicating organisms that perform human-desirable tasks, as bacteria produce insulin and other injectable medications.

**So what is it, then?**

I'd call a xenobot a bioengineered multicellular organism.",14.0

The reason one single person is obligated to pay child support is because they had a hand in bringing the child into the world, and they are responsible for it. Not just in a general sense of being there, but also in the literal financial sense were talking about here.

This makes perfect sense to me. What doesn't make sense is how it could *ever* be possible for someone to be legally obligated or responsible for a child that *isn't* theirs.

They had no role in bringing it into the world, and I think most people would agree they're not responsible for it in the general sense of being there, so why would they be responsible for it in the literal financial sense?

740,t3_r5ehjb,CMV: All Driver License Renewals Should Require Passing Another Driver’s Test,"I promote implementing a universal rule that all drivers operating a motorized vehicle should have to re-take another driving test in order to renew their license once expired. Currently, drivers can renew their license without demonstrating any new competency or improvement than the first day they received their license (such as age 16 at the younger end of the spectrum). Some drivers even get worse over time but have no checks in place to help prevent accidents. I see several problems with this system:

1) Fatalities and injuries caused by cars and their drivers

2) Our driving ability changes with time

3) Cars get inspected for safety but drivers do not

Point #1: Fatalities and injuries

Some of the main reasons for car accidents stem from preventable reasons: speeding, distractions, not obeying traffic laws, etc. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), “A total of 36,096 people died in motor vehicle crashes in 2019. The U.S. Department of Transportation's most recent estimate of the annual economic cost of crashes is $242 billion.” 

According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, “An estimated 20,160 people died in motor vehicle crashes in the first half of 2021, up 18.4% over 2020.”

Not only is this a public hazard, it’s a social and economic toll for all the damage done by drivers.

Point #2: Driving changes over time

You’re not the same driver you were when you first began driving. Some people develop shortcuts, old habits, bad habits, or suffer from physical impairments. Ex: Rolling the stop sign instead of coming to a complete stop. Some drivers might need other accommodations such as vision support, and limb and joint functioning to operate the vehicle safely. Ex: Someone with knee pain might have a harder time operating a clutch. These are generalizations, but I’m suggesting that everyone’s driving behavior changes over time.

Point 3# Annual inspections

Car are required to be inspected, or registered every year. But the people operating the vehicles are not asked to be re-evaluated. I know there are movements by insurance companies, and apps that track driving behavior. The Federal Highway Administration also implements different programs to reduce car incidents such as brighter signs, bicycle lanes, etc. These are helpful structural changes. 

However, this is not a direct means of actually determining if all drivers are up-to-date on driving regulations, and have the correct behavioral tendencies to stay safe on the road.",0.0

742,t3_r5afi2,CMV: The Universe Could Have Begun From Nothing Without a Supernatural Cause,"New Atheist Cosmologist Lawrence Krauss is famous for advocating a cosmological model in which the universe comes out of nothing with no cause at all.**¹**

Basically, the idea is that the universe tunneled**²** from a state of zero size/radius to a finite size and then started expanding. Zero size is the same as no size at all. Zero, in this context, represents nothing. For instance, if I say I have zero dollars in my bank account, that's the same as saying I have no dollars at all.

Now, some critics say**³** this initial state isn't really nothing, but is some kind of quantum vacuum. However, Dr. Krauss was very clear that he is not presuppposing the existence of a vacuum (or empty space). Instead, space and time themselves came into existence in that model!

But what about some kind of supernatural cause? Isn't that necessary? According to Dr. Krauss, the model works perfectly fine without any cause. As an example, he discusses ""virtual particle pairs"". These are particles (excitations/vibrations of fields) that temporarily appear and disappear.**⁴** Standard quantum mechanics requires that these particles do not have any cause. (I explored/defended this argument [elsewhere](https://callidusphilo.blogspot.com/2021/04/kalam_16.html#:~:text=assumptions%20underlying%20his-,prose.,-The%20Quantum%20Mechanical)). Thus, he argued, the same could be true of the universe -- even though the universe wasn't the fluctuation of a field/vacuum.

While this model wasn't proven to be true, it is a possibility which should be considered.

**¹** See, for instance, his book 'A Universe From Nothing', or Alexander Vilenkin's book 'Many Worlds in One.' Alternatively, see the documentary 'Before the Big Bang 9: A Multiverse from Nothing.'

**²** The word ""tunnel"" generally refers to a process called 'quantum tunneling' in which a particle, for example, is able to pass through (or tunnel) an energy barrier such as a field. In this case, the tunneling is from zero size to a finite size.

**³** See David Albert's review of Dr. Krauss' book on the New York Times.

**⁴** See [this visualization](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/startswithabang/files/2017/08/1-jTtmoTiIq5zlHOcaQGqHhQ.gif?) of QCD (Quantum ChromoDynamics) which illustrates how particle/antiparticle pairs pop out of the quantum vacuum for very small amounts of time as a consequence of Heisenberg uncertainty.

743,t3_r55cz4,CMV: The best way to combat the gender pay gap is to promote paternity leave,"I should preface this by saying I have absolutely no background in economics. I haven't arrived at the view I'm about to outline through research, but simply through thinking about it. The reason I'm making this post is to hopefully hear from people who have a better grasp on this stuff than me. I'm here for a productive and insightful discussion, not a debate. 

So, my understanding of the gender pay gap is that there's a fairly significant ( ≈21% in the US) disparity in how much men and women are paid that can mostly be chalked up to differing career choices, levels of education and time taken off work for pregnancy and childcare. I think this is an objective fact pretty much everyone can get on board with. The divisive bit comes in once you account for the factors I mentioned above and are still left with a meaningful disparity (≈5% in the US). Feminists tend to say this remaining disparity is a result of pure misogyny.

I'm of the opinion that the entire pay gap is a problem, but especially the adjusted bit. That's because even though the majority of the disparity probably isn't the result of employers explicitly choosing to pay men more than women, it's still the result of patriarchal cultural factors, such as parents encouraging their sons to go to college but not their daughters. Also, I wonder how much of the ""different career choices"" can be attributed to women leaving competitive, high-earning fields of work due to harassment in the workplace. 

Anyway, I have a feeling that an awful lot of those patriarchal cultural factors I alluded to stem from the fact that women generally need to take time off work as a result of childrearing and men don't. That's why I think the best thing we can do to meaningfully lower the gender pay gap is to promote paternity leave, both through cultural and legislative means. Ideally, I think every single person on earth should be entitled to at least 12 paid weeks off work upon childbirth or adoption. I realise many first world countries don't even guarantee paid maternity leave yet though, so I'm willing to set the net a little lower for a start. I'm not going to specify exactly what changes I want to be made because that would vary wildly from country to country, so I'll let you just go after my logic here.

I think this would greatly improve the pay gap situation (both the unadjusted and adjusted portions) as well as lead to societal improvements in other areas. For instance, I think it could lead to a decrease in men abandoning their children. 

For the record, I don't mind maternity leave still being slightly longer than paternity leave, at least in cases that don't involve adoption or surrogacy, considering pregnancy and breastfeeding are a thing. But I do think the aforementioned minimum 12 paid weeks for either parent would be a good thing to aim for in the long term.

744,t3_r5548e,"CMV: Signatures are an antiquated, useless system for authentifying identity on any document","TO BE CLEAR, By useless I mean ""Ineffective at doing what they intend to do"". In this context, that means identifying the person in question


Basically any time a signature is used. it's purpose is useless. Here are some examples:

1. A signature at the bottom of a formal email, next to their name and contact information
2. A legal document or ""official"" document, like something signed by a university, with a chairman head's signature at the bottom
3. Any document or form YOU sign where you include your signature.

In all of these cases, a signature can be faked very easily either digitally or by faking it yourself with some practice - Any remotely talented penman could fake almost any signature with enough practice, so simple put, absolutely nothing about a signature confirms that the person who claimed they wrote something actually wrote it. Moreover, it's not like signatures are a very good way of identifying people in the first place, seeing as most devolve into something you can't read, and in a sea of millions of people, there is surely lots of many overlaps by many. I've seen signatures that have literally devolved into just a squiggle with no letters! Others look like circles. In theory, it can be anything. It's such a poorly contrived security system that I think people know actually doesn't mean anything -- It's the same reason why I just filled out a form for the dentist and my signature came out terrible and incoherent, but it doesn't matter and I didn't care, nor did the dentists' office.

I think that the only practical use of signatures is to scare people into agreement / convince people that under this arbitrary system, a signature means something so if you signed off on it, you're obligated to be honest and in agreement. Realistically it has never meant anything. Programs like Docusign just let you copy and paste signatures from a given selection of handwriting! And of course, any mobile form of a signature, over mouse or touch screen, is usually quite different than the real thing in writing. Signatures and their existence are one of many reasons things like back cheques are insecure and can be faked -- If we used something else like fingerprints via special ink types and whatnot, we'd probably be much better off - Plus, fingerprints are already stored by the police and whatnot, and are much harder to fake.

Edit 1: To anyone saying that ""it's used so technically it isn't useless"", I'm aware of that and me mentioning it being useless is more of a juxtoposition of it not being useFUL because it's ineffective. Something useless can be defined as something not used OR something ""not fulfilling or not expected to achieve the intended purpose or desired outcome"" which is the meaning I intend here.  


Edit 2: Someone actually disagreeing with this point brought up some very pertinent information:  
Apparently, ""experts can correctly identify 95% of 'real' signatures, and correctly reject 71% of forgeries"". This is proof of how ineffective signatures are at identifying who wrote them! 30% failure rate is ABYSMAL! And that's by experts, wow. One could only wonder what it would be like among people who have no training, or have minimal training - They'd probably have a failure rate of well over 60%, because signatures empart NO information that varifies who wrote them

Edit 3 Last edit (probably):
There are now too many responses for me to respond to everything so I'd like to address a huge chunk of the comments right here. If you're talking about how ""Signatures are still useful in the context of formality or indicating agreement"" you are in essence ignoring what this is actually about. As I say very clearly in the title: ""Signatures are an antiquated, useless system FOR AUTHENTIFYING IDENTITY"", not for formalities, not for indicating agreement. Specifically for authenticity purposes, signatures are not effective, and that is the main purpose of them existing. If your response says ""Yes they are bad for authenticity purposes but..."" you're not disgareeing with me, you're showing that you agree. If your response says ""Yes signatures are a bad system and these other alternatives are better but..."" you're also just agreeing. I have seen a very small amount of responses that don't automatically go to either of these or just talk about agreement in the first place. Useful needs to be applied in the full context of my statement.",303.0
745,t3_r5338b,CMV: Inequality is a not a problem we should care about,"Qualifiers:

I am not saying ""it is not a problem under any circumstance"", I am saying ...

**(1) Poverty seems to me much more important than inequality. Reducing inequality seems to me only the right thing to do insofar as it reduces poverty.**

What can CMV: show me a situation where you have the choice to reduce inequality or to reduce poverty, and reducing inequality is the better choice.

What does NOT count is to say that it does both. In this case, I would say it's good because it reduces poverty, not because it reduces inequality.

I would like to see cases where the inequality is the relatively worse thing, not the poverty.

**(2) Inequality on its own is not a problem, it's the consequences of inequality we care about**

For example: I hear a lot that inequality causes unhappiness. This seems suspicious to me, but let's believe it. But there are other things that cause unhappiness too (e.g. a failed marriage). What is bad is the unhappiness, not the cause of the unhappiness.

What can CMV: show me that inequality is a problem on its own, it is NOT the consequences of inequality that are bad. What won't convince me is if you tell me inequality is linked to / causes XYZ and assume therefore it is bad (but it could be for different reasons, see below). 

**(3) If inequality causes other problems, it seems implausible to me that it's the only or even a dominant cause.** 

For example: Happiness. It seems to me people fall on a spectrum of neuroticism on the Five-Factor-Model, and neuroticism, I presume, is highly linked with life satisfaction (I could be wrong).

How can you make people less neurotic by reducing inequality? This seems to me a badly targeted measure. By how much can you reduce neuroticism by what intervention?

I admit this is quite a weak example. You can CMV if you show me how or why inequality is really a dominant cause (large effect size in studies) of a presumed bad outcome. 

What will NOT convince me is if you just assert that it is inequality that causes bad outcome XYZ. I want to see evidence, underpinned by good measurements of inequality (those are fiendishly hard) and a good discussion of alternative explanations.

**(4) The causes of inequality aren't things we should change, because the costs are too high**

For example: a big cause of inequality seems to be assortative mating. People increasingly choose their mating partners from people similar to them, e.g. clustering at universities. Smart parents are more likely to bring up smart children because of genetics and providing a better environment.

If a major cause of inequality is assortative mating, we would have to prohibit assortative mating to fight the cause. This seems to me a too strong violation of personal freedom.

This is probably my weakest point (because maybe there are good ways of fighting the causes of inequality that I am not aware of). You can reduce my believe in this point if you show me examples of where measures aimed at reducing inequality have had good results.

I am very curious to see those, and I would appreciate if you choose examples that are as strong as possible, e.g. even people with different political views can agree they have been effective.

**(5) Higher utility for everyone is better than lower utility (even if it involves inequality).**

This sounds a bit abstract, but consider the following scenario:

Scenario 1: Person A gets $100.000 and Person B gets $1m

Scenario 2: A gets $50.000 and B gets $50.000.

Scenario 2 is more equal, but in scenario 1 both have a higher utility (let's just assume utility &amp; money are the same even though that's wrong).

It somehow seems convincing to people that when someone asserts that somehow scenario 2 makes people more happy, that this is why we should choose scenario 2.

I find that implausible on the grounds that it would make all of society worse off. I know a lot of people somehow find that convincing ... and I don't get why. Can you point me at the original papers of the people that put forward this argument in a convincing way?

I know there are more sophisticated arguments that involve e.g. diminishing marginal utility, John Rawls maximin principle etc. I would love to have an educated debate about those.

What will also NOT convince me is ...

\- Just saying ""Isn't it bad that 0.1% of people own 50% of the world's wealth?"" (or something like that) 

Maybe, but it's only bad insofar as it causes other bad things (see above). It seems often to me that just invoking this (or some kind of related) supposed fact is enough for most people to believe that inequality is bad. That's not enough for me for the above reasons. If the rich people did something bad to get what they have, the bad thing is the bad thing they did, not the resulting inequality.

I know many people think there is something like a fixed pie. But that's just not true. Can we avoid fixed pie arguments in the debate (or is there a true fixed pie argument I'm not aware of)?

\- ""Isn't it engrossing that some people dine from golden plates while others are dying on the street?"" 

Yes, that picture seems aesthetically engrossing. But the problem seems to me the poverty of the person on the street, not the dining from golden plates (see above).",0.0

747,t3_r4v63o,CMV: The belief that suffering “builds character” or is somehow needed to experience happiness is the single most toxic and dangerous idea ever conceived,"Edit: My view has changed quite significantly, I no longer view minor pains as ethical emergencies, only severe pains. I also accept the view that low levels of eustress (such as exercise) can be beneficial. I would still opt for a life without pain if I could be guaranteed that this would not lead to injury. This post was in part made due to my own *horrifically* low pain tolerance and emotional trauma, which has hugely influenced my personal value system. 


This view has and continues to be used to justify bullying, hazing and other atrocities while holding back medicine with regards to pain management and encouraging shame and guilt among the sensitive and “weak.” The idea has its modern roots in Nietzsche with the phrase “what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger” which is ironic considering Nietzsche’s short and miserable life. Yet try saying that to the millions in chronic pain or whom suffer from PTSD after a particularly “character building” event. 

I take the view that we ought to eliminate pain as much as is humanly possible and that ANY amount of unchosen, unwanted suffering is a moral emergency that must be addressed. This even includes controversial actions like trying to reduce wild animal suffering since I consider the state of nature to be utterly horrific.

748,t3_r4t3e8,CMV: Transitional Kindergarten and Kindergarten (4-5) is too young to be sending homework home and grading it.,"T-K (transitional Kindergarten) students, and I would argue kindergarten as well, probably through most of early elementary, should not receive homework at all, especially graded homework. 


My son is 5 years old, as of yesterday, but he’s been enrolled in a transitional kindergarten program at the local elementary school as he was too young at the beginning of the school year to enroll in kindergarten. 

At the age of 4, and now 5, as presumably it won’t change, he gets daily homework, and weekend homework, and he got a rather large homework packet for the thanksgiving break as well. This all comes back graded. 

Now, none of this homework is hard, but this is all relative as well, and he doesn’t understand the concept of grading either, but all the parents do. The homework consists of about 90 minutes worth of work for a 4-5 year old (assuming they can concentrate straight through, this is highly unlikely in my experience).

Until a few weeks ago his school didn’t have a TK teacher and he was just put into a kindergarten class along with all the other TK students. They’re still short a TK teacher, and this thanksgiving homework packet was labeled “kindergarten” and had activities that frankly we had to just, well, do for him because they were way beyond him. 


**Edit: I just got done dropping off my son at school (8:15AM EST) and his teacher said that the thanksgiving packet that was sent home was a mistake made by a substitute teacher and none of the children should have been expected to complete it. It was far too advanced for TK level, he actually did most of it fairly well.**


So perhaps this is just laziness and not the norm. After all I don’t have a plethora of kids in different schools. The packet took about 2 hours per day over 1 week. It would have taken longer if I hadn’t given up trying to teach him things that were way over his head that he hasn’t even begun learning in class.


Anyway, I think this is ridiculous for this age group. CMV.",2227.0
749,t3_r4ouc3,CMV: It is by no means obvious that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe,"For the purpose of this post I will be defining intelligent life as an organism with comparable or superior mental capabilities to our own.

I feel like it's a fairly commonly held belief especially among relatively young people that not only is there probably some intelligent life out there, but that there is certainly tons of it. While I think it is certainly possible and even likely given the vastness of the universe, the idea that it is clear that numerous super advanced extraterrestrial civilizations exist is unconvincing to me. My view primarly hinges on dissecting the Drake Equation, which I feel is one of the main arguments coming from people with this belief:

For those that don't know, the Drake equation is a model designed to predict the number of civilizations with which humans could communicate (i.e the number of alien worlds with technology similar or more advanced than ours in our galaxy alone). The equation asserts that this number is the product of mean rate of star formation, fraction of stars w/ planets, mean # of planets that could support life per star w/ planets, fraction of habitable planets that have life, fraction of planets w/ life that develop intelligent life, fraction of planets w/ intelligent life that develop communication, and mean length of time that civilizations can communicate. I actually am mostly ok with the model itself. I think that if the correct values were used, this model might be able to predict the proper number of advanced civilizations within a couple orders of magnitude. However, the values traditionally used for these parameters render a completely psuedo-scientific result. The following values are those which were orginally estimated by Drake himself.

**Mean rate of star formation**\- Set by Drake as 1 per year, I'm no astronomer but this is something we apparently have sufficient evidence for and is regarded as a conservative estimate. This value is totally fine by me.

**Fraction of stars with planets**\- Estimated to be between 0.2 and 0.5. Also something we have evidence for, fine by me. I actually thought this number was considered to be even higher.

**Planets that could support life per star with planets**\- Estimated to be between 1 and 5. This is completely baseless. Given that we have never been able to successfully recreate abiogenesis, and we only really have evidence that it has ever taken place once on Earth, I do not see a compelling reason to believe that the true value is greater than something like 10\^-9. There is really nothing to suggest that life is nearly as common as this estimate asserts.

**Fraction of these planets that will develop life**\- Estimated as 100%. I guess the idea is that over billions of years, anything that could happen will almost certainly happen. However, this doesn't take into account the fact that the ability to support life and the ability to start life are entirely different. For example, a major hypothesis about abiogenesis is that it arose from lightning. It is entirely possible if not likely that a given planet with the elemental building blocks of life and proper temperature range would not have the required forces to precipitate abiogenesis.

**Fraction of planets with life that will develop intelligent life**\- This is the one I have the biggest problem with, as it is also set as 100%. This presupposes that there is something inevitable about intelligent life, something intrinsic to the process of natural selection that moves species towards intelligence over many generations. However there is really no evidence for this and it even goes against modern ideas of how evolution works. One of the last lines of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" asserts that ""all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection"". But we know now that this is not the case. Organisms adapt to the conditions of their surroundings, and more often than not intelligence is not an adaptive trait as it is costly in terms of energy and does not benefit a species that cannot utilize it. Primates, given the structure of their body, were in a unique position to benefit from intelligence as they were capable of physically manipulating their environment. It even appears to be the case that multicellular life arising from single cell life is quite rare, as we only have observed it successfully occuring once on our planet. So many specific selective pressures had to be enforced to give the Homo genus their paramount intelligence that this number is likely far closer to 0% than it is to 100%.

**Fraction of planets with intelligent life that will develop sufficient communication systems**\- At 10 to 20%, this estimate is less egregious than the others but I would still argue it is too high. Again, there is nothing inherent or inevitable about the factors that lead to advanced technology. There is no reason to believe that intelligent beings necessarily organize themselves in such a way that such technological advancement is possible or desirable. Hunter-gatherer cultures for example do not tend towards industrialization or even the type of labor specialization required to create advanced technology. Additionally, even if a planet has intelligent life, why does this mean it must also have the requisite resources for communication systems. Such technology requires enormous amounts of energy. The industrialization that took place on our own planet was only possible due to the Carboniferous as well as the presence of large quantities of heavy metals such as iron.

**Years that such civilizations will be able to communicate**\- Estimated to be between 1000 and 100,000,000 years. The lower bound is plausible enough though the upper bound feels ludicrously high. There is no evidence of how long such a civilization will last. However, I don't have a well backed argument for a much lower value so I will accept 

Given these numbers, we find that Drake predicted between 20 and 50,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way with which humans could communicate. People use this result as evidence or advanced extraterrestrial life but as I believe I have demonstrated, the values used render this estimate far too high. If we use my values rather than Drake's, we would estimate less than once advanced civilization in the Milky Way, thus indicating that it is by no means obvious that intelligent life is widely or even somewhat present outside of Earth.

I want my view changed as there appear to be plenty of intelligent, well credentialed people who believe that many, many advanced civilizations exist. I have never really encountered someone who agrees with me on this so I feel that I must be missing something.",86.0
750,t3_r4n4zz,CMV: The US H1B immigration system should change from a lottery to a points based system,"As background, H1B is the most common type of employment visa needed by foreign nationals to work and reside in the US. The typical route for an immigrant on this visa type is to come to the US for education on an F1 visa, get a job on their OPT status under the F1 visa and get their company to sponsor them for an H1B application. The application is then sent to a lottery where you are awarded a visa if you are picked.

Other countries like the UK have a points based system where an applicant is reviewed based on the amount of points they have. For example, if they obtained a degree from the UK, this will give them a certain number of points. If they are applying for a job in a shortage occupation category e.g. a nurse, they are awarded more points. An applicant must reach a pre-specified number of points in order to be awarded a visa.

The US could attract more younger talent but taking away uncertainty and switching to a points based system which aligns immigration more closely with the country's needs and provides better economic benefits. In the point based system, the country can still choose to use certain aspects from the current policy, for example, pre-determined minimum salary levels based on occupation type and also incorporate tests such as the Labor Market Test which sponsoring employers must do to show that there isn't an equally or better qualified American to take the offered job.

The current lottery system is also a big cost to employers who have to move employees to overseas locations when their H1B visa is not picked in the lottery or find replacements through more recruiting. Due to this issue, several employers do not offer positions to international students making the US a less attractive higher education destination compared to other countries.

**Why do I feel this way?** As a current international student, there is a lot of uncertainty with the lottery system. One can go to the best schools and get the best job, yet still be kicked out of the country just due to bad luck. This is a big consideration when deciding to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on my education. It is a shame because the US has some of the best higher education institutions in the world but they may not be able to attract the best talent due to students not wanting uncertainty in their futures and getting a better ""deal"" in other countries such as Canada. Not knowing whether you will be allowed to stay in the country greatly impacts the everyday life. I am not going to want to buy a house or a car or make any significant investment until I am certain I will be able to stay here. Additionally, students who study STEM degrees are given a three year OPT allowing them to enter the H1B lottery three times. However, relatively speaking, this discourages a lot of non-STEM majors from considering the US as an appropriate higher education destination. This is the reason why there are so many international students in the finance and computer science jobs and not as many in the fine arts and literature jobs.

I would love to hear views in favor of the lottery system as I struggle to understand why it has been designed this way.",45.0
751,t3_r4kx1t,CMV: It was a bad idea to kill off Maude Flanders,"I'm curious if any Simpsons fans can make me believe that killing Maude wasn't a bad thing in the long-run.

In 1999, The Simpsons decided to kill off the Flanders family matriarch, Maude. This was predominantly because of a pay issue with her VA. Her voice actress quit, so they killed her off.

The problem with this idea is that Maude wasn't her only voice. She voiced other characters like Luan and Helen. None of these characters were killed off. *Just* Maude Flanders.

Why Maude? Why not Helen or Luan?

I don't see why they couldn't just turn Maude into a silent background character, with a seldom used new VA if needed. Helen had a new VA for a few episodes before her original one came back. It's not like Maude was a talkative character in the first place.

I was reading a book on Simpsons and several of the writers seemed to have disliked that Maude was prematurely killed. Paraphrasing, one writer said they killed the good wife of a good man and let their good kids motherless for no real reason.

Ned being a single father hasn't really done much for him or his character. They briefly hooked him up with Edna out of left-wing, but i know that bugged many because Edna was *Seymour*'s love interest.

Maude still appears in flashbacks and gags, but a lot of them just poke fun at her from beyond the grave.

If they were to kill a Flanders, I think it would have been best to kill Ned. When Maude died, Ned shut down and then doubled down on his religious beliefs. He never blamed Homer or showed anger. Maude, however, is not like her husband. Despite her sweet facade, she's oftentimes spiteful and quick tempered. I could easily see her scorning the Simpsons and this causing a huge shift. I'm pretty sure she doesn't even have a job, so having to step-up would have created an interesting arc.

Maude, however, wasn't killed for plot reasons. She was killed just because her VA changed. In honesty, I think she was killed just to throw stones at her VA. Her death was so anticlimactic and crude, and her funeral was spent bad-talking her. It feels like the series was poking fun at Maude because her voice actress left on bad terms.",22.0
752,t3_r4jnv0,CMV: Hot temperatures are better than cold temperatures,"We’re warm-blooded creatures and therefore I’d think we should naturally prefer hot temperatures to cold ones, but I know some people prefer cold temperatures. I’m open to considering the reasons that cold temps are better than hot ones. Curious to see what you all think!

Here are the reasons why I think hot temps are better, ordered from more trivial to more serious (of course, the below makes certain assumptions and oversimplifies the topic, but I think it’s a good starting point):

1. **Layers:** Layers are a huge hassle. You have to factor in extra time to get anywhere you need to go just for putting on and taking off layers, and accessories like hats and gloves easily get lost. And then you just feel like a huge poof ball walking around in the cold. Also clothing gets more staticky in the winter and you’re constantly getting shocked.
2. **Sweating vs. shivering:** As uncomfortable as sweating is, it’s nothing in comparison to having your teeth chatter and body convulse uncontrollably.
3. **Brain freeze vs. burning your mouth:** The worst that can happen when consuming very cold food/beverages when you want to cool down is temporary brain freeze that only lasts a few seconds. The worst that can happen when eating scalding hot food/beverages is burning your tongue and mouth, which can last days and makes consuming anything else uncomfortable or painful.
4. **Outdoor activities:** So many fun outdoor activities logistically can’t happen in cold temperatures, or technically could but are much less comfortable and enjoyable. This includes music festivals, sports, picnics in the park, amusement parks, dining – anything that involves humans being outdoors doing something. The range of outdoor activities that one can comfortably partake in is much larger for hot temperatures than cold ones.
5. **Travel:** Travel is much harder when you have to lug around clothes for cold temperatures, which tend to weigh more and take up more space than ones you use for hot temperatures. Not to mention that having to check your bag to fit all your warm clothing (comparing, let’s say, a 4-day beach trip to a 4-day snow-related trip) can add additional costs/time to your trip and opens up the possibility of your luggage getting lost.
6. **Costs:** Winter clothing is bigger/bulkier and therefore more expensive than thin lightweight clothing, and heating homes costs more than cooling them.
7. **Danger/Fatalities:** There are stats that indicate that cold weather is deadlier than hot weather. Also, if you’re driving, cold temperatures are more dangerous because they form ice, whereas hot temperatures don’t do much to the roads unless they’re very extreme.",0.0

754,t3_r4cfp0,CMV: Google Earth Engine would be much easier to use/learn with an API in a statically-typed language,"I've recently started using a lot of GEE for work, and myself and my colleagues all agree that it's a huge pain to learn.  It seems to me like almost all unexpected errors are related to variable types, but the JavaScript API can't provide enough information to easily debug it; for example, it took some digging to find out that `List.get` (edit: GEE's data types, not regular JS ones) has to be cast to the appropriate type.

And this gigantic pain point... wouldn't exist at all if the compiler could just tell me what the problem is.  ""The thing is null"" tells me only that `.get()` returned null for some reason (and that only because it gives me a line number).  A statically-typed language would tell me right away (and without needing to wait until run-time) that ""the thing doesn't have a `.get()` method because it's not a list`.  I'm fairly sure a statically-typed language would eliminate 95% of the errors I'm running into, and 100% of the hard-to-track-down ones so far.

Since the GEE API itself is strongly/statically-typed, it doesn't make sense to me that they wouldn't provide an implementation in a language that can directly support that--particularly since they already provide two implementations, so it's not like they're worried about only supporting one.  Explaining why it makes sense for them not to provide such an implementation is the major CMV opportunity here.",1.0
755,t3_r4bslt,CMV: Our outcomes and accomplishments are influenced more by luck than we think," Hey friends,

One thing I have been thinking about is the role of luck (or chance, randomness, or whatever you want to call it) in my life. I have been both burned and blessed by things outside of my control. 

My interest in luck stems from the fact that at the age of 30, I am interested in becoming wealthy and successful. And I know I am not alone. Think about the popularity of magazines such as *Forbes*, *Entrepreneur, Success,* and *Inc.*. Think about all the writers, podcasters, and bloggers that explore the habits of elite billionaires.

**The perceived utility of these materials is rooted in the underlying assumption** **that these people’s accomplishments are caused by their personal characteristics**. We attribute success, wealth, and social status to talent, skill, hard work, persistence, mental toughness, resilience, any other trending trait. Society aims to find causality between personality traits and accomplishments so that we can model the behaviors of the successful to achieve the same outcomes. 

But is life that simple and deterministic? What about the role of luck?

I have explored this in the paragraphs below and would love your feedback and thoughts. It would be great to continue to push my thinking.

## Life Is More Random Than We Think

The core idea I’m getting at can be reduced to this: **outcomes of many things in life are influenced more by randomness than we think.** Put another way, we often confuse luck with skill, randomness with determinism, and coincidence with causality. 

The level of randomness we are exposed to depends on the complexity and variables that influence the outcome we want. The more complex and multivariate a process is, the greater the impact of randomness on the outcome. 

#### Reliving Your Life

Philosopher, author and investor, Nassim Taleb offers a great example to crystalize this point. Let’s compare the role of randomness in the lives of two people: John Doe A and John Doe B. 

John Doe A is a dentist. He has achieved a modest level of success, wealth, and social status by drilling teeth. At the age of 50, after years of work, he is worth $5 million. Now, if John Doe A were to relive his life as a dentist 1,000 times, the range of possible outcomes would be narrow. The best case would be that he becomes a celebrity dentist in Los Angeles, charging more per procedure. The worst case would be that he ends up drilling teeth in small-town Ohio. As a dentist, John Doe A has more control over his outcome than other professions, leading to a narrower range of possibilities. 

Let’s now examine John Doe B, a janitor who has a habit of playing the lottery. With his most recent ticket purchase, he won $5 million, quit his job, and moved next door to John Doe A. But what would happen if John Doe B had to relive his life a 1,000 times? The odds are that he would continue to provide janitorial services and waste money on fruitless lottery tickets. 

#### Dentist &gt; Founder?

This is an extreme example, but it is being used to prove a point. **From a probabilistic viewpoint** **a typical dentist is wealthier than a famous A-list actor, a hedge-fund manager, or a billionaire tech entrepreneur**. Why? Because success in those paths is highly influenced by randomness. 

Let’s look at an entrepreneur like Mark Zuckerberg for example. A start-up has a high probability of failure and a high degree of complexity – its survival is influenced by numerous variables, many of which are outside the entrepreneur’s control. Yet, some succeed and surpass the founders’ wildest expectations. They achieve an unfathomable level of success, wealth, and status. Now, if Zuckerberg had to relive his life 1,000 times, in how many scenarios would he (1) invent Facebook and (2) make it the company we know today? The range of possibilities is massive, and the odds are that he would end up with a vastly different outcome.

#### Blessed by Luck

I’m fortunate enough to have been blessed by luck numerous times throughout my life. One moment that comes to mind is when I was in law school going through the law firm recruitment process.

Having a successful outcome during law firm recruitment is a function of two things: (1) grades, which determine whether you will be granted interviews at firms, and (2) likability, which determines whether lawyers will want to hire you, train you, and spend time with you.

While you have a large degree of control over your grades and likability, part of the outcome is out of your hands. For instance, you can’t control whether the lawyer you will be meeting with had to pull an all-nighter and will be exhausted for your interview. 

My experience during law firm recruitment was positive. But how much credit can I take for the outcome? Sure, I worked hard and prepared, but I also had some major things in common with my interviewers that were based purely on luck. How much did this contribute to my likability? It is hard to say exactly, but I am positive that it played a significant role. 

I also saw classmates who had grades as good as mine, and who were more likable, end up empty-handed. If they had to relive the recruitment process a 1,000 times, would their outcomes be any different? I am confident they would.

Let me emphasize this: **skill, effort, intellect, and other positive personality traits** **matter**. But the key is to understand that they are necessary, not sufficient. They do not guarantee success, especially in fields that are more predisposed to randomness, such as entrepreneurship or investing. 

Taleb thinks of success as a range of possible outcomes: “Mild success can be explainable by skill and labor. Wild success is attributable to variance.”

## Living with Randomness

Why do we discount the role of chance in our lives?

It is because of how we view the past. We all suffer from survivorship bias – only remembering and accounting for the winners and not the losers – and we draw causal conclusions based on this. 

For example, Bill Gates is a winner. So we study his life, determine that he has qualities X, Y, and Z and conclude that these qualities caused him to be a winner. But what about all the other entrepreneurs who had the exact same qualities and started businesses that failed? We don’t know their stories nor their names, so we ignore them. They are not part of the dataset we used to conclude that qualities X, Y, and Z cause success. 

The insight here is that we need to avoid jumping to conclusions regarding what causes wild success. 

What does this all mean for me on my quest for success, wealth, and status? 

The key realization I have had is to focus on the process rather than the outcome. And while I am aware of how trite that insight is, after understanding the role of luck in life, it resonates with me.

By focusing on what is within my control (hard work, talent, skills acquisition, etc.), I can narrow the range of possible outcomes and skew them toward positive expected values. But I can’t guarantee anything. 

So, I won’t beat myself up if I don’t become a billionaire, as that is outside of my control. But if in 10 years, I happen to be on a private jet sipping champagne, I will be sure to toast Lady Luck.

If obese people had an option to get an injection and lose weight in 30 minutes, they would. Anti-vaxers are lucky enough to have this option to decrease the chances they end up in the ICU and they still don't take it. That is selfish.
2. Obesity is rooted in years to decades of poor eating habits, often times learned in childhood from parents. It can be a bad cycle. It has a psychological basis that can take years of purposeful effort to change. For anti-vaxers, most of them have received their childhood vaccines, so it's not a problem with vaccines in general..usually. 
3. Most people with obesity at the very minimum feel bad or shame with being obese, and many are trying to change. They may not be very successful most of the time, but at least there is some degree of effort. With the exception of a small minority, people who are obese know that it is not great to be obese. For anti-vaxers, they are more strongly rooted in their views, there is no effort to change and they believe that there is no drawback to being unvaccinated, even if they have significant comorbidities.
4. Obesity isn't contagious (I don't find this to be a very good argument, because obesity does increase the risk of other diseases which can land you in the hospital)

also i’ve used the argument “animals don’t have the same way of thinking as humans do, so it’s obviously going to be different” but i think that could qualify for a lot of human to human relations as well.
[edit] hi! people have let me know that i used the wrong terminology, i didn’t know that zoophilia is entirely sexual. so what i mean i guess is zoosexuality is okay if it isn’t sexual? im not entirely educated of the definitions of different terms i apologize

759,t3_r48b16,CMV: Cold countries will benefit from global warming,"Global warming is described as a global issue but something that isn't talked about much is a few countries would benefit from it. This list includes Russia, Canada, ~~Scandinavian countries, Greenland, plus other Northern European states and maybe Argentina.~~ Additionally, global warming is expected to cause slowing down of the  Gulf Stream which would lead to colder climate in Europe counteracting the increase in average global temperatures.

These countries have no reason to worry about global warming. On the opposite, it will make currently uninhabited land livable and increase overall comfort of living.

If acting solely out of self-interest, there is no reason for these countries to support measures trying to slow down global warming such as Paris Accord or accelerated switch to renewable energy. Risk of mass migration is better addressed by protecting state borders than by foregoing a chance to make the country more livable.

What's wrong with my thinking here? What negative effects of global warming on cold countries am I overlooking?

When I read this, I layer my own experience on it. Which is that sports programming is often ""everybody"" and ""women only"". Anyone could take EasySurf, which sounds like an intro program. Only women can take Surf Girls.

​

&gt;To me, it's not just about being seen in a swimsuit. It's about not being made to feel 'less than' for their abilities. Women often feel more supported in single sex environments. When I did ropes course trainings, women were so often put aside by male members of the group and not given a chance to succeed, women are taught to not cause trouble and it's conditioned from a young age. They don't speak up when this happens. In a surf course, an example might be men always volunteering to be the example, or women being worried to ask a question that makes them look stupid.

​

&gt;And, when I worked at the yarn store, we had men's only knitting classes, but women took ones that could be mixed gender (but were typically just women, because men did not want to be in a mixed environment when they were learning.) Our ""knitting clubs"" though were all mixed gender.

For most trans women, I believe that they were raised in an environment where people assumed that they were little boys.  They learned little boy things instead of little girl things which translates into not knowing basic woman things like emotional labor.  I just think that if women have the right to say ""no men"" it should also extend to ""no people who weren't raised as little girls.""

761,t3_r454ng,CMV: we should stop using the term “Latinx”,"I admit it will be very difficult to change my view as I feel very strongly on this but I am open to reconsidering my view.

1. The term is completely unpronounceable in Spanish the way that people intend for it to be pronounced. If the people for whom the word is intended cannot even pronounce it, then it is not an effective solution.

2. “Latino” is gender neutral in Spanish already but if that is unacceptable because of its masculine inclination for some people then there are other alternatives that are easier to pronounce such as “Latine” and “Latin.” In Spanish, it is understood that “Latino” is gender neutral and it does not have the sexist connotation that English-speakers assume it does. 

3. The term is largely pushed by progressive white Americans against the will of the Latino community in the US. Only 3% of Latinos in the US identify with the term according to the Pew Research Center, the vast majority have not even heard of it, and amongst those who have their view of it is overwhelmingly negative. They see it as a white Western attempt to disrespect the rules of the Spanish language for politicized means, which is linguistic imperialism. 

4. Given the number of people who actually use the term being so small, it should not be used as the default for all Latinos unlike what corporations and politicians in the US are doing. If you know someone identifies as a woman or a man just call them Latino or Latina. 

5. We often say people are the authors of their own experience and this is a central tenet of progressivism especially for the marginalized. So why are people NOT listening to the majority of Latinos who do not want to be called Latinx? It screams “we know what is better for you than you know for yourself so sit back and shut up.”",4939.0
762,t3_r40wos,"CMV: Mask Mandates are necessary as people are kindof stupid, and there is no good argument against them","For context, I live in Scotland, which does have mask mandates from the government, and recently traveled to England, which does not (I think they might have starting yesterday because of the decepticon varient or whatever, but they didn't when I travelled a month or so ago). In Scotland, 95% of people on public transport and in shops wear masks. In England, about 2% seem to. The point of bringing this up, is to make the point that if we want people to wear masks, we do basically need to tell them they have to, as most people are too stupid to do it without the government telling them to. 

As for the mask mandates themselves, I have never heard a good argument against them. I often hear people say things like ""oh so should we have mask mandates for the flu then"", I don't see how this is a counter. I would be happy to wear a mask for a few months in winter when the flu is most prominent, and if there is a particularly bad flu strain, then telling people to wear masks seems justifiable even if only to reduce money spent in healthcare, not to mention that hospitals often get overwhelmed in winter.

Other arguments I hear are ""muh government telling us to do things bad"", to which the obvious response is seatbelts and not being allows to drunk drive, both of which are things that have small chances to negatively affect other people or you, which you can't do. 

There are medical exceptions, which I do think should be allowed, although maybe with a slightly higher burden of proof than we have now. And I've heard good argument for why kids shouldn't wear them, although those argument are stuff like ""they need to be able to see each others faces to develop emotional intelligence"", not ""it's child abuse"" or some stupid shit like that. I think teenagers should have to wear them too though, this would only apply to young kids.",1196.0

764,t3_r3qbob,"CMV: There is no problem with ""political correctness""","Hey guys! For my whole life I've heard online about how ""political correctness"" is ""ruining"" America. I believe that this is both false and that the influence of political correctness is vastly overstated anyway.

For this post I will be defining political correctness (PC) as

&gt;A set of common norms around the appropriate usage/sharing of words &amp; ideas, especially in a political context

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with PC being bad/against free speech. I don't agree with that argument because free speech is not ""say whatever you want with no consequences,"" it's ""the gov't can't jail/punish you for speech in most circumstances."" I mean the whole point of free speech is so the ""marketplace of ideas"" can thrive and (hopefully) the best ideas are adopted, PC is the ""market"" saying that their idea is sh\*t and should be taken off, there's no problem with that imo as long as the gov't doesn't get involved in that process, not every idea is a winner.

You may counter saying only ""twitter mobs"" support the removal of these ideas from the marketplace and 99% are okay with them. I disagree, if these ""twitter mobs"" are so big and influential so as to cause so much PR damage to a company they fire highly trained professionals over it, it's big enough to represent the marketplace of ideas. And for every 1 person who voices an opinion, I bet their are 5 people who share that opinion but don't voice it.

I also believe it's impact is VASTLY overstated, my main evidence is the sheer number of people that have been ""cancelled"" and came back bigger, Ben Sharpio, David Chappelle, Tucker Carlson.

765,t3_r3oxv0,cmv: Drugs(hardcore) should be made legal for a dying man.,"Making drugs legal for the public has many implications. For starters it severely impacts the workforce of a nation which is very detrimental to a capitalist/communist nation alike. But the way a man /woman can experience something out of the material world is through love/drugs/death so you can say that the above 3 reduces the mundanity of daily life. 
Alas the above argument is not practical. 

But the point I want to make is that humans are inherantly curious and drugs are akin to the forbidden fruit. So every human has the urge to experience drugs atleast once in their lives.. It's also a valid point in the light of equality aswell.. As we all know rich people do drugs but poor people either can't afford or don't have access to drugs . 

So my proposition is that all the dying people/or those past a certain age be allowed to do drugs. This can reduce the forbidden fruit appeal of drugs which can inturn  reduce drug abuse in general. 

Another thing is that those past a certain age 75+ is dependent population , by giving them drugs we can make them rest in peace(of course it's not mandatory to do drugs) This increases the work force and decreases the dependent population thereby ushering in a golden era.",11.0
766,t3_r3njg9,CMV: The Concept Of Straight Passing exists,"Straight Passing from what I understand usually refers when someone perceived as straight. This usually applies when a man and women get together and they are seen as straight even though one of them or both are bi/pan/poly/omni/etc. Therefore queer people in ""straight relationships"" are afforded priveleges of being straight. (Let's throw in an assumption that both parties are either cisgendered or pass as their gender.) 

The title says ""concept of"" because one criticism of the term ""straight-passing"" because they believe that using a term that relates to race as in white passing and applying it to LGBTQ discourse is wrong. I personally don't see it as a problem but I'm not here argue about it that. 

Anwyays, I have seen people denounce this saying it doesn't exist and it's a Biphobic term. WHILE I understand that straight passing CAN be used in bad faith and discredit queer people for being with dating someone of the opposite gender. There is a time place for this discussion and it has some biphobic implications to bring this up when (for example) a bi girl simply talks about her boyfriend. In that context, its weaponized to other (verb) those types of bi people as not belonging in the LGBTQ community. 

However I don't think it's fair to then say that some of straight privileges that they are afforded just doesn't exist. 

I believe It's a straw man to claim that straight passing means the queer people in a straight couple gain all privileges of straight couples and they don't suffer from oppression of any kind. It's just means that in a hetero normative society, people seen a hetero, arent granted the exact same obstacles of those who aren't. They can still face similar issues with others in their community. It's not wrong to tell people to acknowledge their privilege right? How can Straight Privilege be a thing but Straight Passing Privilege not be a thing. 

Now what are some Straight Passinf privileges that come to mind?

Being Open with your relationship without fear of Harassment in public. (Though this can depend on whether the you are displaying your self as bi.)

Not having to come out of the closet when you bring your partner to your friends or family.

Find someone you are attracted to easily

767,t3_r3myrg,CMV: It's totally normal to want to be with someone romantically and not want to be their friend.,"It's funny these posts I see like. ""I told a guy I wouldn't date him and now he won't talk to me??"" 

It's such a strange perspective. I have friends because we share specific hobbies or have known each other since we were kids. Romantic relationships are a different thing. I've had women say they just want to be friends and I just politely said ""that's ok I'm just looking for a romantic partner right now.""

I think it's weird that people feel that friendship is the foundation and you build romance on top of that. Of course I'm friends with my wife, but if we weren't together then I probably wouldn't be. 

Consider this: if you have a young child, would you spend time with them if they weren't your child? I'm not saying you wouldn't enjoy spending time with kids if they aren't yours, but would you specifically set up time to hang out them? 

Do you have friends the same age as your parents? Or do you only have that relationship with them *because* they are your parents? 

It's not an insult to not be friends with someone. I'm not friends with a lot of people I would probably enjoy spending time with. The reality is I just have a few spaces in my life for important people. I wouldn't go around treating kids like my own child just like I wouldn't go around talking about my feelings with women who aren't my wife. 

I'm not saying men and women can't be friends. That's not the claim. I'm saying friends and other catagories aren't the same. I don't look for the same thing from friends that I do from a parent or a spouse.

Now obviously, there's nothing wrong with seeing someone as just a friend. But you can't decide they have to see you the same way and not leave when they find out you don't like them. 

If I'm interested in someone sexually and they aren't into me. I don't want to see them anymore. I'm not angry about it, but if someone specifically tells me I'm not what they want, why would I want to spend time with them? If we were already friends for a while sure, but if it's always been a romantic potential for me then no romance = I'm out. 

We only have so much time for each person in our lives. As well as work and self care, meditation, hobbies, etc. If you don't want to be in the one catagory I'm hiring for, then there's no open positions at this time. And honestly it should go vice versa. Why you would want to be friends with someone who wants to date you is beyond me.",124.0

Showers evenly distribute water over your body while efficiently mixing with soap to break apart oils, dirt, and sweat that are stuck to your skin. Plus in a bath you're kind of left to sit in the water that's now mixed with all the grime that comes off your body, as opposed to the dirty water being sucked down the drain when you're in the shower.

769,t3_r3m38c,CMV: Ancient Macedonia was Greek,"**Macedonia** \- refers to the ancient Greek state of Macedonia

*Macedonia* \- refers to the Slavic modern-day Republic of North Macedonia

*Macedonians*, a Slavic ethnic group, claim to be the descendants of the ancient Greek state of **Macedonia**.

770,t3_r3l7ub,CMV: Giving up constant electricity to combat climate change is NOT an acceptable solution,"I was surprised to find how prevalent this argument is. Recently, I found this argument in-depth in an article: [""To Save the Climate, Give Up the Demand for Constant Electricity""](https://bostonreview.net/articles/david-mcdermott-hughes-battery-trap/). This article, written by a professor of anthropology, makes some points but ultimately I find this position flawed and far too unreasonable.

The argument overall makes—in my opinion—four main points:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""The demand for electrical continuity—may be the real problem. ""
   * It is being argued that the constant flow of electricity and our dependency on consistency is not critical, as it was before constant electricity. Likening ""electricity \[becoming\] the new oxygen.""
* Batteries should not interrupt the progress of renewables.
   * Claims that storage and is implementation time and cost should be ignored because: ""That lost interval—years, in each of the transition scenarios—matters profoundly""
*  ""Planned interruptions"" are in place and are useful in parts of the world
   * This particular article demonstrates that Rural Zimbwawe and hurricane-stricken Puerto Rico have systems similar to what the outcomes elsewhere would be.
*  Lack of electricity can be mitigated, essentially, on a case-by-case basis.
   * What power storage infrastructure there already is can be used only where it is critically needed.

The argument claims that electrical continuity is unnecessary; I disagree, the article chalks this down to ""Self-sacrifice is not popular."" This world where electricity would be provided only during the random hours of the day when renewables are producing power is not self-sacrifice but dangerous and unnecessary; disregard for the infrastructure that society is based on and how that use is critical is not well articulated. The argument acknowledges the ways business and economy use energy and the trend of the household integration of this utility. However, the cited article and others with this view seem to imply that this would not be strictly nessacary especially when seemly not to refute the “Business continuity” that they bring up. Exclaiming: ""We don’t need Nest or permanent telecommuting. For a while, let’s eat a cold dinner here and there. Continuity costs too much."" Without backing it up is quite odd. 

The argument attempts to demonstrate this being feasible with demonstrations of Zimbabwe and Puerto Rico; how they use intermittent power provided by renewables. The author provides speculation through an anecdote. ""A top-loading fridge works even better. I met a transplanted Minnesotan operating one of these devices in the mountains. At the bottom of the fridge he set the thermostat for 32.5°; the top never heated up beyond 40°."" From what I read there was a complete lack of reasoning about how in hot climates, with their extreme circumstances, refrigeration failure would not happen. Just because a ""fridge needs to run continuously"" is false is not a reason to pull the plug from the consistently of renewables.  

Finally, in an attempt to mitigate the categorically consistent power needs of hospitals, while ignoring the needs of seemingly every other person and organization. Seemingly on a whim, a proposal of a ""...battery-assisted, semi-smart micro-grids connecting such infrastructure as well as home medical devices."" There is no further explanation of how it would be set up, the costs, and its feasibility. Further, there is no mention of how productivity would fall or why the benefits of power might outweigh the costs. The platform further suggests no timetable as to when these seemingly third-world conditions may be lifted.

After initially reading the article I was surprised to find that a professor was the author and a part of the group making these arguments. Finding this to be a really bad idea I don't see how someone with the ability to earn a Ph.D. could contend this. Am I missing something? I really tried to be fair to what was said. Must I have possibly misrepresented the actual reason or what the argument is in general?  Does the professor not effectively represent the argument?    Please, CMV.",41.0
771,t3_r3j161,"CMV: Sicily is a transcontinental, not a European island.","Let me preface this by stating that I acknowledge Sicily is part of Italy and is therefore geopolitically European. They speak a European language, and in that regard there absolutely is a European component to the island and its history.

With that said, you cannot boil the complexity of Sicilian history and heritage to just “European” and to change my mind you need to persuade me that they should be considered solely European. and here is why:

1. It is geographically on the African continental plate which makes it geologically part of North Africa.

2. A significant part of Sicilian ancestry and genetic heritage comes from the Levant (Canaan/Holy Land), North Africa, and to a much smaller extent, the Arabian Peninsula. This is obvious from genetic studies and even to some extent physical appearance. They are more closely related to Palestinians, Tunisians, Lebanese and so on than to the Russians, Germans, British, Danes, Dutch, etc. 

3. What continent the island has been seen as belonging to depended on who ruled it. When under Arab rule it was considered part of the Maghreb region (NW Africa) along with Tunisia and Algeria. Therefore it’s European identity is contingent on politics as was its formerly North African one. 

4. Many food items common to the island are shared with either North Africa or the Levant. While much of the cuisine is continuous with continental Italy, some of it is not. 

5. Even 100 years ago it was common knowledge within Italy that Sicilian society was distinct and had non-European influences which were one source of discrimination they faced within their own country when traveling to the north.

772,t3_r3i29i,CMV: Jesus Was A Yogi,"I believe Jesus was a great spiritual master and yogi. Here’s why.

The traditional understanding of Christian theologians and churches is that Jesus was celibate. This lines up with the ancient yogic value of celibacy perfectly.

Jesus taught love, peace, compassion and pacifism. This linws up with the yogic value of ahimsa perfectly.

Jesus fasted and prsyed in the desert in solitude. This is also very typical of traditional yogis, although they are more likely to do it in woodland areas than deserts.

Jesus also spent many other times in isolation like in Mark 1:35 in the New International Version we read “Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.”. This is in line with the yogic scriptural recommendation to wake early for devotional practice.

In Matthew 22:37 of NIV, we read that the Greatest Commandment given by Jesus is to love The Lord with all your heart, soul and mind”. This lines up with the yogic concept of devotion, known as bhakti.

In 1 Corinthians 6:17 in the NIV, we read “But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.¨ In Sanskrit, yoga means union, in this context with spirit/Divinity. This is the purpose of yoga.

In Psalm 119:15 NIV and Psalm 104:34 NIV, it talks about meditation. ""I will meditate on your precepts and fix my eyes on your ways” and “May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the Lord.”. This is important because meditation, known as dhyana, is foundational to yoga.

This, to me, is proof Jesus was a great yogi and mystic. What do you think about this? Can you show me evidence that says he wasn't?",0.0
773,t3_r3hnhc,CMV: There Has Never Been A Political Party As Divided As The Republicans In A Democracy,"There is probably a historical precedent but i can't think of any so i will award an easy delta to anyone who can contrast my view on these 3 points:

There has never been a political party as divided as Republicans currently are that can so passionately hate each other but still unite under one flag.

First off a quick google for stats on ""how many republicans believe election stolen"" shows 1/2 to 2/3rds believe in that. Imagine trying to convince everyone else when you can't even convince your own party including top leaders like the VP and Senate Majority Leader.

Secondly death threats:

[“I know for a fact several members *want* to impeach but fear casting that vote could get them or their families murdered,” Alberta writes. “Numerous House Republicans have received death threats in the past week.”](https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22229052/capitol-hill-riot-intimidate-legislators)

[Meijer told NBC News on Thursday that the threats flooded in immediately, and that his GOP colleagues have requested armed escorts, a protection typically granted only to members of party leadership.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-who-voted-to-impeach-trump-are-getting-death-threats-like-he-wont-last-until-the-primary)

[Three-quarters of people charged for making threats against American politicians come from the Right, according to a 2018 analysis by the Prosecution Project.](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/jeff-van-drew-republican-death-threats-politicians-20191231.html)

There is lots of journalism of Repub on Repub violence and i'm sure everyone agrees abortion clinics have received more threats than anyone in modern times. How do they continue like this? Has any politics ever existed like this before in Democracy?

There wasn't blanket condemnation for the Capitol Rioters chanting their death threats as shown by this it is instead being celebrated:

[MTG dubbed the section of the Washington, D.C., jail holding dozens of individuals arrested in connection with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol the ""Patriot Wing"" after a visit this week](https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-calls-dc-jail-section-holding-jan-6-rioters-patriot-wing-1646323)



Thirdly how are they celebrating or at least advertising the schism? At one of MTG's rallies she said ""there is a civil war in our own party."" There is no teaching the controversy it's as tribalistic as possible.

So tribalistic it has never existed in any kind of democratic system? I'm not here to argue please show me any other political party that operates under these 3 conditions: a schism splitting half or more, death threats against their own being politicized and advertised and the schism itself drawing rallies and being popularized perhaps even becoming the main attraction? 

Any democratic comparisons at all that historically didn't lead to a violent coup?

Let's all take a step back, and a deep breath and consider what it would be like to be a refugee or immigrant to a strange country and you walk in to a political rally completely at odds with their selves and with its top leaders and hearing ""there is a civil war in our own party!"" and then they cheer that.

774,t3_r3hlrn,CMV: Focusing on process is better than the outcome,"In general, making sure the process of a given activity is carried out properly would lead to a better outcome instead of focusing on the result.

I know that many things in life are relative. In some areas, for instance business, there is no point in performing a top-notch process yet generating zero profit as it threatens the business continuation per se. Likewise, any sports team that strives for playing the most advanced techniques of their gameplay (process-focus) but end up losing the match would be considered ineffective. Some fans may enjoy the game played beautifully. However, the fact that they don’t win the tournament yields no return (prize, winner advantages for the following season, etc.) relative to the investment being made on the get-go (practice, time, etc). 

I will give you a more concrete epitome of this process vs outcome saga in education. The dichotomy between an appropriate learning process (understanding the material) and being a straight-A student (getting the highest grade possible) is debatable. In this instance, an appropriate learning process means a given student ought to embrace the mental model: to learn is to understand. In contrast, an outcome-oriented manner means memorizing potential exam questions for the sake of passing the exam. While it is true that understanding the lesson means being able to apply the same concept to other contexts, such as the questions presented in an exam, and hence scoring higher grades, this isn’t always the case. Numerous factors that can influence a grade, eg. nervousness, adequate rest, pure luck, and whatnot that equally impact both a fully prepared and a study-for-exam student, therefore focusing on the outcome (studying exam questions) might in fact be a more efficient approach. In my view though, it negates the point of learning in the first place. Ensuring the right process would save us one fewer element to worry about (uncertain outcomes).  
 

I don’t intend to bring the argument of “depending on the definition of better or getting done right” or “studying past exam questions is part of the learning process and proven to help students attain higher grades”.

775,t3_r3hkh9,CMV: Parents who have been convicted of child abuse should be forcibly sterilised.,"Firstly, my information is only based on UK statistics, so for now I would say this is only true for the UK, however I'm fairly sure that at least some parts of my argument can be extended to other countries as well.

Currently there are on average 80,000 children in the foster care system each year in the UK with the main reasons for this being abuse or neglect. 

[https://www.olivebranchfostering.co.uk/how-many-children-are-in-foster-care-in-the-uk/](https://www.olivebranchfostering.co.uk/how-many-children-are-in-foster-care-in-the-uk/)

There has also been a research study that shows that 1 in 4 mothers who have a child removed, will go on to have dealings with family services including having another child removed at some point in the future.

[https://www.johnsonastills.com/site/blog/ejablog/having-another-baby-if-you-have-had-previous-children-removed](https://www.johnsonastills.com/site/blog/ejablog/having-another-baby-if-you-have-had-previous-children-removed)

I believe that if you have been charged with abusing or neglecting your child, regardless of what gender you are, you should be sterilised.

Not only would this prevent more children being born into the same situation in the future, putting far less strain on the already overstrained foster system as well as all the other services that are then put under pressure as a result in the future, it would also prevent the pain and suffering that abused children go through not only in the family home but also when they are in the foster care system.

I also understand that there is a major consideration to the parents in this case. What if someone has a child removed from them because they were on drugs at the time but in later life get clean and are stable enough to have children?

Whilst that is a very difficult situation to think about, I personally believe that the potential suffering of future children outweighs the potential suffering of the future parent.

The fact that I also specify those that have been convicted of abuse or neglect also protects those parents that give up children for adoption for other reasons such as mental health, ill-health, domestic abuse, rape etc.

I do not believe that any parent who gives their child up for adoption deserves to be punished as in a lot of cases it is genuinelly the right thing for the child and the parent is fully on board and putting their child first. In these cases there wouldn't be charges of neglect or abuse and therefore, if in the future they are in a more stable situation they would still be able to go on to have children.

So, in summary, I believe parents who have been convicted of child abuse should be forcibly sterilised. Change my view.",0.0

777,t3_r3ggjh,CMV: Business transformations fail primarily due to causes related to human behavior,"""Transformation"" is one of the most popular buzzwords in the business world. With the accelerated pace of change and innovation, it's not much of a surprise. Almost every company out there engages, in some capacity, in a transformation initiative. However, statistics show that 70-80% of the transformation efforts fail. An often-spotted ""root cause"" is the ""human element"". Some of the commonly mentioned reasons are: 

\- Resistance to change. ""It's hard to teach an old dog new tricks"". Behaviors are hard to change; the inertia is powerful; status quo bias (and loss-aversion) may take over. Safety is a fundamental human need, so it's normal for people to fear change, especially when it's not clear what the future holds. Especially if the current state was delivering results, some people might argue ""don't change what's not broken"". 

\- Culture. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture), """"organizational culture"" \[is defined\] as comprising a number of features, including a shared ""pattern of basic assumptions"" which group members have acquired over time as they learn to successfully cope with internal and external organizationally relevant problems"". So, the culture is the unspoken that makes people act how they act in that environment. In a culture that ""rewards"" (or a mere sense of ""belonging"") a particular way of doing things, it makes sense for people to hold on to existing customs. 

\- Lack of buy-in. This goes back to the classical ""the why"" problem. The ""why"" and the vision for engaging in a transformation effort may be clear to the leadership; however, sometimes, it fails to percolate down/ across the organization. Without this buy-in, there is no motivation to engage in the pursuit to change. Not to mention that (with the risk of generalization) every change initiative requires time, energy, and effort, some ever-scarcer resources. 

Other reasons might include: leadership failure to act as role-model/doesn't walk the walk, corporate politics, cognitive biases, not having the appropriate organizational structure in place, faulty incentive plans, lack of follow-through, setting inadequate objectives (and expectations) over an inadequate time-horizon, poor delegation, psychological safety, etc. 

These are just a few common themes out there. The literature on the topic is quite broad. Of course, other types of reasons as mentioned as well, such as inadequate processes, technologies, etc. However, matters related to 'human behavior' (at various levels in the organization) seem to constitute the primary issue. I subscribe to this idea. However, I wonder if I'm driven by confirmation bias when researching related literature/ putting more weight on the mentioned ""root cause"". I am curious to hear from people who don't share this opinion and why so. Suggested further readings are welcome.",3.0
778,t3_r3edeo,"CMV: Dating is, when simplified, supply and demand, this is why I think ALL single men sympathizers are wrong because men aren't entitled to women's companionship","So there's this post on I saw that had a number of upvotes that I have never seen before. Holy damn. That truly shocked me, but it related to a recent post I have made. I don't' think I can post it though, without maybe breaking some brigading rule. But anyways...

I find women and men pretty whiny, so despite women's views on single men who can't have sex, there was this analogy I saw that seemed pretty reasonable.

Men make icing, women make cake. Lets suppose I acknowledge that both need each other, but one more than other. An icingless cake is ok, but an icing without a cake sucks. Now, lets suppose some men get zero cake offers, but men are making lots and lots of cake requests. They offer all their icing. (wealth) Now, lets suppose there are 3 types of icing, poisonous icing, mediocre icing, and tasty icing. Would you rather zero cake or have a cake with a poisoned icing? I'm not going to argue whether or not one is better than the other, because I think 'would you rather' can never be objective.

I want to, at the very least, understand why people think 'men have it worse in the dating world'.

Secondly, I want my views changed because, even those who think 'women have it worse' think my view of 'supply and demand' on relationships terrible.

Now comes the icing on the cake (pun intended) the icing makers reaaally need a cake. so I say, I need 6 pounds of icing but you say you lack the stock. What should we do? Icing makers are desperate to get cake, but cake makers are demanding a price they simply don't have. Why is it the cake makers fault? Lets say cake makers have a side hustle and thats why they can go without cake. But for whatever reason, icing makers claim they can't go without cake, but the reality is, they won't die without cake. So why is it cake makers fault if they refuse to sell or give any attention to icing makers?

To add to the analogy, icing makers aren't to picky, any cake market will do, too they request all cake makers to send them their cake. Cake makers however, are looking through the reputation of the icing maker, the ingredients the icing makers make. Etc. Icing makers are complaining about lack of choice when reality its lack of reciprocity. They chose to send in requests to everyone, and cake makers had the same choice. They simply chose to not respond

TLDR: as it relates to a previous post of mine, why are women bad for simply refusing to even care about men (ie giving them compliments or willing to date them) when men do not have the supply to meet the demands of women? And if they are bad, what's the solution?

My thoughts are men can simply give up the cake making business or learn to be happy having icing. (Icing is pretty tasty!) in other words, being alone is OK, and even if it isn't, they aren't entitled to cake because no one owes it to you

I think what can change my mind is if there is an agreeable solution presented to the lack of cake men receive, otherwise I think the whining men do is just stupid.

**Views to change from order of least to most importance:**

**\*\*a) men have it worse in dating.b) both men and women have equal amount of choice, just not reciprocity.c) I don't have to feel sorry for men being single, because in a monogamous population, men and women are 1-1**.\*\****d) even if we weren't monogamous, I don't have to feel sorry for men because liking someone shouldn't be forced and at the expense of another person and there is nothing we can do.***

779,t3_r3d82x,CMV: forcing people to identify by their race rather than their ethnicity in popular discourse increases collectivism based on race and INCREASES racism far more than it raises awareness of privilege.,"Racism is inherently a collectivist ideology: people from one group are taught to view themselves as inherently superior to another group based on their collective identity and the positive attributes they associate it with at the expense of another group whom they view as inferior. White supremacy is an example of this. 

It is currently progressive/Leftist tendency to say that we must think of ourselves not as Irish, Polish, Greek, Nigerian, Jamaican, Dominican Americans but as “white” and “Black” first, and essentially view ourselves as homogenous groups whose differences aren’t relevant because those differences have no bearing on the experience of privilege or oppression within the group. 

THIS IS VERY TOXIC especially for white people because the second that collectivism around whiteness becomes commonplace, it is a breeding ground for white supremacy. Forcing unity of identity between groups of people with little in common other than complexion creates collective white identity which has never historically led to anything positive for race relations. It is far better for instance that white people do not view themselves as a cohesive group but as Irish, Polish, Greek, Italian etc who share little more other than skin color. 

Similarly, grouping all Black people together is also nonsensical because the cultural differences that exist between an Ethiopian, Nigerian, Dominican, African American and Jamaican are very present as are their experiences.

Any comments about ""No, that'll never happen"" are another issue entirely. There's still a lot about software and coding we have to learn, even in this day and age. Thus, it's wise to be open to at least the possibility that such an AI-Robot could come to be. If this is true, then that opens up a whole lot of issues, which I discuss below.  With that said, I'll get this show on the road.

\---------------

I noticed that in all cultures which I'm aware of, most humans  measure a person's worth (high or low) based on *independent survivability* (i.e., surviving without others' help).

Achieving independent survivability requires certain basic things:

S*elf-defense skills*, resource-gathering skills, information-gathering and processing skills.

These themselves require the following traits: Strength, intelligence have the following prerequisites: foresight, creativity, physical strength, physical self-defense ability, lack of fear, courage, task competence, and *probably* others that aren't crossing my mind at the moment).

Based on these measures, there're already AI-robots with superhuman performance in at least the following: *fearlessness, physical strength, task competence, and* at least some kinds of *foresight.* They can certainly run multiple scenarios about routinized or semi-routinized tasks much faster than humans *and* pick the scenario most likely to lead to success and/or lead to the lowest level of loss (which I think qualifies as *foresight* and at least a vague form of *intelligence* and perhaps even 'street smarts' -- arguably the most important type of *intelligence*, especially for raw, basic survivability).

I can also see the plausibility in AI (the ""brain"" of such robots) of them predicting which forms of music and entertainment have the greatest probability of being appealing to at least a certain segment of the population, and perhaps the 'middle 77.8375987%' of the population, should it choose that percentage as such a threshold for 'mass popular'.  That takes care of *foresight* and probably *self-defense ability* (given that self-defense also requires both speed and quality of thought).

*Creativity*, admittedly, may be a problem (predicting a type of music that'll be popular is entirely different from actually creating that kind of music), although I can imagine - without being a musician - that probabilistic thinking just might play a factor in creating music).

**Bottom Line / Conclusion**: If we humans tend to value each other based on physical strength, self-defense ability, task competence, intelligence (foresight, creativity, 'street smarts'), fearlessness, courage -- then it *must* follow that the functional existence of these kinds of AI-robots is indeed more important than the likewise functional existence of even the strongest, smartest, bravest, and most competent humans.",10.0
783,t3_r39oay,"CMV: COVID-19 isn't something we ""snuff"" out or stop.","
A lot of people, from my understanding, seem to think that to stop COVID-19, we need to ""snuff"" it out, meaning stopping the spread entirely by eradicating the disease. This isn't how viruses or diseases work. You don't ""eliminate"" a virus, its just not possible, you teach your body to defend against it. You can eliminate from your body sure, but to destroy every last instance of a viruses is impossible, someone will always have it and even if you were able to magically eradicate it from every person, many animals can still host viruses and pass them to humans. We shouldn't be looking at the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that leads to the COVID-19 diease) as something to eliminate, but as something new that we have to train our bodies to defend against.

Thats where vaccines come in, that's what a vaccine is for. It's not to stop the spread, or to slow it, that is not the purpose of the vaccine, the purpose is to help your body detect and eliminate threatening viruses. Many previous viruses and diseases like the Bubonic Plague and the influenza virus are still around, even though they are hundreds of years old. This is because we developed a vaccine or treatment to help our bodies defend against them.

Despite being commonly associated with and grouped with Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, it really belongs in Eastern Europe, specifically the Balkans.

Greece is excluded because the West idolizes ancient Greeks. 

1. Greece is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox like the majority of Eastern Europe. 

2. Greek food, music, and culture is most similar to that of other Balkan nations, such as Bulgaria, Albania, Serbia, and North Macedonia, and is a mixture of Byzantine, Ottoman Turkish, Slavic, and Mediterranean influences.

3.

Additionally, there are non-Slavic countries in Eastern Europe such as Romania, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia etc. 

4. Being part of the Soviet Union is neither a necessary condition for being Eastern European nor was the entire Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. We consider Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria to be in Eastern Europe but they were never in the Soviet Union.

To put this is in a way that seems less offensive: school libraries should filter information.   


The two are literally the same.   


Schools are places where children should be able to find filtered and accurate information. They should be places where children and young adults can go for trustworthy information. Children and young adults are more susceptible to bullshit compared to adults (and adults are terrible!). Also, bullshit is often more psychologically comforting and easier to accept than the truth, so bullshit is often more compelling than the truth.  


Since many believe that social media has an obligation to stamp down misinformation, it should be even more true for places of learning that are responsible for educating the minds of people (children) who are even more susceptible to bullshit.   


Misinformation can be found in schools libraries. For example, one can find books that promote vaccine misinformation in school libraries. This shouldn't happen. Schools should filter, or in other words ban, such information. If parents and children are interested in information they have many places to go to get it. There are many free websites that offer such information, and such books can be bought from private sellers. No one's legal rights are being violated by banning books from school libraries.",0.0
788,t3_r2w18a,CMV: There is nothing wrong with sponsored segments in YouTube videos,"I will start by saying I understand and agree with the arguments against third-party ads before, during and after videos (I use Opera, which blocks those ads by default). I'll explain my view by listing two of those arguments, why I agree with them, and why I believe they don't apply to a sponsored segment within a video.

**Argument 1: Ads are intrusive.**  
Yes, they are. They're often loud, annoying and unexpected, to say nothing of the unskippable ones or the weird, false advertising mobile game ads that keep showing up. However, sponsored segments are easily skippable within the video, either when the content creator provides a direct timestamp or when you skip ahead yourself. And, if done right, the content creator incorporates the sponsored segment into the video, often adding their own humor and flair to it, and keeping a low volume if the rest of the content was meant to be quiet and relaxing, such as ASMR.

**Argument 2: Ads are used to collect your data, and shown to you based on your data.**  
Sponsored segments don't have that issue at all. If you click the link provided, yes, you will be tracked by algorithms, but it has no impact on your privacy by itself. A sponsored segment is shown to you because a company decided to sponsor that particular YouTuber, not because you are watching the video.

Finally, I will give a strong argument for having sponsored segments in videos: a YouTuber that gets a sponsorship deal is being paid directly for their work. Many creators struggle with demonetization, copyright strikes, and YouTube's ever-changing and selectively applied community guidelines. This means that, if YouTube is a source of revenue for them (primary or not), sponsorship deals are much more reliable for that end.

I'll gladly change my view if I am presented with a clear problem that happens often in sponsored segments, or with examples of sponsorships being used maliciously.",8.0
789,t3_r2v3sk,CMV: It is socially acceptable to go to a dog park without a dog,"I love dogs, but I’ve never had my own. Growing up my parents’ busy schedules and my father’s allergies always interfered with us getting a dog. To this day, I feel like I’ve been deprived of something that gives me so much joy, making it even more special when I meet a dog. I’ll point out every cute dog walking down the street and feel extra special if they come up to say hi to me. Unfortunately, as a student, I do not have the lifestyle that would accommodate getting my own dog at this time. That’s why I love visiting dog parks. Sometimes I’ll sit on a bench and wait for a dog to approach me to pet them (after asking permission from their owners of course). When a dog owner asks me which of the many frolicking dogs is mine, I’ll tell them that none are, but this often leads to mixed reactions. 

I personally don’t find sitting at a dog park without a dog to be weird at all. For one, I make an effort to not make any of the dog owners feel uncomfortable. I always ask the dog owner whether I can pet their dog before doing so. I also do not occupy a significant amount of the dog’s time when I do interact with them. I’ll only pet them for a few seconds before letting them walk away. 

Beyond this, dog parks are a public good and there are no restrictions regarding who can attend them. As well, the closest dog park to me is really beautiful. Even if there weren't dogs around, I would likely still go to enjoy the park itself.

790,t3_r2uhcg,CMV: You connect with others more through how you “are” than through what you say.,"I'm a public speaking and communication skills coach. I've observed that disconnection (along with perhaps discontent, tension and conflict) between people is mostly caused by a lack of presence, and not by the words we use. That is, I think we don't feel disconnected from others because we're saying the wrong thing, but because we're ""being"" the wrong way (i.e. not being fully present in our relationships and conversations). Or, at the very least, it seems that the value of presence is severely underrated when it comes to social skills, communication skills or our ability to create strong connections with others.

I think about it a little like a small pyramid. First, you have to be able to be in presence with yourself and be comfortable with yourself (by taking a few deep breaths, being in silence, noticing your your body feels, etc.). When you can be in presence and comfortable with yourself, you can be the same way with others. Then they can get an experience of your presence and your comfortability with yourself and with them. And this often encourages them to mirror you, so you get a palpable experience of feeling connected without words (e.g. like the feeling of being comfortable with a stranger through each other's body language, or watching TV in silence with a close friend, or sharing a consoling hug with someone and not needing to say anything).

Only once those two things are in place between people (your sense of presence and your comfort level with yourself and with others) does adding any words make sense to help sustain that connection.

Focusing on words (without the foundational comfort of being in silence) actually makes communication/socializing more difficult, and it can create more problems for those with social anxiety and/or fear of public speaking.

793,t3_r2tb7d,"CMV: The problem isn't religion, and isn't bad people abusing religion. The problem is that Abrahamic religious rules are treated deontically when they were intended as utilitarian rules","A lot of people, especially in the west, don't like religion very much. I'm not religious, nor is my family, and I have not studied religion and ethics formally since I was 15, so this take might be fried. A fair warning.

As far as I know, almost all ethical systems fall under one of three headings: utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics. Utilitarianism is concerned with producing the most net amount of goodness (usually defined as human wellbeing). Deontology is concerned with adherence to irreducible and overriding ethical norms (for example, ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" being the principle of retribution). Virtue ethics is concerned with maximizing human potential by encouraging the achievement or certain virtuous traits (say, charity, or resilience).

There are examples of all of these in both theistic and atheistic societies. The west, for example, has a highly deontic approach to human rights, while countries like China are much more utilitarian. Some ancient civilizations like the Greeks were hot on virtue ethics. Virtue ethics has declined in recent years, but I believe is seeing a resurgence of popularity due to Ayn Rand, Jordan Peterson, and other virtue ethics supporters who are compatible with ethical advocacy of capitalism.

I believe strongly one of the big reasons that Abrahamic religions continue to be an exceptional hindrance to social progress in a way other religions are not is that Abrahamic laws are interpreted as deontic, certainly by Islam and Christianity. I'm less familiar with Judaism, but I believe they have a method for challenging the old testament which perhaps makes them less deontic than the other two.

Sikhism, for instance, I would consider a utilitarian religion. Followers will feed the needy without expectation of return because they consider all humans to be part of the same being - by helping others they spiritually help themselves. Most would agree Sikhism is free from most of the problems that have plagued Abrahamic religions.

Buddhism I think is a religion of virtue ethics. Buddhism is all about focus on the self and one's own spiritual enlightenment. Being the best person you can be, regardless of the state of the world, is how you ""win"" Buddhism. Similarly, Buddhism does not cause major problems for social progress under status quo.


Taking a real hard look at the so-called deontic rules of Christianity and Islam, I think they make much less sense as deontic rules than as utilitarian ones. There's no better example of this than the Islamic prohibition on pork. As Bo Burnham said in his song ""From God's Perspective"", ""I created the universe, ya think I'm drawing the line at the fucking deli aisle?""

Obviously supreme moral beings and objective morality if it is so can still be consistent while drawing absolute rules on seemingly arbitrary things like types of meat which are acceptable. But intuitively if there are fundamental moral rules of the universe, it seems like they should be lower level and more axiomatic. Rules like ""do not rape"" as a Kantian moral imperative for instance.

It starts to make a whole lot more sense when you think about the social context in which the Quran was written. Pork is more likely to harbour parasites than any other type of meat. The Quran calling it unclean is more likely a physical remark on its properties, rather than a moral norm on its consumption. In an era before germ theory, simplifying utile rules of life like avoiding parasites was much easier to do with in the framing of being a moral imperative of a higher being.

In the modern day however it no longer makes a lot of sense to avoid pork. This isn't an example of the problems that deontic interpretation causes, but it is is an example of how rules primarily motivated by utilitarianism end up being interpreted as deontology.

What rapidly becomes more problematic is rules like the old testament forbidding homosexuality. If this is a deontic rule of a higher power, it is almost irrefutable. If it is seen as a utilitarian rule, we can examine its origin and trace it back to the prevalence of pederasty in in ancient Roman society. If abrahamic religions were willing to accept their religious principles as utilitarian rules as the majority were intended originally, there optics would be far better in the status quo. As it is, unbreakable adherence to utilitarian rules from 2000 years ago just isn't helpful anymore. 

In fact I would dare argue that if they were seen this way, Abrahamic religion would actually be a force for good in the world. I think there is considerable value in enshrining utilitarian rules for life discovered historically for future generations.

 For example ""An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" is frequently recognised as an antiquated principle of societies past. If religions focus more on the rule utilitarianism angle of how retributive justice contributes to preventing the rise of vigilantism in ancient civilizations, they might have a lot more justification for relevance to the justice system in the status quo.

794,t3_r2sbfg,CMV: You shouldn’t compare Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh.,"It is a disservice to Winnie the Pooh. I understand that the comparison was made originally because it’s kinda funny and it upsets him, so it’s a legitimate jab at the guy. But now that china has advanced censorship tactics, it’s not like him, or anyone in china is going to see it. If anything, continuing to perpetuate the comparison does more damage to Winnie the Pooh, than Xi Jinping.

I actually like Winnie the Pooh. He is a cute lovable bear and now whenever I think of him, I think of Xi Jinping. I’m all for making fun of oppressive leaders, but it isn’t worth it if you have to destroy the image of a innocent character like Winnie the Pooh to do it. This is especially true when you consider the fact that China blocks everything related to Winnie the Pooh, so it’s not like the insult is affecting him. Ultimately, people should stop making the association between Whinnie and Xi Jinping. This is so people can simply think of Whinnie, the honey loving childhood icon, without also thinking of a dictator.",11.0
795,t3_r2q7tr,CMV: Christmas decorations shouldn't go up before Saint-Nicolas has left,"A few notes before getting into the reasons:

1. I have no intention to respond to any comments related to controversy surrounding 'zwarte piet', it's not relevant to this discussion
2. in this post I assume that you're from a country where they know Saint-Nicolas and celebrate him
3. I'll be using Sinterklaas and Saint-Nicolas interchangeably, other names are also used for Saint-Nicolas

So now for the reasons why I hold this view:

First and foremost Santa is a ripoff of Sinterklaas, I mean, it's right there in the name.  Santa is sometimes also called Saint Nicholas or Saint Nick.  This is simply incorrect as Sinterklaas is a different person than santa.  And celebrating the ripoff before the original seems just wrong.  

Now some might say that Christmas decorations have nothing to do with santa.  Hence my second reason, having those decorations up for a long time makes them loose their value, their specialness.  Having a fixed date in December when everybody puts their Christmas decorations up at the same time makes them feel more special (at least in my opinion)

So, change my view, convince me that my neighbors are not wrong for already putting their decorations up too soon.",0.0

797,t3_r2l172,CMV:Doctors are totally justified to request exams based on patient profile,"It got me thinking about it after I read the testimony of this black woman from South Africa. She moved to another country and went to the doctor. Although the woman didn't show any related symptoms, the doctor requested her do an HIV test ""because she is from Africa"". The patient sees this as racism.

I did some research and found that in South Africa 20% of the adult population has HIV. And a large share of them does not even know they are HIV positive.

Medical authorities from all over the world recommend practitioners to HIV test patients that have some non-negligible risk of having HIV, however small that risk is. That includes victims of rape, people who have unprotected casual sex, sex workers, gay men, among other groups considered at risk. Even among these groups, rates of undetected HIV are below what is seen in South Africa.

Just to be clear, I believe it is the doctor's duty to explain in a clear and respectful way why they are requesting an HIV exam, to make it as safe and confortable an experience as possible to the patient.

But I got banned from a subreddit for pointing out that requesting an HIV test from a patient from south africa is not necessarily racist. It is good practice, with few exceptions. I believe what made this woman feel uncomfortable about the HIV test is her own prejudice against HIV patients and ignorance of the statistics. HIV testing is quick, simple, and nothing to be offended by.

So my point is: the doctor must be respectful and offer information, but patients should be submitted to simple exams if they are part of certain demographics according to statistical data, and they are wrong to claim that is racism/discrimination/etc",1816.0
798,t3_r2i4ue,CMV: The Office season 8 is superior to season 9,"First of all, I am not a hardcore Office nut, like some of you people out there. Only seen the show once. No one likes post-Michael Scott seasons that much, but I checked quite a few rankings and lists and almost every one seems to agree that S8 is worse than S9.

[https://screenrant.com/office-seasons-ranked-imdb/](https://screenrant.com/office-seasons-ranked-imdb/)

[https://www.cbr.com/the-office-all-seasons-ranked/](https://www.cbr.com/the-office-all-seasons-ranked/)

Well, neither season is that good, and the show should have probably ended around S6, but my god, was S9 terrible. I literally stopped watching it several times, for weeks at a time, trying to gather enough willpower to finish it. S8 is much better in comparison.

* The decision to bring focus on the fact that this is a tv-show mockumentary was horribly stupid and really detrimental to my enjoyment of it. To me, it kinda ruined it, that they started pretending the filming and the show is real and exists within the story world itself. It adds another layer between me and the story and draws attention to itself. So, instead of me being in the story world with the characters, it leaves me outside to wonder how it really works, the logistics of it all. A terrible way to tell a story, and they should have frankly done the opposite, drawing attention away from the method of filming and onto what is actually happening. Obviously.
* To continue, it opens a pandoras box of unnecessary questions: Are the episodes I watched only the raw footage of the documentary, or some rough cut of the finished product? Is everything I saw also in the documentary, or just parts of it? What parts, what did they leave out? Who am I, the viewer, in this scenario? Why have I seen this before the actual people in the documentary? Did they really send another film crew to film Jim in his other work place, or Dwight on his farm? How many film crews are there? How did several cameras and the cameramen fitted into those rooms? It makes me super self-conscious about how fake and artificial everything is, and how I am really just sitting on a sofa watching tv. Honestly, I feel like it kinda ruins earlier seasons too, when they made it so literal. And it never bothered me before, never even thought about it. It was just a clever method of telling the story and jokes, that you are not supposed to care about, until they made it real and made you think about it in S9.
* The addition of Pete and Clark felt really artificial too, and they never became real persons/characters to me. It felt like they were added to resolve story issues (Who does Erin fall in love with? Who does Dwight play off from, when Jim is in Philadelphia?) and not because they brought something unique or interesting into the chemistry of the office. They were as interesting as people as wet paper bags. Pete always felt to me like a replacement Jim, not in a good way, which is a joke within the season itself as well. I really liked Erin, and although it was not handled the best way, I was invested in her relationship with Andy since it started, so bringing in a better replacement for Andy, it just felt cheap, and you can see it coming miles off anyway. They are not the new Jim and Pam to me, not even close.
* I think this is a bigger problem within shows that has been going on for a while, but I think the characters really became caricatures of themselves, in a bad way. Especially Dwight. They really Flanderisized everyone, and this being the last season means that the trend reached its zenith here.
* There are several episodes in S9 that are double length, and my god, was it hard to sit through them. There is a reason why most sitcoms are half an hour. I could not care less about this caricature-Dwight debating about the inheritance of his farm with some guest-characters I had never seen before and would not see again, for one hour. This was one of the points where I had to take a break for a couple of weeks, and then pushed myself to finish it in hopes that something better would come later. There is no reason for this episode and its kin to be this long. If there were double length episodes in the earlier seasons, I can honestly say I did not notice. But here, my god, it felt like pulling teeth, with everything stretched out as much as possible. An important aspect of comedy is timing, and they really fucked it up here.
* I really liked Robert California. Not a perfect character by any means, but he brought something new and fresh to the table. He shook up the power-dynamics and brought a unique angle and jokes to the show, as everyone was forced to reckon with him, one way or another. Having watched the show only once, I still remember a few of his lines and jokes. (Lizard King, nature metaphor or sex metaphor, could have been drawing a circle). I do not recall a single line from S9. Up until the very end, S9 is just another season of Office, without Michael, and mostly without Jim or Andy either. Is it expecting me to be excited about... Pete and Clarke? And the boom operator? It felt empty. By the time the finale rolled around, I had completely stopped caring about 15 episodes ago.
* I did not like the Jim/Pam storyline here. It was hard and miserable to watch them being so unhappy and it did not give me anything, as I knew they are not about to break up. Besides, Jim was really the asshole there, and I was sick of pretending he was not, or that there was two equal sides there. No, one person is off chasing his dreams, and the other is left dealing with the everyday dirt that just has to be dealt with, essentially being a single working mom of two children.
* They really fucked up Andy. He does almost complete 180 on his personality, back to the fuckwit he was years ago, apparently because of some resentment behind the scenes. It felt unearned, since we had watched him change and grow for years now, only to abruptly see him break bad. Like the mockumentary aspect, this change also made the earlier seasons worse, because we had followed and probably cared about Andy-Erin relationship for years at that point, only for it to be immediately thrown in the bin in S9, because of some behind the scenes crap.

I guess that was most of the reasons. Even though S8 is not peak-Office either, the worst you can say it was mostly forgettable and did not live up to its potential. But at least it did not fuck up several characters and relationships and the format itself. Just for the sake of avoiding these atrocities, it is better than S9, which was actively terrible. ",3.0

801,t3_r2e1e6,CMV: South Slavs are less Slavic than East Slavs and Poles,"South Slavs appear to have significant Paleo-Balkan ancestry, this ancestry is actually higher in most Bulgarians and almost all Macedonians than their Slavic ancestry is, when looking at pca charts and calculators online it becomes very clear that in terms of Autosomal DNA South Slavs are neither close nor particularly related to East Slavs and Poles

Someone might be wondering right now, why I consider Poles and East Slavs to be the most “real” Slavs from a genetic POV, well, on many calculators online such as gedmatch pr G25 ancient/medieval Slavic samples can easily be found, almost all of them seem to be Polish, Ukrainian, Western Russian or Belarusian like.

The reason i do not believe Slavic is “just a linguistic group “ is because languages do not magically appear miles and miles away from their original homeland, i am defining Slavic ancesy as ancestry derived from the original Slavic speakers of (North)eastern Europe,  a Slav to me is someone who is mostly descended from these people, from looking at the autosomal DNA of South Slavs such as Serbs, Bulgarians and especially Macedonians it is clear that they range from being as much Paleo-Balkan as they are Slavic to being more Paleo-Balkan than they are Slavic, it is clear that while the Medieval Slavs did a great job at Slavicizing the Balkans linguistically they did not manage to completely or even significantly wipe out the native pre-Slavic inhabitants.


Leaving genetics aside, i believe that even on a cultural level South Slavs are much farther removed from the Early Slavic peoples than East Slavs and Poles are, South Slavic countries have heavy cultural influence from non-Slavic cultures, such as Ottoman and Austrian-Hungarian influence, while we do not exactly know what the early Slavic cilturee was like since there are no wirtten records about it we can still make a conclusion from stuff that has been passed down to history via speech. East Slavs appear to have more folklore and even some holidays of Slavic pagan origin than South Slavs have. Even when looking at food Bulgarian food seems to be much closer to Turkish or Greek food than to Ukrainian or Polish food.

Also, it should be noted that i have been accused for being a racist for having this view, i do not personally believe such thing is true, i am not saying it’s a bad thing that South Slavs are genetically and culturally distant from the Early Slavic peoples, if people choose to get offended by me saying that then they are the racists since they think having non-Slavic ancestry is a bad thing.

In conclusion, my view is that South Slavs are Slavs in a linguistic sesne but not so much in a cultural and especially ethnic/genetic/ancestral sense",0.0
802,t3_r2bcqc,"CMV: ""Real communism has never been tried"" is a factually incorrect and incredibly disingenuous argument","1. Real communism may have not ever been achieved, but it has certainly been *attempted*, and to ignore that ignores the real and tangible contributions of real people to the theory and practice of socialism. Mao, Lenin, Castro and Stalin all read and wrote extensively about Marxist theory and made many justifications on how their policies would bring their respective countries closer to the ideal of Marx. If you would want to establish real communism, you have to see how past people did it and what they got right and wrong. And it's not as if they were all charlatans either who only cared about money or big mansions - that kind of thinking leads to small men who get overthrown easily. A lot of these people genuinely bought into their own bullshit and believed that communism would be achieved within their lifetimes.

803,t3_r2a5qm,CMV: Moral Nihilism is the Correct meta-ethical position,"It’s hard to talk about moral Nihilism, because people often respond with smug questions like “Are you saying rape is not immoral? Are you saying murder is not immoral? Are you saying if I torture you in my basement for 30 years, that’s not immoral?” Of course I don’t condone rape, murder and torture. 

But I can’t justify that philosophically. I am unable to make intelligible moral propositions, at least from an epistemological perspective. There is nothing in the universe that gives you a moral code. There is nothing in nature that gives you a moral code. What we call ethics and morality are a mix of instincts and abstract axioms we pass on to our children and grandchildren. Most people find incest immoral. But that’s because we are programmed to avoid incest due to the genetic abnormalities that incest often leads to. People call murder wrong, because they themselves have an instinctive urge to survive themselves and for their tribe to survive. The moral axioms come from the aforementioned instincts as well as environmental and cultural factors. 

The twist I give my argument is I am unable to avoid making moral claims. I would be against a law that outlawed homosexuality, for example. However, my claim is a preference. I don’t care if two men or two women date or have sex. It doesn’t affect me in any way. I’ve also been in love before, and it was one of the most delightful experience in my entire life. If other people are able to have the same experience (whether the love interest is of the same sex or not, I certainly won’t stand in their way. 

In conclusion, I think moral claims are a useful tool and nothing more. I have a set of preferences, you have another set, and your grandmother has another set still. Sometimes our preferences overlap, sometimes they differ. But none of our moral claims have anything to do with truth. That’s why i’m a moral Nihilist and not a moral relativist.",3.0

This urge to check the “viewers” feature on Instagram comes down to validation and wanting to portray a certain image of ourselves to the public, particularly those we associate with/think of as part of our 'in-group'.

806,t3_r24ulq,"CMV: There are legitimately realistic situations in which one's health and wellbeing can be out of their own control due to them not possessing friends, and it being through no fault of their own. I suspect it is the source of many problems in this world and should be taken as a serious issue.","There is one factor of Mental/Emotional health is a major injustice, yet nothing has been done about it. That factor is having genuine deep friendly relations, and it is overlooked by swathes of the population all who either: possess friends, OR have no desire for friends and have the fortunate temperament of being somewhat fine with being friendless. But those who are friendless but DO passionately desire friends have been routinely overlooked and their serious problem dismissed as either trivial, comical, or of their own doing; the remainder of people in the other two camps (people who have an amount of friends that they're satisfied with, and people who don't currently strongly prefer to have/make friends) have the privilege of ignoring this problem, believing that this problem is self-caused, or believing this problem to be comical.

Those who are in this predicament are in it due to the flat fact that they need to have genuine friends to have good mental health, but no one is obligated to be their friend. This results in them not having a way for them to improve their mental health at all in this regard. Having no friends while strongly desiring them severely and ruthlessly hampers one's mental health, which in turn also severely hampers their physical health and leads to many unglamorous problems for them, and in some cases problems for society.

What this means is, in these predicaments, one's emotional—and consequently physical—health and wellbeing is not even in their own control. I don't think that is just, and leads me to my thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

***Thesis:***

***Total social justice cannot occur in the world if there are situations in which this remains true: one's emotional—and consequently physical—health and wellbeing is totally out of their own control due to one strongly desiring friends but being unable to possess friends.***

&amp;#x200B;

=====

&amp;#x200B;

***Introduction to my ""truths"", and the conclusion which they led to:***

I've determined that there are 6 factors that are out of one's control that compound on each other when one is friendless but devoted to the want to make friends. These are also coincidentally factors of my own friendlessness in particular.

\--

**Observed Truths (the 5 primary, uncontrollable factors):**

1. The vast majority of people in my high school already have a friend group that they're comfortable with and that they don't want to change.

\-

2. People passively observe me and what I do. Due to me spending much of my time at school alone, despite me residing in this town for a long while in which I presumably had ample time to make friends, they unconsciously conclude that I either:

* will not want to be their friend,
* that I would make a poor friend,
* that I am someone to be feared and that is why I don't have friends,
* or that I deliberately choose not to have/make friends,

thus I appear completely identical to someone who:

* does have friends but those friends don't attend the same school,
* does it for attention,
* or is happy with not having friends,

even though none of those are the case.

And as well, these people who observed me then go on to spread these assumptuous rumors and patterns of behavior toward me to other students—especially students who are new to the school or who would even potentially become my friend had they not seen how other people think of me—resulting in those other students who had the rumors about me told to them to adopt the same belief: that I am not worthy of being their friend for some reason, despite them not even being familiar with me yet.

And on the contrary, these people who would reject me would observe someone who has many friends (and therefore has the privilege of constantly being able to show off their social skills and humor) as someone who would be both a good friend to them and may want to become friends with them, so they go on to make friends with people who already have friends, and not make friends with me, someone who has no friends.

\-

3. I am deprived of many opportunities to improve my social skills, due to having no one to practice them on. This ensures that my social skills will remain poor. Thus creating a negative feedback loop.

And on the contrary, those students who possess friends will only get better and better at their social skills, since their friendly relationships increase in numerity and depth as they improve their social skills—creating a *positive* feedback loop for them.

\-

4. It is exponentially harder for me to make friends than it is for someone already possessing friends to make friends, because, in the case of someone already possessing friends that decides to attempt to make a new friend, they simply have to introduce the new friend to their existing friend circle or invite the new friend to an event or 'group chat' which other/mutual friends will attend. They also have the subtler option of talking to the new friend while talking to their existing friend(s), initiating conversation between all parties, subtly establishing friendship with the new friend.

I have absolutely none of these avenues in my more unfortunate case, making the process of initiating a more-than-surface-level conversation with the new friend impossibly more awkward and complex for me to navigate, and at best case will result in the prospective new friend simply becoming a shallow 'peer-friend' that I say ""hi"" to every once-in-a-while, which itself eventually fades out after some time, after which we will go on as if we were always strangers.

\-

5. Though I can try to resist negative side effects with all my will, it is fully inevitable that every so often my frustration with not having any friends will culminate as outward frustration, exhaustion, or depression, which are all unattractive traits that unavoidably outwardly manifest in me caring less about my hygiene, having increased irritability, having antisocial behaviors, or etc., which will only further repulse anyone from wanting to interact with me. This is yet another negative feedback loop.

And on the contrary, people possessing friends receive no such frustration from this source, which prevents them from having these negative behaviours as routinely as I do, thereby these people possessing friends are *not* routinely seen as unattractive to others, but *a*ttractive. This is another positive feedback loop for them.

\-

**My recent conclusion:**

While I remain in this town and/or generally around the proximity of anyone who attends or staffs this school, there is no way out of this predicament except by a miracle. This is a 'social trap'.

I have no friends and each of the above factors and feedback loops compound on each other to ensure that, day-to-day, I have a very very close to 0% chance of gaining even a single friend. Yet this works the opposite way for those students in my high school that presently have friends. The students that presently have friends and desire to make more can typically expect to continue to gain more of them due to the above factors compounding positively for them; the more friends one has, the more friends one will make, similar to exponentiation.

Ultimately at the top of this hierarchy are the 'popular' students, who, being friends with swathes of the student population, have the ability to influence those swathes into being friends with any one particular person simply by choosing to have that particular person as their own friend or not. Which means these popular students, though unconscious of it, serve the role of dictating who is able to rise to their level in the friend-numerity hierarchy and who is not. And in some not-rare cases, 'cool teachers' also take an identical role.

The above paragraph elaborates on the final, sixth, factor: popular students and 'cool teachers' *do* have the subtle, undetectable power to dictate the social climate, without them even *knowing*. It's not just a high school sit-com or movie trope. It's a real issue for people in my situation, that seemingly nothing can be done about... Popular students and 'cool' teachers deciding who to be friends with or not can be loosely interpreted as 'bullying', but the problem is it's *not bullying*, because people obviously have the right to decide who they want to be genuine friends with or not, as well as the fact that genuine friendship cannot be forced. **So, I can't think of a solution to this problem, but my view is that a solution to it** ***does*** **need to be worked on and found if we are to believe in fairness, because it is something that is out of some peoples' control. Convince me otherwise.**

\-

***My final thoughts:***

You would assume that popular students, despite being deprived of further growth in friend numerity due to having reached the top, would presumably want further growth in their amount of friends, thus they'd want to be friends with me. But that is stereotypically not the case; they would still not want to make friends with me because I have the factors of 2 and 5 (see the 5 factors above) that make me look very undesirable.

If your personal belongings and luxuries were paid for by someone else who is willing, you may be crafty for being able to take advantage of such an arrangement but you didn’t work for any of those items, and very likely had to perform sexual acts in order for the arrangement to work in which case it is essentially prostitution.

808,t3_r21ue9,CMV: Gwent in the Witcher 3 is better than the standalone Gwent.,"To be clear, I'm just referring to the implementation of the game itself. Of course being able to play against actual people etc is an improvement.

In short, Gwent as a standalone game is so heavily... uh, gaming-ized that it doesn't really feel like a card game any more; it almost reminds me of those strategy games that had turn-based battles. I think the emphasis on active actions, not just leader ability but also all the cards doing things and so forth, just distracts and detracts from what was already an excellent card game as implemented in W3. And drawing extra cards every round significantly weakens the strategic element, as a side note.

In general, good digital implementations of board games don't add in all that stuff--look at online chess or computer card games. The fluff does not enhance the game, and I'd rather just have an online implementation of the W3 version.

Edit to clarify the ""changing view"" part: the main point there would be that I don't understand why they implemented it the way they did. Surely that was a lot more development effort for no real improvement.",31.0

Another time there’s a guy sitting on the far side of the room, by himself facing the wall. The guy closest to me comes and knocks on my window and says “that guys not wearing his mask”. Now this is a giant open room with high ceilings, ventilation, filters and the only people in it were these 2 guys over 20ft away from each other.

Lastly I overheard a lady shouting “Get back to your area! You need to have a mask out here! If you don’t have one you need to leave right now.” This went on for about 3 minutes and I was wondering why grown people were sitting there taking that until I heard a little voice say “I’m sorry. My mask is in my pocket”. This lady was yelling and berating a 7-8 year old who was alone in the hallway getting a snack from the vending machine.

There are people with legitimate reasons they can’t/won’t get vaccinated and those with fanatical reasons. we acknowledge those people and there’s an entire sub dedicated to making fun of them when they die (which is disgusting). But for some reason fanatical vaxxers/maskers go unaddressed and can be dangerous.

For one I feel there are people who look to assert their power over other, Karen’s. It gives them a reason to harass or discriminate against people. I had a boss who did this and he himself was antivax. He used this to ban minorities from the business

Another is it promotes a different type misinformation, albeit one that errs on the side of safety, but misinformation none the less. They usually exaggerate the science behind the precautions and this can lead to paranoia especially to vulnerable people.

So I wouldnt say mask/vax fanatics are as dangerous as antivxxers but I do think they are very problematic

That way, If a man/ shop owner sees a thief they can complain to the police without feeling like it's too big a deal.

Then it struck me that 90+ percent of the NYT's headlines were all describing some horrible event or something in the future they should be worried about.

It's a trap. It's not good for anyone's mental health. It should be easier to seek out positive news stories.

One thing I like about reddit is subreddits like /r/UpliftingNews that allow people to just get a quick dose of happiness while also staying up to date on the news. All major news websites should have a similar option.

After a quick perusal of the NYT's sidebar links I saw at least 60+ sections on various topics like ""Social Media"" and ""Health Guide"" and ""Photography."" If they can find the time to curate a section on ""Automotive"" news, I think they should be able to collate happy or uplifting stories into one feed.

The only reason I can think of to not do this is that instilling a sense of dread in readers keeps them coming back. There's truth in that.

If we do not recognize the ""right"" to self-determination, why should we expect other nations to? More than that, we would rightfully be disgusted if China interfered in this internal matter and supported Californian independence. We would view this as Chinese imperialism.

It would also be a hypocritical application of these criticisms. We are rightfully silent over the situation in Catalonia and Scotland, as these are internal matters that do not concern us. So long as nations aren't violating OUR sovereignty, what they do within their borders is not our concern.

The true threat of China is her propensity to shift her weight around in an attempt to silence critics, as seen with the NBA and Hollywood. Soon, 90% of the media we consume will be Chinese propaganda. This is dangerous for our sovereignty, but we should counter it by reducing our economic reliance on them, not by acting in hypocritical ways. Being so heavily reliant on trade from an authoritarian state is dangerous to our liberties and sovereignty, so we should seek to gradually eliminate all economic relations with China. We should impose extremely high tariffs on Chinese good and bar Chinese investments into the United States.

The academy award for that is just awful. In a sense that it's nothing but a glorified ""Pat disney on the back again"". Almost all movies in that category are generic animated children's movies whose only value is box office. Reminder that the abominable ""Boss Baby"" was nominated.

It seems they only watch the hottest new cartoons and decide which one won based on box office alone. Screw artistic merit, screw the animation quality, screw everything. Disney demands their yearly reward.

The alternative to this is someone who had physical harm done to them whether it be violence or otherwise with usage of the word.

821,t3_r1nn14,CMV: reserve prices on online auctions don't make sense,"Reserves are a minimum price that bids must reach in order to be sold, on top of whatever the bidding starts at. This wastes everyone's time by making them attempt to bid amounts that the item won't be sold for. Bidding should start at the minimum price with no secret higher price. This is especially true on websites in which bidders don't necessarily pay what they bid. For example, an auction starts at $1, if bidder A bids $10, bidder B bids $100, and bid increments are $1, bidder B will win and pay $11. In a live auction, bidder B would pay $100 under the same conditions. Here, a reserve makes sense as it encourages bidders to bid high to meet the reserve. But for online auctions, one can bid small increments until they meet the reserve, and even if they do bid high, they still only pay the next increment up from the next lowest bid or the reserve, whichever is more.

822,t3_r1kefj,"CMV: In areas where it is legal to carry weapons, open carry is all-around better than concealed carry.","This is something I have been pondering for a while, and I just do not understand why in some places concealed carry (CC) is legal when open carry (OC) is illegal.  It seems to me that OC would accomplish what CC tries much more effectively.  

The primary reason to carry a weapon is self-defense.  In general, an OC weapon, say in a hip holster, could be used more quickly than CC weapon, and in a critical situation, that speed could make all the difference.

Another reason to carry is deterrence, and I think this is where OC is far more effective than CC.  The idea is that I may never be the victim of a violent crime if the criminal thinks I might have a weapon.  Would it prevent even more crime if the criminal *knew* I had a weapon?  Wouldn't he see that gun on my hip and think, ""I definitely don't want to mess with that guy!""  Also, seeing that gun might prevent a crime to a third person in that the criminal would have second thoughts about a potential good samaritan might intervene.  

When OC is the rule, only one with a nefarious purpose would have a reason to have a concealed weapon.  

All the other reasons people list for carrying a weapon (You have a right to, makes you more aware of the situation, gives you confidence) do not change between CC and OC.  

The only reason I can think of for CC is that OC might cause panic in those who don't carry, but I think those people need to calm down and realize that good citizens who carry could protect their lives as well, and when it comes to a critical situation, it is better to *know* who is armed.

823,t3_r1ijwv,"CMV: Critical Race Theory is a tool of control, not of liberation","Okay, so here we go. Another controversial topic.

As I see it, socioeconomic class is and always has been a far more important social distinction than race. Sometimes race is used to give definition and reinforcement to class lines (race-based slavery in the US, Jim Crow laws, apartheid in South Africa), but the fundamental division is one of socioeconomic class. There is one group of people who are supposed to run things and get to make the rules, and another who must follow them, obey their dictates, and are generally economically exploited by the ruling class.

Often there is also a middle class who enjoy more advantages, freedom, and economic privilege than the lower class, but still must stay in line and not question the policies of the ruling upper class. The middle class usually has much more in common with the lower class than it does with the upper class, but, to retain their small and relatively insignificant privileges, will often support the upper class anyway and not ""rock the boat"".

In my view, Critical Race Theory (CRT) obscures this fundamental truth of human societies by focusing on race to the exclusion of class. By casting race as the most important distinguishing factor between people, it obscures rather than elucidates the true source of oppression and the true path to relieving it. Is a black banker or state prosecutor any less of an oppressor of the lower class simply because she is black? Is a white coal miner or factory worker less a member of the exploited lower class because he is white? I don't think so, but CRT as I understand it seems to say this is the case.

By keeping people focused on race as the primary driver of socioeconomic exploitation and inequality, CRT divides groups that might otherwise work together to achieve real meaningful progress. Seen through the lens of CRT, poor white Trump supporters with racist tendencies become the enemy, rather than potential allies.

I find great inspiration in the stories of people like [Fred Hampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton), who recruited the poor, white, Confederate flag-waving Young Patriots into his ""Rainbow Coalition"" alongside Black Panthers and local Latino organizations, to fight oppression and build ground-up alternative services to support their impoverished and exploited communities in Chicago.

If Fred Hampton were alive today, I think he would be loosely affiliated with the BLM movement, but advocating for class consciousness and trying to work across racial lines to ally with Trump voters, rather than demonizing them.

CRT, and many of the countermeasures its supporters advocate (affirmative action in education, preferential diversity hiring targets at large companies, race-based ""sensitivity training"" at work that teaches that America is inherently white supremacist and all white people are complicit in oppression) acts as a wedge to prevent this from happening. It keeps poor and middle class black and white Americans fighting each other, rather than fighting the system and investing, together, in their communities to improve the condition of all lower-class people from the ground up.",30.0
824,t3_r1g6ww,"CMV: Reddit (outside of humor and informational subs) is an irredeemable cesspit of idiotic circlejerking, trolling, political garbage and power-tripping mods.","This *happens* to include this sub, although as per Rule D I am *not* talking about this sub in particular (and I DO still think it is entirely possible to change my mind--see below.)

Anyway, this is how it goes on any sub not devoted to humor or neutral topics (i.e. without any political, social or psychological relevance whatsoever)... you have two choices:

A) Choose to post something short and blunt, get a torrent of people spamming the same exact objection, which you do have a response to but you have to repeat it over and over until your fingers bleed.

B) Choose to post something of medium to long length, everyone reads 10% of it and skims the rest, and then spews out **the same exact frickin' objections anyway**, and this is allowed because being lazy or an illiterate moron is not just *allowed*, but is actively *encouraged* by mods on those types of subs... because this level of idiocy is very time-efficient, drives sub activity, and drives the drama that ultimately gives them that sweet, sweet release of dopamine that they so crave when they get to remove a post (generally for the crime of being too coherent and/or too non-troll-y.)

There is no option C.

No one is ever warned, banned or otherwise sanctioned for posting non-sequiturs, straw men, or generally incoherent second grade level drivel. Ever. On any sub.

And on top of this, the overwhelming majority of mods also lazy and/or capricious (see above comment re: dopamine) and/or pursuing their own agenda, so it doesn't really matter what the rules are anyway.

There's also the matter of CONSTANTLY having to ""prove"" that you're not a conservative (and I most certainly am not!) in order to make any comment that in any way that *happens* contradicts the moronically fortune cookie-level party line that the popular left happens to be championing today.  E.g. Fauci is a self-serving asshat who obviously made the pandemic much worse, but no one can mention this without prefacing it with a 10,000 word essay about how horrible Trump and Rand Paul are.  

And yet actually taking the time to post those sorts of disclaimers is enough to make your post too long for 95% of people to bother reading.

Also, any time you comprehensively and decisively debunk someone's ignorant nonsense with a bevy of citations and earnest rhetoric, there will be no reply (unless it's someone who simply ignores what you wrote and starts strawmanning), but instead there will be a single and amusingly defiant vote down. 

This is because:

 a) there's no penalty for doing this (because everyone copied Slashdot's amazing idea of comment moderation, but no one bothered copying or expanding on the equally important concept of meta-moderation to keep it honest) and 

b) your intelligent rebuttal is far, far too long for anyone other than the poster you're replying to to bother reading.

And due to a combination of the above reasons, Hot / Top are inevitably dominated by the same asinine line-toeing topics, so you have to wade through the garbage heap of New in order to find something that isn't the same cliched circlejerk you've seen 1000 times before.

*****

This is section is NOT meant to be a part of my CMV (otherwise, a particularly intrepid mod might claim it runs afoul of rule D!) I am including this here ONLY for the sake of mods who may be considering removing the post, and for those considering reporting it.


Rule A: I clearly pass this rule, though I'm sure an especially ambitious mod could simply claim that I posted less than 500 words (in base 200!), in which case I'll simply have to tip my hat to their creativity.

Rule B ""willingness"": It would be very, very, very easy to change my view. **Link to a sub where the clowns and trolls are not running the show.**  That would change my mind. It's exceedingly simple.  

Of course it doesn't actually matter if I do end up posting 7 times that my view has 'substantially changed', because someone only has to link 3 posts where I disagreed with examples provided (by trolls and/or the illiterate) and that will surely be enough to have the post removed.  

Rule B ""soapbox"": Lol, hell no I don't expect to any of this change anyone's mind. I've spent a few hours going through this sub and it's obviously beyond redemption. The vast majority of people here (as elsewhere on Reddit! No rule D, no rule D! This isn't meta! I mention it *only* to explain why I certainly wouldn't bother trying to soapbox here) are lazy douchebags, and the ones that aren't certainly don't need me to explain the patently obvious.

(BUT! Some noble person from this remaining tiny percentage might be able to give me a counterexample, thus Changing My View and giving me a more worthwhile sub to focus on.)

**Of course, because I almost always make the effort to articulate myself clearly and completely, this will likely be deemed ""soapboxing"" by mods who are used to people posting the textual equivalent of a stream of emojis.**  The working definition of ""non-soapboxing"" is obviously just flinging your feces at a wall for a couple minutes and calling it a post.  Whereas anyone who actually thinks about things and has ideas complex enough to rise above a gradeschool level, and is willing to take the time to articulate those ideas, *obviously* has an agenda of some sort. 

(But not the legions of trolls; those guys are cool.) 

Rule C: I think my title more or less covers it.

Rule D ""meta"": Again, I'm more than happy to not mention this subreddit at all (and indeed this entire section is meant ONLY for the mods.) HOWEVER, what may end up happening is this: some troll is going to go through my post history and comment on something specific. I will inevitably respond, because I have no self-restraint whatsoever in these matters. This will be used as justification to remove the post, while the troll (who brought up the subbreddit first) will suffer no consequences. C'est la vie.

And again this isn't specific to this sub. The mods on nonhumorous/noninformational subs know well enough not to remove the trolls.  Trolls are their lifeblood.  Without the trolls and the circlejerkers, who would drive their traffic up to desirable levels (as well as luring in unsuspecting victims to be sacrificed for that sublime hit of dopamine)?

Rule D ""personal harm"": I mean, it *is* true that 97% of Reddit (and the human race in general) would serve society infinitely better by being fed into a wood chipper and used as fertilizer for crops. This is just an objective fact. You can't argue with facts.

But no, I'm not campaigning for this nor do I bear especially ill will toward any one *particular* person.

Rule D ""self-promotion"":  Uh. no. I mean Christ, if anyone has a good idea for actually monetizing my entirely well-founded and righteous contempt, PLEASE DM me.  

Rule E: Oh, believe you me I will respond. And it will not be low effort.  I can count on one hand the number of Reddit users I've ever seen who've put more effort into their responses than I (on any sub. I'm NOT talking about this sub! No Rule D violation!)",677.0

So even assuming that the most dire predictions are correct, for people alive today, the risk of death from the effects of climate change would be less than say, the risk of death from driving to work everyday, or heart disease, or cancer.  That is to say, we are more likely to die from a host of other factors that are also nominally within our control than we are from the effects of climate change.  If you have no great urge to change your lifestyle to avoid heart disease, change your habits to avoid driving, you shouldn't worry about climate change either.              

This is also factoring in that effects of climate change are and will be felt more keenly by poorer countries and populations.  The blueprint that we have now to combat climate change involves richer countries telling poorer countries that they cannot and should not achieve the levels of industrialization that Western nations have.  That it is better for the planet if the majority of their populations remain in poverty.  This is not only unjust but an irrational ask for developing countries.  That is to say, it's better for the welfare of developing countries to ignore pledges to stop using fossil fuels and to end deforestation.  Even if climate change would in the future lead to some decrease in general welfare for those countries, the increase from modernization would more than make up for it.     

Therefore,  the rational course of action for people alive today is to not worry about climate change because the effects are too remote and the cure right now is worse than the disease.",0.0

829,t3_r1bhs4,CMV: I don't care if something is handmade or not,"I get so frustrated when I'm shopping and find an item I like, only to see that it has an exorbitant price tag. Usually the explanation is that the item is handmade, it took the artist X many hours, they poured their heart and soul into it, they used ancient traditional techniques bla bla bla...

I understand that a lot of manhours go into the making of an handmade object. So, they have to charge a lot more than mass produced items to make it worth their time. However, as a customer this is not my problem. I only care about the object that is produced in the end, not how long it took them to make it.

Of course, no one is forcing me to buy hand made objects. My point is, I don't understand why other people care at all and consent to pay such higher prices. In my experience, saying an item is handmade is just an excuse to charge a ridiculous amount of money. The item in the end is not even higher quality, often it is worse and flawed because machines are infinitely more precise than we can hope to be.

Here are some arguments I am anticipating and what I think of them:

\- Handmade items are unique unlike mass produced ones: 

I concede this one but I don't understand the urge to own something marginally unique. What does it matter if your handmade bag has a slightly different stitching at one location compared to other bags made by the same artist. No one will ever pick up on such small differences anyway. 

\- We support artists by buying their handmade art: 

Yeah but by that same logic we can artificially support many kinds of professions that are not always commercially viable. Artists don't need us to buy their handmade art in order to survive. Artists have been around for all of human history. They have always had patrons that provide for them. In the age of crowd sourcing its even easier for artists to find patrons. If I want to support someone, I can just give them money. Or, I can commision a piece from them and pay for it. I just don't want to go to the store and pay extra for handmade stuff.

\- Just don't buy it if you don't want to:

True. I can avoid buying handmade items. I just want to understand the view of people who buy them.

830,t3_r1azq3,CMV: Not all pedophiles are at high risk of molesting children,"“Ticking time bombs”, “they’re all alike”, “they have uncontrollable urges”, “it’s just a matter of time”, “no such thing as a nonoffender”, “just haven’t got caught yet”,”need constant intensive therapy to control themselves”, “lack empathy for kids—missing nurturing/protective instinct”, “they’re all monsters”, “none can be trusted around kids”, “crazy and unstable”, “subhuman”

These are some of things I’ve read that suggest pedophiles are all teetering on the edge of losing control and are all at high risk of eventually harming a child. I think this is completely wrong.

I think these wrong ideas stem from decades of biased research that was completely focused on pedophiles who had committed crimes. Those researchers just assumed those criminals were representative of all pedophiles without ever making the effort to seek out pedophiles who had not committed crimes. If you are studying criminals, you should not be surprised to find criminal traits.

I cannot think of any other group than pedophiles where we assume that all of it’s members are at high risk of committing a crime based only on a subset of them that have already been convicted of that crime. It’s absurd when you think about it.

Recent studies are painting a very different picture.

I assert that pedophiles are wide-ranging in their attributes, including risk factors for criminality. I assert attractions mostly only determine *who* a sex offender targets, not so much *whether* they commit the crime. A sex offender who is a heterosexual man will likely target a woman because that’s what he is attracted to. A pedophilic sex offender will target a child because that is who they are attracted to. In both cases high risk factors for criminality are more important than attractions for predicting *whether* a person commits the crime.",0.0
831,t3_r1atb1,CMV: CMV: Any company that requires employees to complete an unpaid internship should also be required to offer room and board for them during the duration of their internship.,"This isn't going to be long.

833,t3_r194z0,CMV: I should do whatever it takes (within moral and legal limits) to lose my virginity,"For context I am a 30 year old male virgin. I have only had one girlfriend (back in highschool) and have not done much dating outside of that. In recent years I've made a concentrated effort to be more social in general and to do more dating specifically (although covid has made that more difficult). 

In my dating efforts I've found my virginity to be a hindrance. It causes me stress in knowing how/if to bring it up. I am stressed about that because I know that most people would consider it a negative at my age. (For instance, the last woman I went on more than one date with broke it off because I told her I was a virgin.) However, hiding it, even if I don't directly lie about it, feels dishonest. That's not how I want to start a relationship. Being a virgin also amplifies my existing confidence issues that stem from my lack of dating experience. These things make me reluctant to pursue romantic opportunities when they arise.

At this point, I should emphasize that I do not expect sex to magically change me. I know I'll still have self-confidence issues and that the first several times I have sex are likely to be lackluster at best. However, it will eliminate a mental stumbling block in my dating efforts and allow me to escape the cultural connotations and perceptions of being a virgin without being deceptive. 

This brings me to my point. I know that I'm a good catch on paper. I'm in good shape, have a solid career, am decently sociable, etc. My virginity is probably my biggest negative. As such, the rational thing to do is to get rid of it. 

Instead of trying to find a relationship while dealing with this handicap I should aim for a one night stand or even look into hiring a prostitute (assuming that's possible to do in a way that is legal and doesn't encourage human trafficking). These actions do not appeal to me, but that doesn't seem like a good enough reason not to do them. My job doesn't particularly appeal to me either. I go to work because it is useful for achieving my goals and I view this course of action in the same way. It's achievable and eliminates something that I have identified as a significant problem in my life, therefore I should do it.

As you might guess from the fact that I'm making this post, I'm hesitant to commit to this plan. Mentally the logic seems sound to me, but my heart isn't in it. I feel like if I do this I'll regret it. My intellect and emotions are at an impasse. I'm hoping that someone can point out a significant flaw in my argument or construct a rational counterargument that shows that focusing on getting rid of my virginity is not the most effective way to increase my odds of finding a serious romantic relationship.

That said, do not take my desire to have this view changed as a sign it is loosely held. Platitudes about how ""there's someone for everyone"" or generic advice about how I ""just need to keep trying"" will not change my view and will likely be ignored.",4.0

As you probably know, gerrymandering allows a party (both Democrats and Republicans do this) to essentially determine election results ahead of time. There is no way this is healthy for a democracy like the US. Democracy is supposed to be free and fair, and deciding results ahead of time or altering maps to benefit yourself is definitely not fair.

Then we have the issue of an increasing willingness from the Republicans to reject all defeats as fraudulent (I personally find this hypocritical given their record of passing voter restriction laws). You might know that this is one of the things that put the US on the receding democracies list earlier this year. This wouldn’t concern me too much if it was just talk, but an increasing amount of “election fraud” lawyers are being appointed to election boards, which will probably allow them to overturn any defeats by refusing to certify the election.

So these are my two top concerns with US democracy, especially the second one. I guess this is why the US is a “flawed democracy” and not a full democracy like many other countries and why it is classified as a receding democracy this year.

837,t3_r15w3i,CMV: The make a wish foundation is bad and we should not contribute to it,"The make a wish foundation basically takes terminally ill kids and grants them a wish, like going to Disney world or being a fireman for a day. It's a bit of an oversimplification, but that's the jist. They do this by spending money from donations/fundraising. I think this is a terrible idea, and people who feed into it are wrong for doing so.

Reason 1: That money/time/resources/manpower/etc could be spent on better causes. There are all sorts of discussions as to what is the pound-for-pound most effective use of money when it comes to charities and such, and I cannot tell you what is the best way to spend it. However, the make a wish foundation is obviously not at the top or anywhere close. Let's say, conservatively, that the make a wish foundation takes $10k and sends a terminally ill 9yo girl to disney world. That same $10k could be used to save numerous (likely dozens or more) sick kids in other parts of the world. There are many examples of this.

Reason 2: Some of you won't like this, but hear me out. Those kids are fucked anyway. Don't get me wrong, it's a horrible tragedy, it's heartbreaking, and seeing an innocent child suffer is awful. But if you have the choice of making a doomed kid happy, or making a suffering-but-not-doomed kid healthy again the choice is obvious. People are blinding themselves with their sentiment by going ""aaawwwwww"" when they see the little bald girl at Disney world, probably because they're not confronted with a sick or starving kid in a harsher part of the world.

838,t3_r14zzc,CMV: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again… democracy simply doesn’t work.,"Don’t worry this isn’t some “having a dictator is is great” post.

I’ve always had the feeling that democracy is a great system of government when populism is kept under control. Very often “the people” need to be told what is good for them, they need guided and sometimes told what to do. 

While democracy is great in that it keeps the powerful from resting on their laurels and it breaks dynasty’s (to some extent) I do feel that it works best when the popular views are largely ignored in favour of the experts and well intentioned elites.

Overall I would say that “a person is smart but people are dumb panicky animals” (I fully include myself in that assessment as part of the people). So my view would that government should be run by “persons” not the “people”. Too many people and I feel you get subpar leaders with poor agendas. The experts should be allowed to “get on with it” to some degree without people jumping in with idiotic and foolish views.

I’m aware that this makes me an elitist and I do worry that I’m wrong to think this way.

Things that would change my view:
-Evidence that the golden days of ignoring the populations foolishness are in fact rose tinted specs 
- evidence of better social advancement under periods of populism 

Change my view.

Edit: some commenters have mentioned that my title, while meant to be a joke quote from the simpsons is setting the wrong tone. My view is not that democracy is bad but that in the representative version of democracy we elect experts to represent us.

Shouldn’t there be at least a little restriction to keep people safe? I know you could argue that we should just get a better mental health system to prevent people from using guns in a bad way in the first place, but there will ALWAYS be people like that no matter how mentally-oriented our society is. And if everyone was mentally stable, we wouldn’t need the guns for anything. It’s a paradox. Besides that, though, I wouldn’t wanna live in a society where gunfire is heard every 30 seconds. And if everyone has a gun, people WILL get killed unjustly. I think guns should only go to people who need them, such as the police force…. but NOT the one we have now. I cannot stress this enough. The police we have now are terrible. However, contrary to what other people say, I am not against the idea of law enforcement, I just think we need a better one.

844,t3_r0pepa,CMV: All rational adults have a right to die,"I believe that all rational agents have a right to bodily autonomy, and are allowed to alter or engage their own body in whatever way they see fit so long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others. This would somewhat exclude young children, infants, and animals which is why we do certain things without their consent, and I'm not going to defend that parties with limited rationality have a right to die.

To elaborate, the right to bodily autonomy would include a right to end one's life on their own terms because that is just a person exercising control over their body, and it doesn't violate the rights of anyone else. 

To clarify, a lot of suicides can be irrational. But I don't think suicide is ever immoral, unless perhaps if someone's dependant on you. 

Potential objections:

&gt;Wanting to die is a sign of mental illness, and thus irrationality. So no one has the right to die

Why is it irrational to want to die though? It is true that humans on average will value their own lives, but I don't think it follows from this that they therefore ought to value their own lives. Why is it always in one's self-interest to live?

&gt;You don't have a right to someone's labor, so you don't have a right to something like euthanasia or assisted suicide

I don't disagree with this, however, I still think people should at least have the option to go see a doctor for the chance of receiving assisted suicide. People still have a right to at least associate themselves in consensual relationships where they get a say, so why can't a doctor and a patient engage in such a consensual relation? I don't think doctors should be fired for refusing to deliver a certain type of care, but this is still compatible with saying that the state should lift certain restrictions. 

&gt;People who genuinely want to die will find ways to die without assisted suicide

I don't know if completely remember the objection correctly, but I'll respond to this statement anyways. Yes, people may end up finding other ways to die if they're desparate, but I don't see how it follows that we need to maintain a restriction on something like assisted suicide. People still have a right to engage in certain consensual relations. They should have certain positive freedoms. Why would we need to limit their options? Now if the point of this objection is trying to say that it's useless to lift the restriction because people will just use other methods of killing themselves instead, then this arguably seems false. People will no longer have to use certain methods which are less successful or have a higher risk for leaving them disabled, and they also have an incentive to not commit suicide in public areas which will traumitize more people. Granted, in an assisted suicide scenario, you're probably still affecting the doctor mentally, but you're still traumitizing less people in that setting. 

Plus, the uselessness of lifting a regulation which infringes on bodily autonomy doesn't thereby follow that we shouldn't life that regulation.

&gt;Recognizing the right to die will lead to more irrational suicides and will lead to abuse

I think certain policies could be enacted to prevent irrational suicides. For healthy adults who want to kill themselves, there can be a waiting period put in place to give them time to think about whether they actually want to kill themselves. For adults who are chronically or mentally ill, I would rather they don't have a waiting period if they are in lots of suffering and want to get rid of it.",62.0

846,t3_r0kgn2,"CMV: The problem with modern social movements isn't that they're wrong, it's that they want to be taken seriously and it's asking too much for most people","TLDR: Being easy-going but focused on the mission is way more effective than being angry all the time 

Part 1: People have a limit to how many things they can care about. Compassion fatigue is a real thing. The modern world has access to the best and worst that is happening everywhere due to the internet. We evolved to handle a certain amount of tragedy and injustice based on relatively small groups. Let's say 1 out of 10 people are suffering tragedy at any given time (please don't bust my balls on the number, just follow my concept here) and we're equipped to handle maybe 5 tragedies at a time and still give a shit. But when you hear about all the tragedies from millions/billions of people there is just too much for anyone to care about them all. The same is true of injustices - the world is too big and complex so history has led us to a place where injustice is all over. As time progresses often injustices improve but not always, and some get worse.

Part 2: Enter modern social causes (race, autism, LGBT, sexism, mental health, disabilities, etc etc). It's true that you sometimes get some religious nutjob or stubborn asshole that insists on calling a transgender woman ""Mike"" because that was her birth name and it blows up into some viral thing online. And that's bad, really bad. But it's not that frequent for most of us, we're just constantly hearing about it (refer to part 1). The much more common issue which is driving the animosity between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" is that the ""haves"" just don't take them seriously enough and the ""have nots"" want to be taken seriously.

Part 3: These social movements should strive to not take themselves so seriously, which will make it much easier for the rest of the people to accept their demands. I'm not suggesting that gay people stop having pride parades or anything like that. But when a joke (even a distasteful joke) is blown out of proportion, then people rally behind them it causes much more animosity. You're not talking the joker's language. I personally avoid joking about black people because of the social consequences, but I'd love to feel free to crack vulgar jokes about them for the same reason I have fun joking about everyone (including Mexicans culture, which is my heritage) and have fun when people joke about me (even for being Mexican).

Core of my view: We would get much more bang for our buck as a society by encouraging people to have thick skin and be courageous about facing their feelings, while fighting the injustice, than we will with constant outrage. Many people are motivated by their anger, but it's an unreliable and often indiscriminate way to fight. Far better for honor and courage to drive you. The constant outrage just becomes a mildly irritating white noise, and the righteous anger that activists are driven by is seductive. I've been made fun of for being Mexican by friends and been straight up insulted by strangers (as well as those same friends). Having thick enough skin to deal with it gracefully is just so much more powerful than freaking out.

848,t3_r0i5o8,CMV: There is no rational argument for the significant downscaling of Nuclear Energy,"This post is about the trend in countries like Germany and France, which see them shutting down their nuclear plants in favor of wind, solar, hydroelectric and god forbid natural gases/carbon fuels. The reason I think this is happening is over safety concerns and a bad rep that nuclear energy has because of a handful of nuclear crises like Chernobyl and in Japan. However the breakup as I see it is as follows:

1. Safety concerns 
This is an irrational fear because nuclear radiation sounds scary, but statistically nuclear energy has caused less deaths per kilo Watt hour than wind, hydro and waaay less than carbon fuels. Additionally crises like Chernobyl and Fukushima have been shown to be a result of govt negligence and building on disaster prone land, which while not fully avoidable is manageable. Also it's not like France and Germany are doing this for disaster prone areas they doin it all over.  

2. Environmental concerns
Nuclear produces a waste that is scary and hard to treat yes. But it is exceptionally well contained and can be stored until we find a way to reliably treat it in the future. Compare this to the hundreds and thousands of deaths minimum caused directly due to carbon emissions or even the significant environmental damage causes by hydro dams or the significant damage to aviary life caused by wind power. I'm not saying nuclear is better, but it is certainly not worse than the alternatives. The UN confirms that nuke energy accounts for a quarter of the worlds clean energy. 

3. Economics and Cost
Nuclear Energy is more costly to build, true. But it is much more sustainable and profitable in the long term. A newly built plant is estimated to outperform even natural gas electricity in cost after 20 years. 20 years seems long but we are talking about grids and sources that will last for a very very long time.

849,t3_r0hpk8,CMV: There isn't much value in discussing if we think pedophiles are bad and deserve to be punished. At this point it's a tool used by conspiracy theorist to push their agenda,"Let me just start this post by saying: I think pedophilia and sex trafficking should be illegal. And I'm willing to bet &gt;99% of all people (in America at least) agree with this. And the great news is: they are! Despite this, in the past week I have seen multiple bumper stickers saying things like: ""The only good pedophile is a dead one"" and ""#savethechildren"". Sex trafficking and pedophilia is discussed ad nauseam on the news and on social media.

But everyone in society agrees on this, why do people feel the need to say it constantly? Like I have never seen someone with a bumper sticker that says ""I don't support murders"" or like ""robbery is bad"". It's implied that you are opposed to murder or robbery, it's only important to speak up if you are in the very small minority that supports these things. Otherwise everyone will assume you are just like everyone else and think these things are bad.

Maybe this argument could be applied to a lot of different things that people generally agree upon but still want to talk about a lot, but with pedophilia and sex trafficking I see people 1. Extremely heated about it and 2. This passion being weaponized by extremist groups to recruit new members. Look at how the QAnon conspiracy dragged Tom Hanks, the Clintons, and dozens of others names through the mud with no/minimal evidence of any wrong doing. I think ironically this opposition to pedophilia is almost net harmful to the US right now and if everyone just chilled out and let the justice system or the police or the mental institutions handle this problem we would all be way better off.

But somehow, some people still believe otherwise and I genuinely can't understand their point of view.

Kyle was there trying to put out fires and distribute first aid. He actually supports the BLM movement, he just wanted to help his community from this violent mob of thugs burning everything in sight - as any sane American should do when they see such chaos. And while he doesn't primarily live there that doesn't matter. Some people unironically say ""he should be in jail for murder because he crossed state lines"". In America, as a matter of fact, you are legally allowed to go to all 50 states.

He was in his rights to own a gun because of the barrel length and I'm sure anyone rushing into such a dangerous environment like that would want a gun. Cops carry guns. He only shot those rioters in self-defense. And if he didn't, then why did he run from them? Why did he run? If he was really there wanting to shoot them, looking for trouble, why did he run? Shooting them down was his last resort. It was in self defense. He would have died that night if he didn't shoot back.

The legal case against him was so empty the prosecutors had to use unprofessional and borderline illegal evidence. They literally brought up video games, I'm not kidding. Then there are the tards on MSNBC painting this out to be a racial issue despite Kyle supporting BLM and every single person in this whole case being white. Everyone shot, Kyle, the attournies, the prosecutor, and the judge are all white. 

 I think the entire trial was fair, the verdict was absolutely correct, and am glad Rittenhouse is free. Not one single person has been able to bring up one valid point against him since the trial concluded so I wanna see if the... quirky intellectual of Reddit have an answer.

851,t3_r0h61e,"CMV: The idea that there ""should not be billionaires"" is hopelessly flawed","If I understand correctly, the basic issue with billionaires existing are generally as follows:

* Humans chose to arrange society in its current shape, and thus all poor people who exist or billionaires who exist represent a conscious policy choice that we take and continue to take, by not choosing to arrange our institutions and laws another way.
* Billionaires have undue influence on politics, distorting the democratic process with ads, lobbying and campaign donations.
* Billionaires only exist because they exploit their workers. Ask ""why does billionaire X have so much money?"" and the answer is usually ""because all of his employees that created most of the value of his company are paid less than fair wages for their labor, and the surplus value they generate is extracted and goes to billionaire's pockets.""
* Even if there are some ""good"" billionaires like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, who have pledged to eventually give all of their money to charity, and have already given a significant amount of their wealth to charitable causes - they are bad because they are undemocratic in how they spend their money. Maybe the people of the world didn't want or need Bill Gates' malaria vaccines, and if they had been allowed a vote would have chosen for him to go after some other societal or global problem.
* Billionaires waste massive amounts of resources with vanity projects like Space X.
* Billionaires are responsible for climate change.

I'm going to agree with some of those, and disagree with others. But I'm only going to address two points in this post:

**Billionaires spend their money in an undemocratic way**

Yes, and this is a generally a good thing.

It is useful to have checks and balances in society, and having people with lots of power outside of the government is a good check on government.

Malcolm X in his speech [Message to the Grass Roots](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/speeches-african-american-history/1963-malcolm-x-message-grassroots/) talks about how the Civil Rights movement of the 60's was funded.

&gt; A philanthropic society headed by a white man named Stephen Currier called all the top civil-rights leaders together at the Carlyle Hotel. And he told them that, “By you all fighting each other, you are destroying the civil-rights movement. And since you’re fighting over money from white liberals, let us set up what is known as the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership. Let’s form this council, and all the civil-rights organizations will belong to it, and we’ll use it for fund-raising purposes.”

And later on he talks about the money rich White elites were funneling into the civil rights movement:

&gt; Once they formed it, with the white man over it, he promised them and gave them $800,000 to split up between the Big Six [Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, John Lewis, A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young]; and told them that after the march was over they’d give them $700,000 more. A million and a half dollars — split up between leaders that you’ve been following, going to jail for, crying crocodile tears for.

Now, Malcolm X's speech is criticizing this fact, and arguing against it.

However, I think this is a good thing. In a racist, segregated country state power would never voluntarily bow to the desires of black people for greater representation in society. The only thing that was able to oppose power was a grass roots of the underclass working together with power centers outside the racist, seggregationist government.

Representative democracy in a society built on a number of unjust hierarchies can never dismantle itself - only power centers outside of the government can do that.

And direct democracy is no salve for this either. Imagining that a world where 90% of people are white and racist, and 10% is black and lower class, how would a majority ever come to back the civil rights movement, if not for the combination of a grass roots and rich angel investors? Rich people are a check against the people's own worst devils as well.

**Society would be better off if resources were distributed more equally**

On the face of it, this seems to be true. [America's GDP per capita is](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263601/gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita-in-the-united-states/) was ~$65,000 in 2019, while [America's median individual income is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States) $35,977.

Wouldn't it be better if everyone was getting the fruits of their labor, and benefiting equally from the surplus that the division of labor produces?

However, I don't think this is a sensible stopping point.

Surely, if we don't believe in the American 1% having too much wealth, we should also take a look at American wealth on the whole. America is one of the wealthiest countries to ever exist. That means there's intense inequality between the United States and the rest of the world.

[World GDP per capita in 2019 was](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/gdp-per-capita) $11,417.

I don't think there's a good argument that separates the ""billionaires shouldn't exist because of wealth inequality"" from ""American wealth [inevitably in the top ~20% of the world] shouldn't exist.""

Taking this idea to its logical conclusion, we should actually make virtually all Americans worse off, in order to make a great portion of the Global South better off.

Maybe some people are willing to accept this idea, but I think if you asked the average American, ""would you like your yearly salary to be $11,000, if it would make the rest of the world better off?"" very few people would actually be saintly enough to take the deal.

I would rather make the world into an Eco-Socialist Utopia where we sustainably bring everyone to an American middle class level of material wealth and consumption, than make the world into a dystopia where everyone only gets $11,000 a year and is equally poorly off. Growth is almost as important as the level of inequality of a society, and it's better to sustainably grow the economy than to force half the world to exist in squalor. And currently, I think the engines of capitalism still need to grow the global GDP per capita a little longer before we can achieve that Eco-Socialist Utopia.",12.0
852,t3_r079eh,"CMV: Regardless of your political views, people in general need to take more responsibility for where they spend their money","I believe that actions speak louder than words. If you are aware of and complain about the practices of a corporation - or even just a small business, I suppose - but you continue to spend your money there, then what you’re really saying is that the value of those goods and services outweigh the cons (such as underpaid employees, environmental issues, sexual harassment, etc). You’re sending the message to company and the market that what they are doing is ultimately okay in your eyes.

This is based on the assumption that you have the ability to spend your money somewhere else, which I think is true much more often than not. After all, most things aren’t strictly necessary to buy.

Edit: As I’ve already awarded deltas for these points, I need to clarify that I’m talking about picking the least objectionable options you’re aware of when you shop.. not turning yourself into a saint. If our culture was more intentional with the way it spends its money, the world would be a better place.. would it not?

Edit 2: I’m expanding this to be not just where you shop, but also what you buy.

And I’m narrowing the focus to say you should focus on spending your money in a way that best reflects your personal values, within your power. You may be forced to prioritize.

Edit 3: I want to say that I don’t vote because there are a lot of things about both Republicans and Democrats that I detest. I live in a state that will be blue no matter what I vote for, and I’m moving to a state that will be red no matter what I vote for. Those of you arguing that your actions have no effect, I would argue that collectively they have more of a direct impact than voting does. The market includes everyone, and it adjusts to the way everyone spends. Voting leaves large segments of the population unhappy.

To be clear, if you feel strongly that one side represents your interests better than the other, you should vote.

853,t3_r02c3e,CMV: It’s bigoted to describe certain suspects but not others in news stories,"I’m not sure how common it is around the US but you can usually tell when a crime is committed by a minority by the lack of description given. My local news will give a description of white people no problem even when it doesn’t necessarily matter. But when it’s a minority group it’s extra vague. 

For example, there was a story about a woman who was harassing some kids to get off the sidewalk riding bikes and spit on them. She was arrested and taken to jail, they had her name and age but for some reason had to make it known she was white. It wasn’t really relevant 

Meanwhile, there was a story about a group of 3 “massage therapist” who were meeting people at hotels and robbing them. the clients who came forward gave a description but the news only reported “3 women about 5’10”-6ft tall posing as masseuses”. This spree went on for another week until they were finally caught and it turned out to be 3 black transwomen. The people who came forward said they gave this information 

Another kinda goofy one was where the guy was caught on camera robbing a store and they described everything about him, down to a bandage on his leg, excluding his race. 

So how it’s pretty easy to tell when some crime was committed by a nonwhite person because there’s no mention of race at all.

I think this In itself is bigoted and dangerous. I don’t know how effective descriptions actually are, but I’d bet they’re far less effective leaving out major descriptions like this as well. Just put relevant descriptions in all articles or none

I have heard arguments that it is too convoluted. I have also heard others say that according to my thought process, everything is nuclear as the Sun is behind our weather, life on this planet etc.

To that I say, nay. Tisn't convoluted at all. In fact, it is less convoluted than the conventional way of harnessing nuclear energy.

Solar: Nuclear -&gt; Light -&gt; Electrical (3 steps)

Conventional: Nuclear -&gt; Thermal -&gt; Mechanical -&gt; Electrical (4 steps)

It takes more energy conversions from nuclear to electrical in an ordinary nuclear plant than a solar plant.

In addition, it is also less convoluted in what has to be done to convert it. With solar plants, you install solar panels. In a nuclear plant, you have to use the thermal energy to boil water, superheat the steam, use said steam to drive a turbine, transmit the mechanical energy from the turbine to the generator via a reduction gear, and then you finally get electrical energy.

Edit:

I am not saying that the word ""solar"" should be banned. I think it should just fall under the category of nuclear.

Squares are rectangles. We refer to squares as ""squares"" instead of ""rectangles""  because we have enough information to make that more specific classification.

However its important to put things into scale - these initiatives are like using a spoon to get the water out of a sinking boat. 30 millions pounds of trash out of the ocean, but equivalents amount of trash is deposited into the ocean within merely a few hours.

Based on this the real purpose of this movements must be publicity and raising awareness of such issues, but I think even in this regard they either fall flat or are actually counterproductive. The real solution should be to reduce the amount of waste we produce by cutting them off at the source - companies that mass produce single use plastics. Emphasizing ocean cleanup pushes responsibility away from these companies and frames this problem as ""everyone's problem we should collectively solve"".

858,t3_qzucjs,CMV: CO2 Emission per capita is really useless and misleading metric,"It blows my mind that CO₂ Emission per capita is a metric still often presented to single out a country which is doing good or bad on their CO₂ emissions. 

Let's take a look at what this formula consists of:

    CO₂ Emission per capita = total emission (metric tons) per year / country population

From simply mathematical point of view this rather simple formula contains one pretty disturbing property. The higher the population, the lower (better) is the resulting number and *vice versa*. It almost encourages overpopulation by its nature. 

Now, as you probably immediately realized, in real world, throwing pure mathematics aside, higher population also usually equals higher emission, and lower population equals lower emission, so everything balances itself out and the with country's population increasing, the total emissions increase, and this formula still shows a relevant and describing number.

Except it does not. We are living in a finite three dimensional world, with fixed amount of habitable surface, a certain volume of atmosphere and a constant sized planet. Nowhere in that formula is any of that taken into account. It's a ratio, which only includes one relevant component (CO₂ emissions, which hurt our enviroment in excess) and completely irrelevant and arbitrary number of ""population"". In no way is a population count relevant in a calculation which is supposed to show how much is environment being hurt. **And even less is increased population size somehow supposed to remedy increased CO**₂ **output.** Let me prove it to you by simple example: 

Country A produces 10 metric tons of CO₂ per year and has 1,000 people

    10 / 1000 = 0.01


Country B produces 1000 metric tons of CO₂ per year and has 100,000 people.

    1000/100000 = 0.01

They both are given the same ""score"" of 0.01 in this case, while Country B produces 100 times more of CO₂.  


I would assume that someone might try to argue that this is proportionally correct and fair, but this argument ignores the fact that the real world and environment does not care what proportions or ratios you use, it cares about **total emission** only. Somehow this ratio makes it okay to emit as much gas as the country wants, as long as they balance this increase with population growth (which itself is bad for environment for many other reasons than just extra CO₂).

Ask yourself this: Do you think it's reasonable that population increase is a solution to excessive CO₂ emissions? If not, then I have a better alternative below:

# What metric I think is more fair than CO₂ Emission per capita

I think the fairest and most reasonable metric is 

    total emission (metric tons) per year / country surface area

Why country surface area? Think about it, country surface is constant. It's realistically not possible to manipulate it, and it has a real connection to amount of available atmosphere due to geometric properties of a planet and thus has a direct link to the problem at hand: CO₂ amount in atmosphere. 

Each country would be responsible for X% of atmosphere, based on how much land they have in a our world. Our clever scientists would calculate a reasonable and sustainable CO₂ total emission level and then divide it between countries based on this percentage. If country does not produce the CO₂ to fill their limit, they can sell their extra emission rights to other countries just as today. 

In the future the total amount of available CO₂ emissions can be adjusted based on how the world is doing. If there's enough technology or nature to collect the CO₂ from the air, then the output levels could be increased world wide, but the ratios between countries would still stay constant based on their land size.",1.0

I argue that “the most wonderful time of the year” shouldn’t start December 1st. It should begin in the middle of November, more specifically right before Thanksgiving. The sooner the Christmas tree goes up the longer you get to enjoy it! I’m convinced this is the reason Disneyland Christmas starts on November 12th. 

In college, I loved coming back home to Christmas lights strung up in the neighborhoods and seeing Christmas trees in the windows. It was a good reminder of how special home is to me. On Thanksgiving, everyone enjoyed the Christmas tree and decorations along with the cozy, warm, joyous feeling radiated throughout the house. The decorations always seemed to make everyone feel a little happier and cheerier in a time when things were stressful and hectic. 

Logistically, decorating earlier makes it a lot easier to find decorations instead of waiting to the last minute when a lot of things are sold out. It’s always better to prepare sooner rather than later to create the most desired home Christmas aesthetic. Slow and steady always wins the race.

863,t3_qzp18o,CMV: The Marxist labor theory of value doesn't adequately account for fungibility,"Background on me before I explain my thoughts. Social democrat, well versed on Marx and leftist implementation ideas like anarcho-communism and antiwork. Tech startup founder as my day job. I'm aware this isn't a novel line of reasoning, but I've also not yet seen an adequate response

So my startup makes construction software for drastically speeding up project change order management and dispute resolution. I've been contemplating the ethics of my own profit versus our customers (and their workers) and my own employees. I focus on this example because I think we add value in a fairly straightforward way - use us and your margins go up. Assume for a second that there are only 3 parties in this discussion:

1. A perfectly organised workers co-operative construction company

2. Software developers employed by me 

3. Me and my co-founder

The labor theory of value would hold that I'm entitled to more compensation than the others in this equation by a bit. The exact amount can be argued about, but a moderate value probably. Of the revenue the software my company develops generates, the lion's share should be distributed amongst my workers and the workers of the construction company. The question, of course, is to what degree I created that value versus my workers and the workers at the construction company. Certainly, without the labor of the construction workers, my software developers would have no process to make more efficient. Without me, my software developers would likely work on a problem that adds much less value. 

To bring in my title's thesis, the labor theory of value makes a lot of sense for the construction workers. The value of construction is the guys actually on the ground throwing bricks around. The quality and value of the construction project is directly proportional to the amount of people and time spent throwing bricks around. It doesn't require much creativity to know what to do to achieve that value. If someone is stood there siphoning off most of the result, arguably it might well be theft from the workers.

For the software developers, they need a certain amount of creativity to be efficient, but efficient software developers are essentially fungible. What they're building is very very important, and an extremely proficient software developer can produce absolutely no value as the result of a lot of labor in a way that it's much harder for a construction worker to. They're entitled to some stake for sure, but the exact same small development team working on two different problems could revolutionise the world or make something nobody wants. And choosing between ideas is very difficult.

And that brings it to me. I will either make absolutely no money, or boatloads of money, and that result is determined directly by how good the ideas I produce are. The technology to make what my company makes has been around for 20+ years, but nobody has organised a team and gotten to it until now. I'm not inventing the wheel, but I have invented a small, logical progression that makes the construction industry more efficient. 

It remains to be seen whether it actually provides value on a large scale, but whether the result is 1x or 10000x what it is now, the influence rests not much on the construction workers, a little bit on my programmers, and a lot on me. The fact that tiny decisions that don't take me much time but could be the difference between extremely large value and small value is measurable labor doesn't make much sense.

Physical labor creates additative physical value. Work twice as much, produce twice as much value. Value is transparently a function of labor.

Intellectual labor multiplies physical value. The value created by the intellectual is proportional to the amount of physical labor done, but it doesn't require any additional ongoing labor by the intellectual to continue creating that value. It doesn't make the intellectual a parasite to siphon off perhaps 10 or 20% of that additional value. He's not stealing from the laborer, he created a ton of value for the laborer and is taking a cut.

Economically, there is a quite a well developed argument ([example](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-low-can-americas-birth-rate-go-before-its-a-problem/)) that a nation with a declining birth rate must find a way to sustain an older population. A large portion of Europe is already going through this challenge and the U.S. will have to do the same. I'm not going to spend much time into this one because it's already spoken. But I think there are some understated consequences (particularly with fellow progressives) that I want to pose a question: *if there are less children coming into the world, will the infrastructure of health care and education for this next generation get better or worse over time?* To find a potential answer to this question, I want to discuss **who** are those that are going to be making up the childbearing population.

While trends are declining across most demographics, births are higher and more sustained among those who are more diverse in the U.S., particularly among Native American, Hispanic and African American HHs ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr012-508.pdf)). These HH's also correlate to HH's of lower income. There already is a large disparity among health care and educational opportunities across these populations, and I think this gap will grow due to the historic and growing imbalance of resources.

My prediction from this difference is that there will be domino effects on future inequality and put further pressure on public spending, making us worse off - particularly women of color. Starting with maternal care: health care systems in wealthier communities will be having less infants to take care of, but quality of care in these communities will not decline along the same rate. Conversely, female health services and maternal wards in more vulnerable communities ([which are already abysmal](https://www.kff.org/report-section/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health-an-overview-issue-brief/)) will have more demand for health services and be more strained for quality care.

This effect can then extend in other areas such as education such as the funding and infrastructure of public vs. private schooling, housing, and nutritional outcomes. Similar to the work from home and remote schooling trends in COVID, the historical imbalance of resources leaves disadvantaged families to experience further strain, while more affluent households can maintain or adapt to new circumstances - thus exacerbating social inequality in health and wealth. These circumstances will continue to fuel powder keg changes into the political and social dynamic in this country, weakening communities and further social ties.

In both time and money, the choice to not have children is an incredible privilege in the modern world.  Having children in the modern world has become increasingly difficult and burdensome. I didn't even get into the philosophical or moral points - which we can debate. But from a purely socioeconomic POV we need individuals (especially **who can** **afford** to have kids) to have kids.

Instead of just talking bout the outrageous costs, we should work on improving the social fabric to adapt to the needs of the modern caregiver (parental leave, child care, public education, extending support beyond the traditional nuclear family) that can strengthen families and communities to raise the floor of inequality and reduce the burden for future generations. Looking at historic and current trends, I believe a childfree movement only exacerbates it.",0.0
865,t3_qzoa0y,CMV: it doesn't make sense to refer to Taiwan/ROC as the legitimate China as opposed to the PRC,"The fact that Westerners disagree with the PRC's policies is not a sufficient reason to recognize or not recognize them as a country. What matters is the actual role that country has as an interlocutor on the world stage. For better or for worse, the PRC represents the vast, vast majority of Chinese people and territory and viewing Taiwan as the legitimate government over those masses is not only silly in an aesthetic sense but betrays a somewhat colonialist mindset. It means that legitimacy as a country depends on whether your mode of functioning aligns with that of the West or not, independently of any defacto authority you might have. And that the views of the mainland Chinese population itself either does not matter, or is only in support of the current government because they are unable to form their own opinions, and would otherwise be only too eager to form a Western-friendly democracy similar to Taiwan if given the chance.

**To me this is a separate issue from whether you support Taiwan/ROC in a practical sense or not, or whether you want the West to prevent its annexation by the PRC, or whether you recognize Taiwan as its own country or not**. **My view is only about considering the PRC itself as non-legitimate**. Of course, with the PRC's One China policy other countries are forced to choose between the two, but in that case I consider picking the PRC the only reasonable choice both from a practical and theoretical standpoint. In other words, to do business and conduct diplomacy successfully you want to be conversing with the government that englobes the actual China as opposed to some government in exile that has no real authority except over an island, and in terms of what legitimacy is supposed to entail the PRC's claim is so much stronger that it precludes debate for the most part.",0.0

867,t3_qzmbrf,"CMV: Anyone who claims to espouse a principle of ""do no harm"" must be an environmentalist and a conscientious consumer","

I have seen some right-wing people (ie, people who lean conservative, neoliberal or libertarian) argue against regulation and redistribution by invoking in a ""do no harm"" principle: _""As long as you harm no one, everyone should be free to do whatever they want and has no obligation to help others.""_

I do not agree with this principle, but it has its merits. The problem, however, is that _no one follows this principle_.

In a modern economy, _everyone does harm_. Possibly in several ways, but most obviously in the form of _pollution_. Pollution causes plenty of harm to other humans and nonhumans. It is delayed and diffuse and thus not immediately intuitive, but any intelligent and educated person can see that it is harm nonetheless.

Most of us do other kinds of harm as well. There is the tremendous suffering inflicted upon animals by conventional modern food production, and we may unwittingly support the exploitation of workers in slave-like conditions in poor countries. But even if you somehow reject those, my first point still stands. Also notice that even if you don't believe in climate change (and you should believe in climate change), there are other important forms of pollution, such as air pollution.

My point is that if you claim to espouse a ""do no harm"" principle, you need to be very aware of the harm you _do_ cause and make a substantial effort to minimise it and/or compensate for it. That or be a hypocrite. (And I strongly suspect that many right-wing people choose that last option.)",0.0
868,t3_qzlq44,"CMV: The media was intentionally misleading the public on the Rittenhouse case for profit and potentially to stir up more civil unrest after the case was over, regardless of what the outcome was, knowing how divided everyone was as a result of their intentional misinformation.","#==EDIT==

#I was not going to even mention my political views as I don’t think they are relevant, nor my views on this case, though I did lightly touch on it a bit, however I’m getting a tremendous amount of accusations from people saying that I’m just bias towards conservative media and therefore I think he’s a hero. Allow me to set the record straight: I am left center politically, I do not watch conservative media, prior to watching raw court footage (the only source I have on this) I was inclined to believe he was probably guilty. I do not believe him to be a hero. 


#I do not believe this is a prerequisite for believing he had the right to defend himself. Arguments about the media leaving out a video about him allegedly being involved in a domestic abuse incident sometime in the past is not in any way relevant to this case. If you can’t understand why I’m not going to bother explaining it. This is not the same thing as condoning domestic abuse. 


So I did not follow the Rittenhouse case on the news. I don’t watch live news, I don’t watch streams, I tend to, in general, steer clear of this kind of stuff. 


My only real understanding of what was going on with the Rittenhouse case was the few threads I read on here and a couple clips I saw/heard from other peoples devices when I was present, other than the basics of what happened from back when it all actually happened. 


But as much as I tried to stay neutral, I formulated an opinion, though not a particularly firm one, admittedly. My initial opinion was that he was an absolute idiot for going to Kenosha to begin with armed with a gun, and was probably looking for trouble, and had no reason to go there as he didn’t even live in Wisconsin. And while he may have actually feared for his life in that moment, he probably should be found guilty because of his stupid decisions that lead him to be in that position in the first place. 


But curiosity and a desire for the truth got the best of me, and I went and watched archives of the full trial. And boy did angry people angry at the acquittal and the media misrepresent realty in a **major** way. But the most concerning issue here is that I actually think that many of the angry people on social media that want Rittenhouse in prison *aren’t even aware of how incredibly misinformed they are.* Because all they’ve seen is what CNN or their favorite social media reporter/influencer wants them to see, which paints a picture very different from reality. 


**They never mention that Rittenhouse had family and friends that live in Kenosha.**


**They never mention that he was employed in Kenosha.**

 - To both of these points, they make it seem like he’s over there blindly and had no reason to be there other than to be in the fray and incite fear and hostility in rioters. 


**They never show pictures of him the previous day scrubbing graffiti off the walls of the high school down the road from where the shooting took place.**


**They never show footage of him walking around with his medical bag asking people if they need medical assistance, yelling “friendly friendly friendly” to assure everyone that he’s not hostile.**


**And most importantly, they never show any of the footage that clearly shows from multiple angles all three of the people he shot, and the fact that he was running away from 2 of them, lunged at by one before cornered between vehicles and a mob of people while his weapon was being grabbed, and the other two he was hit in the head and knocked down while being advanced on by a mob of people. He was sitting down flat on his ass while a man charged him and pointed a gun point blank at his head, and Kyle gave him a chance to retreat. And did not shoot numerous other people, who did retreat.**


This is clear, implicit bias by left wing media by intentionally omitting information they most certainly had access to. I can only assume this was done with the intent of riling up the American public for profit, and quite potentially in hopes of stirring more civil unrest and riots in the wake of whatever outcome was to come of this highly charged and politicized trial.

871,t3_qzf123,CMV: Nuclear power is the best source of energy in the world who's bad reputation comes from human error,"Nuclear energy gets some bad press, but most of this is unfounded. Nuclear energy has unfortunately suffered some pretty large PR disasters in the past (Chernobyl, Fukushima etc) and this has understandably shaken public trust in its safety. Despite its bad rep, nuclear energy has consistently been shown to be orders of magnitude safer than most other methods of electricity generation.

Chernobyl had too much red tape. Fukushima was built on a fault line. The third was almost a disaster. Need I say more?
 
[Studies ](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh) have shown that nuclear energy causes just 0.07 deaths for every tera-watt hour of electricity generated. This is in comparison with 2.82 for gas, 18.43 for oil and 32.72 for coal. Nuclear power plants do not release any carbon dioxide during the course of energy generation and even accounting for CO2 emissions during construction, the emissions associated with nuclear energy are still 50 times lower than those associated with coal power and 30 times lower than those associated with coal mining and natural gas.

One often overlooked aspect of the pollution released by coal power is that ash released from burning coal often contains highly concentrated levels of thorium and urainium. [Studies ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/) have shown that exposure to the elevated levels of radioactive material present in coal ash has the result that people living in the vicinity of coal power stations experience radiation doses up to 200% greater than those living close by to nuclear power plants. Bizarrely enough, the radioactive waste produced by burning coal is actually more radioactive than the waste from nuclear power and yet there are no restrictions on coal ash simply being released into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy is a low carbon, low risk method of energy generation and has an essential part to play in the battle against climate change.

874,t3_qzagkx,CMV: Crypto currencies are useless and bad for the world,"I think crypto currencies are useless and poor investments. It is a currency, yet no one uses it as a currency. You can't use it to buy things around town or from major online stores. So, it's not actually a currency. People that use bitcoin and other crypto currencies are treating it like an investment - not an actual transaction. The only people who use crypto for currency are small time criminals like ransom ware hackers and other such people, but crypto isn't even good [for that](https://qz.com/1761343/bitcoin-money-laundering-is-a-classically-stupid-crime/). But how can you justify a holding and using currency that is primarily used to facilitate criminal activity?

People will never use bitcoin as an actual currency. Why? A two main reasons reasons. First, massive fluctuations in value. Crypto people go crazy when there is a tiny bit of inflation in the dollar and say that's why we need crypto, yet bitcoin has wild fluctuations where it doubles then halves in a matter of months. You simply cannot use something that volatile as a medium of exchange, it's impractical. And there is no government or entity controlling crypto prices. Crypto people point to this as a good thing, yet I'd rather have the fed and hundreds of the smartest economists in the country to maintain a stable rate of low inflation than be at the complete mercy of the market. And to top it off, bitcoin will ALWAYS be volatile because it is a limited supply. 

Second reason - what is money and why does it have value? It has value because enough people say it as money. The US government is the strongest government on earth and it guarantees the dollar. Taxes have to be paid in dollars. Who guarantees bitcoin? What is required to be paid in bitcoin? Nothing. 

So crypto currencies are just a place for speculation. People are trying to get in early on cryptos and get out before it crashes. That's all that's going on. There's no inherent value here because crypto will never be widely used as an actual currency. 

Finally, another reason why crypto is bad, it uses a ridiculous amount of energy to mine. This is unsustainable and bad for the world. First, it is generated excess demand for energy, leading to pollution, but without any societal benefits. This energy is just going towards keeping bitcoin going, which is only a means of speculation and nothing more. Second, it is helping fueling a shortage of computer chips, which can be used for actually useful purposes instead of mining bitcoin.

876,t3_qz9gpf,CMV: GPU and Console makers should be able to just charge what they're worth.,"I'm not deeply attached to this issue, its just something that always occurs to me when people complain about scalpers and shortages.  Very happy to be convinced otherwise, I don't know much about this stuff.

Also, I'll say at the outset that I think as a practical matter they couldn't do this because of the PR backlash.  But the backlash is misguided and unfortunate.

So if GPU and console makers were able to just sell the things for what they are worth (i.e. increasing the price a lot at least until shortages are alleviated) I think it would be best for everyone.

First, scalping no longer is profitable so no worries about that. 

Perhaps the companies could use the extra revenue to offer more money for components or whatever and it would help alleviate shortages more quickly.  You might say this is unlikely because greedy corporations etc etc but at least there's a CHANCE that the money gets reinvested instead of just going to scalpers.

The ""but then only rich people could buy them"" argument... I don't totally understand.  First, the price will go down eventually.  Second, the same logic applies to the scalper price.    Third,  wihtout raisign the price you end up with a few who have the luck (or who are willing to pay the price in time spent camping outside best buy or whatever) to get the thing at MSRP, and then everyone else is hosed.   Better to have the console go to the person for whom it is worth (e.g.) $1500 rather than have it go, by luck, to someone for whom it is only worth $600 (i.e. thats the max they would pay if they could).

877,t3_qz9f12,"CMV:CMV:The U.S is one of the worst countries to immigrate to for students, and not for obvious reasons.","Based on my experience and having talked to many people in a similar situation, I can without hesitation say that the U.S provides the least value for international students out of all the other popular destinations.

When people think ""U.S BaD dUrr"" they usually think of some bullshit reason like racism or whatever, that has not been my experience, I have never experienced racism during my stay here, not even once, the people are nice, friendly, you can ""be yourself"" to an extent that is usually not acceptable in your home country, it's easy to blend in and have a good time...so what's the problem?

The problem is that students are cash cows, have 0 viable paths to permanent residency, are extremely restricted and are set up in a way that when they complete their degree they are hard pressed to go back to their country.

Allow me to explain, basically, you cannot legally work as an international student (whereas you have limited hours off campus in many other countries), you need to get special permission to work a limited time in a field that's related to your program, fine, basically find an employer willing to hire your inexperienced ass or an internship that pays nothing and has you making coffee and scrolling through instagram the whole period you're with them.

You can't get financial aid, there are no career placements for international students, you have to pay bullshit fees for OPT authorization (Optional practical training, basically a work permit), wait for OPT, meanwhile look for someone willing to hire a foreigner, explain to them you can't work unless you have OPT, they move on to someone else, you get your OPT, now you have a grace period of two months to get everything in order or you're gone.

Tuition is batshit high, your only chance is to work at some restaurant washing dishes and doing deliveries during the winter cold all while being paid $8 an hour in a state with the highest minimum wage, your parents are expecting good things of you but you can barely manage paying rent and like, maybe pay some of the tuition off if you restrict your budget.

Your parents are now wondering how come you've been here in the U.S forever and you're barely able to pay rent, why no residency? Why aren't you sending them a little money to help them out just like they helped you out with the tuition fees? Because you motherflipping can't, you're unemployed, your visa's almost expired, you're waiting on a response from the 500 interviews you went to and you're already considering going back home defeated.

Oh but wait, you now find out that some immigrant family tried crossing the border to the U.S, they get separated, and are now being awarded $450,000 each, meanwhile you're bending over day in day out to barely survive. Don't get me wrong, good on them, but it absolutely destroys me to think that someone who's been following the rules, came in legally, is being hopeful towards the future, basically has all odds against him and is set up to have no option but to go back where he came from, meanwhile that undocumented guy is using someone else's social security number to work driving people around and is building something.

Let's not forget your childhood friend who barely passed highschool, managed to get in with a green card because he ""got lucky"" and hit the DV visa lottery jackpot.

Things finally turn around and you land a job, your employer is willing to sponsor you, albeit for a pay cut, then what does the U.S do? raise fees so that employers are deterred from ever sponsoring anyone, but still, this one's going through with it, and you're finally applying for H1B, but here's the catch, you only have 30% of your application being selected because for some reason it's still a lottery, but yours does get accepted somehow because your family's praying for you, then USCIS decides to send you continuous RFEs (Request for evidence) to the point where you just give up.

You've now used up most of your parents money, have barely any experience after graduating, and have no clear path in sight, and the only thing you managed to get during your stay is chronic depression and anxiety.

I love the US, I love that people are nice and friendly, but i wouldn't for the life of me recommend a single soul to ever think of applying here as a student unless a drastic change is made to allow people who come here legally, documented, a clear path to residency where they can contribute to the country in many ways and still live out their discount store American dream.",0.0
878,t3_qz6plt,CMV: Moral Egoism doesn't mean being a selfish asshole,"I would consider my moral system to be a form of egoism where I value the maximisation of my own happiness. I think when most people hear this they (understandably) assume ""oh so you're a selfish bastard then?"", however I don't think it really leads to this position.

There are sortof two pillars of the egosim, the first is the ""reciprocation of values and advocacy"" one. Basically I should act towards others the way I want them to act towards me, so to take two basic examples, if I don't kill, and advocate against killing, people will not kill me, and advocate against the kill of me. And if I let people do things they like that don't hurt anyone else, people will let me do things like that too. This would only really apply to beings capable of doing this sortof reciprocal values, which is probably every living human (note capable, not necessary those actually doing it).

The second pillar is where I feel like it gets a bit wishy washy and is why I'm making this post, because as much as I can't see an obvious hole in it, it feels super dumb when I say it out loud. Basically it goes as follows:

I feel natural empathy towards people, which means that I don't like it when they are in pain for example, as it makes me feel bad, so I would be against it, even if not condemning it was guaranteed not to have a ""reciprocated values"" negative effect on me. (So if I could kill someone without anyone ever finding out, I still would be against it rather than just indifferent).  
Now at first this sounds like ""bad things are things I don't like"", but it wouldn't quite be as I would want to make sure it didn't violate the first idea of the reciprocation. (i.e. I'm not going to condemn someone for doing something I just don't like but isn't hurting anyone, as they could turn that back on me).  

The reason it feels wishy washy is because I feel like I'm just adding in ""oh by the way things that I find uncomfortable are also morally bad"", which almost feels like cheating, but it seems to be consistent.

880,t3_qz51hj,CMV: Jurors should be given flow charts to help them arrive at verdicts which are correct according to the law,"Watching footage of a trial recently, I was struck by how badly information about the law was conveyed to the jurors.  Both the prosecution and defense made statements about the applicable laws which were at best confusing, and at worst just wrong.  There was disagreement regarding what instructions should be given to the jury, and the eventual instructions were long, verbose, and interrelated.

I understand that laws have to be written very precisely, which often causes them to be verbose.  However, there is no reason why the instructions need to be presented to the jury solely in the form of a screed of text.

Laws could be presented to the jury as a flow chart, which would allow them to focus on getting each detail of the charge correct rather than concerning themselves with the ""big picture"" or how various parts of the law interact with each other. All of the same semantics would be there, just connected with visual diagrams rather than grammatical clauses.

The flow charts wouldn't be just created as needed.  There are already offical handbooks of jury instruction ""patterns"" which judges use as a template.  An official set of flowcharts would need to be created in a similar vein.

Frankly, we could go further than this, and actually make flow charts the primary codification of the law.  This might help prevent legislators from making laws which have meanings different to what was intended.  It might also aid non-layers in their understanding of the law.

* It's not a view I hold strongly, but it niggles at me to think that there's a better way and we're not using it.  If my view changes I can be more happy with the status quo.

* Too expensive or difficult.  I believe consistent justice is worth great expense and effort.
* The judge also reads the instructions to the jury. This suffers from many of the same problems as written text, and maybe some other problems as well.

883,t3_qz3ok7,CMV: Halle Bailey should not have been cast as Ariel in the live-action remake of The Little Mermaid,"I know this is a topic that has been debated a lot since 2019. Now the movie has wrapped filming, I still have so many doubts about this casting just because I just love and care about this story so much…

First of all, I’m a huge Disney fan and I even worked in Disney's internal consulting team before. I’m not arguing this to bring shame on Disney. I’m arguing this because I sincerely wish the success of every Disney film. Secondly, I personally don’t have any negative opinions about Halle Bailey. She’s an excellent singer. I love the way how she interpreted Can You Feel the Love Tonight on Disney World 50. She definitely has the voice to become Ariel, but

Here are the reasons why I think Halle Bailey should not have been cast as Ariel:

* Culturally: The Little Mermaid is a story adapted from a Danish fairy tale, just like Mulan is adapted from a Chinese folk tale. That’s why the live-action remake of Mulan cast all Asian actors to complete the film. I won’t say there is no “political correctness” or “win-over Asian market” consideration in the casting for Mulan, but the casting shows the basic respect to the culture of the story. The kingdom underneath the ocean, the culture of pirates and sailing, those elements of the story clearly belong to Northern Europe. Just imagine casting an Asian girl for Tiana, I don’t think that will be an accurate, respectful representation of the black people culture in New Orleans.
* Commercially: The Little Mermaid animation has been such a classic. People who never even watched The Little Mermaid can easily identify Ariel. The anchoring effect of the animation Ariel is just so strong that it can easily trigger a huge backlash from the audience when Ariel is far from *the Ariel* they know in their life. The simple result of this backlash is people lost interest in the live-action, not buying the tickets, which leads to box-office bombs.
* Politically: I understand Disney is trying to create more diversity in the industry, and I fully support that. But Disney already has one black princess that has not been remade—Tiana. Why not cast Halle Bailey in that classic? I’m sure she will do a great job on that. If Disney is not happy about Tiana, it can surely create another black princess, just like creating Moana as a tribute to the Polynesian. I think Disney absolutely has the capacity and ability to do that.  

I’m hoping to hear other people’s opinions on this and maybe explain why Disney made this decision. ",2.0
884,t3_qz3oev,"CMV: ""Just give them homes"" is not a good solution to homelessness","I don't believe that any other person is entitled to my personal property unless I voluntarily want to share it. 

For instance, is a failing student justified in taking grades away from a student who's scoring 99%? Surely the high-performing student doesn't *need* such high marks. They can easily get into a good college with a slightly lower mark while sharing some of their marks with the failing student. If we shave a few percentage points off the high performer so the low performer can pass, the class will be better off as a whole. Why is it fair that some students are dominating the class with grades above 95% while there are people struggling to pass? To make sure things are fair, we will take marks from the top 1% of the class and redistribute them so that everyone can stay above the passing grade. 

This sounds ridiculous, but it's essentially what the 'free housing' crowd is advocating for. 

There are *many* ways to help low-performing students, but no reasonable person would advocate for redistribution of people's earnings as the primary solution. 

The best solution to the homelessness problem is means-tested *transitionary shelter* for the truly destitute in combination with incentives to increase supply and drive down prices, not unconditional permanent housing. 

We need zoning reform, housing construction incentives, increased access to mental health services, universal healthcare and transitional safety nets.

If you've ever gone to a pool or a beach, the only thing a bikini covers is the nipple. The entire boob is practically in plain view it's just the nipple part that has the stigma. Why is it so taboo? I would argue at least an equal amount of people are attracted to a boob behind a bikini than a bare boob with no support and the nipple showing. 

I will not argue that it's not more of a fetish for men/women to be into female boobs than females/males are into male boobs. But a bikini isn't hiding the boob. It's hiding the nipple.

890,t3_qywhvr,"CMV: the view among some (many?) engineers of ""I didn't use what I learned in college"" is often based on a misunderstanding of what you're supposed to learn in college.","Edit to clarify: I mean for those who work in a field that their degree subject was reasonably suited to prepare them for.  Obviously if you change fields you won't use much of what you learned, other than general problem-solving.

Let me admit up front that I have limited industry experience, hence being open to a change of view.  I've worked in research for a few years, but my industry experience is limited to one internship (in which I definitely applied my coursework), and I know research work is different.

I am also reasoning on the basis that that stance seems to be relatively common, but that impression is based on the Internet, which I know is a terrible sample (and I haven't heard it in person, but most of the engineers I know are researchers, not industry).  A convincing argument that fairly few experienced engineers actually think that would also CMV.

I also don't dispute the ""you only use 10%, but you don't know which 10% it will be"" viewpoint.

Anyway, onto the argument: of course no one depends on having learned the equations and so forth; references and manuals exist for a reason.  Given the context of discussion in which it comes up, it seems like that view is often referring to this.  But if so, that seems like a misconception about what a degree (in an engineering context) is actually for.  You aren't there to learn equations, which is why exams (including FE/PE) usually provide/allow equation sheets.  The three points, I think (based on my own experience), are to learn to learn efficiently; to develop rigorous problem-solving skills; and to develop the basis for a general intuition about the relevant principles.  The latter parts, I think, are the key things here; you don't need to memorize the equations, but you do need to have extensive practice with them to understand how these things behave, and to be able to practically apply them to problems.

I have definitely benefited in my own work from having a decent intuition for how water budgets, hydraulics, and soil properties work, even though I can and do look up the equations.  I would not be able to have an informed discussion about how we should investigate the hydrologic behavior of a given watershed without having appropriate and reasonably in-depth background (with emphasis on practical application) in surface water and groundwater--which I *could* learn on the job, of course, but which I *did* learn in school, relatively efficiently (and I actually did learn most of the exact technical skills needed for my internship in class).  Conversely, being able to look up steel design standards (e.g. in the FE reference) doesn't mean I can actually do steel design calculations, having no exposure to the general principles.

To put it briefly, the described view seems to assume that the degree is about knowing the equations, which is unimportant, when it's actually about developing a general understanding of how the relevant systems work and how to effectively apply that, which is important and which a university education does aim for.

Four major ways to change my view here:

* Argue convincingly that the referenced view is held by a small minority of engineers (doesn't have to be none--of course the number who used their coursework would be less than 100%).
* Argue convincingly that my impression of how the coursework does get applied (i.e. the importance of a general intuition for the relevant system) is anomalous, e.g. specific to research and coincidentally that one internship, but less common generally.
* Argue convincingly that my university experience (i.e. actually providing the relevant background and focusing on that, including applications, vs. just memorizing equations or whatever) was unusual, and that many/most students actually do just focus on learning the equations.
* Argue convincingly that my impression is field-specific (civil engineering/hydrology) and doesn't generalize to other fields of engineering.  [Edit: I have awarded a delta on this, related to power engineering.]",45.0

The appropriate amount of people were being scheduled per shift.
And a load was taken off of all of our backs.

Because in being “lazy” and working the appropriate work load for what we were doing. It stalled the business and forced them to make changes that would not only accommodate us but speed up the business aswell.

I still work for this company and am a valued member of the team. I just have limits on how hard I’m willing to stress myself for the demands of the company.
When the company’s own processes have lead to the problems at hand. Not my lack of work ethic.

They still ask me to take my old position back acting this way. Because Im good with people. But this company isn’t worth my best and their getting what they pay for.

All the blame can’t fall onto the worker for taking the bad behavior when their the victims in this situation. It’s  more complex than I make it out to be.

Edit 3: Working hard for a promotion is a viable strategy to get promoted if said promotion is deemed worth it. Definitely not every situation is the same and I understand the merit of working hard for something you really want.

I’ve been seeing that “Extra hard” is vague terminology and if you care to read this far ide like it thought of as “More than your job Discription entails”

I don’t believe in the concept of “gender euphoria” in isolation, because you cannot experience euphoria from one situation if the opposite situation doesn’t cause dysphoria: they exist on opposite ends of a scale. 

Note that the people who I am referring to tend to NOT undergo any hormonal or surgical transition, tend to keep much the same and simply change their physical style and pronouns, something easily reversible so when they change their mind and wish to return to their assigned at birth gender, they can do so effortlessly. 

When someone can turn on and off at whim this presentation they’re shielded from much of the societal oppression but still benefit from the social element of being part of the LGBTQ community.

895,t3_qytce3,CMV: We should all commit to free speech,"I’m of the opinion that as a society we should make an almost 100% commitment to free speech and the open exchange of ideas. I also think that this is bigger than the First Amendment which only restricts the government from limiting speech. In addition to this, social media, news organizations, entertainment producers, and especially universities should do as little as possible to limit the ability of people to disseminate their views. It’s illiberal and it’s cowardly. If a person expresses a view that is incorrect or offensive, we all have the right to articulate a contrary viewpoint but “deplatforming” is (almost) never the right move. 

A great example of this is the case of University of Chicago professor [Dorion Abbot was uninvited](https://chicagomaroon.com/article/2021/11/8/uchicago-professors-mit-lecture-canceled-dei-opinions-spark/) from giving a lecture at MIT because upheaval over critical views of affirmative action programs that Abbot had expressed in print. This is absurd for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Abbot was not coming to MIT to talk about diversity on campus, he was coming to talk atmospheric studies of other planets and the potential application to the study of climate change on earth. Sounds like it might be kind of important. Secondly, it’s not like he was advocating genocide or something. There are plenty of Americans who are not entirely convinced that affirmative action in college admissions is a desirable policy. If you are in favor of affirmative action, the thing to do is engage in debate with your opponents, not shut them down. 

Another example that was all over this sub a few weeks ago was Dave Chappelle and the things that he said about trans people in his latest Netflix special. I agree that what he said was problematic and not really that funny, but…that’s me. I don’t get to decide for other people what’s OK and what’s funny. If you have a problem with it, don’t watch it. But he’s a popular comedian and if people want to spend their time and money listening to him talk (and many people do) that’s cool. 

I’m not just picking on left leaning people either. They do not have a monopoly on trying to protect themselves from hearing opinions that make them uncomfortable. There’s been a lot of press lately about state legislatures that are trying [to ban teachers](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-critical-race-theory-lawsuit-aclu-rcna3276) from teaching “critical race theory”. These laws are written in an incredibly vague manner, here’s a quote from the article I just linked to, “the Oklahoma law bans teaching that anyone is “inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,” or that they should feel “discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex.” It’s pretty clear to me that this is just a way of covering your ears and trying to drown out uncomfortable facts about American history. I mean, it’s hard not to feel “psychological distress” when you learn about lynching in the Jim Crow South to give just one example. 

I will say that in instances where a person’s speech is adding nothing to an organization, it is acceptable to deplatform someone. For example, if someone goes onto r/modeltrains and constantly writes things like, “Model trains are for babies! Grow up!”, that person should be banned. Obviously, this is a space for people who like model trains (they are awesome) and this person is just creating a nuisance. 

I’m also very conflicted about the decision Twitter and Facebook made to ban Donald Trump. I feel that was a violation of the rights of people who wanted to hear what he had to say, however, he was more powerful than the average citizen, by a long shot, and was intentionally disseminating views that were leading to violence and unrest. So…I’m not sure. Let’s talk about that in the comments.

I do feel confortable talking about parenting legislation however, as it is something that might affect me one day with possible massive effect.

Once the child is birthed, I consider any parent as strict equal, and in my eyes, any can be the primary caregiver. This equal responsibility means to me that they should all be able to choose that responsibility, rather than having it forced upon them.

The birthing parent, through the option to abort, do actively choose this responsibility by not having an abortion. It is their sole prerogative wether they do it or not, and are free to exclude any third party from this decision making process. It means that they bear alone by default the responsibility for their pregnancy, and its outcome.

In this condition, having the other genitor tied to this decision is unfair. They should be able to not suffer any consequence from a choice they may have no saying in.

I believe this is consistent with pro-choice talking points, about how restrictive abortion laws limit the agency of pregnant people when it comes to their parenthood. I think it would be great to expand this logic to the other people involved too.

After a summer of racial justice protests, the anger over Rittenhouse was palpable. A white teen crossed state lines to go to a protest armed with an AR-15 and shot and killed two people. In general, I would say the public was on the left's side on Rittenhouse, even though it was of course an incredibly divisive issue back when it happened as it is now. But instead of being objective, and looking at the actual facts of the case, the left decided to turn Rittenhouse into the scapegoat of white supremacy, of the alt-right.

He never should've been charged with murder 1. Any unbiased legal expert could've told you from the beginning that it was going to be very hard to convict Rittenhouse of first-degree murder, given the facts of the case as well as America's overall leniency to self-defense. But the political pressure forced the DA to go for the home run, and boy did they swing and miss. The prosecution was an absolute disaster. They were so bad that I've seen many memes about them on Reddit, even in typically left-leaning subreddits.

And now that he's been acquitted, we all know that Kyle Rittenhouse has a lifetime of Fox News segments ahead of him (hell, he's already done an interview with Tucker Carlson if I'm not mistaken). He'll probably never have to work a real job another day in his life, now that he's a right-wing hero. Now, you might say ""the right was going to make a hero out of Rittenhouse no matter what,"" and that may be true to some extent. But, if the left had not made such a hubbub over Rittenhouse himself, and instead had charged him with lesser crimes, as well as focused on changing the laws to prevent such a tragedy from happening again, Rittenhouse would not be as big of a celebrity as he will be now.

And the other thing is. I think the whole Rittenhouse trial fiasco has just been bad optics for the left in general. I don't just mean for conservatives, I mean for independents and moderates as well. Independents tuning in to see what they thought was going to be an evil white supremacist convicted of murder charges, instead saw a prosecution making an absolute fool of themselves. And now that the not guilty verdict has come down, the left is playing hard into the racial politics and systemic injustice rhetoric, even though anyone with a little bit of common sense saw the writing on the wall about two days into the trial.

900,t3_qyk6zs,CMV: Gender is not just a social construct,"EDIT: i'm sorry if i didn't reply or missed out on awarding a delta. It is my first post here and I need to get back to doing some work.   
My view has been changed by pointing out inconsistencies in my definitions, questioning my motivation and reason for making such distinctions, and most importantly showing how its just a hypothesis, rather than something factual. Oh and also I need to better explain my arguments

Alright, I know it can be a sensitive topic for some people, especially those that struggle with their gender identity. I think my post may mention some things that people can find offensive, so please point that out to me, I would appreciate that! I make this post with good intentions in mind, and do not want to hurt or diminish anyone's identity!

To start, I know that there is a clear distinction between sex and gender. Truly, I don't know enough to properly understand the complexity of a person's sex, meaning their biological composition, but what I do get is that majority of measures of sex tend to be bimodal. Now, the way that I've understood gender was, for the most part, that it is a social construct, and describes the way people present themselves to the society.

Here is where I think differently about gender: I think that gender is not constricted to a single dimension, but rather exists at least as two different concepts - biological gender and cultural gender. These names are by no means scientific, I just use them to distinguish between the two. I think that ""biological gender"" exists in the first place, because it would be the result of the composition of the person's sex. Basically, the biology behind what hormones are more dominant in their body would have an impact on the behaviors and appearance they have, and thus impact the way they interact with the society. Essentially, I think that part of gender has a biological cause behind it, which then further feeds into how society understand masculinity vs femininity.

Now, what I referred to as cultural gender previously, would then be the understanding of gender as a social construct. Which is mostly the way people choose to present themseves to the society, based on the established gender norms within the culture.

So the way I imagine these two dimensions of gender, I would think that something like gender dysphoria could be driven by incongruence between person's sex and their ""biological gender"", which would result in desire to reject physical gender signifiers. Or it can be driven by incongruence between the assigned gender and the cultural gender identity, so a person would choose to reject the traditional gender norms, while still feeling comfortable with their physical body.

Women still take their husband's last names when they marry. That tradition is 100%, unequivocally rooted in sexism. It comes from a time when women  were just barely a tier above being a man's property, and losing their last name (with their husbands' replacing it) was indicative of the fact  that she basically relinquished her identity. She couldn't do anything  beyond keeping house or raising children without his permission.

Some women hyphenate, but that still begs the question of why the woman is the one to hyphenate and not the man, and the much bigger question of  why the woman is the one to sometimes lose her entire last name. Yes, men sometimes take their wives' last names, but we all know that's outstandingly rare. There's (usually) no reason besides ""tradition,"" so we're basically just continuing to be sexist because we used to do it.

I don't understand how we can fight for gender equality, but then continue traditions that have origins in complete, unmitigated, unapologetic gender **in**equality. That doesn't make sense to me. It creates a power dynamic IMO where it feels like the man is more powerful.

902,t3_qyj6zv,CMV: We should'nt all be expected to be greener (climate),"Recently a friend asked me ""Generally speaking, if given the choice, would I choose the greener option or the cheaper option"". It sounds like a simple question, but its got a complex answer so I thought it was worth some discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

So I do care about green energy, a lot, its very important, however I understand, that despite what anyone says, whether that be an individual or a fortune 10 oil conglomerate, money is always the number 1 driving factor in deciding between greener, or cheaper. It always has been, and it most likely always will be. Complaining about it wont change that, shaming every person or company for not being green is simplifying the situation enormously and ultimately does nothing to help the issue.

What we currently see is that third world and developing countries don't tend to care as much about climate change[^(\[1\])](https://www.vox.com/2014/9/23/6835285/why-rich-countries-worry-more-about-climate-change-than-poor-ones#:~:text=Researchers%C2%A0have%20long%20pointed%20out%20that%20people%20don%27t%20tend%20to%20worry%20as%20much%20about%20long%2Drange%20environmental%20issues%20when%20they%20have%20more%20immediate%20needs%2C%20like%20health%20care%20or%20jobs%20or%20trying%20to%20affordable%20food), they're too busy trying to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads, that is of course with the exception of those most heavily affected by climate change. However, as the ratio between the average cost of living and the average household income increases, suddenly, more people start to care about the environment, and it becomes a political issue that the electoral candidates have to address in their manifestos, and if they later get into office, their legislation's, regulations, and taxes.

So, the point here is that the average individual, and small businesses (which just so happens to be the overwhelming percentage of businesses in the world) ARE going to prioritise the cheaper option over the greener option, because their primary concern is to survive and provide for their families, the average person in the world lives day by day. Similarly the small businesses of the world need to manage their expenses and their cash flow, or they too will die. Expecting these people to live a greener lifestyle is quite frankly, inappropriate. The wealthier nations of the world can afford the luxury of choice. Ironically tho, even though these nations can afford to care about the environment, they would certainly have something to say if suddenly the prices for everything in the stores increased due to the additional expenses of being sustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched a documentary a couple of weeks ago about plastic waste, and Coca Cola[^(\[2\])](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0010zxs). Coca Cola including all of its child companies are by far the largest producers of plastic bottle waste in the world. They are however doing more to clean up and recycle plastic bottles than any other company in the world, but not nearly to the degree that makes up for the waste they produce every year. Over the last 40 years or so they've set multiple targets to have their bottles made of more and more recycled plastic. I cant remember exactly what they were so dont quote me on these figures, but it was something like 20%, then 30% and most recently 40% recycled plastic, and every time they've failed, by a country mile. If I remember rightly theyre not even at 20% at the moment, there was a time when they were 20% I think for 4 years, and then they stopped it and went back to practically nothing. In the early days of coke, they always sold it in glass bottles and then they had designated drop off points for the bottles when you were done, they would then get taken away, washed, and reused. In todays heavily competitive market, it is my view, that this expensive and time consuming way of doing business is not something Coca Cola, or honestly any company in the same position, should be expected to practice off their own free will, not without some kind of practical incentive or tax to drive this change.

The mega corporations of the world are really the ones who should be held not only accountable, but responsible. They should be forced to change their manufacturing and exporting methods to greener solutions. The main reasons being, simply, that they are the largest producers of waste and greenhouse gasses, but importantly, they are wealthy enough to afford to change. To some degree they are doing some of the right things, but not to the right proportions, like in Coca Cola's case. Its a problem, because now we are relying on the governments to manage these enormous companies, and whilst governments haven't got a great track record at managing complex issues at the best of times, these mega companies are not just operating in one country, so now we need the governments of the world to come together and agree upon a general and unified international law to regulate these enormous international companies... Which is always going to be a long and drawn out exercise of compromises where no-ones a winner, because understandably every country has its own agenda and priorities based on their individual cultures, future plans, and economic ability to run a more sustainable nation. This is basically what's been happening at the Glasgow Climate Change Conference.

In my opinion I think a fair move from todays governments would be for an international law to be implemented that makes it illegal for any company, and its subsidiaries, from earning a profit margin over a certain percentage without first having reached certain agreed sustainability standards. This percentage would change at given fixed profit brackets, the percentage decreasing as the companies net profit increases. This doesnt prevent them from earning a profit over a certain percentage altogether, it just prevents them from doing so without first acting sustainably and responsibly, which seems pretty fair to me. An internationally recognised body would have to be established to regulate this, and the brackets and percentages would likely have to be bespoke to the different industries as some are capable of greener operation than others. As this is where things start to get a little complicated, this is likely where the governments would stumble.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem is that the people in office of any government are also subject to the promises they made to any companies who supported and funded them during their election campaigns. This makes it difficult for them to then turn around and slap these companies in the face with an aggressive new law like this. Many people would call this government lobbying corruption, but I see it more as a broken system, I dont think any individual is really to blame. Theres enormous incentives from both sides to practice lobbying, honestly its the only way to stay ahead of the competition, in both politics and business. If either side didnt, a given politician wouldn't stand a chance at getting into office, and a given company wouldn't get a seat at the table when discussing the latest industry taxes and regulations. I dont see it as corruption, they do it to survive, I see a broken system. The problem is it's now becoming increasingly monopolistic. It wasn't such a problem at the birth of democracy but as time has gone on, the population has increased, technology has improved, and as a result globalism has connected the entire planet, and companies have grown to sizes previously never imagined, and it will only continue to do so. With larger companies brings more money, brings bigger carrots to dangle in front of the politicians, brings more power to the unelected with their own selfish agendas. Did you know, according to Investopedia[^(\[3\])](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/which-industry-spends-most-lobbying-antm-so/), since January 1st 1998 the oil and gas industry has spent $2,493,422,698 on lobbying in the US alone, 2.5 trillion. Interestingly theyre not the biggest lobbying spender in the US, the number 1 spot is taken by Pharmaceuticals/Health Products who have spent a total of $4,951,696,278 in the same time. Thats pretty disgusting for anyone coming from a country with free public healthcare, but thats a different subject altogether.

Bernie Sanders had the right idea during the last US election, he was slating all the other candidates for taking huge piles of cash from various industry leading companies to fund their campaigns, in return for favourable treatment and tax rebates, when really, these companies are exactly the opposite direction to where the money should be going, which is down to the people, investing in better schools and healthcare, and public services in general. Governments should be expected to work towards reducing the disparity of wealth, not increasing it. Honestly its pretty damn impressive that Sanders got the amount of votes he did with the money he had for his campaign. Reportedly never accepting lobbying money in his whole political career, *with a pinch of salt* \- apparently he took a little bit from a few companies in the 2016 election[^(\[4\])](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/09/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/bernie-sanders-has-taken-corporate-lobbyist-money-/), but feel free to do your own research on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem of the world is the simple fact that with todays technology, unsustainable and 'un-green' ways of doing business just happen to be the cheapest ways of doing business. There are plenty of technologies, methods, and products available to the consumer and the producer that are sustainable, theyre just expensive. Some of the clever engineers of the world understand that if they want their sustainable green product to be successful they not only have to be sustainable and green, but also both better than the standard, and cheaper. It does sound a bit like asking the impossible when you think about it but its happened before, and is still happening today. For example, electricity and lightbulbs compared to candle light, the internet and email compared to delivery by hand, and more recently Tesla are starting to roll out batteries that are more energy dense, cheaper, and more sustainable than the current industry standard lithium ion batteries, not only that theyre easier to produce too, which is an added bonus for them. Tesla also have a track record for having open patents that their competitors can use for free[^(\[5\])](https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you), in an effort to speed up the adoption of electric vehicles, and greener, more sustainable technology in general, which is great! So hopefully these new batteries will follow the same path when they're fully mass production ready. If more companies did this the world would be a better place.

If we can continue to innovate like this we can make it so that even the smallest of companies WANT to use the most sustainable option available, and this puts less guilt and 'blame' on the consumer for buying and using the product. This is where government spending should be heavy today, the idea is that its not a perpetual expense, once we find these cleaner technologies spending can be distributed back to other places of need.

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary, yes I do care about being green, but also yes, being in my current personal financial situation I will generally choose the cheaper option over the greener option, if I have the luxury to afford going with the greener option in the future, I will; and if we're optimistic, maybe one day, the greener option will be the cheaper option, and people wont have to make that choice.

However, many have said to me that to call something ‘sexist’ it has to stem from a systemic perspective, or a perspective of prolonged oppression based on sex. Whereas I see sexism as simply being discrimination based on ones sex, so if a women says ‘men are pieces of shit’ then that is equally as sexist as a man saying ‘women are pieces of shit’. Apparently due to men being the oppressor they then can’t be oppressed? That is also something I have heard. Not sure if this view is the common view? Or if it’s delusional and old fashioned.

904,t3_qyi2ya,CMV: Sell-side equity research is useless to retail investors to beat the market,"What is the value of information for investors?

905,t3_qyha8r,CMV:US Citizens should not have to justify being in any public location with legal accessories including guns,"So many people have argued that the Rittenhouse verdict was correct but not just, or that it was incorrect on the basis of ""He had no reason to be there"" or ""he couldn't justify why he was there"" or that ""no one should go to a protest/riot with a gun no matter what"", etc.

I think it was a bad idea, a dangerous idea, etc to do what Rittenhouse did. But I don't think we can or should condemn him or anyone based on simply being on public streets that were dangerous. I can't see how we get the restrictions on movement out of this argument. I don't mean legally, I mean even morally - who decides what constitutes a public place where certain people ""can't go""?

Presumably, on different days, these same people wouldn't say Rittenhouse would need to justify being in Kenosha. Most of them explicitly say if he was just outside his house it  would be different. So this would be a shifting curtailment of freedom of movement. What is the universal standard here? I've never liked ""I'll know it when I see it"" because it seems inherently ex post facto and just likely to be unfair and biased in application.

The final part of my view is that I don't think taking one legal activity and adding an accessory to it that is also legal changes any need to justify yourself. I see that all the time with Cameras - so many people get harassed for having a camera on them in public, even though it's perfectly legal. There is no need to justify having a camera in a public place. This is the same with guns when they're allowed open carry. 

You could disagree with the law, but that doesn't mean I need to justify myself to anyone.

Anyway - if you have a coherent argument on why we should require people to ""prove they should be somewhere in public"" and have that play into their criminal or moral culpability, or clarify why carrying something legal is morally wrong because it bothers others I'll listen to it.",23.0
906,t3_qyglj9,"CMV: In the film Arcane, at the end of episode 3, Powder (Jinx) made the right decision","I truly believe that Powder made the right decision in saving her sister, friends, and Vander, a father figure when she was captured by Silco instead of staying back. While it did result in almost everyone in the warehouse dying I still believe it was the right choice. Here's why.

**Vi and her friends weren't facing normal goons, they were much more dangerous with the serum, Powder bringing a trick up her own sleeve set her allies on equal footing**

We can see that in the beginning Silco and his goons were experimenting on a purple serum that makes living things much more stronger, and violent, something that was used on a human that turned out to be an unstoppable monster. Had Powder not brought a trick up her own sleeve it would've ended up being a one-sided slaughter. 

**Even if Vi and her team escaped without Powder's intervention there could've been guards outside to catch them or someone with the serum that can catch them**

Again, this is pretty self explanatory, Vander mentioned himself when he first met Vi after he was captured, he mentioned how there are guards everywhere. There is also the fact that someone with the serum could've ran and caught up to them was also a possibility, if it wasn't for Powder to disable everyone they might've gotten caught either way with nobody on her side making it out alive

**Powder could've saved her friends if she put in less hex crystals in the toy monkey thus making the explosion was smaller so it would only affect those outside the door**

In the beginning we can see that a single hex crystal made an explosion that wasn't THAT bad, but since Powder put in more the explosion killed almost everyone, if she put in less hex crystals it would've been flawless as Silco and his goons would've been dead or too injured to catch them.

Either way I think Powder made the right decision, although it was a bit miscalculated I still think she made the right choice because at least Vi lived after it.",9.0
907,t3_qygey6,CMV: Janet Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction” wasn’t an accident at all. It was an intentional publicity act that got the opposite reaction than desired.,"First, I love Janet Jackson, and I really enjoy Justin Timberlake. Both are people I’d love to meet, and both seem like genuinely nice people.

On to my argument:

Like many of you, I saw it live on tv. To this day, I cannot be convinced it was an accident. When the “malfunction” happened, Justin’s didn’t rush to help cover her back up and Janet didn’t rush to cover herself. In addition, she was wearing tape over her nipple in an ‘X’ shape. I’m curious, why would someone wear tape over their nipple?

Some could argue the costume was uncomfortable for  the nips and so she wanted to protect them. Ok - I’ll bite: then why wouldn’t she just wear a bandaid like runners do?

“Maybe it was double-sided tape to hold her costume in place” I can hear many of you saying, Ok, I’ll bite on that too - why was the surface area of tape used for coverage so small, and why did the tape remain in place instead of pulling off a bit &amp; dangling too?

Edit: additionally, the song “Rock your body” by Justin was being performed, and at the precise moment of “malfunction”, the lyrics were “better have you naked by the end of this song”.

IMO: this was a choreographed publicity stunt that got the wrong reaction and everyone involved in the set up bailed on the intentional action by calling it a “malfunction”.",17.0

That's fine and all, but I think what discourse is lacking is the why.

Suppose a man is married to a woman. Man says he's going out but doesn't tell the wife where. The wife says 'it's my right to know'. That's a statement that she wants to know, sure, but it doesn't explain why.

""It's my right to call you a bitch."" Of course, you won't be arrested, but that doesn't mean you should do it.

I also see this often said in response to criticism. I also think we shouldn't conflate the 'right' as the legal sense with the 'moral' sense. For example, if I said 'I fucking hate religion' and you say 'it's my right to practice' and I say 'sure, I wouldn't want you arrested' and they respond with 'so then you should shut up'. I mean, it would just get us in circles. It's your legal right to practice religion, it's my legal right to criticize, what's the point in saying it's my right then?

National CC across state lines is a popular push for firearms enthusiasts, but it further endangers the lives of all, because anyone could be conceal carrying, and anyone could be a threat, and if someone feels they are threatened they can legally take *any action* to feel less threatened.

Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

\----- Old post.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I mean AMERICA, and America only. Not West. I have many Occidental, and Oriental friends.

But you know who I cannot be friends with? Americans. They're just not compassionate. I hope you can change my opinion on this, I'm 100% open to it.

Three examples:

1- What America is doing to my country, Iran. You're sanctioning us, it's hurting people, I don't care if you're trying to punish the ""pariah"" government, I don't care that the Iranian government oppresses its people. Your sanctions thwart societal upheaval, stops young Iranians like me to become independent and make changes, and I bet you would want that because a progressive Iran is an Iran you can't justify sanctioning. Your brains are rotten to the core with anti-Iranian propaganda. You think our women ""wear burqas"" and cannot drive. You think we're Arabs because you're too dumb to understand what 'Arab' means and don't realize how offensive it is to call an Iranian Arab! You think ALL Iranians are religious zealots whilst it's chockful of atheists like me. You have the mental capacity of a 2 year old, if you can't see something, it probably doesn't exist! You can't make decisions for yourselves so you elect old f\*ckt\*rds who abuse you and take you for a ride. An American 'statesperson' just becomes a statesperson to fill up his pocket with lobbyist money. I'm not saying Iran is a good country BUT I DON'T IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH MY COUNTRY. I am, foremost, a human. But you put your Amernicanness and your nation state in front of all your decisions. American is not a nationality for you people, it's an IDENTITY. What I'm saying applies to most older people, people ages 35-80, but what's worse is that younger people in your country are no better which brings me to..

2- The ""simp"" behavior. Hear me out, not every gallant act is simping! Not every person who helps a person of the opposite sex out is a 'simp'! Maybe in your rotten brains, every person who helps someone is looking after something in return. But it's not the case in majority of the situations. Someone pays a girls' rent, he may also pay a guy's rent! When you have money you are obligated to help people around you. When you're fortunate you MUST look after other people. It's this ""mine! mine! mine!"" attitude that will be the downfall of America and somewhere in the near future you all will be so involved with yourselves and forgot your brethren and sistren than you will ultimately fail to recognize who's in need, and your only drive for charitable work will be to add to your social portfolio. You will be so anti-expertise, so anti-science that your society will crumble from within.

3- You think offensive jokes are a-ok. Listen to me, nobody makes a joke unless he, deep inside, believes in that thing. Nobody will use a racial slur unless he believes that racial slur carries a meaning. Youtuber iDubbz who's responsible for creating a horde of lewd young people thinks if he uses the n-word a lot, the word will suddenly lose all its meaning. That's not true. Common sense says when you attack infringed members of a society, those members of the society will be offended even if you say it's a 'joke'. The prevalence of Youtubers who just spray vitriol and hatred just goes to show how unfamiliar the American society is with compassion. Suicide rate is extremely high among the Asian minority for this exact reason.

When 70 million people in your country CHOOSES to vote for a maniac, there's something wrong with your society. And don't try to use my nationality to carry a point, I am well aware of the ailments of the country I live in. But that country is just that, a place I was born in. It's not my identity. But I guess a lot of people are seething right now that a filthy sngr rat is offending their dear beloved nation of FREEDOM. To them I say, get a life.

Also, before you accuse me of ""falling for state propaganda"", keep in mind that I consume almost zero Iranian media. All I do is I watch Youtube and browse Reddit whilst I work. So yeah, put that in your pipe and smoke it.

So I guess I'm putting a hard task ahead of you in order to change my view. Some common arguments I hear from Americans when I tell them how much they suck:

1- Not ALL of us are like this!

True. But would you believe it if I tell you that most Iranians don't hate America and don't shout ""Death to America"" either? But you have CHOSEN to believe that most of us do this. Even so, the Iranians who do this are extremely old, and remember the days when AMERICAN SOLDIERS R\*PED IRANIAN WOMEN. They have a reason for hating America. Stats don't lie. 70 million people voted for Trump. Even more so are teenagers who can't vote and are conditioned by their parents that Trump is the Second Coming of Jesus. Q-Anon is a thing. Yes, not even most of you are like this. But A LOT of you are like this. Enough to carry out a change.

2- B...But we're conditioned to be like this!

No. No you are NOT. Media is free in your country. All you f\*ck\*rs can f\*ck\*ng read.

3- We can't really carry any change!

Yes, yes, you can. You can simply team up and vote third party. And the fact that you haven't done so in the past 40 years when you were shown how vitriolic bipartisan politics is, just goes to show how non-compassionate you are!

Again, don't use Iran's problems as a counter-argument. I am well-aware of them. Don't try to use any of the populist arguments, and don't try to play the racism card, telling me I'm being racist against white people when I clearly mean all Americans. I equally hate all Americans, and I believe this country is the cause of many ailments in the world.

If the downfall of America comes, which hopefully will be very soon, don't ask WHY it happened. Ask yourself how you can postpone it. Be more passionate. Stop sanctioning my country. Stop spreading hatred and vitriol. Educate your people.

When you bring up the issues of Iran you're being bullies because Iran is a third world despot and people are simply powerless. American people are empowered to change their situation and not only they don't fix it, they choose to vote for people who are the worst human beings on the planet. This is just sad that America holds this much power.

So can you change my opinion with all these points I've made? I will give a delta to the every single top, or second-level comment that can prove me wrong. If fake internet points means a lot to you (which is another issue I have with Americans), then act on it. You may also stop me from beating up Americans when I see them because the way they hurt my country, they deserve it. You CAN protest Iranian sanctions, and the fact that you DON'T shows how ugly your souls are.",0.0
915,t3_qya8o0,"CMV: Your beliefs determine your actions, and thus, your outcomes","Hey friends,

One thing I have been exploring recently is the impact of how our beliefs impacts many aspect of our lives, including our happiness, confidence, achievements, etc. I have read a lot about this and wrote some of my learnings to help me solidify them. I thought I would share with you all for feedback.

Would love to see if this resonates or makes sense! Feel free to be critical. Would welcome any push back, or recommendations on what to read / how to further sharpen my thinking. 

\---

“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”

This is a quote that is often shared as sound advice. While trite, I think it has merit, and I try to adhere to it the best I can.

When I moved to New York, one of the goals I set for myself was to spend more time with people who were more successful than me. \[1\] Entrepreneurs, investors, and operators were at the top of that list.

After a few months of network building, I found myself at a small six-person dinner where everyone fit the above criteria. I was the odd man out.

Dinner involved great conversation; we discussed our ambitions, how we spend our time, what motivates us, etc. But on my walk home, I felt sad. I kept comparing my outcomes to those of my new friends and was disappointed that I wasn’t as successful as they were.

After my three-day pity party, I decided to snap out of my funk and figure out why their outcomes differed from mine. I made a list of all the qualities that the five people at dinner had—intellect, integrity, energy, ambition, ability to learn, creativity, etc.—and compared myself against it.

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I felt generally on par when it came to every quality except one: They had a bias toward actions with big impacts. \[2\] \[3\]

I know it’s reductive to say that our different outcomes can be boiled down to thinking big and acting on it. Success and wealth are multivariate; there are numerous factors at play, including luck.

But I also know that having a critical lens toward myself enables me to identify where I fall short and reflect on how I can improve. Doing so will increase my probability of favorable outcomes. This is what inspired today’s essay: how our beliefs impact the actions we take.

# The link between beliefs and actions

People who have earned success are all action-oriented. Being action-oriented simply means understanding causality. If you want a certain outcome, a certain input is required.

**Input--&gt;Outcomes**

I won’t belabor this point, because intuitively, most people get it. What is more interesting is understanding what causes us to choose one action over another. How do we determine which actions to pursue?

When I was in college, I wanted to get into finance. My motives were to learn, make money, and enjoy the prestige associated with a career in finance. However, underlying that was also a belief that I could get a job in finance and do well. If I didn’t think I had a chance, I wouldn’t have tried.

My beliefs spurred action.

I networked hard, creating a massive Excel sheet filled with the personal details of every banker I met, as well as their contact information. I kept in touch with them the best I could and eventually built enough meaningful relationships to start a career in finance.

I tell this story only to contrast it with one that was shared at the dinner I attended.

One of the dinner participants (let’s call him “Bob”) was a founder who was looking to raise another round of money for his start-up. Bob had recently attended a conference where he’d met a bunch of potential investors. He explained that he had an Excel sheet containing information about investors he’d met and that he planned to use this sheet to stay in touch with them.

Bob was doing the exact same action I had used to get into finance—the same tool, same manner, and same level of effort—but the potential outcomes of our actions were exponentially different. My best case was a good-paying job working long hours. His best case was a massive cheque that could change the course of his business. \[4\]

This is when I started to think about how our beliefs impact our actions and, thus, our outcomes.

# Belief —&gt; Action —&gt; Outcome

The framework I use to think about beliefs and actions is this: Your beliefs direct your actions, which impact your outcomes.

It is important to briefly define beliefs.

Anything that arises in the mind is a thought. Beliefs are thoughts that we trust to be true. You typically have thousands of thoughts going through your head on any given day, but you only accept as real and act on thoughts you trust.

Let’s tie this back to my earlier example:

* Belief: I can get a job in finance
* Action: Create an Excel tracker, send cold emails, etc.
* Outcome: Secure a job in finance

Based on this, it is clear how our beliefs about ourselves impact our outcomes.

The next question to pursue is, can we change our beliefs?

From my experience, the answer is yes.

We are certainly not born with preset beliefs. Our beliefs build over time as we live our lives and have different experiences. Our experiences, actions, and outcomes impact our beliefs. So, the framework from earlier needs to be updated to be beliefs --&gt; actions --&gt; outcomes --&gt; beliefs (creating a feedback loop).

The framework above depicts a feedback loop indicating that current beliefs drive actions, leading to outcomes that reinforce these beliefs.

The scale of your beliefs can also change. A pattern of small wins will slowly start to impact how you perceive yourself and the beliefs you hold. After a series of small wins, your beliefs might change drastically, leading to powerful beliefs with big actions.

# Alignment of beliefs and outcomes

Why does this matter?

You need to align your beliefs with your desires and ambitions. If you want outsized success, you need to have beliefs that are conducive to that. If you want to be a successful investor, founder, or operator, you need to believe you can be those things.

I certainly have limiting beliefs about myself. \[5\] While belief change is possible, it is hard. The key is to understand which of my current beliefs are limiting me and to focus on slowly changing them. Perhaps this way, I will fit in at dinner next time.

\[1\] The definition of success is ambiguous and personal. My definition of success is a function of owning my time, doing interesting work that is fulfilling and wealth.  
\[2\] Maybe I’m wrong and this is too arrogant a view. It’s hard to have the exact data points needed to reach a more definitive conclusion. Perhaps my ignorance is why our outcomes are different?  
\[3\] It is worth noting that big actions are correlated with risk. So, another way of looking at this is that they are better at taking smart risks.  
\[4\] Getting a job in finance can also change the trajectory of your life. But the impact is small vs raising a round of money from the right investor.  
\[5\] One of my limiting beliefs is that I need more “experience” to do something big. If you want to do something big, perhaps the best experience is to just do it? Another is fear of failure. I tend to be competitive and compare myself to others, which is helpful at times, but also makes me be afraid of falling behind.",1.0
916,t3_qy9wt7,"CMV: people who call others ""NPCs"" as a put-down are generally cringe-worthy hypocrites and doing so says more about them than anything else","Many, most, or all of us have seen it: there is a political-type discussion going on and someone throws out the ""you're just a NPC"" or ""all those NPC sheep just following along,"" - something along those lines. 

I typically see this phrase parroted in likely suspect places like where conspiracies might be discussed or political conversations. It may be also seen in more widespread circles. 

For those who may not know,  ""NPC"" is short for ""non-player character,"" originally ascribed to the computer-generated characters you might interact with in a video game. The online Urban Dictionary provides these definitions for ""NPC"": 

&gt;A play on video games ""non-player character"" mixed with a play on The Simulation Hypothesis.

&gt;An NPC is seemingly a human that is unable to think objectively.

&gt;We exist in a simulated reality and some humans take on the role of NPCs, spouting ""opinions"" they are programmed to spout and repeating in a cult-like manner.

The issues I see with anyone, at this point, calling others ""NPCs"" are varied, but I've laid out that I see it as generally demonstrating cringe-worthy hypocrisy and saying more about the person who uses the term than anything else. 

First, the hypocrisy: calling individuals or groups ""NPCs"" is so popular that it's in the Urban Dictionary and a widely understood phrase. It isn't an original thought for anyone using it today. They're just ""spouting and repeating"" a label they heard before. It may not be cult-like, but in my experience its usage definitely shows up more frequently in certain circles than others. Using the term is meant as a put-down, to indicate that the object of the put-down is an unthinking and unaware follower...but using the phrase itself seems to be just following along with the vernacular of certain circles where its use is popular. 

Pretty cringe-worthy to follow the popular trend in phrasing when trying to put someone down for ""blindly"" following something else. Indeed, this speaks to the further hypocrisy involved: namely, that the supposéd NPC is blindly believing anything. In online contexts, most who interact don't know each other. The person who calls another an NPC cannot possibly objectively determine that the other person arrived at their beliefs blindly and without careful consideration in the vast majority of cases where the phrase is used. It's more accurate to say that the person calling others by ""NPC"" is likely blindly making that assertion. 

To the second part: calling others ""NPCs"" can be considered a form of rankism or bullying-type behavior. As above, this is meant as a put-down. Bullying behavior has many psychological causes but often speaks to feelings of inadequacy in some way. Putting others down can help the bully feel better about themselves in the short-term. In the long-term, it's unhealthy and can destroy relationships...not a good habit of behavior to adopt even for the possible short-term gain. And it is likely such habits can translate from online interactions to offline relationships and interactions. 

If you find yourself wanting to call any individuals or a whole group of people ""NPCs,"" stop and think about that for a minute. It's hypocritical and reflects poorly on where you're at. Or, change my view.",0.0

I don’t care what the reason is. You do not have a right to burn down someone’s business who had nothing to do with the injustice being protested. You do not have a right to burn their car, destroy their home or store, or physically attack them.

Doing this is not brave, bold or making a positive difference. People attack innocent uninvolved people and their belongings because they are too afraid to go after the people who actually have power and contribute to the injustice at hand, so they attack powerless people with no recourse and expect those people to self-sacrifice everything they’ve earned and worked hard for in the name of the “greater good.”",3878.0
918,t3_qy8aun,CMV: The government should pay people if they donate a kidney,"I'm mostly relying on Belgian/Dutch figures, but I doubt the math will be much different in other countries.     

Dialysis is expensive. Very expensive. It's sadly also the only option for a lot of people.    
In the Netherlands, it costs between €80-120k per person per year on dialysis. That is a lot of money being spent on keeping people alive and even then their QoL is severely diminished compared to actually having a functioning kidney.       
Meanwhile, the cost of a kidney transplant surgery in Belgium is roughly €70k. The follow-up for the acceptor costs €5k per year and the follow-up for the donor is only a once-a-year appointment to have blood and urine samples analyzed which are relatively minor costs.    

The problem is that there currently aren't enough kidneys to go around. So dialysis is the alternative. But people can perfectly live with only 1 kidney. And the surgery to remove a kidney is relatively minor and also relatively safe. So considering the impact on the donor is minimal but it would be a huge benefit both to the acceptor and the government's finances, I think governments should incentivize people donating a kidney by paying them for it. With an average lifespan of 15 years for a healthy kidney from a live donor, society stands to save more than €1m in costs related to the acceptor's medical bills. So even if you apply an incentive of €100k for the donor, it would still be incredibly cost-efficient.",3.0

920,t3_qy6q16,cmv: Isonatalism should be a well-supported ideal by the masses,"Isonatalism is an ideology which assigns a negative or positive value to human repoduction depending on the state of environments at large. In other words, assigning a negative value to humans giving birth if it is a net detriment to the sustainability of society and a positive if it is a net benefit. It can be extended to discuss non-human animals as well, but humans are the focus of this conversation.

Things like deforestation, pollution and acidification of the ocean, human-induced species extinction and accelerated glacial melting are typical examples of negative ecological impacts of our human civilization which pose a threat to earthings' lives. Take at least one of these as axioms and throw those that you don't subscribe to away. Any one of these is enough of a reason to have this discussion. I argue that these issues may still exist on a smaller scale but we would have a better shot at long-term sustainability of life on earth or just making it to another star with isonatalistic views as the norm. If you don't agree on at least one of these issues as an axiom, then don't waste your time responding because I am not willing to change my view that at least of them pose a risk to the survivability of earthlings. I am, however, willing to change my view that isonatalism should be a well-supported ideal by the masses.

The reasons for negative or positive value assignment are different from those of the tangential [pro/anti]natalism. unlike these the value assignment is subject to change. That is, if we weren't reproducing at an unsustainable rate, but in a balanced way, this value could change from negative to positive or neutral.

However, talking about things like global climate change without acknowledging the impact of overpopulation is a waste of time. Any efforts to solve these problems are undermined by the unwillingness of people to address the root cause - which is too many people on the planet. As the Center for Biological Diversity states, in the quest to survive climate change “we not only need smaller footprints, but fewer feet.” Ignoring population factor is as good as wishing on a star for some breakthrough to solve humanity's problems, when we have a solution in front of us.

Isonatalism addresses the dismissal of population as the main issue in a way that, if it were the belief of the masses, would help humans achieve a sensible population. By dismissal, I'm specifically talking about wanting and pursuing the aspiration of having kids in spite of these facts.",0.0
921,t3_qy6288,"CMV: ""No uterus, no opinion"" is a bad argument to use against pro-life men","I get that the point of the argument is to place emphasis on the fact that since men do not have uteruses, they could never sympathise with the experience of women who have gone through an abortion (or might go through one in the future).
 
There's two problems with this argument:

• It ""encourages"" men to not care about this issue since their opinion ""does not matter"" and implies that abortion is solely a women's issue rather than a societal issue.

• In reality, this argument is hypocritical because as I have seen countless times, men's opinions on abortion DO matter, but only if they're pro-choice. If their opinion truly didn't matter, then pro-choice people wouldn't support male pro-choice allies.

Not to mention that this argument excludes infertile women and trans women.

As women I believe we need male allies to win this fight. And ""no uterus, no opinion"" is purely divisive and exclusionary.

922,t3_qxyypr,CMV: Wage stagnation is inevitable,"I am a frequent visitor to r/AustralianPolitics. On that sub, many news articles like the following are posted:

* [Morrison to announce wage-crushing immigration reboot](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/m0zj6o/morrison_to_announce_wagecrushing_immigration/)
* [Australia's youth benefitting from negative immigration](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/o59dsu/australias_youth_benefitting_from_negative/)

* [How immigration suppresses wage growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/op47dk/how_immigration_suppresses_wage_growth/)

As a naturalised immigrant to Australia myself, it pains me to see that all of these news articles blame people like me for Australia's wage stagnation. However, I also believe that if our economy can only get wage growth through less people, we didn't have a particularly robust economy to begin with. Also, if wage stagnation can only be avoided through negative/reverse immigration, that is a very unsustainable option because long term use of that strategy would seriously deplete our population.

The basic premise of this post is that wage stagnation is **inevitable**, not that it's impossible to **reduce** the size of this problem. Why do I think it's inevitable?:

* Sure, employers can stop wage theft and giving their CEOs absurdly large salaries. However, not all employers do these dodgy things, and even among those which do, stopping these can only put a dent in wage stagnation, not completely prevent it.
* Some people argue ""*wages don't keep up with rising productivity*"". But even if it did, there would be a limit to productivity.
* Australia already has [the world's highest minimum wage](https://www.9news.com.au/national/australia-minimum-wage-2021-lifts-to-20-an-hour-772-a-week/64eb42a0-8ec2-41c1-9a88-1ce0dfb46d0b). However, we also have a moribund manufacturing sector, because manufacturing companies can't afford to hire Australian workers.
* Some people argue ""*just make value-added and luxury products*"" to counter the claim that manufacturing is hindered by wage growth. However, there is a limit to value-adding, and the market for luxury products is smaller than for cheaper equivalents.
* Countries which don't have wage stagnation are generally those with fast-growing economies. Unless humanity can become a [multi-planetary species](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/space.2017.29009.emu) quickly, Earth's limited resources casts the strategy of endless economic growth into doubt. And even then, we would eventually hit the Solar System's resource limitations.",2.0
923,t3_qy1wc6,CMV: The Hard Problem of Consciousness is a myth,"#### The Hard Problem's existence is controversial and has not been demonstrated

While the majority of Philosophers of the Mind tend towards [acceptance of the Hard Problem](https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/5042), the numbers are not nearly high enough to firmly settle the issue either way. Further, many Philosophers of Mind and Neuroscientists explicitly reject its existence. The [Wikipedia article on the Hard Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) provides a good list of citations on both sides of the issue.

As a result, while its existence may seem obvious to some, the Hard Problem is far from being firmly demonstrated. Acceptance of the problem can be justified within the correct context, but so can rejection. 

In my view, if it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the problem absolutely cannot be solved, then the Hardness of the Problem has not been correctly identified and so it would be inaccurate to describe it as such. We can ask many questions about consciousness, and we may explain it in various ways, so there are multiple ""problems"" that can be identified but none which can be demonstrated as ""hard"".

#### The Hard Problem is contrary to Physicalism

I'm (generally) a physicalist because I have seen no evidence of any nonphysical existence. Modern academic philosophy also leans heavily towards [physicalism of the mind](https://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP). While some constructions of the Hard Problem are compatible with physicalism, it is most commonly constructed as an explicitly anti-physicalist issue. As a result, I tend to reject most variations for this reason alone.

If you posit a compatible construction then I'm more likely to accept it, though I haven't seen one that I consider to be both meaningful and valid. I believe an anti-physicalist construction has a much higher burden of proof, because it seems unlikely that something nonphysical would be observable (and therefore evidenced). Therefore, if you propose that  (e.g.) nonphysical qualia exists then you have the burden of proof to demonstrate that it does exist before we can examine its properties.

#### Consciousness exists as an emergent property of biology.

This issue doesn't eliminate the Hard Problem, but significantly narrows its scope. I think my description would be encompassed under what Chalmers refers to as [the Easy Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness#:~:text=another%20experience%3F%5B20%5D-,Easy%20problems,-%5Bedit%5D), so I don't think even an advocate of the Hard Problem would reject this notion, but please let me know if you see any issues with it.

[Consciousness encompasses a wide variety of cognitive functions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6u0VBqNBQ8) While the Hard Problem is often constructed to refer to Phenomenal Experience, Qualia, etc., these are mere subsets of consciousness. As a result, consciousness as a whole is better understood as an emergent property of biology with many complex features connecting our internal state to our external state. 

Without first introducing a concept like qualia, the Hard Problem is even more difficult to identify. When discussing such a complex system in its entirety, it tends to be best explained by [emergence and synergy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE) rather than by reduction to its fundamental parts. For clarity, I will refer to this system as Biological Consciousness, and presume that most external awareness is rooted in biology. Thus, for the Hard Problem to not have a biological solution, it must be constrained to some function of internal awareness like qualia.

#### Qualia is not a special case

Here I cover a few ways to identify that internal function, and show why I do not consider them sufficient for a Hard Problem.

Terms like ""Subjective Experience"" are commonly used for internal consciousness, and subjectivity is utilized as a special case in opposition to objectivity. However, even an inanimate object can be a subject, or undergo an experience, so these terms are not particularly specific or useful for trying to identify the real issue. Further, we have objective evidence that subjective experience exists. If we didn't, then we wouldn't know that it does. As a result, subjective experience exists in the objective world, and is best considered a subset of objective existence rather than its antithesis. 

""Self-Awareness"" is a clearer term, but if we consider external awareness to be a core feature of biological consiousness, then internal awareness seems an almost trivial step. Especially from an evolutionary perspective, it is clearly beneficial to be aware of your own internal systems and information exchange between internal systems is trivial via the Central Nervous System. In what sense, then, is Self-Awareness anything more than an internalization of the same Biological Consciousness?

Qualia and Phenomenal Experience are also common, but can vary in definition and can be difficult to identify as meaningfully distinct from the rest of consciousness. Further, they tend to be defined in terms of Subjectivity, Awareness, and Experience, and would thus already be addressed as above. You are more than welcome to propose a more specific definition. However, for a notion like qualia to meaningfully impact the Hard Problem, you must demonstrate that

1. It exists

2. It is meaningfully distinct from Biological Consciousness

3. It cannot be explained by the same systems that are sufficient to explain Biological Consciousness

#### Philosophical zombies

The [p-zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie) thought experiment is one in which a perfect physical copy of a conscious person exists without consciousness. However, the construction implies an immediate contradiction if consciousness is physical, because then the p-zombie would have the exact same consciousness as the original. I fully reject the argument on this basis alone, though I'm more than willing to elaborate if challenged.

#### Magical Thinking (commentary)

I think the myth of the Hard Problem stems from the fact that phenomenal experience doesn't ""feel"" like a brain. The brain is not fully understood, of course, but a missing understanding is not equivalent to a Hard Problem.

A good analogy that I like is a kaleidoscope. A viewer might be amazed by the world of color inside, while a 3rd party observer sees only a tube with some glued-in mirrors and beads. The viewer might be amazed by the sight and insist it cannot be explained with mere beads, but in reality the only difference is a matter of perspective. I see consciousness in very much the same way, though the viewer would be the same being as the kaleidoscope. 

[Magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking) is a [cultural universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal), which implies that humans have a strong tendency to come up with magical explanations for anything they don't understand. Personally, I believe philosophy (and metaphysics in particular) is rife with magical thinking, which prevents a reasonable consensus on major issues, and the issue of the Hard Problem is the most pervasive example I have found. Only about 37% of modern philosophers strictly accept it, but that's sufficient for it to be quite important to modern philosophy, as evidenced by the [God debate](https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/4842) which bears only 14% acceptance. 

#### Summary

While some meaningful questions about consciousness are unanswered, none have been shown to be unanswerable. Most issues, like subjectivity, are formed from poorly-defined terms and cannot be shown to be meaningfully distinct from Biological Consciousness, which is known to exist. The perceived ""Hard Problem"" actually represents a simple gap between our understanding and the reality of the brain. 

There are a lot of issues to cover here, and there are variations on the Problem that may be worth addressing, but I believe I have made a solid**** case for each of the most common arguments. Please mention which topic you are addressing if you want to try to refute a particular point.",23.0
924,t3_qxsxdr,CMV: Western nations should start making plans to evacuate Taiwan's democracy supporters and semiconductor experts,"# Introduction

I've been to both the PRC and Taiwan, and I've enjoyed my visits to both. But considering current geopolitical trends, I believe that Taiwan's days are numbered. I am very pro-democracy, but considering current geopolitical trends, I think our nations are well in decline, and that we are in no shape to fight so it's time to start bracing for impact. I very much prefer to live in a democracy, but totalitarian nations have the potential to be stronger.

This question is inspired by the post [Australia vows to help US defend Taiwan from Chinese attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/qszg4o/australia_vows_to_help_us_defend_taiwan_from) on r/AustralianPolitics, where there are a lot of comments like [the one below](https://np.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/qszg4o/australia_vows_to_help_us_defend_taiwan_from/hkk1yru?context=100):

&gt;The might of the US military (also one of the biggest polluters in the world) combined with the Australian and British militaries and those of other countries failed to defeat a group of blokes with machine guns on the back of land rovers. After almost two decades of fighting they took everything back in days. The same ‘alliance’ lost to a bunch of farmers in the jungle in Vietnam. If we did go into a war with China I reckon pretty decent chance we would lose.

They're right. Despite our large military budgets, well-trained troops and cutting-edge military equipment, we did lose in Afghanistan and Vietnam even after several years of trying to win. Now imagine the disaster if we fight against a [nuclear-armed superpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) on their doorstep.

# Here's why I think we should be ready to evacuate Taiwan's democracy supporters and semiconductor experts

* Semiconductors are only made in a few nations. The USA and Europe combined [produce only about 20% of the world's semiconductors](https://www.statista.com/chart/25552/semiconductor-manufacturing-by-location/), and Australia produces [none](https://www.aumanufacturing.com.au/the-terrible-trickiness-of-growing-an-australian-semiconductor-sector). Most semiconductors are made in East Asia, so even ignoring the Taiwan issue, this situation makes us vulnerable to supply disruptions. We should welcome Taiwanese expertise to create a semiconductor industry of our own.
* As shown in the [2019-2020 Hong Kong protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests) and the [Tiananmen Square Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests_and_massacre), the PRC is unafraid to crush democracy supporters.
* Taiwanese democracy supporters, especially after losing their democratic homeland, will value democracy equally or more than westerners who grew up taking democracy for granted.
* Some Western countries (among others) evacuated the families of Afghan interpreters and the government sympathisers of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Admittedly, [there were a lot of flaws with our evacuation](https://youtu.be/X2BUgL7Mums), and [Australia is not doing its share](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australia-yet-to-grant-a-single-humanitarian-visa-for-fleeing-afghans-senate-hears/16311311-c5ac-45c3-a4e1-cc122d3fc314). If some countries can accept poorly-educated Afghan evacuees out of humanitarian reasons, surely we can accept highly-educated Taiwanese democracy supporters and semiconductor experts (and if not for humanitarian reasons, for practical reasons since their skills are very useful)?

# Here's why I think we'll lose if we try to fight the PRC over Taiwan

* As mentioned previously, the PRC has nukes, and Taiwan is literally on their doorstep.
* The [AUKUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS) submarine deal won't be completed for at least another 10 years.
* Thanks to Western governments doing stuff like the [2003 Iraq Invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Invasion_of_Iraq), persecuting whistleblowers (like Assange and Snowden) and revelations of programs like Operations Northwoods, MKULTRA and Sea Spray, a lot of westerners distrust their governments. This has led to a rise of antivaxx and otherwise anti-authority sentiments. If our people don't trust the government, the war is already lost.
* Like us, the USSR lost in Afghanistan, and in less than 10 years, they completely collapsed. Considering our social problems (political polarisation, homelessness, unemployment, de-industrialisation), it seems like we will go down the same path. A nation can only withstand so many military failures before disintegrating.
* While VisualPolitikEN [claims that the PRC's latest military hardware is inferior](https://youtu.be/KO4QkiwZ2QY), our allegedly superior Western military hardware doesn't translate to success - we've lost most wars since World War II.
* Here in Australia, the Coalition has been playing up the Taiwan issue, and it seems like it's working to distract people from their climate inaction, their corruption scandals and the Parliamentary rape allegations. Do we really want to start a war to allow the current government to dodge accountability to an even greater extent?
* Liberal democracy will inevitably have political disagreements. Unfortunately, today's Western nations, especially Anglophone ones, have had political polarisation reach unsafe levels. There have been violent protests, including a storming of the US Capitol. We can't possibly win a war if domestic infighting is this severe.
* Australia's military is [getting applicants seeking a job due to the coronavirus recession](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-04/adf-recruiting-soars-as-unemployment-rises-under-covid19/12419240). The [USA has problems recruiting for their army](https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/05/05/pandemic-and-political-discourse-challenge-army-recruiting-efforts/). Some Western allies like Taiwan and South Korea rely on conscription. This means that the soldiers on our side will be either fighting for a paycheck, or unwilling conscripts. In addition, our militaries are not ideologically cohesive, whereas [the PRC's military is](https://www.economist.com/china/2015/02/27/red-red-army).
* u/Polymatter has a video series called [China's Reckoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTbILK0fxDY&amp;list=PLR5tswn4SFyUOm3QusvlFGbPCCAN_uXnK), showing the factors which might cripple the PRC. However, Westerners have been predicting the PRC's collapse for decades, and nothing has made it come true (whether it be the COVID-19 pandemic, the corruption problems, the Evergrande collapse). This makes me believe that the PRC isn't affected by the same economic/sociopolitical rules that affect other nations.
* PRC supporters [on this very sub](https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/o2k9uo/cmv_we_ought_to_lose_all_hope_about_the_situation/h27aey9/?context=3) frequently bring up maps showing that [most countries support the PRC's actions against Uyghurs](https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sizes/large/thediplomat-2020-10-08.png), and [most countries support the PRC's South China Sea territorial claims](https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thediplomat_2016-07-27_14-05-18.png). Say what you want about the PRC ""buying alliances"", at the end of the day, most countries are already on the PRC's side, not the West's.
* Australia will take [until 2060 to pay off its COVID-related debts](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-27/intergenerational-report-shows-economic-damage-from-covid/100248246). The USA also has a big debt problem, [which is only kept manageable through short-term fixes](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/12/1045359655/house-debt-ceiling-vote-short-term). Say what you want about the PRC's debt, but it doesn't seem to cause problems for them, while our debt causes problems for us.

# Conclusion

I sincerely believe that we will lose if we were to fight the PRC. The West is increasingly weak, increasingly isolated, and authorities are distrusted. I also believe that the PRC won't show leniency to democracy supporters if they conquer the island.

Hopefully, this scenario (i.e. the PRC conquering Taiwan and us needing to evacuate Taiwan's democracy supporters and semiconductor experts) doesn't happen. But we should at least be prepared for the possibility. If our evacuation flights get shot down by the PRC, that's on them, not us.",1603.0
925,t3_qxnyvj,CMV: Miles Morales did no punch The Lizard in the Brazilian No Way Home Trailer,"Personally I’m not sure we’ll get all 3 Spider-Men in the film, not that I don’t want them but I just don’t think they’ll get around to it.

However a lot of the speculation makes sense, I guess it’s valid, but the most recent conspiracy is that Lizard was punched by something invisible, and folks instantly assumed it was Miles Morales or another one of the Spider-Men edited out who’s punching him.

The way I see it, he wasn’t even being punched. He was turning around. We don’t know all the context but I’m sure he might’ve just noticed something else.

To boot Miles would be overkill, not that I wouldn't love for him to be there but I just don't see them doing that in the main film, perhaps an after credits scene or something.

Feel free to talk generally about how you feel about the rumours *only if a thread about my view veers into the that*, but I’m willing to back down with more convincing information that suggests either Miles Morales was there punching Lizard, Miles might be in the movie period, or any Spider-Dude other than Holland punched Lizard in that trailer.",0.0
926,t3_qxo5rw,CMV: “Antiwork” is completely impractical in practice,"For starters, I like the general idea of antiwork. I’m fairly big on leanFIRE, and I think a lot of the same general principles go hand in hand. I think basic things like a living wage, financial independence and scaleable careers are important.

That said, it feels as though a lot of antiwork ideals have bounced around in that echo chamber for a bit too long. People are protesting and boycott business in the name of what they consider fair compensation. And that idea of “fair compensation” has gotten completely unrealistic.

The biggest problem is that very few (if any) businesses could actually afford to meet a lot of anitwork’s main demands at this point. I’ve seen a number of posts/comments advocating for a ~$30/hour minimum wage (not to mention very generous PTO, healthcare, and other benefits).

My issue isn’t that I believe unskilled laborers are undeserving of this type of compensation. It’s that antiwork leaves absolutely no room for this to actually become a reality. Very few, if any, employers can afford to bring every employee up to $30/hour. It would put countless businesses - big and small - under and drive jobs out of the United States (or where ever this were to happen). The few business that could afford it, like Amazon perhaps, would be alright, but that represents a slim minority.

If antiworkers (for lack of a better term) were to get their way, it would be bad for pretty much every party involved - including the lower level workers that they’re advocating for. I’m not saying that people don’t deserve better, I’m just saying that antiwork isn’t the solution.

&amp;nbsp;

For the record, I was making $11/hour this time last year (no tips either). As much as I liked that job, it simply wasn’t sustainable and I ended up having to move on. Point being, I think I have a relatively balanced perspective on this issue.",192.0
927,t3_qxkpi9,"CMV: most self-identified ""great drivers"" are the most identifiable examples of the Dunning-Kerig effect","Actual good, safe drivers never state themselves to be ""good drivers"" because it's not a skill that needs to be spotlighted, while those who do claim to be ""great drivers"" are more likely to be the nutjob swerving between lanes and frequently cause near crashes which only entrenches their own belief of their superior driving skills. The Dunning-Kerig effect is the psychological response of being more confident in your proficiency in a skill than your ability should grant you, at least in English speaking countries, where in Japan it has been shown the opposite where individuals underestimate their own ability in a skill. To change my view, simply make a case that another set of individuals is a better example of the Dunning-Kerig Effect, and simply pointing towards those who hold political or religious beliefs with confidence isn't related to the Dunning-Kerig Effect since it is not a skill that can be demonstrated.

928,t3_qxjths,CMV: Wearing a waterproof rain coat without any other waterproof clothing is pointless,"Everyone hates getting caught in the rain, and umbrellas can be annoying to carry around and are easily forgotten. A good, waterpoof rain jacket seems like the best solution to not getting wet.


However, I've found that wearing a waterproof raincoat in the absence of other waterproof clothing gets me *more wet* than if I'd just worn whatever. That's because the water droplets don't penetrate the waterproofing of my jacket and will bead off. With nowhere to go, the water droplets drip onto my pants, leaving me soaked. If say I had just been wearing a sweater, then the rain would just get me mildly wet everywere. Wearing a rain jacket though and I'm dry on top and soaked on the bottom, which is more annoying overall.


Wearing rain pants to go to work, to go out with friends or whatnot is impractical. They are less convenient ghan a jacket, which is easily taken on and off. But as outlined above, without wearing the rain pants the rain jacket doesn't really do anything.

930,t3_qxi7n7,"CMV: if a friend tells you about something a date did or didn’t do and then follows it with, “that’s messed up, right?” then you don’t have to agree with them if you don’t think it’s “messed up.”","TL;DR - friend told me about a date they had. They told me he ordered before they got there (they weren’t late) and he didn’t ask if they were hungry until an hour into the date. They asked me “that’s not right, don’t you think?” and I didn’t side with them on some of their grievances. If you ask for my input, I’m not obligated to agree with you. Should I change views?

Longer Version - A friend of mine (we’ll call Bee) was telling me about a bumble date they had a week before. Basically, Bee gets to the restaurant very shortly after the dude, and he’d already ordered a drink. Bee thought this was rude of him and asked if I thought it was rude. I told them, “I don’t really find it rude unless they never asked if you want one, Bee.” That answer doesn’t sit right with Bee. 

Bee says they sit and they talk for an hour before he finally asks Bee if they’re hungry. Bee was hungry (had actually been saving room for this meal), but they decline because their date isn’t eating anything, and bee doesn’t want to be the only one eating on the date because it’s awkward. That was their reasoning for declining to eat. Bee goes, “isn’t that messed up? Like what kinda guy goes on a date and doesn’t offer a menu or anything to their date?” (Paraphrased a little). Overall, Bee said conversation was meh, too. Awkward pauses and all.

So I told Bee I don’t think it’s totally messed up. Was he a good date? No. Is Bee in the wrong for having certain expectations? No. Everyone can have expectations. I told Bee this. He clearly doesn’t match with them, but even if it was late in the date, Bee said no to being hungry when they were, in fact, hungry. “That’s on [Bee],” I told them. Bee talks a lot about walking to the beat of their own drum, being independent, etc and is accomplishing a lot of awesome things currently. Very proud of my friend Bee. However, I don’t think it’s reasonable to place expectations on people when you haven’t actually communicated those expectations in some way, shape, or form. Bee didn’t communicate any of these thoughts to him (Bee admitted that). I don’t think Bee is wrong for having expectations, but I didn’t like that I was expected to agree with Bee or “hype them up like all their other guy friends” as they put it. “[Bee] knows [their] worth.” “[Bee] shouldn’t have to ask a date to get [them] a menu.” I sugarcoated my replies but it sounded so fucking entitled!

Am I in the wrong? I can very easily get caught up in debates and arguments about anything (even when I shouldn’t), so I can see if I’m out of pocket here, but Bee asked for my input, and I don’t think I need to agree when I don’t. I never said the guy was vindicated in any way; I told Bee this. I always offer for food and drink when I go on a date and wait until my date gets there before ordering, but my gripe was that Bee was holding this guy to expectations that weren’t communicated before, during, or after the fact. He wasn’t a bad guy. Just not a good date. Bee didn’t take any initiative in ordering their own food. 

Is my view wrong? If someone asks for my  input and it doesn’t seem like something that requires a delicate approach, I’ll be honest with them. I don’t lie to my friends. Maybe sugarcoat things, but never lie. Especially to friends I respect as much as Bee.",0.0
931,t3_qxgb95,CMV: The motivation behind the legalization of Marijuana consumption is more by delusion than its benefits,"While the Marijuana could give potential benefits, I feel that the reason why people want to legalize these drugs is either motivated by delusional ideas maybe made by new age conspiracies or the idea that everything that restricts freedom must be a ""bad"" thing.

Everytime when there are posts about the Marijuana, people aggressively feel hope that it will be legalized and when someone makes a critique against the legalization they are swarmed by a bunch of pot heads and frustrated kids who throw insults and cherry pick the ""undebunkable"" proof that the consumption of Marijuana is a good thing. This is one of the reason why I find it difficult understanding about these hallucinogenic drugs.

So basically I feel that they want the legalization of Marjiuna just to become a burden of society and go around babbling about conspiracies and ""f\*\*\* the system!!"" manthras.

As long as there are those pot heads and frustrated teenagers that cherry pick the information about these drugs and attack those who make genuine critique against the legalization, I wont support this legalization.

932,t3_qxdvnt,Cmv: Copyright contradicts with decentralisation,"By copyright, I mean the copyright applied to information which is easily copied and spread. It can't be held secret as long as one copy has been delivered. Software doesn't really satisfy this criteria since the information, the binaries can be obfuscated  without hindering its functionality, but opensource works nonetheless. 

It is not authorship either, here. Instead I believe copyright encourages plagiarism and copycats get more attention.

The present internet is underdeveloped, so that it is possible to set up paywalls. As the internet progresses, it will be more decentralised, making it impossible to enforce copyright laws.

The problem is how the industry should be financed, in the future where it is not possible or acceptable to do advertising, or it doesn't need to.

Edit

**In a hypothetical future internet which is more decentralized, thanks to the tech advancements, copyright will become impractical to enforce, so that the only way to finance creators is donation, or something else.

That's true to some extent. However, these cars were not originally designed as track-eating cars that single-handedly gave the word ""hypercar"" its first clear definition, that was just a coincidental byproduct. Instead, Volvo designed them for practicality, reliability and safety. You see, the high drag coefficient of such brick is only bad when you're trying to accelerate or maintain speed (and for gas mileage).

934,t3_qxc7bl,"CMV: Science cannot prove free will or comment on its substance or attributes. Therefore, nobody has ever given, or can give, meaningful advice on free will and 'making the right choice'","This question follows from determinism, which basically says that because we live in a universe of cause and effect, there is no such thing as a 'choice'. Choice is based on cause and effect no more or less so than weather patterns or any other natural phenomenon.

This philosophy is backed up by science because science can't prove or describe free will. You can't point to where it resides in the brain or what it's mechanisms are. In fact, you can't even *imagine* what free will is. Unicorns aren't real, but at least you can describe them. They are an animal, they have one horn. But you can't describe free will.

So I'm not really here to argue for or against determinism. I'm Catholic and I believe in free will. You can't have a meaningful argument about determinism vs. free will. I wrote the above paragraph because of rule 2.

What I'm here to argue is that, given the lack of science, psychology, and even religion's ability to explain free will, no scientist, psychologist, priest, parent or teacher, can give meaningful advice about free will or choice.

Edit: Just realized that if you could give meaningful advice about it, it would almost violate the essence of free will.

Edit II: Most of the comments have ended up being about determinism vs free will or the vocabulary I used. Remember that my point was that you can’t give good advice about free will, and that point would hold whether it was determinism or free will. One thing you could do to change my view is simply show an example of advice about how you can make the right choice.",0.0
935,t3_qxbl6u,CMV: All videogame achievement should be described,"**Backstory:**

I was playing few games on the weekend. In one of them I was already basically won the game and was just exploring. I came up with two achievements named “???”. That’s all. There wasn’t name, description, or picture to suggest what I should do in order to get them. I knew that I could get some unique gear from them. I didn’t need it but I wanted it, so I did what you do. I googled what I should do and executed. Solution was to play tutorial simulator for 30 times to unlock a optional boss.

In second game they said that once I do secret goal in level I might unlock secret level. It didn’t specify what I needed to do or what levels had secrets in them. I played this new game for few hours and unlocked few secret levels without ever knowing what I did. I know I will boot up search engines once I finish the story in order to unlock every level.

**View:**

Achievements fall roughly to two main categories. Cumulative (like kill 100 enemies in your playthrough) that you just get by playing game for long time and task oriented (do something very specific once). If you know what you are aiming for you can get both pretty easily.

Cost of implementing description is next to nothing and we know we can search the results from the web if we want. Problem is that I don’t want to exit the game flow and spent 5 minutes on my phone to find a answer that could be in the game.

Second problem is that online guides often include other spoilers that I might not want to know about. Good example are stars in Mario Odyssey. At beginning game only tells how many there are to be found. If you don’t feel like searching them randomly you can ask stars name from a parrot. This gives you a hint to the solution and small nudge to right direction. If this isn’t enough you can just buy stars exact location. Online guides often go straight to “this is the answer” instead of giving these small steps. Most terrible achievements are those that don’t even tell they exist, so you have no hint at all where to start.

936,t3_qxbehl,CMV: Steve Rodger’s side in MCU Civil War is completely illogical.,"So in the MCU adaptation of the comic book civil war, the avengers split down the middle.  Half of them sign the Sokovia Accords and half of them don’t.

I would side with Steve, but the thing is; Tony doesn’t actually agree with the accords, and has no intention of actually obeying them.  

Tony pretty much says that the only reason he wants to cooperate with the United Nations is to keep the Avengers from becoming fugitives.  Tony disobeys the accords multiple times within days of signing them and doesn’t listen to the UN at all. 

The avengers are in the business of saving people, and how many people do you think Steve saves when he goes on the run.  Steve having to avoid being captured on sight by almost every major government surely is more of a hindrance then having to dodge the UN every once and a while.

937,t3_qx9zl8,CMV: The Education System needs to change,"For a start, most places start too early in the day. This video explains it very well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4u6oOQ77mg). But, a teenagers brain is physically wired to sleep later, this is reported in all teenagers, among all cultures, geographical locations and sex. The reason for this being how much the brain is developing during puberty and adolescence. It's not a simple fix like ""go to bed earlier"" either, as you will most likely just lay in bed until your body naturally winds down.

Another issue is how long students spend on school. On average students will need to complete about 3 hours a day, plus 6-7 hours of school. This equals to around 45 - 50 hours of schoolwork a week, it's illegal to make adults work that amount of time in some places, so why is it legal to make *children* do that much work a week?

Lookin at some of the changes that Finland made to it's schooling system as well, they show fundamental flaws most places in the world have with education. This link is where I take my source from: [https://leverageedu.com/blog/finland-education-system/](https://leverageedu.com/blog/finland-education-system/).

They've cut down the schooling hours, which is great for mental and physical health of students as it allows more time to spend with friends and family, and allows proper sleep patterns. 

They also removed standardized testing, which was a broken way to test intelligence anyways. It's not going to be accurate to throw a bunch of teens in  a stressful situation and tell them to do good. Instead, grades are marked on classroom performance, based on a marking rubric comprised by the teacher.

Another thing that the Finnish education system does well is put emphasis on having great teachers. Teachers are paid livable wages, and are treated on the same respect as surgeons in Finnish society. The teachers are also required to have a master's degree at specialized teaching schools.

The ""Cooperation over competition"" policy also teaches students how to function with groups which is very helpful to building a stronger society in the future.

I think we will be around for tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years.","Why do I think this? Well in simple terms, I've don't think I've ever heard a good reason to think humanity will die out...I know that we are amazing survivors and have reached incredible levels of success and security, especially in the last 200 years.

Factors such as our initial rise from cave dwellers to today’s society…it is an incredible testament to what we achieved especially in the face of adversity…our bounce back from the plague to the renaissance is one example…in an era where other diseases and wars were rampant…much worse than today…then the massive almost world ending eruption in Indonesia 75,000 yrs ago (the Toba catastrophe) couldn’t wipe us out when we were at our infancy…Our most vulnerable and ignorant ancestors pulled through…Then there is our ability to preserve food, cultivate food, tame animals, harvest plants…our diet is incredibly diverse, our ability to live in almost any earth bound climate is also incredible.

Now to the obstacles we may face…we could face famine due to overpopulation, but it seems obvious that this is an argument for short term population decline, not eradication…same for any pandemics…now back to the bubonic plague…this was by far the worst pandemic we’ve experienced and it gave rise to the renaissance due to more resources being available p/person afterwards... It also doesn’t take into account modern medicine that would make the plague very hard to top.

Now climate change: Is climate change that bad that all of humanity would starve? How could this be? This I feel is where I'm less knowledgeable...but in the event we had multiple crop failures the human population would simply decline until the point where the food available can sustain the present population…We see this cyclical pattern play out in nature all the time. I see no reason that we couldn't grow crops...it could just be that we grow them in different parts of the world to a lesser extent where it was historically too cold etc.

Then there is the issue of time…this wouldn’t be a fast occurrence…it might start with some crop failures, then increased prices for staples and knowing how people are…once the developed world needs to sacrifice luxuries to afford bread and butter you can bet your last dollar shit will get done to mitigate the issue…I cannot see it reaching the point of worldwide starvation.

Will we blow ourselves up in war? Hard to say for sure…I can definitely see a catastrophe of some sort occurring, I can see nuclear disaster wiping out most of us but I still find it unlikely (think of the steps it would take for that happen and then consider how likely each step is on its own and then combine the probability of all of those things happening) …Now if it did happen then I think the American paranoia during the cold war has taught us that people fucking prepare for that shit. Hideouts, bunkers, years’ worth of tinned food etc…We could at our own hands cause a dystopia, but it wouldn’t last forever…. We’d surely bounce back like we always have.

It’s one thing to support a school or team, but aside from the mascot changing, nothing else is different. For example, if my old high school, whose mascot is the Mountaineers, decided they were going to change it, I wouldn’t be posting on social media complaining about it, saying I’ll always be a Mountaineer.

942,t3_qx6rm4,CMV: There's no reason to single out NFTs as bad for the environment.,"A lot of people hate NFTs because the blockchains they operate are on use a lot of energy. Well, not all of them - some blockchains are proof-of-stake - but some of them use a lot of energy.

I think it's a valid criticism. Completely valid! But most people who hate NFTs don't apply their hate evenly. It only makes sense that you should also hate Christmas lights, video games, Netflix, etc. Because they're all massive uses of electricity that are purely for entertainment. The exact same use case as NFTs.

But I find that NFTs catch way more than their fair share of hate for this. You don't see nearly as many ""video gamers are destroying the environment!"" people as you do ""NFTs are destroying the environment!"" people.

And I think this is rooted in the fact they're angry they didn't think of something so simple and get rich during the process. Just like when people see a simple piece of art at a museum that sold for millions and get jealous and think ""Anyone could have made that!"" You know the art I'm talking about: the kind where it's like a totally blank canvas except one solid-color line down the middle.

Basically, my view is that there is no real reason to single out NFTs as a waste of electricity. Yes, it's valid to criticize them, but people who focus specifically on NFTs are probably doing it because they're angry they didn't get in early enough to make the easy money. Maybe it's even subconscious and they aren't aware that's why they hate them so much.",0.0
943,t3_qx56ot,CMV: Turkey is gobble awful and should be dropped from Thanksgiving dinner menu,"Every year around this time, I read a thousand online tip articles and hear anecdotes from coworkers about how to cook the “perfect,” delicious, moist turkey for Thanksgiving dinner. I simply don’t understand why turkey is worth the effort.

My primary issue with turkey is the final product. Even the best dark meat I’ve ever tasted is about as good as average chicken. My next qualm is preparation. Why does the U.S. favor a barely better than chicken butter ball when there are so many ways it can falter while cooking?

On a larger scale, Thanksgiving creates an artificial inflation in demand. This means that there are hundreds of thousands of turkeys that are raised up for the express purpose of being slaughtered for a single holiday. The counter argument could be made that other meats would have to be raised and slaughtered in place of turkey; in my mind this would be a more natural approach and the market could handle demand with less waste and therefore less slaughter.

I am open to changing my mind in a few ways. Firstly, I would enjoy hearing objective benefits about turkey meat that make it enjoyable or at least predictable to cook. Second, I’m open to ethical arguments about turkey demand. As always, some people may have heard my view a million times before and you have an ace tucked away just for me.

Note: this post is based on U.S. holiday tradition. Those from outside the U.S., please feel free to chime in your perspective as an outsider looking in.

Edit: I don’t want this to turn into a chicken vs turkey debate. I love smoked brisket as a turkey alternative. Also, this post is not about my subjective dislike of turkey. I am attempting to make a larger argument that turkey should not be the main meat for thanksgiving. Saying you like turkey won’t change my view. Why should it remain the holiday favorite over all other options?",0.0

Public like/dislike ratio is important for both creating and controlling hype.

As a result, we have few doctors and supply and demand dictates that they get paid a lot. These doctors are incentivized to keep it going once they become high paid doctors because that keep their salary high.

947,t3_qx08i8,"CMV: Sokka (from Avatar: the Last Airbender) is a truer, better version of Ron Weasley than what is portrayed in the Harry Potter movies","To start off with, AtLA and HP have an extremely similar ""Golden Trio.""  Aang and Harry are both at the center of everything: heroes hunted by the bad guys, chosen by destiny for great things, wielding 'powers others know not.' Both storylines focus not just on how these protagonists fight evil but also on how they grow and mature. We see two boys learn to use their power and grow into heroes. While they may posses power, it is often their bravery, loyalty, and overall noble character that truely sets them apart. Hermione and Katara both tend to serve as voices of reason, calming the more hot-headed boys. Both extremely skilled and respected in their respective studies, magic and water-bending. Both can be a bit motherly and insistent on following the rules, but we always know that it won't stop them for risking it all to save their friends.

It's the third members of these trios that I found the most different. Or rather, I feel these characters should have been the most similar, but they aren't, even though there are a ton of similarities in the roles they play. Sokka is a goof. It's his comedy and humor (many times at his expense) that provides a lot of the comedic moments for the series. For much of *Avatar*, we laugh at funny, embarrassing things happening to Sokka, even if he really doesn't deserve as much against him as he gets. This is much the same as the portrayal of Movie Ron. At a glance, they're both the one who's serving as the comedy by looking foolish (and not doing a whole lot else).

BUT there's clearly more to Sokka than just his comedic role, and even that has deeper purpose than an audience's amusement (shown in the episode ""Sokka's Master""). Sokka's humor has meaning in the series, keeping morale high and helping the group stay united. Without him, the group easily becomes bored and not well-directed. Furthermore, Sokka is the undisputed strategist and planner of the Avatar trio. On many occasions, his ideas and tactics are what help the trio achieve their goals or get out of bad situations, and day-to-day he's the one who makes sure that they're moving in the right direction (geographically and metaphorically). 

This is what Movie Ron should have been like if they wanted to do the character justice. Perhaps a bit on the goofy side, but undeniably a valuable member of the group with both intelligence and heart. One who knows more about the world than the protagonist, and one who makes up for his lack of special powers with insight and strategy. Like Sokka, Ron doesn't really have the powers/abilities that Harry does or the prodigy-like skills of Hermione. However, while Sokka continues to prove his worth as a strategist, leader, and a morale-booster time and time again throughout the series, Movie Ron's strategic value seems to end after the First Year Chess match, which itself is very downplayed in the movies, and his humor is almost always exclusively for the audience's benefit (if even that). 

Essentially,

1.  The Harry Potter movies demoted the character of Ron Weasley, sacrificing much of his value and importance to the group for cheap comedic effect at his expense
2. Sokka is a very similar character to book Ron, both by the group he's in and his contributions to it
3. Based on the above, Sokka's character is better and more true to the original book character than the movie portrayal of Ron Weasley",21.0
948,t3_qwzzto,CMV: There is no good reason for demanding a paternity test as the default for married and monogamous parents who trust each other.,"To start with, if there is evidence that it should be questioned who the father is, then of course it is reasonable to want one.  Easy example would be an open relationship, where there is no cheating, they trust each other, but obviously it's entirely possible that an accident happened with the wife and a partner who wasn't the husband.  Getting a test in this scenario does not show a lack of trust, but a reasonable response to the reality of their situation.

When there is no actual evidence of some sort to suspect it, then the only reason to want one is lack of trust in the partner or irrationality, both to a degree that show the relationship itself has deep problems and the couple probably shouldn't be having children anyways, much less have gotten married.

For the trust issue, in order for a monogamous couple to have a child where the husband isn't the birth father, the mother would have to be actively lying to her partner about something she knows she did.  It is completely reasonable for her to interpret the request that way, expected really, and this shows a deep problem in the relationship.

**Trigger warning below, sexual assault**

I have seen one attempt at an explanation for how the husband would not suspect his wife of cheating, but still think a test should be done, which involved her being raped without her knowledge through drugs.  This is, frankly, completely unreasonable to think.  A thing being possible does not make it likely, and does not make it rational to test for it.  Someone who honestly is worried about this with zero evidence (again, if there is actual evidence, then I am not talking about that situation) is irrational to a degree that shows deep issues, to the point where the wife would be justified in not wanting to stay with him.  There are all sorts of things that *could* happen in life, but something technically being possible does not make it reasonable to prepare for it, especially when the method of doing so would deeply hurt someone.

Edit: It should be noted that when we talk about ""trust"" in this sense, it doesn't mean ""I hope you remembered to lock the door"" but instead ""I don't believe you would intentionally do something that we both know would be a deep breach of trust and then lie to me about it.""  It's not ""just being sure,"" suspecting the child is not the father's requires believing the mother cheated and then lied about it.",0.0

When things do get to court, lack of evidence causes the charges to be dropped or if/when things actually go to trial and filings are completed, too many rapists get off without any jail time due to their status as a college student, skin color, position in power, nice attitude, being Bill Cosby, or other sociopathic abilities to appeal  to the judge as a good person.

Its not like i'm an addict, and I would like the topic of obviously harmful addiction not be touched, but I re-evaluated some of the material I was looking at through the eyes of a feminist stance and ""normal persons"" like my parents, my girlfriend etc. and was a little bit terrified, how grotesque and violent it looks, when women gag on deepthroats, scream when having anal sex and of course cry and are depicetd as unwilling in a lot of hentai stuff.

Consider a crab that could forcibly eject something akin to a stingray stinger. Or many smaller spines. Or perhaps an ink spray / vemon spray.  


Normally, crabs are defeated in three ways:  


1) A specialized predator obtains a hold on the crab and defeats it's armor. Such as a starfish or snail. A ranged defense can engage these foes before they get close enough to hold on.  


2) A large predator such as a ray or shark just bodies the crab and eats it. Large predators are easy to hit. Engaging the predator before it gets it eating distance would really help.   


3) A small mobile predator out maneuvers the crab. Similar to the large predator, a ranged defense at least gives an ability to threaten the maneuverable predator.

953,t3_qwrbd8,"CMV: The GOP focus on ""election integrity"" is hypocritical bullshit.","I was just looking at [the official platform of the American Republican Party](https://www.gop.com/about-our-party/) and saw this in the second sentence, front and center:

&gt; Today, as those principles come under attack from the far-left, we are engaged in a national effort to fight for our proven agenda, take our message to every American, grow the party, ***promote election integrity***, and elect Republicans up and down the ballot.

In my view, elections that have integrity are free, fair, and equal. No election should favor one party or one constituency over another. All votes should be equal. All properly-cast votes should be counted. All voters should have equal access to the ballots.

In theory, election integrity is great. But when you look at the GOP's *actual* impact on elections in America, it's clear the the GOP doesn't actually care about ""election integrity"" as most voters would understand it.

- They have [gerrymandered state legislatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/politics/republicans-2022-redistricting-maps.html) to such an extreme extent that in a country in which the GOP has lost the popular vote in 8 of the last 9 presidential elections, they [basically cannot lose more than 195 congressional races](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/). They only need to win 28 of the 72 competitive races in an average election year to win a majority in the House. *They have gerrymandered their way to an electoral advantage* at the expense of America's electoral fairness/integrity.

- The Senate is built to advantage the GOP's rural voting base over the Democrats' urban strongholds. This obviously is not exclusive to modern politics and isn't the direct cause of today's GOP. Yet if the GOP wanted to increase ""election integrity"" they would seek to eliminate archaic systems and rules that favor one set of voters for no actual benefit to our electoral system.

- Their well documented attempts to require voting IDs that Democratic voters are statistically more unlikely to already have. They are essentially creating extra hurdles for certain voters to combat a problem that doesn't exist on a scale large enough to justify those voter identification requirements.

- Their complete unwillingness to investigate or address foreign interference in recent elections.

- Republican-elected presidents have appointed Supreme Court justices which have done massive damage to America's voting systems. Decisions like *Citizens United* allowed the GOP's billionaire donor base to flood elections with money, while literally ruling unconstitutional any efforts to level the playing field in *[Arizona Free Enterprise v Bennett](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010/10-238)*. In the months preceding the 2020 election they allowed Florida to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of likely Democratic voters in [a shadow docket case]
(https://www.propublica.org/article/in-florida-the-gutting-of-a-landmark-law-leaves-few-felons-likely-to-vote) that essentially upheld a racist poll tax.  Don't get me started on *Bush v Gore*.

- The comical and blatantly fraudulent attempts by the party to subvert the 2020 election by attempting to throw out millions of properly-cast votes in several states. 

It's patently obvious that when the GOP says they want to promote election integrity they simply mean they want to prevent Democrats from voting, and when they do vote, to prevent those votes from being counted. They simply can't say that out loud, so they stretch the concepts of ""election integrity"" and ""free speech"" to such extreme extents that the terms effectively become meaningless when held to any sort of scrutiny.

Obviously the Democratic Party isn't an angel. They definitely also participate in gerrymandering. It's just not in the same ballpark as the Republicans, and the Democrats don't pretend that ""election integrity"" is a central tenet of their party platform. It isn't even mentioned until the eleventh paragraph of their [platform preamble](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/preamble-2/).

955,t3_qwoybr,CMV: A loving God would not send people to hell (Christian focus),"  

I’m basing this off of conversations that I’ve had with a lot of born-again Christians. And this post is directed at them. I’m not sure how many I will find on Reddit, though. 

I want to start by saying that I’m not an atheist and I’m actually very much interested in religion in general, but one thing I cannot accept about Christianity is the notion that people who do not accept Christ as their savior spend eternity in hell. 

Christians will often state that God’s love is unconditional and site John 3:16 as the source. Let’s have a look:

*For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.*

This is not unconditional love. The condition is very clear. We must believe in one particular version of God. Unconditional love means loving someone despite any wrongdoing. Mere mortals are fundamentally flawed but able to forgive people for all kinds of things. People forgive infidelity, theft, even murder. It’s not easy for sure, but it happens. If people can do it, why can’t a perfect being? 

Secondly, I have never really understood the idea of “gave His one and only Son”. He sent His Son, who is actually part of God in the first place, to the world for 33 years. Then He died in what is surely a very horrible way, but, let’s be honest, many people have been tortured to death. And, according to the Christian Bible many of those same people then had their everlasting souls cast into never ending agony because they did not believe in the Christian God. Christ was eternal in the first place. So, was 33 years really such a sacrifice? I’m not trying to be disrespectful. It just doesn’t make sense to me. 

I want to say, that I am comfortable with the idea of a Creator being who is not loving and sends people to hell because He’s kind of a sadist. I see no reason to believe that this is not true. I’m also comfortable with the idea that God grants eternal life to people who believe in Him and everyone else just slips into nothingness. That also makes sense, I guess. But, I can’t wrap my head around the idea of a loving God who casts people into an eternity of suffering. 

I’m sorry but that does not make any kind of sense to me. Change my view, please.",583.0
956,t3_qwmhbp,"CMV: The primary reason why Mexican-Americans have lower average outcomes is because a disproportionate amount of them come here illegally, not because of racism","Why is the Mexican-American community poorer, on average, compared to other immigrant populations? This is something we must ask ourselves. Most people explain away this inequality of outcome with inequality of opportunity,  that is, Mexican-Americans perform worse on average because there is more racism against them.

I disagree, it is precisely because a disproportionate amount of them come here illegally that they are poorer, on average. The 57% of [undocumented Mexicans don't even have a HIGH SCHOOL](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/23/u-s-undocumented-immigrants-are-more-proficient-in-english-more-educated-than-a-decade-ago/) level of education, these are ~~low IQ~~ people that simply don't have that much to offer in terms of skills. For comparison, the figure is 8% in the general population. Because of this low level of education, Mexican-Americans work in very low wage fields, as low wages are all they have to offer. They aren't being paid less because of their race, they're being paid less because of their lower-than-average qualifications. Normally, our legal immigration system filters out those who have little hope of success, in order to support meritocracy and to ensure that permanent underclass does not develop. However, illegal immigration circumvents this filter, resulting in an influx of ~~low IQ~~ unskilled workers. This ultimately results in higher poverty rates in Mexican-American communities, and consequently higher crime among the *descendants* of illegal immigrants (illegals themselves commit crime are lower rate due to fear of deportation). This effect continues throughout the generations, as the American children of these undocumented immigrants face less opportunity due to their parents lack of education and skills, and are therefor less educated themselves.

Racism can't be the primary reason Mexican-Americans aren't successful on average, as Cubans, Peruvians, and Argentines have both found success in America, even though they are of the same race as Mexicans. If race was truly the factor, and not a difference in merit/qualifications, then you would expect Cuban and Peruvians to be poor as well, and yet they are more successful than even the average White American. Additionally, most Mexicans came here in the 70s, after segregation had ended and racial discrimination was made illegal. Even Black Nigerian immigrants are now richer than White Americans, and I think we can agree that Black people have experienced more racism than Mexicans. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income)) Similarly, Asian-Americans have also achieved a great deal of success, despite severe discrimination against them in the past. The reason these groups are more successful than Mexicans is not because there is more racism against Mexicans, but because there is more illegal immigration from Mexico, and therefor the workers are less skilled and consequently paid less. [Asian Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/29/key-facts-about-asian-americans/) and Nigerian Americans are better educated than even the average White American, and are thus paid better for it. This has occurred because our race-blind merit-based legal immigration system specifically selects for those who are skilled. If Mexicans had the same level of skilled ***legal*** migration as Asians, they would just as successful, as only the most qualified would come here. If we truly want the Mexican-American community to be successful, instead of a permanent underclass, we would oppose illegal immigration.

TLDR; There is a higher level of illegal immigration means less successful communities as unskilled workers are not filtered our. Since the Mexican American community has a higher level of illegal migration, their community is less successful on average.",0.0

3. The worst see this as vindication of injustice and as a focal point to escalate violence and retribution against those that facilitated the shootings. In terms of the procurement of weapons, travel and if  exonerated a system of law itself. 

Personally feel that he ( Rittenhouse) should at least be charged for Man slaughter and face the maximum sentence within the law. He went looking for trouble and found it. He wasn't just sitting at home and people broke in

On the other hand if it's true he was attacked and he defended himself with a legal fire arm. But that dosn't negate the fact that he intentionally put himself in that situation

Refugees tend to need support from the government, which is an economic negative. Now, I know people will say that the refugees will return it through finding work. But again, so can non refugees without spending or relying on the governments money 

Non refugee immigrants tend to be wealthier, to my understanding, and bring in money. 

Refugees, by nature of being refugees, will have their hands tied and probably loads of baggage. Some refugees probably took the first plane out of whatever country they are fleeing from. Some refugees will have stress. Stress, by nature of being stressed, tend to have lower productivity. 

Again, this is not a fuck refugees or fuck immigrants post. As an individual they are fine, but  my view is mostly from an economic perspective.

Anyways, I think my view is, if we had a refugee immigrant and an immigrant that's coming in for work, wouldn't it be more economically beneficial to pick the economic immigrant all the time.

But the problem is recreation. VR is little more than  a gimmick when it comes to entertainment, and the issue is effort. Electronic entertainment is supposed to be easy and relaxing, and enjoying VR takes a ton of effort.

Do you have a small apartment, like most young, tech enthusiasts? Time to move all of your furniture to get adequate space. 

Did you just have a long day and you want to relax?  Nope, you have to stay standing and move around.

Even down to your looks. Did you do your hair for a fun night out? Time to ruin it by having two straps tied to your head.

Lastly, it's also a money issue. The headset is costly for the narrow entertainment desires it currently fulfills.

There are other, smaller issues, but those are the biggest imo.

I'm a 22 yo male college grad, and I work in the tech space. I check almost every box for their target market. Almost all of my friends are college-educated as well and earn decent money.

There are a lot of explanations, some from trans people, that is not even a thing. I suppose I have been fooled by social media again. Deltas are currently being awarded and consider my view, if not changed, null and void.** 

**Thank you!**

Hey Y'all!

So normally I hate the transgender debate on this sub, because it often boils down to: ""I don't like trans people and want to discover the correct way to couch that belief."" That said, I have noticed this trend lately and am wondering what I am missing here. It appears that, in certain internet circles, we have started calling the feeding of a newborn as ""chest feeding"", as a gender neutral alternative to ""breast feeding"". The thought that immediately came to mind is ***why are we gendering the word breast?*** Of course, as a cis straight man, the first thing that comes to MY mind when I hear the word breast, is a female bust, but I thought the whole point was to expand the word ""gender"" beyond how it is imagined in a cis mens' collective heads.

The word ""breast"" is a gender neutral term and always has been.

**Webster's Dictionary defines breast as follows**: either of the pair of mammary glands extending from the front of the chest in pubescent and adult human females and some other mammals ***also*** **: either of the** ***analogous*** **but rudimentary organs of the male chest especially when enlarged**

**The Mayo Clinic defines male breast cancer as such:**  Male breast cancer is a rare cancer that forms in the breast tissue of men. Though breast cancer is most commonly thought of as a disease that affects women, breast cancer does occur in men.

**Breastplate:** A piece of armor worn over the chest. Of course, due to the nature of the time, this was mostly worn by men.

**AND PERHAPS THE MOST DAMNING PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF MY VIEW:** Male breast are capable of producing milk. Of course this requires the help of the hormone prolactin, but the circuitry is there and fully functional.

Perhaps this is on me for fundamentally misunderstanding a community I am trying to be an ally of. But the way I see it, by calling it ""chest feeding"" we are freely giving power to those who would definitively define gender-neutral human anatomy as ""male"", or ""female"".",13.0

My arguments essentially boils down to these few things.

1. At birth, we are born with a set of genes that influence how our life is shaped. Some people will be born with conditions that effect their ability to empathize while others will not. Some will have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia and others will not. 

2. As life advances into childhood, our surroundings affect our ability to grow, learn, and adapt. We become the offspring of our surroundings. For example, childhood trauma can lead to arrested development. Abusive households can lead to bad behavior.

3. The events we experience shape our actions. If you cheat on a test and get caught, next time you will either not cheat or cheat better.

4. If all these things are, in fact, true, then we must simply come to the conclusion that we are not in control of our own actions and our actions are a direct result of our environments.

In anticipation of the holidays and *lovely* family conversation that will likely be brought up, I was trying to establish what I believe and how I will respond to the wide variety of opinions I will be encountering in the next two months. This popped into my head, and I realized that I don't have a good answer for why one transition should be inherently acceptable and one not. I'm very open to hearing where my thought process may be in error here. Yes, this is a throwaway account. This is a very sensitive topic and, while I'm genuinely and honestly curious about learning more on this, I don't want it associated with my personal account. 

My understanding for the ""justification"" of being transgender (not that it should need justification, but the existence of it is still a debated topic by many) is that, broadly, an individual should not be forced to be trapped in a body they do not identify with, for whatever reason that might be. Individuals should be free to express who they are and be comfortable in their identity, which does not have to perfectly line up with their biological features. Sex/gender and race/ethnicity are two aspects of identity that have physical/biological characteristics but, socially, have a specific impact on how we interact with the world and how it interacts with us.

Obviously, this is limited to circumstances where individuals genuinely desire to change their identity, not just altering their appearance for entertainment or comedy (like ""blackface"").

968,t3_qwbj5m,CMV: Political correctness causes more prejudice and division.,"  Firstly, I want to clarify what I mean by political correctness as I see it as a spectrum to some extent. I have no problem with everyone agreeing with the fact that certain terms are offensive and we should try not to use them in polite conversation. 

I even respect people's right to use those words if they are targeted at them (for example black people having the right to use the n word), however I do think this can cause a lot of confusion with words that are less well known for being so offensive.

My issue lies with the ever-changing nature of language and the fact that now if you say the wrong word once, your life is ruined if anyone finds out no matter how innocent or based in ignorance the original remark was.

From what I've seen in the media and what I've experienced talking to a variety of people, this fear mongering in the media gets 3 main responses from people.

1, Apathy - We are so used to the fact that people are generally assholes that nobody cares any more when another person comes out as one.

2. Righteousness - For those people who already were prejudice against that group, someone being ""cancelled"" for using offensive language becomes a martyr of sorts showing how that group is ruining the world. Or they become very defensive with this idea that other people are taking away their free speech and they have a right to say whatever the hell they want no matter who it offends.

Or for people who already were fighting against that type of discrimination, their voices get louder given the first group of people even more ammo to see them as extremists and just solidify their belief system.

3. Fear- There are a growing number of people who are seeing this ""cancel culture"" come out more online and political correctness being used as their main reasoning who are terrified. They don't want to say or do the wrong thing or have their lives ruined so they just avoid anyone that is different from them. Grouping us down into smaller and smaller social bubbles until we avoid anyone who doesn't look, sound, think like us out of fear of the consequences.

So the outcome is the people who already hated, hate even more, the people who cared or didn't care, still do or don't, yet a growing number of people are now being pushed out all together because they just don't want to do something wrong whilst trying to help.

We are then left with a tiny minority of people who can work together, whilst everyone else is either hating or hiding causing more division and prejudice over time.",384.0

Though the vaccine has little to no adverse effects associated with it, a 0.01% mortality rate seems a little low to effectively justify a child’s loss of body autonomy. This is a hill I have no desire to die on, and my bias is definitely skewed in favor of vaccination in general. However, the only argument I can think of in favor of public school vaccine mandates is to protect school staff that may be some combination of a higher risk age group and/or immunocompromised. But it would also seem an inevitability that school staff would eventually become infected even if there was unanimous vaccination amongst the students and staff by virtue of the conditions of their environment - meaning highly populated areas in enclosed spaces for long lengths of time.

However, I think that telling vulnerable patients to “go smoke a plant” is irresponsible.

Opiates are a massively beneficial class of pharmaceuticals but we never prescribe patients “poppies.” They are processed into compounds with known effects, such as morphine. Processed cannabinoids are already being used as validated, FDA-approved treatments (Epidiolex, etc.) to great effect. The endocannabinoid system was only discovered a couple decades ago, so there is a whole realm of medications affecting that system waiting to be developed. 

I have also held a cannabis prescription in the past. They sent me to the dispensary where a 20-something stoner helped me find the strains that might be helpful rather than harmful. I’ve seen my friend with epilepsy fall into convulsive seizures after accidentally smoking the wrong strain. I’ve seen people have terrible anxiety after using the wrong edibles. Every personal experience I’ve had has reinforced my belief that “medical cannabis” is a dangerous and unethical prescription.

People should be prescribed regimented doses of compounds that are clinically tested to produce the desired results with known side-effects.

Random strains of cannabis from a dispensary staffed by college students do not seem to fit those requirements.

972,t3_qw6uya,CMV: Medicare should be fixed before proposing Medicare for All,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not against Medicare for All as a principle, but think Medicare needs to be fixed first so that we have our seniors properly protected against rising medical bills (immediate need) before we force people to potentially go onto an antiquated and inadequate medical plan.

Currently I have private insurance for me and my family.  I have a deductible of $3,350 with an out of pocket max of $5,000 for the entire family.  Between my deductible and OOP max I have a 10% co-pay.  There are other details, but I will leave it there.  I know this is better insurance than most people, but is a reasonable starting point for what we should offer our seniors.

Medicare can't be boiled down to such simple terms.  Medicare Part A has a deductible of $1,556 per person, which covers 60 days in the hospital, then a co-insurance of $389 per day in the hospital for the next 30 days, and then it gets even more confusing.  For this, I am paying $3,409 this year for a plan that I will not use for many years.  I can live to be 150 and never break even on this insurance.

Medicare part B costs more money in premiums, has an additional deductible of $203/person, and then a co-pay of 20% with no annual max out of pocket.  So with Part A and B, two married partners will have a higher combined deductible than I have for my whole family with a higher copay and no annual OOP max.

Medicare doesn't even cover prescription drugs (embedded in mine), dental, hearing, or vision (which I get through separate plans).  This is just wholly broken.  

Medicare should cover medical, long term care, dental, prescription drugs, vision, and hearing in one plan with one deductible, a max of 20% co-pay, and a reasonable annual and lifetime out of pocket.  This should be proposed as a stand-alone bill and then any attempt to add people to the Medicare roles should be considered after we get a fix for the current mess that is so confusing that most seniors don't even understand it.

You won't change my mind by a Republican vs. Democrat blame game, btw.  I strongly believe there is the willingness for bipartisan legislation to fix Medicare if that is the only thing in the bill.

EDIT:  I understand that Medicare for All attempts to fix the problems with Medicare while also putting everybody on Medicare.  That really isn't an argument that changes my mind because Medicare for All is unpassable at this point.  My question is why not make the fixes first?  Why not put forth a stand-alone bill to fix Medicare?  Some have argued that it wouldn't pass either, but it is a nonsensical argument to say ""a portion of the bill can't pass so I am going to demand that portion to be couched into a larger bill that has even less support.""",13.0

I don’t think this is a relevant factor at all, and only look at the “time to destination” portion of Google maps. We’ve made decisions not to eat at particular restaurants, stop by particular parks, or run errands because things were not “on the way,” even if it didn’t affect our overall estimated time of arrival (ETA) because those stops were near highway ramps. 

My view is, even if we head backwards for part of the way, who cares? Basically, my husband thinks that there is value to driving in a “pretty” route that’s a circle, oval or line (to and from), and I don’t think there is ANY value in what your route looks like, and the only discussion should be around ETA (and often times, a few minutes difference in ETA may be totally worth it for a better restaurant). He would rather run the errand on a different day when it's more convenient, but I think if we have the time, we should just go for it.

Edit: A lot of these answers seem to be comparing real world evidence of exaggerated negatives from the media, against “possibilities” that have yet to come. Which brings some hope to look for, but still feels like a carrot on a stick.

Edit 2 possible answer: the best answer so far, and has been stated by a few people, is that this happens to every generation. But when it happens to “you/me”. It seems more real than the issues in the past that we conquered. So while there is no “answer” to change the view of being concerned with world ending problems, or perceived world end problems, it’s normal to have a time of despair and hopelessness. And if you persevere, like generations before us, we will see that most of us will be just fine. So it is nice to know there’s not a direction or solution we can see currently, hence the hopelessness, if you stick around and do the right thing, you’ll see (I’ll see) that these issues weren’t that end of the world as we know it.

976,t3_qw1qjt,"CMV: The blame for the AstroFest tragedy falls on LiveNation/security/organizers, not Travis Scott, and Scott is being unfairly targeted simply on fame alone.","Now that over a week has passed since the AstroFest tragedy, and a 125-person class action has been filed against Travis Scott, I am failing to understand why the masses are angry at Scott when they *should* be mad at LiveNation, incl. security and organizers that they may or may not have hired.  

A festival is the product of many peoples' work. You've got performing artists, whose job it is to entertain. This invariably involves using in-ear monitors (think earbuds if you aren't familiar) to play back their voice so they can hear themselves over the crowd and music. There's smoke, lights, and (based on the time of day here) darkness obscuring their view. They are expected to perform, entertain, and often (if Scott's lyrics are any indication) do so under the influence of drugs and alcohol, impairing their perception.

Meanwhile, hundreds if not thousands of security and medical staff are hired by the venue/organizers, in this case LiveNation. I may be biased because LiveNation a.k.a. Ticketmaster is a massive, almost monopolistic company and I feel they should be broken up under antitrust laws for being anti-competitive, but that is not the crux of this CMV. Regardless, it is not the job of the artist himself to be a medical or security professional; the artist merely hires LiveNation, who owns the venue, to staff these areas. Those folks are the ones in charge of the safety and security.

I say all of this because it appears (without having seen the actual court filings) that the civil lawsuit is alleging negligence. To prove negligence, generally, you need to demonstrate that 1) the defendant had a duty of care, and 2) the defendant breached that duty. Based on what I've outlined above, it seems to me that the guy on stage relieved himself of any possible duty **by hiring the organizers to do those jobs.** Practically speaking, how is someone supposed to give a performance if they're also expected to be simultaneously working security and medical support? It seems to me that LiveNation, etc. had the duty of care here, not Scott. 

Moreover, there appears to be evidence that Scott [went to the after-party unaware of the injuries](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/travis-scott-went-party-astroworld-was-unaware-tragedy-source-says-rcna5080). There are only two plausible explanations for why an artist would continue to party in the wake of mass casualties: either 1) they just don't care, or 2) they were genuinely unaware of what occurred. People point to Travis noticing an ambulance in the crowd; I can tell you as someone who has attended many festivals that people take a ton of drugs and sometimes overdose, have seizures, or take a drug different than what they thought they had. I've seen people have seizures at a Danny Brown concert and I have personally passed out from drinking and heat exhaustion at a Red Hot Chili Peppers show; both times medical staff handled the situations and the shows continued. I was personally put in a small ambulance and removed from a crowd at the RHCP show, and I would not blame the artist for my own dumbassery in getting drunk on a 98 degree day. It is near impossible for Travis Scott to have known whether the ambulance was there for a drug or similar medical emergency, or due to more systemic issues like crowd crush, etc. 

Meanwhile, it appears that much of the issue stems from 1) overcrowding of the venue, due to poor security and 2) poor festival layout design. As to 1), people have pointed to the now-deleted tweet from Scott ""NAW WE STILL SNEAKING THE WILD ONES IN"". This is a far, far cry from Scott's actions in 2017 for example. **Travis has not been charged with any crimes**, possibly because there is no evidence to support such a charge. In [2017 he was charged](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/travis-scott-arrested-charged-arkansas-concert-inciting-riot/) with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, etc. It appears that, unlike in 2017, Scott did not go on stage and encourage fans to blow past security. If anything, it was not Scott's job to work security, and the influx of people without tickets seems to be a failure of the front gate security if anyone. As to 2), it appears the festival was very poorly laid out. [Aerial photos](https://i0.wp.com/www.expandingawarenessrelations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-14-at-14-49-35-Astroworld-Festival-video-Drone-11-captures-stage-and-area-where-eight-people-died.png?w=1162&amp;ssl=1) show pockets near the stage where guests were surrounded by barriers on **three sides.** This is objectively stupid design, and I sincerely doubt that Scott personally designed this layout; it was LiveNation.

Travis Scott is not a perfect person, but he is being unfairly targeted because it was ""his"" festival and his headlining set. Headlines don't read ""People died at LiveNation concert"" but instead ""People died at Travis Scott concert"". To impose responsibility on one artist for the failures of organizers and security is unfair. 

I am open to changing my view on this, and I admittedly do not have all the evidence or answers. But I still fail to see why people aren't blaming LiveNation more.",0.0
977,t3_qvxtnl,CMV: there are more than two genders,"Like the title says theres more than two genders, with the amount of technology we have now we can change people to other genders or even more recently we can do things like be a non binary so that makes 4 genders and then theres things like wolfkin and bisexual so that makes 6 genders

Male, female, trans , non binary, wolfkin and bisexual

I ain't gonna list something like attack helicopter because that is a false gender

I also just searched some more theres otherthings like poly , pan.

Change my view, I'm bout getting science articles and or opinions alls I gonna say is be nice to each other, it's the internet, treat it like a video game.",0.0
978,t3_qvvidg,CMV: Following news stories about child abduction is a sick form of entertainment,"I'm not sure how common this is in other countries, but here in Australia we seem to regularly have a national following of a child who has gone missing/has been abducted. It's almost always the number one story and every new lead is breaking news and will have several news articles associated with it.

I absolutely hate when people ask me my opinion of it because it just seems like we are discussing it for entertainment purposes. Almost like wondering who is the killer is a murder mystery book. I don't read those books, but I don't mind that people enjoy them for entertainment. But when we use an actual child and their family to spice up our day to discuss/view something thrilling, then I think this is just sad.

I'm sure some people say it's a good way of educating people on child safety. I don't think this is necessary because people are already insanely protective of their children. And even if it is effective for this reason, I don't think it needs to be followed in such intense detail and have so many people so invested in the outcome",18.0
979,t3_qvupyk,CMV: Instagram isn’t fake: your life just sucks and you’re taking is out on them.,"Everyday I see people telling you to not believe instagram because its just a highlight reel and that its not the entire picture of their life.

The problem isn’t in the fact that its highlight reel, its just that you can’t curate your own highlight reel, because your life doesn’t have highlight - it’s monotonous, repetitive, and dull.

There’s nothing wrong with filters. They highlight whats great about a person’s face. You’re making a problem with filters because there‘s nothing on your face that is highlight worthy.

There’s no problem with them taking on large credit card debt to afford and show off what they have. You’re just making a problem out of it because you don’t have the credit scores to take that kind of debt.

Stop complaining that the friends people show off on instagram isn’t real. You probably have no friends so you’re just trying to take that away from them. What you have to realise is that you are a sad, lonely dull person.

Stop trying to ruin other people’s happiness. If you can’t find it in your life, at least be grateful that someone who has a lot of it is willing to share a little bit of it with you so that you can be ignorant for a little bit of time and enjoy it.

People really need to accept that there is a social gradient. Some people WILL be happier and richer than you. There’s no need to take that away from them. Just accept that your life isn’t as nice and move on.",0.0
980,t3_qvud7y,CMV: all shows that start out in a very dramatic way will eventually go downhill,"I was browsing reddit and stumbled across a thread where someone asked which tv shows were ruined in the long run and a lot of the answers followed a trend.

I think that if a show starts out at like a 9 drama-wise, the show will eventually suck, because even if the first season is amazing, the writers will be pressured to come up with something more dramatic for the next season. With each season the storylines will become more and more outlandish until it doesn’t make sense anymore and becomes unwatchable.

Examples: prison break, scandal, riverdale, once upon a time, pretty little liars, how to get away with murder",0.0
981,t3_qvt8s1,"CMV: People who use the word ""whilst"" instead of ""while"" are just trying to sound smart.","The meaning and grammatical use of ""while"" and ""whilst"" is exactly the same and so there is no real reason to use one over the other. In daily conversations, text messages to friends, and even work emails, there is no reason to use the level of formality that comes with using ""whilst"". 

The exceptions to this might be in novels (where it fits the tone) and maybe some professions such as law which can sometimes require super formal wording for clarity (again this might just be to fit the tone). Another possible exception might be country differences/generational differences. 

I only mention the above so that I can clarify my position and pre-empt a few of the counter arguments which I already agree with.

Also, the fact I think people are just trying to sound smart, doesn't mean we should disparage them or suggest they shouldn't use ""whilst"". But to me - all I can think is that this person is just trying to slip into the conversation a sense that they are well-read/knowledgable etc.",1.0
982,t3_qvr5sj,CMV: America would’ve been a better place without guns.,"I’m not saying that we should take everyone’s guns, because that is impossible. I am simply stating that guns should’ve never been allowed to the public from the start. If people are going to have guns, they should be required to undergo mandatory training at least 1 week every 6 months. This training would help people identify threats, shoot properly, and know when a threat is neutralized.

Guns are a far too powerful tool to just sell to anyone with a background check. We either A, need to have mandatory training or B, not allow people who don’t have them to buy them. That way, slowly but surely, guns would become rare in civilian or untrained hands.",0.0
983,t3_qvo3c5,CMV: Anarchy is not a valid worldview,"UPDATE: I made this post having little to no understanding of Anarchist ideology and while I am ashamed of my ignorance, I am grateful for your responses and my new-found perspective. I will add that I think my friend might also lack a full understanding of what it means to be an Anarchist. Thanks for helping me out, everyone. 

ORIGINAL POST:

My friend is a self-described Anarchist and also Libertarian somehow and when we discuss societal issues and world affairs, he tends to fall back on the argument that if there were no systems or structures or rules, everything would sort itself out and humanity would be as it should be. I become annoyed by this assertion because while I criticize the imperfect nature of laws and governments, I think that the alternative would be very brutal and violent. The pervasive thought I keep having is that he is very privileged and comfortable enough to have such views due to the very societal structures that he condemns. I welcome any perspectives on this that will help me be more thoughtful and understanding about this worldview rather than annoyed with it.",252.0
984,t3_qvnqac,"CMV: If billionaires shouldn't be able to accumulate that much wealth, then no country (especially America) should accumulate that much wealth either.","I completely agree with the sentiment that billionaires should not be able to accumulate that much wealth and needs to be held accountable for their fair share of taxes, etc. But I feel like most people here(who are mostly American) forget that they are living extremely privileged lives compare to the rest of the world. I would also be focusing on United States because America possesses 25% share of World GDP.

We are all human beings and the only difference between an American baby ($63,500 gdp/capita) and an Indian baby ($1900 gdp/capita) is where they are born. These two babies are going to live drastically different lives. While the average American child can definitely achieve a good standard of living through good education/mentorship, it is very unlikely that the average Indian child will ever escape their standard of living. Just think about this: the GDP of Mississippi (a state we associate with low-income, poverty, etc.) has a GDP of $115 billion. The GDP of the entire country of Cambodia is $25 billion.

I'm not an expert but let's draw some parallels. Just like billionaires and corporations setting up shell companies to evade taxes, rich countries definitely use their power to exploit poorer countries and have exploitative foreign investment policies (The Banana Wars, BP Nigerian Oil Reserves, emerald mines). Just like billionaires not possessing real skills and being made richer by their underpaid employees, first world countries have immigration policies which favors ""brain gain/drain"". Just like billionaires do not care for the common folks, the average American (at least the ones I talk to) are apathetic of what's happening to the rest of the world. If you want to talk about Foreign Aid, as a percentage of GDP, the US ranks near the bottom compared to other developed countries, but we often complain about the philanthropic contributions made by billionaires.

If you advocate for billionaires sharing their wealth, you should also advocate for rich countries sharing their wealth as well. Otherwise you are just looking out for yourself and personal gain rather than supporting economic equality.

Edit: I think most comments are misinterpreting what I meant and are fixated  upon taxing the wealthy. What I'm talking about is increasing economic  equity globally through non-exploitative foreign investments,  technology-sharing, open borders, access to education, access to the  internet. Wealthy countries are hoarding all these, and nobody is criticizing them.",6.0
