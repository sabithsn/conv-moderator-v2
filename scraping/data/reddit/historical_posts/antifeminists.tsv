As part of my New Year's resolution I've decided to pleasure myself in the form of strip clubs, lap dances and arranged sex. It's too late for me to ever rely on a woman to willingly want to have sex with me so I have to take matters into my own hands (Any means with the woman's consent).

My question for those of you on here. If you haven't had sex when did you accept that it was simply never going to happen unless you arranged it? Even for those of you who have had sex, have you simply decided it wasn't worth it anymore and decided to go alternate routes?",0.0

Rather, We Compliment Each Other And This, Many Won't Understand.","**We live in a society, where men are shamed and ridiculed for acting like ""men.**"" If they're saying the facts, they are said to be ""Mansplaning"" and if they sit comfortably with their legs wide, they're called ""manspreading."" If they say they want a ""traditional wife"" who knows her role in the home, they're called to be ""misogynistic"" and ""women oppressor"" and so on.


 **And we live in a society where women are shamed and ridiculed, if they say they want a ""traditional household"" where the man works and provides, while she looks after the home and children.** If she doesn't go out and ""empowers"" herself in being a ""strong, independent and free women"" she's called a ""pick me"" and ""old school."" And eventually what happens? **Even these types of women easily get brainwashed by the latter, in following the same route which makes most of these women miserable.** If you go on the so called female dating strategy subs, majority of the women on there are ""strong and independent"" by societies standards, but they're 30 plus unmarried and low-key miserable. 



**The reality is, since the dawn of time society has always been Patriarchal.** Patriarchy was the norm in majority of the societies, even in Kuffar societies. You have couple famous ""rulers"" such as Cleopatra and so on, who were women and lead, but that was only for a short period of time. Matriarchal societies collapsed very fast, and that's why, there isn't even that much history regarding it. **It collapsed so fast, people couldn't even write too much about them.**
Men lead, and women followed.** This was the norm since the dawn of time. Now just in the past 100 years, with all these movements and what not to ""empower"" women, it has all changed. One foolish person might say, women are so ""empowered"" now and they have all their rights and they're ""free.""


Yes, this might be the case on paper. But you want to know something? **As much as women are free, they're enslaved to their corporate bosses/elite/government more than ever.** In the name of ""freedom"", majority of these women show off their ""goods"", for attention and still complain when men ""objectify"" them. You can't have your cake and eat it too.


**Today, the modern “empowered” female is a breathing parody of what her Liberal corporate overlords want her to be**; useful only for being a sexual commodity for marketing products in advertisements, or raking in millions of Dollar$ for social media tech companies, by caking her face with makeup to attention-wh0re in what would have passed for soft-core p0rn at one time for desperate men, **while hypocritically complaining about being “objectified” at the same time.**


Such a woman herself, has reduced her value to that of a sexual object. **She willingly demolished the protective layered defense of the traditional patriarchy, the role of the father, husband, brother and son.** She instead replaced it with slavery to corporate bosses, sexually frustrated consumers, and obnoxiously demanding supervisors; **all of whom only see her utility in either fulfillment of lust, or that of monetary gain and nothing more, until she withers away with the slightest sign of aging and her youthful years having been spent, to be forgotten by society only to be replaced by a more youthful substitute.** Rinse and repeat.



Isn't this the reality? When the West called for women to be ""empowered"" that's^ what it meant. **Unfortunately, men forgot how to lead, and women forgot their roles. I don't blame the men, because majority of men who are raised up in the west are brainwashed to hate their own gender.** They think that, they will make the ""perfect husband"" by acting as a male fèminíst and ""empowering"" their women.  While the women? **Society has done a perfect job to make them feel that they were ""oppressed"" for many centuries,** and now, that's it's time to go out and shake their booties for the whole world to see and to be ""free.""  Is this what they call ""empowering?""



**In conclusion, both men and women forgot their roles.** And as much as society says we're ""progressing"", the statistics of marriage/divorce/parental upbringing and overall happiness says otherwise. Before you ""empowered"" women and ""male fèminísts"" get triggered and call me names, just think about something. **Do you really believe, a quad masking male fèminíst would be able to defend this country, if opposition came to destroy it?** Or would it be an ""Patriarchal/Traditional/Sèxist"" male who actually genuinely cares about this country?

41,t3_rtb575,The Feminist Basis (and it's issues),"Hello. This is a part 2 of my original post about the flawed feminist ideology, as seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/antifeminists/comments/rsmsmq/feminism_was_broken_from_the_start/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Now a commenter gave me some idea story what I'll make my new post about. I'll link them if they say they wish to be linked in the comments, and I decided that the next thing for me to tackle would be the feminist historical basis, and it's problems in Western Society.

I'll start in different time groups, going through the historical periods of Western society.

In the US and Canada, where a lot of the radical feminists are based, I'll first explain what the gender roles were like in the 1700s-1800s. 

1700-1900: In this era, men were the soldiers, or militia in say, the Revolutionary War, the war in which colonists broke off from England to settle in what is now, the United States. Men were the builders, the protectors, and the troops. 

Women were, as you can expect, those who had less political and economic power, but definitely were the privileged when it comes to worth in the eyes of society, protection, and overall safety.

1900-2000: This is when feminism first came around. Around this time, the gender roles were pretty much the same. Men had careers and more freedom in society economically and politically, having the right to vote and the ability to possess and control their career. 

Despite stigmatization towards women when refusing to be a housewife, there was also a heavy amount of stigmatization towards men who wanted to focus more on their family life. Gender roles were harmful not only to women, but to men as well, disproving the notion that Western society is historically patriarchal. It was based in gender roles, and hurt both genders a fair amount throughout this time.

In the 60's and 70's radical feminists started to appear. Women had already had the right to vote and were progressing in the workplace. This is when the gender roles, for women specifically, started to be broken down, a good thing indeed. I don't think anybody should be forced to play a part based on traditional gender roles, *but* there was a major problem throughout here, which kept continuing throughout our Western society to the present day.

2000-2021: Even at the very beginning of this period, women were completely broken from their gender roles, but now to talk about the problem I mentioned. As Warren Farrel points out in a TEDx talk, linked here if you want to listen to it, 
https://youtu.be/Qi1oN1icAYc 
while women were given the opportunity by society to be a career woman as well as a housewife, men were still just given the options of be a career man, or just be a loser. 

Now, feminist is a broken system, undermining the presumption of innocence for males hence the Duluth Model, where men spreading their legs too far on a subway is shown as an oppressive dominance signal, they refuse to acknowledge men's issues and even when they do, blame other men as if that makes any difference to the victim. 

At this point, feminism has clearly reached the point of ""jumping at shadows,"" a term for trying to find a solution for a non-existent problem, mainly because feminism had no basis for proving that women were ever oppressed. Instead, they just help find proof that historically, both sexes were oppressed, not exclusively women.

56,t3_rsmsmq,Feminism was Broken From the Start,"To start, feminism itself. What is it?

Feminism is an ideology that paints us living in a patriarchal society in which power is held by men, men are the oppressors and women are the victims. Feminists try to boost women's rights to make up for this supposed patriarchal gap, making progress towards equality.

There are 2 problems with this ideology itself.

A, in much of the world, definitely Western and European society where a lot of feminism is rooted, women are treated more then fairly in comparison to men. Men are subject to selective service, very rarely given custody in family court, commonly have to pay alimony, are substantially more likely to be charged with the crime if done, and twice as likely to be convicted of the crime. 

They are laughed at and ignored when victims of rape and DV. They are sued for child support when they have their sperm stolen or are raped, they are falling behind in education while women are still given special scholarships as if they are an oppressed minority, they are more likely to be victims of assault as a whole, and much much more.

Another thing is that this ideology naturally means that feminists cannot acknowledge men's issues. Why? Because any evidence that men may not have it so great after all is a threat to the feminist ideology as it means that men may not be the privileged sex, which is what the  feminist movement is built upon. 

So what I'm trying to say here, the feminist ideology itself is flawed, as it cannot focus on or acknowledge the issues of men, and is built upon a fallacy, the fallacy that men somehow have it better than women.

I think we can all conclude that both groups of people are shitty in general. 

Why do they behave like this though? 

They don't want to work. 

Not on themselves, their beliefs, work towards facing themselves neutrally, acknowledge their faults, take responsibility etc. 

That's why you see a very bratty attitude from them, with no sense of justice or fairness whatsoever, calling them narcissistic might be only fractionally true (people use that term very loosely anyway), they are simply brats who think acting spoiled, entitled, and taking pleasure of other people's demise or causing it by painting the extreme picture of a generic relationship problem will give them the contentment they need, however, we know this satisfaction lasts only for short while and they go back to being miserable and repeat the cycle.

This is like porn addiction, addicts usually fail to acknowledge that they are addicted, justify their addiction is superbly creative ways just so they can get their fix, refuse any sound advice or all reason, don't even get me started on accountability, and when they experience the 'side effects' of their addiction, they simply find another creative justification that will help them get their daily fix.

Being ‘anti feminist’ will get you nowhere.

Females need feminism.

When girls go through puberty, the world changes for them. Feminism has the ability to protect them from the horrors they face.

What men need is a cultural body, a force, to protect them from the tyranny of evil and stupid domineering women.

Manipulation, lies, social assassination. 

Institutions are turned against us at the word of a woman.

The world is structured to favour them, and still they claim that it is unfair, that we have all the power and it’s all our fault.

What a twisted way to play the game.

To say that they have no power, while wielding so much, to gain even more.

90,t3_rpyoa8,Why am I not a feminist?,"**Who/What am I?**

I am a woman. And a single mom of three daughters. My ex husband was an addict (gambler) and the entire family suffered tremendously. He never admitted that he had a problem and never wanted to go to therapy. We lost our home because he spent the money for the loan redemption in a casino and never even told me that the loan wasn't redeemed in a timely manner. The bank terminated the loan contract and evicted us. We had to move within three days in December, and at the time, my twins were only six months old. I gave him an ultimatum: go get help/therapy, because you cannot have both the family and gambling addiction. He left us and never even called us or asked if the kids are okay, how they were doing in school, if they missed him etc. He abandoned us four years ago.

I am 42 years old. I hold two Master's degrees and own a business for 15 years now. I earn well as a translator (more than well). I am financially independent and I was always financially independent. My parents were poor back then when I attended the university, so I had to work and pay for the tuition and everything else myself (I'm not complaining, actually, I'm bragging, lol).

Two years ago I entered into a romantic relationship with an old friend of mine. He's 43, he was never married and doesn't have any children. I am not sure that I can have a child with him. Of course I would love to have a child with him, but due to my age, it's possible that I cannot get pregnant. My fiance is aware of it and still accepts me and my kids as we are. He's my kids' dad, and way more caring and dedicated than their own father. My kids adore him and he loves them. I work a lot, so he takes care of the kids and helps me around the house, since he's currently unemployed (due to Covid measures and heavy reduction of the staff with his ex employer).

So, the women around me are SHOCKED when they hear my story and realize that I am not a feminist. I am financially independent and I always was. I am a sole provider for my family. My ex fled the country to avoid child support payment. He betrayed the kids and me as well. My future husband is unemployed and I am the one who earns and provides for everything. I hold two Master's degrees, I am very successful, I have three daughters, and yet, I am not a feminist! How come, they wonder. One woman told me the other day: *I am 34, and not yet married. Men want younger women who can bear children, I've hit the wall and nobody wants to marry me anymore. How come that you, with three kids, at the age of 40, when you probably cannot have any more children, find a good guy who doesn't have his own children, whereas I, a single woman, with no kids, cannot find a man, although I am younger than you?*

**Why then am I not a feminist?**

When I attended the Elementary school, I was a shy nerd. I went to chess section, math and physics section, and I was the only girl in those groups, surrounded by boys. What do you think, who discriminated me? The boys in those groups? Or maybe the girls from my class? The latter is the correct answer. The girls hated me and ridiculed me. On the other hand, the boys from those groups were very kind and supportive, they treated me like a princess, like their queen! They even defended me when the girls were to mean to me.

Later, when we were 14 and 15, all the girls from my class had boyfriends, started wearing makeup and going out, while I was still a nerd who loved reading, math and languages. I wasn't interested in boys at all. I wasn't going out with anyone. The girls were even meaner, they called me ugly, told me that ""nobody wants me, that's why I don't have a boyfriend"".

In Grammar school the situation wasn't much different. I had my first boyfriend when I was 19, simply because I wasn't interested in relationships. I was focused on my education and had my dream to fulfill (to become a translator). I studied hard, I was also a volleyball player and swimmer, and I simply didn't care about going out or boyfriends. Those four years of my Grammar school were a living hell. The girls would sometimes ridicule me, tear my ""ugly clothes"", even hit me and kick me for ""being ugly AF"".

Grammar school is completed here where I live at the age of 19. I went to another city to attend the University. There I met my first boyfriend. We were together for 3 years, and then we broke up because he had to move to another country (for good). I graduated at the age of 22, obtained my first Master's degree at the age of 24, and the second one at the age of 26. By then, I was together with my (now ex) husband. I gave birth to our first daughter at the age of 27. I also started my business in the same year. At the age of 33 I gave birth to the twins. When I was 38, my (now ex) husband abandoned us. Now I'm 42 and this year I'll marry my best friend (above mentioned).

I was never ever discriminated by any man. Men ADMIRE me because I am a hard-working mom. They don't envy, they don't talk shit about me behind my back. On the other hand, women in my neighborhood, my female relatives and girlfriends are still mean and envious. They're spreading lies about me. For instance, they claim that I don't earn as a translator, but as a hoe on OnlyFans or even a prostitute (suddenly I'm no longer ugly but very attractive and use my beauty to seduce men and take their money, lol). They claim that my ex husband abandoned me because I cheated him and earned money as a prostitute. At the same time they claim that I am extremely stupid, because I am not a feminist even though my ex husband was an AH (wow, they cannot even get their story straight, lol).

At the same time, they're still unmarried, divorced, abandoned, without children, in most cases unemployed or working for a minimum wage, they're miserable and desperate. Several times I told them that life is about choices we make, that there's something called accountability and responsibility for one's actions and choices. Several times I told them that there were great men out there but they rejected them constantly. Oh, they get really angry when I tell them that once they are 30+, they cannot expect to be married to a 30+ successful, rich, white-collar man, because such men now look for younger women.

These women are all feminists and bitter beyond measure. Now when they have high body count, when they should settle for what's available, when they must lower their criteria and realize that there's not much they can bring on the table, they're now feminists.

And I have it all... Yes, my ex is irresponsible and an addict, a true AH who abandons his own children, but I still have it all. My business, three great kids, my career, my family, a good man by my side, a good home, a few expensive bags and shoes, and I even dare to look younger! Well, sorry, gals, but low body count, family life, my life choices and everything else made me look 10 years younger than I actually am. Years of partying, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, one-night stands and irresponsible life are now visible on their faces, but not on mine. And that's not my fault.

Although my ex was an AH, I would never say that all men are irresponsible AHs. I have the greatest dad in the entire universe (and you can never prove me wrong about this). In school, the boys supported me, loved me, defended me and admired me. My brother is also a great guy and extremely supportive. My male colleagues and male clients, my male employees also admire me and respect me. My future husband is another greatest guy in the entire universe.

On the other hand, women are mean to other women. Women discriminate other women. They fell ""endangered"" by another woman! They have zero accountability and responsibility, and when the reality hits, they blame everyone else, but themselves, for their poor life choices. My entire life I was hated by other women! And never ever by any man!

Men are not afraid of a strong, independent woman. They actually respect a strong, independent woman and admire her. What the feminists fail to realize is the fact that the definition of a strong and independent woman is **not** what they think it is. Men don't discriminate women, **women discriminate and hate other women**, and they hate most every successful, independent woman who dares have everything they don't.

I don't even hate my ex husband. He was also a good guy before the addiction. He is sick, addiction is illness and I cannot hate him. Yes, I'm disappointed, mostly because my kids had a really hard time accepting that he was gone. But I don't hate him. We had several years of passionate love and great marriage, before the addiction. I still think that he should go to therapy, for his own sake. If he doesn't, he'll end up homeless and miserable. But that's not my call.

And I don't hate those women who abused me, discriminated me, ridiculed me and lied about me. I feel sorry for them.

Feminism is a lie. Men are not enemies to other men. Men are not enemies to women either. On the other hand, women are enemies to other women, and also to men. And the result of that hate is their miserable and bitter existence. I truly feel sorry for them.

We have a saying in my country: **you'll reap what you sowed**. The feminists are those who don't get this, because it's always someone else's fault... Patriarchy? Well, if it wasn't for patriarchy, I would never be supported, defended and admired by men. In matriarchy, I would be hated and ridiculed, exactly as I was, or even worse!",116.0

115,t3_rovli5,The truth about emotional labor,"So I have been researching 'emotional labor'. This means things like the expectation to excel at being a diplomatic, supportive, warm, sensitive, sentimental and friendly person.  The expectation that you will remember special occasions, will be talented at hosting and gift giving and will remember everything about everyone and will always know the correct thing to say or do.  All of this is true.  A significant burden is on women to socially 'perform'.  As a woman with Aspergers, I feel this in my soul.  

I keep reading about how men and the patriarchy are the reasons why women have to do emotional labor and that's where I strongly disagree.  In fact the expectation for women to perform socially and act like everyone's cheerleader, mom and mentor comes from women.  This is why I have never really been good at female friednships, because I'm crap at emotional labor.  Yet my relationships with men have not been effected.  Most men couldn't give a crap about most of that stuff.  My husband honestly doesn't care that our house is clean (I do, so that's why I keep it clean, my husband would happily live in filth and wouldn't care if I didn't clean) or that I remember his birthday (in fact he's relieved to have a wife who doesn't care a lot about special occasions, he says that in the past he's felt pressured to celebrate his birthday and he doesn't want to).

Then there is the claim that women have to guess men's feelings and make everything alright when something upsets them.  I don't have this experience with men at all.  Most men want to go and deal with negative emotions on their own and when they are moody and sullen you just give them some personal space.  It's actually women who want you to guess their feelings and make everything OK again.  

Most of the people who have negatively judged me for not being a warm, sentimental person who always knows what to say or do have been women.  Women judge my parenting, my sense of style, who I am as a person, what I cook for dinner, what my home decor is, how I walk and talk and present myself, practically all my choices far more than men do.  It's women who shun you when you forget to send them a birthday card or tell them how stunning and brave they are for whatever it is.  This performance that I apparently have to stage and this thing called emotional labor is an expectation that women generally have of other women and themselves.  I don't fit the mould because I'm socially abnormal and I have paid the price.

Blaming men is all a big projection.  Women do emotional labor for themselves and other women.  

I'm not going to claim that my relationships with men have been perfect, they have had their separate problems, but researching the concept of 'emotional labor' and what that means has given me an aha moment about my difficulty in relationships with other women.",21.0

Opening scene had me raging.

I’m looking forward to seeing how this story evolves.

I’m already grateful for the portrayal of all these evil women.

And the ‘diversity hire’ judge.

I am thankful to the beauty and power of Rosamund Pike. She knows the message this film is putting out.

Manipulation of the system, ‘officials’ collaborating.

Peter Dinklage. Always a pleasant sight.

I’m waiting for the counter plot against this Grayson ‘bitch’.

There was a scene just now that highlighted the genuine plight that women have faced.

I can’t forget my own mistreatment of women. Not that I’m forgetting my mistreatment of self in those cases either… and the mistreatment of them to me and them to themselves…

My Nan commented “she is one evil mare”

My response: “there’s a lot of evil women out there. They get away with it. Feminism”.

Feminism could be a force for good, alongside Masculism.

The opening scene to this movie will make you want to break things if you, like me, have suffered the misandry, the abuse, from this uncivilisation, that is ubiquitous.

Nazis were less than a hundred years ago.

The evil people and the idiots who allowed that to happen are the same as the people today.

Scene gets me thinking… “we didn’t start the fire, the world’s been burning since the world’s been turning”.

I want her to die, she’s so evil, but I also don’t, the story’s not over yet.

I think I’m biologically wired to be glad to see women survive…

Weird that this evil woman is still somehow being (successfully) framed as a character we are rooting for to come out well…

Then again, I know I’ve rooted for evil men to do well… I must admit I have misanthropy in my soul.

I’m now getting the message that this film is bringing a spotlight to something huge and evil.

Watch the movie, you’ll get it.

164,t3_rlui27,"Gender pay gap. It exists, but not in the way you might think.","For a few decades now, there has been a continuous debate on a factor of work; salaries, and why they're different. So, first off, I'd like to just say, that there is a gender pay gap, this is just factual. However, it is not what you'd assume it to be. In this post, I will try to show you what I realized, and how that might affect how you view the world.

So for the past few years, I've been auditing how I and other business owners pay those who work for me. And I'll say that whether it's men or women, they get the amount in salary. Because the payment systems are not based on names, they're based on a series of numbers and job classes. These inform us on how we pay workers and employees. As always, such systems, well...you're no even human, just a bunch of numbers in a set of other numbers. This means that the pay gap that's been touted by the others, is most definitely false.

So why did I say that a pay gap exists? Well here's why: My audit, involved actual worker value. Basically, I have taken to shadow managing and analyzing exactly what value the worker adds to the business' earnings. Well, I am going to uncomfortably admit that some are actually not paid what they deserve. A job class is an excuse to limit the definition of what you do, and thus ensures you cannot sue and win. Here's the thing though; the results I found were that men actually get paid less for actual work done.

See that's the reason most companies prefer to hire men is that they're, easily over used and underpaid without ever complaining. Perfect employees, to be honest. A good example is in marketing. Now you would assume that women are better at getting clients, right? You'd actually be very wrong. The metrics show that men are 40% better at pushing products that women are. That's because of how most people approach products. The so called, mansplaining, is actually a good thing for business. Over 80% of clients want the product explained to them like they're kids. Why? Because nobody likes to think too hard when spending. So men are more likely to push the product. The resulting earnings, is work done, and men do a lot of it. Yet, payment is exactly equal to the woman who lost her nerve, or failed to explain the product effectively to the client. So there's a 40% pay gap there.

Now before you go sharing this as a trump card. Remember, this is a sampling of 20 businesses. None of which are willing to be named, or have their data showcased. So I would advise those in research to check this info, and see if it applies to the larger picture. Birds of a feather, and this is one very specific species of birds. So check out the others.

However, based on that, I have questions as to the validity of the various statements posited by the likes of Hermione, and the rest. What was the intention of those statements? Because if this sampling is anything t go by, it means that you, me an many others have been woefully hoodwinked. Now, I'm not complaining about having to pay great workers less, I'm a socialist, but I'm also pragmatic. More money for me, and more value for the world is good. What pisses me off, is that I've been forced to ignore very good worked, chasing white elephants (with dyed hair). So I think I will endeavor to work with more men, because clearly, there's quite a lot of money to be earned there. Plus, even with the workers union they're in, they have never once asked for more than 8% of that 40%. That's a very tiny fraction of money that's already theirs. I'm just annoyed that some lazy mary gets some of that value without putting in the work.

Regardless, the pay gap exists, and men are gonna make me money. That's the world for you, and that's why I'm a thoroughly antifeminist socialist (who efficiently practices a reasonably amount of pragmatic economics).",9.0

Random dude's oh U don't say cptn obvious!? Did U just mansplain me!? 😂 You know how i come to this opinion? Because you Said that you are a man AND just show not one single thing like compassion or empathie or just even try to understand the question above. Infact you didnt even try to read the comments to get a clue. Because you just don't care. And thats a part of the problem. Every single time you just dare to mention anything that doesnt include men or even worse: reveal issues caused by men... Some of em will jump out the bush and cry salty male tears without just thinking for one second. Pathetic.

Random dude's

weird lady Have fun with whatever you are doing. I do not participate in this anymore. You really wasted a lot of energy to ""mansplain"" to me how pathetic I am LOL. I do think a lot. I just don't agree with you, AT ALL. I do have lots empathy, but not for people who are rude (regardless of their gender). Just say what you want to say in a laconic way. Like I just Hate X y. Bye. Hope you find peace of mind. And succeed in whatever your goal is.

209,t3_rhts3y,Should I date," 

Disclamer} It's going to be controversial, and that's what I think

{Background} 20\[M\] Engineering graduate{orphan}.Only have two male classmates. Whom to which I talk like around one in 3 to 4 days. Extremely introverted in nature. I was raised in a boys' school. None to no female interaction. I never visited family parties and functions. So practically no sister or female friends either.

In 2018I got major exposure to things called the internet.

What I find that 1. Men are falsely accused of rape and sexual harassment. {In my college, this guy was falsely accused of harassment. As a result, he was suspended for a month. A month later girl confirmed her lie, and she was released free of charge. Total damage to the boy and his family's reputation. It totally made into news }. Do females don't feel h empathy for the opposite gender and consequence of their word on opposite gender career and reputation

2. High level of adultery going around in the world. In everyday cases, a wife cheats his husband and vice versa. Do real loving partners exist?

3. Whenever there is a major rape incident around. People post like all men are dogs. Kill all men... All men are rapists. Is it true that all females feel the same ???  
4. In most movies/anime I watch, Men get beaten up by women for silly things, not vice versa. Why is this so common. I have seen cases that men couldn't fight back. He gets brutally beaten up, slapped, and couldn't do a thing

5. what comes to my mind when it comes to dating is my partner will cheat. Take child custody. Ask me to pay child support. This is indeed the norm. People really don't have emotion this day??

I want to say that females who don't cheat are rational; take equal care of you as you do of them exist. Basically, I want to ask if you have a partner that really loves you in this world. I am too afraid to ask.

Do good /decent girls exist? Or I should prefer to be single. Please change my point of view about this world. Please share some good things in this negative world.",46.0

As someone who once was one of these simps, I can understand why; however, I don’t believe that she is deserving of being a representative for us. She has said that nice guys shouldn’t have to say their nice (which I agree with), but she is in her own words, “A good girl.” She has stated that child support should not make up more than 1/3 of a man’s income, which is ridiculously broad, especially if we’re talking an upper-middle class man or higher. She has also uploaded a video titled, “You Might be Pro-Choice and not Know it,” which basically models after the Buzzfeed, “You Might be a Feminist and not Know it,” videos. (Don’t care about your abortion stance, I’m just stating how dumb the video was.) She also doesn’t take good care of herself either, because she has attempted suicide twice in the last year or so, and claims that she’s all better now. 

Chloe, if you’re reading this, you are not all better. Someone with your mental state takes years or even decades to recover, and that’s if you’re doing it right. Please, I’m begging you to get professional help. If not for your own sake, do it for your daughter, because if you don’t, you will succeed in killing yourself, and you will leave your daughter an orphan, or worse, back into the hands of your abusive ex. I’m not saying this to be mean, I’m giving you the reality of your situation.

As for everyone else, we can’t afford to have someone like Chloe representing us, especially if she’s as unstable as she is. If any of you are following her on anything, withdraw immediately. If you’re buying from her Onlyfans, unsubscribe. If you watch her YouTube or Tik Tok, unsubscribe. If you follow her on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media, unfollow.

The posters of this subreddits did not agree with this posts (at least not openly) this is actually a fairly tame sub mostly opposing the worst excesses of feminism. I am not representative for this sub, i just wanted a platform and i got it.

While a lot of people took issue with my view nobody was able to show that it was actually wrong which is likely because my conclusion was correct. I can try finding some more studies backing up my conclusions but i doubt it will change anyones views regarding this.

As for platforming controversial opinions: i have seen leftwingers to that with outright nazis, inviting them to their shows for views (david pakman did that). The moderators here may have just missed my post though because it was mostly domnvoted.

In this case both AHS and this sub platformed my post but AHS gave it far more viability due to their sub being much larger and them giving it a lot of upvotes.

295,t3_rdwyww,"🎶🎶🎶 This is, what GUYS want 😇 🎶🎶🎶","We are not anti-women... We just want the equality which men are deprived from... We are here for :

1. Stopping False accusations of rape by women on men

2. Acknowledging rape happening on men by women

3. Mandatory DNA testing of the child at birth to confirm if the guy is the child's real father

4. Stopping free public transport services and college seats provided to women on terms of gender  and paying up for it by the government with loads of money from taxes, the merit of men and women shall be equal, the person who moves ahead in life has nothing to to with other... So the false idea that ""PATRIARCHY is real"", doesn't exist too

5. Having equal share in payment and not men paying more

6. Stopping female predators from sexually harassing or raping male teens

7. Equalising the period of time sentenced in jail by the judiciary, which is currently more for men and less for women for the exact same crimes

8. Stopping men to be portrayed as villains all the time and women as victims all the time

9. Stopping forced male circumcision at birth

10. Encouraging society to acknowledge the efforts made by men to sustain the society

11. Showing the reality of simp politicians who put men on pedestal and women as queens always, whereas men are the ones paying more taxes

12. Equalising alimony matters between both genders which is currently men providing women and not the other way round

13. Equality in child custody battles in courts

14. Countering the misandry of mainstream media (even subreddits here, which are perhaps flooded with many)

15. Encouraging society to train women into being cautious of feminists and not to fall into their trap (even the MRM shall end once it neutralizes the effects of feminism)

16. Enforcing a strict law so women are also forced to work alongside us rather than staying at home (and some, rather most, being feminists yet bashing us)... They shall work in offices, and even in the army, no one shall be excluded

(In case the woman wants a man with traditional responsibility of providing money, she has to return the favour by doing house work, IF SHE DOESNT WANNA WORK OUTSIDE)

Otherwise for the most part : 

""Equal rights, equal fights and equal responsibilities""

17. Also we need to counter misogyny which is shown by some people (maybe even here) because that portrays us in a bad light, when we clearly are not bad, we are adding to the gender equality equation

18. (Feminism - misandry) + (MRM - misogyny) = Egalitarian society

Perhaps currently Misandry has increased a lot (feminists are now MOSTLY misandrists) whereas misogyny has gone down very much... So MRM shall equalize feminism so that egalitarian society could be formed, feminism has gone too far... And thus MRM is the need for today...

Add more points in the comments :) and comment if you like what I wrote, I am open for criticism (not misandry lol)

Boys, I am proud we are taking steps for our equality with women, and those sensible girls who decided to come with us rather than those bigoted feminists, thanks a lot sisters, your struggles alongside us and taking the right decision when nobody dared to, will always be remembered :)

Thanks a lot guys for reading this :)





Edits :

19. Open talks for men sexual problems and penis hygiene at institutions and society just like women get for their period and sexual problems. For example : Nightfalls

20. Equal discussion before conceiving a child (like all money and duties sorted out beforehand... So that the one who deviates can be put in check by the court)

21. Also need for more people for advocating men in courts

22. Awareness campaigns to recognise men and their work, also celebration of men's day just like women's day, or banning the celebration of both...

23. Teaching young men about their value and how to save themselves from threats of feminism (considering feminism becomes a total villain afterwards) and proper procedure to proceed against false allegations, in short more education related to men specific topics (this one kinda sounds the previous 3-4 points in the main post combined in one lol)

24. If the current so called father is proved to not be the biological father too, the government/court shall pay the money for upbringing of the child, not the guy paying for someone who's not his child

25. MOST IMPORTANT ONE I FORGOT : support men who show emotions and don't say things like ""Man Up!"", or ""don't be a pussy!"" And not judge men on emotions... If a man supports his partner and elders perfectly, then he should get same treatment of sympathy in return too...

26. Stop portraying men as useless, idiots, buffoons and sex objects (i.e. Diet Coke adverts/commercials) in television adverts and commercials UNLESS the same portrayals are applied to women",114.0

If women are the gatekeepers to sex then how in the fuck is it the same when men and women sleep around.

Look i think it's disgusting when men or women do it and I'm not into casual sex. Most of my friends sleep around and i jokingly call them sluts, obviously they take it as a complement lmao. 

But the difference is although i think it's disgusting it's IMPRESSIVE. There's literally nothing impressive about a woman being a walking wank sleeve, dripping her cunt grease onto any guy that walks along it's just easy for them. We're impressed when men do it because it's difficult.

384,t3_r88vev,"Some thoughts on ""toxic masculinity""","""Toxic masculinity"" automatically assumes, that the problem is with masculinity, or some part of it, which is not true at all. The problem is not with masculinity, the problem is how a given society relates to men and boys. Therefore the term is inapplicable. Some societal expectations are toxic, not some aspects of masculinity. 

Men may be more prone to violence, but it's a very very small minority of the population who was actually born with antisocial disorder... Violence is a ""tool"" that can be used for good or for bad. ""Bad"" or ""good"" is not inherent to human beings. Wether someone turns out to be a valuable member of society or a fugitive, it depends on their upbringing and environment.

If boys and young man can not channel their masculine energies correctly, if they are not shown ways to use their violence for good, if they have no real life examples (eg. fathers) as to what does it actually mean to be a Man, they do not learn the importance of honor, the respect of others, how to control their emotions, their rage, their anger, how to behave in position of power, how to be humble, how to trait and deal with women, how, when and where they can show weakness etc. .. They will be vulnerable to corruptive ideas and lifestyle. Bad people are made, not born.

Single parent households are insufficient to ""produce"" healthy children, every single research shows that these kids will have numerous disadvantages, boys even more then girls.

We can not erase the ""bad"" side of masculinity nor should we, because certain traits ARE inherent, and by trying we are only going to produce a bunch of disfunctional men, full of confusions. We must tech boys how to be masculine and how to use it for good. We need more masculinity, not less. We must keep fathers around, we must find mentors and role models, we must have more male teachers. But before anything, the gender war must stop, and the use of inappropriate terminologies must cease. So instead of ""toxic masculinity"", let's talk about the ""toxic societal expectations towards men"".

In any case, the worst thing we can do is what ""we"" do today, wielding a crusade against masculinity on the basis that it can potentially turn out to be harmful, and as a solution we try to enforce feminine traits on boys and force them into an environment (school) which clearly doesn't suit their needs. We can't resolve problems with masculinity by effeminating boys. 

Further, the notion of ""toxic masculinity"" does not only harm boys. It harms girls just as much, because it causes (often unconscious) resentment, mistrust and dread towards boys/men and makes it virtually impossible for them to maintain healthy romantic relationships. So if you ever wondered why divorce is on the rise compared to population growth, here's one plausible reason.",5.0

For society to function (not this social construct called gender equality properly, the most suitable people had to be assigned for certain tasks.

For “hunting/providing” tasks, men are more suitable due to biology. For “nurturing/caring” tasks, women are more suitable.

For example, if we want to build a military of soldiers (50% men and 50% women), the overall quality of that military would drop, because most of the 50% women only got into the military because of their gender, not because of their physical skills. And eventually, this military would get destroyed and cease to exist. It’s similar to society.

But she blamed it on the so-called patriarchy. 

A simpler answer is that women always valued themselves over their sexuality than anything else. They just didn’t have the avenues for putting themselves out there than they do now.

So why do so many women say social media or the patriarchy sexually objectifies females; when it is in fact young girls, who if you try to explain this to them; say there is nothing wrong with flaunting their bodies over social media to total strangers (and say social media outlets like Facebook, Instagram and tiktok are empowering)?",57.0
417,t3_r68xey,What I've noticed about Feminists,"I've noticed that most Feminists treat men as some kind of different human species. When you read their posts, comments, and whatnot, you will notice they have a ""us vs them"" mentality when it comes to men. I remember seeing a youtube comment that went: ""Men were defending women from who? Other MEN."" They completely forget that we're the same species, as that our male ancestors were also defending their land and future. They always think that our two genders are like teams from a game, where only one can be dominant and the other is oppressed. Whenever a woman is anti-feminist, they treat her like some sort of traitor to their cause, even if she wasn't a feminist. 

It's the reason they hate us. They want to have total domination over men and turn us into submissive servants. You will see this in any of their videos or subreddits, or anywhere feminist related. Feminists never think of the future, either. They never question whether or not the future they want will be any better than the supposed oppression of modern women. Feminists, I ask you, will this world be better? Will it change to give an equal starting point to everyone, or will it only benefit feminist women? Will the matriarchy be as oppressive to men as the patriarchy was supposedly to women? Ponder these questions, and challenge your viewpoints.",73.0

431,t3_r5hz1u,"A UK Government Petition to ban infant male circumcision - ""Make Male Genital Mutilation (Circumcision) an offence unless medically required"" (Not explicitly anti-feminist but pro-male rights)","There is a petition on the official UK government petition website which proposes a ban on infant male circumcision. It should prove more popular with the public than not as **91% of males in the UK are not circumcised.**

**This is a link to the petition:**  [https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598185](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598185)

Text of petition reads:

“Make Male Genital Mutilation (Circumcision) an offence unless medically required.

I’m asking the UK Government to criminalise circumcision, no exceptions for Religious circumstances, unless it has to be done for medical reasons, such as an infection. Parents or medical professionals found Circumcising children otherwise should be prosecuted accordingly.  More details  The fact that FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) is criminalised but MGM isn’t is extremely sexist &amp; wrong.

MGM can have a profound effect on children’s mental health and it is often done without the child’s consent.  I am asking that performing or allowing MGM to be performed be made a specific criminal offence. Where a parent is involved the penalties should include losing their child.”

**Why should male infant circumcision be banned?**

1. It is a medically unnecessary alteration to a healthy body
2. The ""health benefits"" are highly contestable, and most respected health organisations have decieded they do not confer enough benefit to justify the operation.
3. Whilst religious freedom deserves to be respected, we do not allow religious freedom to allow parents to make permanent cosmetic alterations to children's bodys in other context e.g. scarification.
4. The foreskin is the most sensitive area of the penis. In circumcision 30-50% of the total penile skin is removed and 50-80% of the total innervation is removed. This greatly reduces the potential of the penis as a sensory organ.
5. Currently women and girls are protected from non-consentual non-medical genital cutting for any reason. This same protection should be extended for boys and men, improving equality of treatment under the law.
6. When a child becomes an adult they may decide that what was done to their body in childhood does not conform to their current identity. This would be true of people who grow up to not hold the same religious or cultural beliefs as their parents, or hold different values.
7. An 	individual would still be free to be circumcised, but an age that they can give informed consent.
8. Circumcision is easier as an adult and results in better cosmetic outcomes, and less complications.

It’s basically about feminists disregarding simple biology. For Pete’s sake, men are generally stronger than woman. There ya go. It’s a fact, it is NOT meant to belittle women. Yes, there ARE some men who indeed like to gloat because they are insecure or just wanna feel like they are superior, when those same people could fall with a headshot. I’ve seen posts from other subs saying that it’s laughable how “ weak” women are and that no amount of work they do is greater than what a man that has great power does. I’m my opinion, anyone and I mean ANYONE worth their salt knows that having a physical advantage that’s not even earned shouldn’t be praised, instead, It’s what they DO with what they are given truly matters. There are a lot of jobs out there that are physically and mentally demanding and come with a lot of risks that don’t have anything to do with physical strength. What you put a lot of effort and power( either mental or physical) in is what counts and that goes for everyone. Do not let being different get to you. 

But with that said, please know your limits. If you know you’re an average woman or man with average strength trying to do things like lift  around  300 lbs people as a firefighter, you are putting yourself and others as risk. There are some feminists that actually defend this because it somehow does against equality. See, that’s obvious bullshit. Anyone’s welcome to what they want to do, you have to be QUALIFIED.

‘The period of **woman’s supremacy** lasted through many centuries - undisputed, accepted as natural and proper wherever it existed, and was called the **matriarchate**, or mother-age’. Figurehead of the suffragette movement in the US, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, parroting the ideas of Frederich Engels, calling for **matriarchy**, for women to replace men in power, in an article titled Matriarchate or Mother-Age published in 1891.

""We \[women\] are, as a sex, **infinitely superior to men**"" Elizabeth Cady Stanton quoted in as Revealed in Her Letters, Diary and Reminiscences, Volume 2, 1922, cited on the Chronicles of Cultural Misandry [http://nomoremisandry.blogspot.com/2013/09/elizabeth-cady-stanton-first-wave.html](http://nomoremisandry.blogspot.com/2013/09/elizabeth-cady-stanton-first-wave.html).

Feminism has never been about equality, NEVER. It has always been a sexist ideology, rotten and corrupt to the core, highly deceptive and manipulative, pursuing nothing but money, power and influence, at any cost.

The aforementioned **Stanton**, one of the early founders of the feminist movement, was an ardent **racist, eugenicist and a slave owner**. Throughout her life, she fought hard against the emancipation of black people in the US. In the 1860s, she struck an alliance with the openly racist leaders of the Kansas Democratic Party and together with them worked to oppose black enfranchisement in the US.

And if you think that she was alone in these views of hers you would be wrong:

'I will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work or demand the ballot for the Negro and not the woman.' Said leader of the suffragette movement in the US and early feminist Susan B Anthony in a meeting with an abolitionist in 1867. She opposed the 15th Amendment.

Anthony would leave her will to a trust devoted to women from which feminist separatist, women only communes have been established in the US, communes where men are not allowed and where women are indoctrinated in feminist separatism, a branch of feminism not much unlike MGTOW that encourages women to separate from men in all areas of life and turn lesbian. One example of these communes is the Susan B Anthony Memorial Unrest Women's Land Trust (the SuBAMUH. 

[https://subamuh.wordpress.com](https://subamuh.wordpress.com)

**Point of interest:** For insights into **feminist separatism** (the feminist equivalent of MGTOW) I highly recommend the works of Jill Johnston, specifically *Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution* published in 1973 in which Johnston argued the notion that all women are born lesbian then socialised by society into heterosexuals, slaves of men.

Johnston hated men with a zeal. For an insight into this hatred inspired by feminism, I highly recommend this following clip taken from a documentary produced about her in the 1970s called **Jill Johnston: October 1975**.

But back to early feminism. 

Racist, anti-black cartoon taken from an early publication of the suffragette movement:

[https://i.ibb.co/1GBZ6Dq/JUST-LIKE-THE-MEN.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/1GBZ6Dq/JUST-LIKE-THE-MEN.jpg)

Contemporary feminism controls the mainstream narrative surrounding its past. It has whitewashed its ugly history, presenting itself in the past as nothing but a wholesome ideology. This could not be further from the truth.

When you go on Wikipedia and search Stanton and Susan B Anthony, these icons of what feminists like to call 'first wave feminism', you find nothing but lies written about them both. On Wikipedia, they actually claim that these racists supported black enfranchisement, which is the opposite of what these women did in real life. They have deleted and whitewashed all the negative information written about these women on their pages on Wikipida, pages which initially contained vivid accounts of their racist past, 

For an example of this whitewashing, I highly recommend looking into a campaign started by **Amnesty International** in 2018 called the **Feminist Wikipedia Takeover** in which Amnesty International funded and organised thousands of feminists across the globe in an effort to edit Wikipedia such that it presents a more positive picture of feminism:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGN0Mjgjlok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGN0Mjgjlok)

People are being brainwashed and lied to about feminism by feminists. They have been led to believe that feminism used to be good that it used to fight for 'women's rights' and that it might have somehow lost its way. This could not be further from the truth!!!! Feminism has always been as bad as it is now, but thanks to censorship most people don't know!

Let me quickly give you an example of the lies of feminism.

Feminism has convinced people today that the suffragette movement, what feminists call 'first wave feminism', in the late 1800s to early 1900s fought for and won women voting rights. This is not true!

The **Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU)** known more popularly as the suffragettes, a union led mostly by man-hating lesbians, disbanded in 1914 with the eruption of the First World War. It was disbanded by the leader of this union Emmeline Pankhurst and its deputy, her daughter Christabel after they were bribed with a substantial amount of money to do so by Stanely Baldwin's Conservative Government. They then quickly proceeded to turn the WSPU into an agency for the British government to pressure men to enlist and die in the First World War through the White Feather Campaign. In this campaign they went around the streets of the UK attacking men and young boys, hanging white feathers on them as to shame them into enlisting, fighting in and dying in the First World War. They repeated this campaign in the Second World War.

The suffragettes disbanded their movement FOUR years before the Parliament in the UK gave all men and women the right to vote through the enactment of the People’s Act of 1918. This change was not in any way shape or form motivated by the suffragettes and their movement, but by men dying on the front lines in the First World War. The Parliament in the UK argued that men, most of whom at the time also lacked the right to vote, deserved the right to vote because they were dying for the country and if they were expected to die for the country they surely deserved the right to vote. It is this that caused the parliament to enact the People's Act of 1918 allowing all people in the UK the right to vote, not the suffragette movement which had disbanded four years prior to the enactment of the People's Act. As in, contrary to feminist claims, it wan't feminists that allowed women the right to vote, but men dying on the front lines of wars!! For god's sake, read the Handsard records of the debates leading up to the People's Act of 1918. There is no mention of suffragettes anywhere!! They played no part in the total enfranchisement of women. Hardly anyone knows about these things.

Millicent Fawcett, feminist and leader of the suffragists in the UK supported, protected and promoted concentration camps set up by the British Government for the Boers in South Africa in the Boer War, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children by virtue of nothing but the racial identity group that they belonged to. **How many people know this about the genocidal past of feminism**? How many people today involved in gender politics know that early feminism played a pivotal role in genocide? Clearly, not many, because we recently had a statue erected in London to celebrate Millicent Fawcett:

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Millicent\_Fawcett\_Statue\_02\_-\_Courage\_Calls\_%2827810755638%29\_%28cropped%29.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Millicent_Fawcett_Statue_02_-_Courage_Calls_%2827810755638%29_%28cropped%29.jpg)

Feminists control the mainstream narrative. They have whitewashed their history. They have presented a false account of their past to people, a past full of just as much perversion, violence, ugliness, lies and hate as that of feminism today.

Below you can find a headline for an article published on April 20 1920 in the New York Times on the sinking of the Titanic. This article was exposed in Women First, Men Last by Steven Adams:

[https://i.ibb.co/nQCyxMd/Women-first-Is-the-Universal-Rule-says-Sylvia.png](https://i.ibb.co/nQCyxMd/Women-first-Is-the-Universal-Rule-says-Sylvia.png)

In this article, marxist, communist, leading figure in and daughter of the leader of the suffragette movement, Sylvia Pankhurst argues that women must always come first in disasters and conflicts, justifying the disproportionate number of male deaths in the Titanic incident.

Equality? What equality?? People who think that feminism used to want equality have been brainwashed by contemporary feminism. They need to stop promoting the idea that feminism used to be good in the past. It wasn't!! You have been lied to!

If you have concluded that the vast majority of men are worthless LVM, and that the chance of finding an ideal HVM is almost next to zero( even HVM have problems in their philosophy and are far from the ideal man), wouldn't it be that the most rational decision to be made here as a female is to simply leave the game entirely and focus on more important issues in life? There were some enlightened MGTOWs that I found on forums that realised the pointless nature of dating women in general and began to focus on more vital questions like spirituality or science and the quest to understand the workings of the universe. StarDusk for example, gathered an impressive amount of knowledge regarding evolutionary psychology. What I see when I go to FDS subs? Countless examples of "" male depravity"", movies and tv show reconstructions that reflect FDS philosophy, bashing and shaming of men galore etc. And I only scratched the surface, since I've been on Reddit for only two months. Their entire philosophy is hurtful to men at first glance, granted, but it also generates much suffering in their emotional sphere as well. Don't they see that this unhealthy obsession with males is actually poisoning their lives? Will not detachment lead to a more productive way of looking at things?

If a man kills a child you'll call him a predator, demand he serves the rest of his life behind bars, he was fully aware of his actions. 

If gender stereotypes harm men and women then can any feminist explain the above without gender stereotyping women. 

If a woman can do anything a man can do then why can't a woman be fully in control of her actions in this case or the man be emotionally heightened in this case. Unless of course men lack any emotional capacity, but then isn't that a harmful stereotype? 

If it's wrong to judge certain women's actions based on our perceptions of their emotional state, then why is OK to do so in cases like this but not to apply the same logic to men in cases like this.

Pure lack of accountability. I listen to his music so maybe I'm a piece of shit too but I'm not defending him, all I'm saying is this dumb bitch knew what the fuck he was, stupid ho. 

Whenever a guy says something like ""girls don't care about personality"" or ""girls will date bad boys as long as they're good looking"" they're always hit with ""don't justify abuse"" or ""we don't know they're abusers"" well if you didn't know da baby was abusive you're a fucking retard.

He's a well built, good looking, confident, rich young man and that's enough for him to have a haram of girls he doesn't give a fuck about. It doesn't matter he's openly a piece of shit. Watch all his bitches be crying online and posting to feminist blogs about how abusive men are while they ignore good men or just men in their own League in general and all throw themselves at an abusive guy, to then say men are abusive....

My gripe isn't necessarily that they like him, fuck who you want. It's that I see them come online chatting about men being abusive and the patriarchy being a problem and by me being a male I'm a part of a problem, while the retards throw themselves at a guy like him 😭😭😭 clown world 🤡🌍🤡🌍

&gt;  
&gt;I highly recommend having a dedicated profile just for this sub. Some of you like to participate on controversial subs found on the Popular tab, or scroll through All and don’t pay attention to the subreddit you’re replying on, and bam, you’ve posted on a men’s rights sub. There’s nothing wrong with this per se, but we have a strict ban bot that WILL ban you for posting there. It doesn’t matter if you were actually arguing in defense of women there. The bot does not care about context. **Loosening up the bot is not an option, as it keeps out a lot of riff-raff.** Unfortunately, that means sometimes someone will be banned by accident. You may appeal the ban, but why not take the easier road? Having an alt removes this issue - less hassle for you, less work for the mods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alts are also a part of good [OPSEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/fclsdn/a_security_psa_how_to_not_get_doxxed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). This way, if you like to post things like selfies or personally identifiable information on your main, you can have an alt where you can remain anonymous. **There are some scary mofos out there and we want you all to be safe**.

615,t3_qrge5l,I would like to point this out,"I've been on this subreddit for a while now and I started to see a noticeable pattern in the last few months.

This sub has basically become: Feminist = hate men and that Feminism nowdays is about brining down men in order to ""raise"" women up.

However, I would like to point out a few things here and there.

First of all, we need to establish the definition of ""feminism"" to find some common ground.  


Feminism, according to Wikipedia:  
 ""**Feminism** is a range of [social movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement), [political movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_movement), and [ideologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology) that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social [equality of the sexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality).[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism#cite_note-2)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism#cite_note-Lengermann_&amp;_Niebrugge-3)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism#cite_note-Mendus-4)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism#cite_note-Hawkesworth-5)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism#cite_note-Beasley-6)  Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male  point of view, and that women are treated unjustly within those  societies.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism#cite_note-7) Efforts to change that include fighting against [gender stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_stereotypes)  and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal  opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men.""  


Feminism, according to Oxford Learner's Dictionaries:

""the belief and aim that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men; the struggle to achieve this aim""

&amp;#x200B;

So, as evidenced here, one can read that ""feminism"" is about the equality of the sexes. Not to bring anybody down in order to raise other people up. The idea is to bring both male and female on the same basis in our society.

So, if we put 1 and 1 together, if a so called ""feminist"" says ""kill all men"" or ""men are rapists"" and all that stuff that we hear nowdays, wouldn't that make them anything BUT a feminist? I mean, they can still call them feminists, but when you look at the definition of feminism, they're not.

The problem here isn't feminism, it is the people that hide their hate driven opinion under something that very much idealises the opposite.

In that sense, we need feminism in our society, because I think anybody would agree with with me when I say that it's good to give every sex there is the same opportunity in life.

Let's look at the subreddit r/antifeminists itself:  


Description:  The purpose of this subreddit is to critique, and debunk feminist views and talking-points.

Critique I get, but ""debunk feminist views and talking points"" implies that modern feminism describes itself as something it's not and here is the problem:  
As established further on the top, the definition of feminism is to ""aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social [equality of the sexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality)"".  ""debunk feminist views and talking points"" contradicts with the basic definition of feminism.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Rule:  

*Feminism isn't synonymous with women.*

*We  will allow discussion about gendered traits, including negative traits  and potentially evolved traits. But there is a line, albeit difficult to  define, where this crosses into demonization of women.*  


Whenever this line might be crossed, usually people defend it by saying ""FDS is way worse, why would we need to be good if they're doing the same thing?"" to which I think ""Why would this justify anything? Wouldn't it make more sense to be welcoming and NOT be what we're laughing at?"" We're not better than the people we make fun of if we chose to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I get the idea of this sub, and I'm all for equality. But I have the feeling that nowdays, this sub is mostly driven by hating ""feminists"" and making fun of other people. Rational conversations are mostly overshadowed by now.

I have been researching feminism for about fifteen years. In these fifteen years I have come across a preponderance of feminist literature defending, celebrating and advocating for **pedophilia**, books worse than you can ever possibly imagine in your worst nightmares. This post is dedicated to one such book written by icon of feminism **Pat Califia**, a book containing a detailed guide for women to grooming and sexually abusing children.

If these posts manage to find an audience on this platform, I will carry on adding further parts to this series for so long as I am not banned. I will never run out of material. Such is the prevalence of pedophilia in feminism. You cannot swing a dead cat in feminism without hitting a pedophile or an advocate of pedophilia. Feminism is FULL of them.

If you like what you will read here, consider supporting me by following me and please do cite me wherever you use this work on which I have expended many years of my life. What I am sharing with you here is nothing but the tip of the iceberg that is the information that I have on feminism. Help platform my voice. Help me expose, dismantle and depose this highly rotten, morally bankrupt ideology.

**BRIEF BACKGROUND ON PAT CALIFIA**

**Pat is a renowned American, feminist, LGBTQ+ activist**, an author, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and a sexual deviant of the highest order. She has authored articles and books in feminist pornography (Yes, there is such a thing) and sexual liberation. She owns a private practice as a therapist in California where she offers counselling services to persons of her inclinations. Her books are sold on all major online bookstores and her stories and articles have been published in some of the most celebrated mainstream feminist magazines for which she has received accolades from some of the biggest publishers in the world. She is **a huge advocate of pedophilia** and (hard as it is to believe) other sexual deviances just as bad if not worse.

Pat has throughout her life become more extreme in her sexuality. She identified as a heterosexual in her teens, before turning feminist and lesbian in her late teens then a female-to-male transexual in her forties.

[Picture published in 2019 on a feminist website, specialising in art and photography, celebrating Pat Califia. Taken originally by a feminist photographer in 1996, this photograph shows Pat, a self-identified certain lesbian in the 90s obsessed with sadomasochism, standing next to whips and chains.](https://preview.redd.it/7pybgygl8wy71.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6399e369f45b23413ebcd94ccf4dfa7c88817104)

[A more recent picture of Pat as a self identified transexual taken from her Twitter account. She is now certain she is not a lesbian, but a man trapped inside a woman’s body.](https://preview.redd.it/buaiqw5p8wy71.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd06b0d1465dd65c8f9e017d1aa06c9fe93e70e0)

**THE BOOK - INFANTS ARE SEXUAL!**

Patricia has published many books and articles promoting pedophilia in the feminist community, providing feminists with instructions on how they can groom and engage in sex with children.

**‘Children are sexual. Infants in their cribs have frequently been observed exploring and stimulating their own genitals’** declared this mentally disturbed woman in **Sapphistry**, a book she devoted to lesbian sexuality published in 1988.

https://preview.redd.it/zv979d8s8wy71.jpg?width=311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a82cb8b1c0c091bef255ee5c3ac7e97e2fa6d51

Lesbians, feminists and parents, she suggests in this book, can sexualise children by:

‘**hugging, kissing, shared nudity, bathing together, back rubs**... **playful wrestling**’ **as well as masturbating or engaging in sex with other people in front of children.**

She carries on to state:

**‘the possibility of sex between a child and an adult sometimes arises’** **adding that sex between adults and children can be an experience ‘enjoyable and pleasant for a child’** concluding that in a sexually liberated world, children would be free to choose their sexuality from **‘the complete spectrum of human sexual behaviour’.**

Pedophilia is widespread in the lesbian feminist community.

‘**An underage lesbian usually knows many more legally adult lesbians than other minors**. **Despite social barriers, romantic and sexual relationships are frequently formed between women of disparate ages**’ wrote Califia, then a member of the lesbian feminist scene for roughly twenty years, in Sapphistry describing the prevalence of pedophilia in the lesbian, feminist community.

Paedophilic relationships, adds Califia, may be threatened from the outside world, by families of the children and authorities concluding that **‘lesbians in such relationships often feel that they would be happier and safer if age-of-consent laws were repealed’** adding ‘\[t\]he rewards for such a relationship come from the women involved and the feelings they have for each other. In a less homophobic and violent world, it might be taken for granted that adults would teach adolescents about the art of sexuality as well as other aspects of life. If adolescents were not stereotyped as irresponsible, immature and unreliable, adults might be less reluctant to engage in intimate relationships with them. It would be clearer that such a relationship is a mutual exchange rather than a hierarchical, one way arrangement.’

**Point of interest:** Feminism has since the early 1960s and the advent of its sexual revolution constantly campaigned for the removal of age-of-consent laws and the legalisation of pedophilia across the globe. Icon of feminism Simone de Beauvoir led numerous such campaigns alongside the biggest feminist icons of her time. These efforts have continued to this day. They are so great in number you can write volumes of books citing and detailing them, each volume consisting of thousands of pages. Such is the magnitude of the problem that is pedophilia in feminism, a problem about which many outside of feminism remain ignorant.

[Article calling for an end to age-of-consent laws and the legalisation of pedophilia published in the early 80s for a British feminist magazine for children. Yes, you read that right, for children.  ](https://preview.redd.it/zw6r6lnu8wy71.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2691c8254ae7f67381e8c66f0fada34fcc4895ed)

Pat’s depravity does not stop at promoting pedophilia. She carries on in her book to promote **sex with animals**, for adults and children, claiming that it is chauvinistic to look down on such types of sex, noting that fantasies about such behaviour are **‘very common’** going on to provide her feminist readers with instructions as to how they can sexually abuse animals. She is right in this claim of hers. Fantasies of this nature and other types far worse are extremely common in the world of feminism and they are often not limited to mere fantasies as you will come to see in future parts of this series on Feminism and Pedophilia.

‘**Does it turn you on to pet your collie?** **Do you have a cat that insists on lying on your chest while you masturbate? Some experiences with animals are more clearly sexual. Children often explore the genitals of the family pet or allow an animal to smell and lick their genitals. If you have a pet, you may massage its genitals when it comes into heat and can’t be allowed to have sex with a member of its own species. You may allow your favourite animal to stay in the room while you masturbate or make love. Dogs become especially interested in sexual noises and smells and may want to taste sexual juices or perspiration on your skin and vulva without any encouragement from you…If you are not compelling the animal to accept your attentions and you are gentle, you will not harm it emotionally or physically. Concerns about hygiene can be alleviated by washing yourself or your non-human furry friend. Conception cannot occur as a result of sex between humans and animals or other species.’** Wrote Pat in Sapphistry.

**It gets worse**. She carries on in this book to promote the consumption of excrement, urine and menstrual blood to her readers, providing them with detailed advice on how to perform these acts, not only in adults but children as well.

**‘Children often play with their urine or excrement or interpret eliminating waste as a pleasant, sexually stimulating experience.** **Playing with piss can be a playful, childlike experience. Urinating on someone or at her command involves a loss of control and inhibition that is often an exciting, liberating experience…Controlling your partner’s elimination of waste is an intimate experience that can make her feel helpless, accepted and cared for…Urine is sterile. It is possible to drink the urine of a healthy person without harmful effect…Excrement is not sterile…If ingesting shit is a sexual game you play, you should monitor your health and the health of your partners with great care…A good investment…is a rubber sheet to protect the floor or your bed…**’ Wrote Patricia in Sapphistry of excrement and urine.

In her forward for the book, under the title Dirty Deeds for Dirty Boys \(and Men\) she writes ‘he gets exactly how thrilling it can be to push a weaker person down and suck them dry’ of the author of this book.](https://preview.redd.it/xg9c4iby8wy71.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f48a7764176593148f46388069d8fbf1e493d8)

Pat opens up Sapphistry with many fantasies written by women in the feminist community, one of which reads as follows:

‘Most of my fantasies, oddly enough, involve men, Taboo situations - like the back seat of a car are my favourite, which is a **gang rape** situation in a field of grass at night - **All young boys**.’

**Point of interest:** Some of the most popular sexual fantasies in feminists are of themselves getting raped by men. I am not joking. I will be touching on this matter in future parts of this feminism and pedophilia series. Surprising for an ideology that claims to fight a rape culture where rape is justified and trivialised, no? The hypocrisy of feminism has no bounds.

In Sapphistry, Pat not only encourages women to have pedophilic fantasies, but also to act out on them. Many feminist do. As you will see in future parts of this series that exposes a side of feminism to you that feminists like to hide from the general public, a general public to whom feminists lie morning, day and night, claiming they only want equality. This movement, does not want equality. It wants things far worse than this that it hides behind a facade of euphemisms.

‘Trust yourself’. Writes Califia in Sapphistry of sexual fantasies adding ‘**You will know when you are enjoying a fantasy for its own sake and when it represents something you may want to play around if an opportunity presents itself**. Don't discount the variety of sexual fantasies quoted earlier. Given this variation in plot and characters, it would be unrealistic to label some fantasy content acceptable and other content unacceptable. In all sexual matters, diversity and individuality seem to be the norm, not conformity and homogeneity …The only solution is to go after what we enjoy and and forget about what we’ve heard we should enjoy’.

She goes on in this book, as many icons of feminism have done before and after her, to promote child pornography arguing that it is not harmful, neither to children nor to those who consume this type of pornography, but harmful to repress it.

‘**Child pornography** is another big issue with the anti-pornography movement. As in the case of rape, it is difficult to see how eliminating the image will eliminate the act. The coercive use of children goes on regardless of whether or not there are magazines which document the fantasy of sex between adults and young people. Historically, movements to protect children from the sexual depredations of adults have focused on gay men. They thus supplement rather than challenge enforcement of mandatory heterosexuality'.

**Point of interest:** One of the fundamental principles on which feminism is based is the idea that heterosexuality is an oppressive social contract imposed on women as to limit them to men and therefore slavery. One of the foremost goals of the feminist movement is to redefine sexuality. This is a huge topic in feminism outside of the remits of this post. I will not expand on it here. If you have any questions feel free to ask in the comment section below.

In 1991, she was awarded the **Lambda Literary Award**, an award funded by Antioch University, California and some of the largest book publishers in the world including **Penguin Random House**. She received this award for a pornographic story titled Doc and Fluff about a sexual relationship between an adult woman and a girl child. The story is composed entirely of violence and pedophilia.

Finally, Pat founded a sadomasochist, feminist organisation in the late 1970s called the Samois that attended feminist conferences in which it set up workshops promoting pedophilia. Samois called for the removal of age of consent laws and the legalisation of pedophilia. It also supported pedophile groups such as the **North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA**).",64.0

Feminism this disease called feminism is so far removed from any decency. The whole trick to get people to change their behavior is by holding them to a higher standard. Constantly bashing men and shaming men is literally the dumbest fucking thing that stupid fuckin Feminist do. 

I am not writing this to drop a rant on you guys - I want the feminist reading this to see the effect that this kind of stupid brainwashing and hatred and shaming has on “good guys” like me 🤮. 

Yeah I happen to be a person with good energy and does nice things for other and Im popular blah blah blah - all that crap; but the hatred towards men only motivates me to retreat from society and stay clear of women. Idiots.

678,t3_qno2cn,Feminism isn't about equality anymore.,"Soooooo, Feminism. Dictionary definition:  'the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.' But is it really? It seems like rather than striving for equal rights to men feminists are now doing the opposite, what the men that they hate are apparently doing. Demonizing the other gender and building themselves up, at the expense of the other as well. Well, unfortunately for feminists, Men and women will NEVER be equal. Here's just a couple of the less obscure examples. (These will be stats from North America)

BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

 Women vs. Men physically: Average Female upper body strength: 52% of the strength of the average man. Average Female lower body strength: 66% of the strength of the average man. 

Average:

Weight: Male: 197.9 lbs. Female: 170.6 lbs.

Height: Male: 5 foot 9. Female: 5 foot 4.

PHYSIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

* Girls develop right side of brain faster than boys: leads to talking, vocabulary, pronunciation, reading earlier, better memory.
* Boys develop left side faster than girls: visual-spatial-logical skills, perceptual skills, better at math, problem solving, building and figuring out puzzles.
* Girls more interested in toys with faces than boys are; play with stuffed animals and dolls more; boys drawn to blocks or anything that can be manipulated.
* Women use both hemispheres of brain; corpus callosum thicker in women.

MISCELLANEOUS DIFFERENCES

* Men are more logical, analytical, rational.
* Women are more intuitive, holistic, creative, integrative.
* Men have a much more difficult time relating to their own feelings, and may feel very threatened by the expression of feelings in their presence. This may cause them to react by withdrawing or attempting to control the situation through a display of control and/or power.
* Men are actually more vulnerable and dependent on relationships than women are and are more devastated by the ending, since they have fewer friends and sources of emotional support.
* Men are more at ease with their own angry feelings than women are.
* Women are in touch with a much wider range of feelings than men, and the intensity of those feelings is usually much greater for women than men. As a result of this, many man perceive that women’s feelings appear to change quickly; men may find this irrational and difficult to understand.
* Men tend to be more functional in approaching problem-solving; women are aesthetically-oriented in addition to being functional.
* Women tend to be much more sensitive to sounds and smells than men are; and women as such tend to place a greater emphasis on “atmosphere”.

DIFFERENCES IN RELATIONSHIPS

* The most frequent complain men have about women:  Women are always trying to change them.
* The most frequent complaint women have about men: Men don’t listen.
* Women want empathy, yet men usually offer solutions.
* When a woman tries to change or improve or correct or give advice to a man, men hear that they are being told that they aren’t competent or don’t know how to do something or that they can’t do something on their own.
* Men often feel responsible or to blame for women’s problems.
* Men always assume women want advice and solutions to problems, that that is the best way to be helpful and to show love; women often just want someone to sincerely listen to them.
* Housework: men avoid it, try to get others to do it at all costs, feel demeaned by doing it. For women, cleanliness of house is a manifestation of warm, homey nest. Men and women have different thresholds for cleanliness and dirt.
* Men often try to change a woman’s mood when she is upset by offering solutions to her problems, which she interprets as discounting and invalidating her feelings.
* Women try to change men’s behavior by offering unsolicited advice and criticism and becoming a home-improvement committee.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, these are just a couple of key differences between men and women, not even getting into the vastly different culture. Long story short: Women are more emotional, physically weaker, tend to be more creative and intuitive, whereas men tend to be more logical, stable, and rational. This is why men and women can't be equal. It's because we aren't and never will be. There are men for a reason. There are women for a reason. There. But that's not addressing the bigger issue, which is feminism.

Feminists nowadays aren't shooting for equality. They are shooting for superiority. They do this by playing the victim card, and then attacking and bringing men down. They call them brutes, or stupid, or misogynists simply because they are men and are different. Men have much stronger sex drives than women, so they are therefore brutes. Men find women difficult to understand, since women's emotions are unstable, erratic, and matter to them far more than men, so men are therefore stupid. If men don't agree with the feminists, then they are therefore misogynists. This is the modern feminist narrative. They also bring up rights of women. Just STFU. Women have equal rights now, thanks to some of the better feminists back in the day, when there was a gap in rights between males and females. I'll address the gender pay gap now though. It does not exist. Well, technically it does exist, but not in the way feminists put it. Men get payed more than women on average. The reason why is: 

\-Men take far riskier jobs than women (Risky jobs tend to be higher paying)

\-Men tend to be more consistent workers and are promoted more often since they don't usually take breaks or quit their jobs to be a housewife or have kids like women do

\-Men work on average 2 hours longer than women in an average workweek, hence forming a gap with  their occupations, consistency, and time spent in work, causing them to make more money.

This puts a bit of a plug in the feminist narrative, and now since I've gotten rights out of the way, lets move on to how modern feminists tend to be. They aren't shooting for equality anymore. They are shooting for superiority. Rather than trying to be equals they are just degrading and demonizing men, and oh boy do they have a lot of platforms to use. Pretty much every major news network except maybe fox and some conservative networks, All over social media (oh yeah feminists love it there) and pretty much every media app. They spend their time crying about how they are so undervalued and how they are superior to men and should play the same role as them, even though we are so vastly different. And, news flash, men don't need to be told when they're in the wrong a whole lot, considering men tend to take responsibility if they upset a woman or if there is something wrong. Also, men naturally want to protect women. That's what they are designed to do, and that's how men should use their superior physical capabilities, while women are far better at raising children and being homemakers. If you look at any of this writing above you it should be pretty obvious that men and women have their own distinct attributes and roles, and trying to disrupt or substitute them is simply stupid. For us men, we should speak up more and be less docile about OUR rights and for feminists, you should reflect on why you are one, and what it'll do for the world.

And then she responded this:

I see your point.I couln't agree more .Thanks for the suggestion.However, the world is very diverse and there are still many countries and conmunities where women are simply ignored,unheard,abused and treated as a man's proprety or object.In the highly developed countries , where democracy and the Human Rights are trully lived women's discrimination is not even a subject  but ,unfortunatelly,those countries are still a minority. Either for religious or cultural reasons ,all over the world many women still suffer the stigma for simply having been born females.I would be a fool to deny that in certain sectors and even jobs there's a lot of prejudice towards men who ""dare"" to intrude in female jobs,for example in our country it is not unusual to look  at a man being a domestic servant or a nursery school teacher with some degree of disdain or even despise .

Think about this : ,at the moment,the number of top achieving students (high school and university)  is female so why have we had only just 1 female president and just for a short period o time?If female top achiervers are higher in numbers why aren't there more women in top positions or as political leaders?If many women have proven to be very well prepared  why some aren't accepted  or fired at jobs just because they are pregnant?

Those are some of the reasons why I will surely have to talk about it.It's part of our program.

Nevertheless,I admit that there is discrimination/prejudice/ abuse towards men too  but it is not the common rule.

This still a man's world !( Seal has a wonderful version of this song!) where most of the decisions and policies have been designed by men even if they refer to a woman's desire to practice abortion.Well sorry for having taken so much of your time but this a rather controversial topic.

701,t3_qmcuc6,Why the Hell do feminists get so pissed at guys who want rights?,"I was ordering a coffee with my colleagues ""women and men"" and one of them asked what I thought on feminist and men's rights. I said ""Personally I don't like to talk about these topics, and it always leads to problems"" (it fucking did). After I then answered with a question ""Feminists want equality. So how the fuck you want equality when you don't even acknowledge mens rights...? Don't I deserve rights as?"". ""It makes no damn since and is a contradiction to what you say you want."" (Then everything goes to shit.). Apparently there was a group of feminists around and heard me then they approached me about what I said. First I didn't know they were feminists until one of them said this. ""You don't fucking deserve rights. None of you four do. You are disgusting monster who constantly oppress women disregarding their rights, strength, and power."". I told her I don't and who the Hell are you to make that assumption. There are literally three women here would say I don't do any of that shit. After that stuff got physical. The same one that approached me then went ahead and kicked me in the balls. No joke kicked me in the balls as hard as I could and they started trying to assault me more. Me and all of my mail colleagues were to lay a finger on one of these 5 women we would go to jail. Meaning I had to sit and take being hit and scratched until people got them away from me. I know some people are going to call me a bitch for not pushing them off. Yet if I were to push one of them they are going to hit the floor get right back up and keep trying. And I would be called a damn woman beater and risk going to fucking prison. Finally my female colleagues my 3 female colleagues and two women who noticed the situation pulled them off and called the police. When they arrived they didn't even question all the scratches and bruises on my body. They went straight to the damn women.

She got the job because of her father, an alleged expert gunsmith. She admits to having issues loading firearms (with blanks) confidently, and was also seen breaking safety rules and regs on a previous movie set. (Handing a firearm improperly to a minor child on set.)

Nothing was done, and now someone is dead.

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10125505/Filming-halted-Alec-Baldwin-Rust-movie-inexperienced-24-year-old-gave-gun-child-set.html#comments](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10125505/Filming-halted-Alec-Baldwin-Rust-movie-inexperienced-24-year-old-gave-gun-child-set.html#comments)

I think this young lady should have stuck to selfies and her social media image.

Being in charge of firearm safety on something as busy as a movie set requires proper training, experience and a track record of accountability and safety. This person has none of those things.

In her statements from her lawyers, all we get is a litany of excuses how this incident was everybody else's fault except for hers. And I'm left here scratching my head.

[https://www.tmz.com/2021/10/29/rust-armorer-hannah-gutierrez-reed-lawyer-live-rounds-fatal-shooting/](https://www.tmz.com/2021/10/29/rust-armorer-hannah-gutierrez-reed-lawyer-live-rounds-fatal-shooting/)

These excuses ironically point towards what is also lacking here:  a sense of personal responsibility.

1. She claims she had two positions and was over-stretched.
2. She claims her requests for ""additional training"" were ignored.
3. She claims she brought up safety issues and was ignored.
4. She claims guns were locked up, yet others were taking them out for target practice.
5. She points the finger at every other person on set besides herself.

Quite interesting ""defense"" - how she admits to KNOWING things were unsafe on set yet she claims her only responsibility was perhaps mentioning to one or two disinterested parties. If things were indeed that dangerous, and her authority as a high-ranking safety official in a very important role was not being acknowledged, who else did she report it to? Only her boss? Were there not other places/agencies to report to?  The film-makers association? The union? Law enforcement? She had ALL KINDS of other ways she could have made the safety problems known. Yet, for her own self interests, she continued working in an unsafe environment (she herself was largely responsible for creating). There were TWO courses of action here:

a) Report it further, to more and different people.

b) Failing a response in (a), STEP DOWN and cite reasons why

And again, how is it that she could be the LAST person on the list of those responsible for safety while holding the title of ""Armorer""?  She was not a prop assistant. She was not a stage hand. She was the ARMORER, allegedly.

Myself, after reading about her past, I wouldn't hire this young lady to polish my firearms, let alone be responsible for people's safety regarding firearms.

""Girl Power"" has cost someone their life and now the lady's family (and Mr. Baldwin) has to suffer the trauma from this.

Shame on the gyno-powers at work that would hand jobs to people not qualified to them based on who they know or what their gender is.

It's fine feminists want women to get into positions based on their gender. But perhaps when these are highly safety sensitive positions we should rethink ""girl power"" and hire people actually qualified to keep people safe - and alive.

What's sick is the comments which defend this ""poor girl"" and insist it's someone else's responsibility beyond the armorer's to ensure firearm safety on set.

I guess when you have an unqualified girl in a critical safety role, safety has to fall on someone else's shoulders. Or, people just get killed. And this time, that's exactly what happened.

Shame on you fake armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. You knew you were over your head and decided to roll with it and now someone is dead.

&gt;My  (31m) wife (33f) is currently pregnant. The baby is not mine, it’s not  even hers: she’s a surrogate for her best friend and his husband.   
&gt;  
&gt;I didn’t know she was going to do this. She mentioned it a few times  in passing but I thought she was just considering it. I never gave it  much thought because we’ve had many conversations during our  relationship and marriage about not wanting children whatsoever, so I  thought she was entertaining the idea out of politeness. Then one day  she tells me the appointment is booked and it’s happening. I literally  get no say because it’s ‘her body her rules’. Even though I have to  obviously now have to step up and look after my pregnant wife, deal with  the challenges of a pregnancy which we’d agreed not to go through, take  on the financial burden during her months of maternity leave, and  support her physically during her recovery. I’d have no problem doing  this if it was our child and we’d agreed to have it, and I felt like my  view was valued whatsoever, but I really had no say at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;Part of the deal was that the fathers would be very supportive of her  and help out wherever possible. They mean well but this means they’re  now round our house almost every other day, sometimes all evening until  my wife is too tired, so it feels like there really is no respite from  all things baby.  
&gt;  
&gt;As her hormones have obviously become more intense and our  relationship continues to be strained I suggested relationship  counselling but my wife says she’s too tired to go, we need to save our  money and we can deal with these challenges after the baby is born. But  the baby is still 15-16 weeks away and I can’t take this any more. So I  moved out.  
&gt;  
&gt;**I’m not suggesting a permanent separation because I love my wife** but I  can’t be around her and all the baby stuff all day every day. Just some  kind of break where we can deal with this how we need to and then come  back together once life is a bit more normal. I thought this was fine  but since **I moved in with my friends every single person I’ve spoken to  says I’m in the wrong and that I’ve abandoned my pregnant wife.** So AITA?

But yeah I think I'm addicted to calling out hypocrisy. I put them in a position where they either have to admit men and women aren't equal or that I'm right, neither of which they will do and it gives me a thrill watching these people I know argue for fun pretty much rage quit

I've done it to the point I have a borderline formula

So some shortened examples

I'll ask them if it's wrong for a guy to try and fuck his roommate

Now the whole time I'm waiting on this ""if she wanted to have sex with him it would have already happened"" or some other version of that

But in the meantime I'll throw in some other things that would piss them off too. So like I know for a fact they can't be against casual sex because they're so pro women they can't criticise something like that. Since I know this, when they say something like it's devaluing her to just want to fuck, I'll counter with something like ""sex doesn't devalue women"" ""women can have casual sex if they want"" because I know they'll have to talk in circles to convince themselves they're right because you can't hold the position that sex doesn't devalue women and that casual sex is ok while thinking that wanting to fuck a friend or whatever is devaluing her

If they say something about discomfort I'll say women are strong and independent. Although I have actually heard and agree with counter arguments to this

But what I'm waiting on is the ""If she wanted to it would have already happened"" the reason I'm waiting on that is because you either have to admit blatant sexism or that I'm right. Because the counter is ""if it's wrong for the guy to ask to fuck her, then it must also be wrong for the girl to ask the guy to fuck her"" there's no way around that other than blatantly saying that yes, guys can't ask for sex but girls can.... Now of course they'd never say that because it's just blatant sexism lmao

Or another example I'd do it with a friend instead of roommate

They'll say something like ""you're willing to throw away a friendship over sex?"". So I'll say ""no I wouldn't stop hanging around a girl just because she rejected me. Surely you would be the one throwing away a friendship over sex since you're saying the girl would be the one uncomfortable and she'd end the friendship?""

I do this quite often when I'm bored and I not only enjoy watching them rage quit but it amuses me that I've done this about 15 times now and since the SJWs of the internet are like bots I can almost copy and past my exact argument I made to a separate sjw and it would still be relevant

I think the thrill I get is these people preach equality but as soon as I flip the genders they freak out and their arguments fall apart.

If anyone is trying to argue with feminists for the sake of it sex is a good thing to target because many women are deeply insecure when it comes to sex and secretly feel shame about their past despite what they say. Much of what they say about slut shaming is actually projection. Mix that with the hatred they have for men's sexuality and it's very easy to get a raise or make them start saying dumb shit.

If anyone's wondering, with incels I used to poke fun at the ones who wanted women to be household items issued by the government. Most of them were repulsed by prostitution but yet still advocated government mandated girlfriends.... So you can imagine the type of logical hoops they'd have to jump through to come to such a conclusion and how much fun I had with it",94.0

**Hothead Paisan** is a comic widely popular in feminism one of many of its kind promoting division, anger, violence and hate between women and men. It was published quarterly between 1991 and 1996. It was an instant best-seller, selling out consistently.

The comic, created by feminist lesbian Diane DiMassa whilst she was in a drug and alcohol recovery programme, **follows a self described** **homicidal lesbian terrorist that goes around attacking, castrating, mutilating and murdering males**.

This comic has received nothing but glowing reviews from the feminist community, some only criticising it for depicting hate and violence against transgenders.

They have given it a 4.17 out of 5 rating on the Goodreads website where they call its sexism and violence ‘cathartic’ and ‘funny’.

Feminism inspires so much hate and anger in women for men that it leads many women to find great pleasure in pain and violence inflicted on men.

This comic promoting sexism and violence is available for purchase on Amazon and other such major bookselling platforms where feminists have also given it nothing but positive five star reviews.

‘This is the only feminist cartoon in the world that makes me laugh out loud, but then where else in the world of comics can you turn to consistently see **white male jerks righteously castrated**, **mutilated and murdered**, by a self proclaimed homicidal lesbian terrorist? **Read Hothead get inspired**’ wrote feminist activist Erin Immaculate of Hothead Paisan in a popular feminist magazine with the following cover:

This type of comic is not isolated in feminism. There are many thousands of others like it, also highly popular in feminist circles about which people outside of feminism know little or nothing. Below you can find one such example published in a feminist magazine, hard as it is to believe, for children. It depicts a comic strip of a girl, a child, accusing a boyfriend of rape before she and her friends castrate him.

**Point of interest:** This last comic is part of a highly popular feminist magazine sold to children in the UK throughout the 80s and 90s. It is full of articles promoting paedophilia, abortion, violence, even terrorism and it touches nothing but the tip of the iceberg that is rhetoric of this nature in feminist literature.",25.0

So somewhere i actually agree with many feminists on is that the patriarchy hurts men, my problem is those same women will acknowledge this fact but then act like men as a whole are privileged when in fact most women have more privilege than most men.

Now this part here has nothing to do with women and it is something us men should sort out. The problem is ultra powerful men suppress common men for their own greedy gain in an effort to attain many women.

In the past it was the norm to kill men and rape women, in the modern world of ethics and laws and such instead of killing fellow men they instead rip resources off them and instead of raping women they simply offer them money and prestige and power and a lavish life. (i don't give a fuck what anyone says, men will marry a broke bitch as long as she isn't crazy. Most women are prostitutes to some degree even if it isn't outright. Maybe they do require love and connection but most require money to go with it, if you exchange money for sex than what are ya?) the men at the top essentially flex and control media to make it seem like it's cool to be with them. Now this is of course a male made problem. It's an issue made by males for males and we should sort it out.

Now where do women and feminism come into this? Well the world was designed by old rich men for the benefit of young attractive women.(but the bar for attractive isn't very high and even unattractive women still have trickle down benefits) so the old and the rich essentially make it difficult for the young and the poor men to succeed.

On to women, they act like they're oppressed when almost everything in society is designed to benefit them. Imagine posting on a relationship sub you think your girlfriend is using you because she never dropped 300 on the first date. If a girl ASSAULTS YOU you're expected to not even defend yourself. They're given priority in hospitals and when the police are called and in states of emergency such as a ship sinking.

So yeah, fuck the patriarchy. Fuck those old crusty cunts at the top but why and how has feminism came to the conclusion they're the victims? By what metric are they victims? They always point to the wealth gap and always leave out two huge chunks of information

1. Pregnancy plus being physically weaker is why many women don't get paid as much

2. It's not the majority of men who're benefiting from this it's a few ultra rich at the top that hold almost all the wealth.

Plus just a side note that the vast majority of guys aren't abusive and girls get so many requests to date it's hilarious and then cry when they somehow all manage to date the few 1 in 100 dickheads

So from an average guys perspective, ever since you're a teen you're expected to sacrifice yourself, you're expected to be a gentleman and put women on a pedestal. You're put under judgement when her dickhead boyfriend that she choose over you rapes her little sister or her friends then beats her up for not being cool with it. Then in many cases they still decide to have a kid with this POS and guess what? She can't work because of trauma and the boyfriend doesn't give a fuck, so you mr. Average normal guy, they take your taxes to pay for the demon bastard offspring of the bitch who rejected you or guys like you and the worst of the worst male gets to pass on his genes. Oh and the tax? Well you see those ultra rich dudes that horde all the wealth that you get blamed for, well they don't actually pay tax😊 but YOU have too. And then this bitch gets on her feminist grind and buys her a cup that says male tears and starts posting to FDS about men ain't shit, all while you go out to work and she leeches tax off you. You have a problem with it? You don't like getting your money and time taken off you with no sex in return? Deal with it you fucking incel. You don't want to deal with women at all? Oh good go away then, in fact make a group dedicated to fellas going to their own place, doing their own thing... What could we call such a group? WELL IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER YOU CUNT, CENSORED. Can't be going and doing your own thing you misogynist bitch. You want to pay women for sex? MISOGYNIST CUNT WHO THINKS WOMEN ARE OBJECTS OR PROPERTY. Since women make the rules, you want to learn how to play the game huh? You want to be romeo? MANIPULATIVE CUNT HOW DARE YOU PLAY MIND GAMES. You want to just avoid women altogether? You fucking misogynist piece of shit of fucking dare you? A kween deserves to be pampered.

Mr. Average guy finds a girl he likes and gets married. Better be on your toes broski, one wrong move and all your shits gone.

Mr. Average maybe decides not to get married and live the single life. Well if at any point a girls says you raped her or beat her then that's what you done. Even if the courts find you innocent the trial by public won't. Didn't you know that stupid things like evidence and innocent until proven guilty are just tools of the patriarchy?

A naked girl on the street shakes her big phat ass in your face and you decide to grab her? Uh oh that's assault if she decides it's assault. I mean, let's just ignore the blatant sexualisation of herself, let's ignore the public indecency, the invasion of private space. It's just a joke when she does it, women can express their sexuality how they want you silly inkwell. But when you decide to grab her or try and fuck her? Well she didn't give you consent you fucking weirdo. Grinding her asshole on your nose? That's not consent to put your dick in her, fuck it's not even consent to ASK, even if you ask that makes you a predator.

Popular tiktok girl caught on video pinning a guy down and grinding on him while he's clearly uncomfortable? Looooooool

You smack a girls ass because she's actively either naked or nearly naked and giving out sexual energy, showing her availability and giving out signals? You're a rapist.

So mr.average is shafted when it comes to sex and money. What about workplace disputes? If you don't have a whole lotta evidence then ya fucked. Physical alterations? Nahhh you don't have a chance. Custody despute of kids? Noooooope.

So where I'm struggling with, is as an average guy what benefit do i actually have over an average women? What privilege have i got?

It seems to me I have less free speech, less financial benefits or benefits at all really while I'm expected to have the same or more responsibility.

‘The period of **woman’s supremacy** lasted through many centuries - undisputed, accepted as natural and proper wherever it existed, and was called the **matriarchate**, or mother-age’ Leading figure of the suffragette movement in the US, socialist, marxist, communist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, parroting the ideas of the founder of marxism and communism Frederich Engels, calling for matriarchy, for women to replace men in power in an article titled Matriarchate or Mother-Age published in 1891.

""We \[women\] are, as a sex, **infinitely superior to men**"" Elizabeth Cady Stanton quoted in as Revealed in Her Letters, Diary and Reminiscences Volume 2, 1922, cited on the Chronicles of Cultural Misandry [http://nomoremisandry.blogspot.com/2013/09/elizabeth-cady-stanton-first-wave.html](http://nomoremisandry.blogspot.com/2013/09/elizabeth-cady-stanton-first-wave.html).

Feminism, as you rightly state in your submission, was never about equality, NEVER. It has always been a sexist ideology, rotten and corrupt to the core, highly deceptive and manipulative, pursuing nothing but money, power and influence, at any cost.

The aforementioned **Stanton**, one of the founders of the feminist movement, was an ardent **racist, eugenicist and a slave owner**. Throughout her life she fought hard against the emancipation of black people in the US. In the 1860s, she struck an alliance with the openly racist leaders of the Kansas Democratic Party and together with them worked to oppose black enfranchisement in the US.

Contemporary feminism controls the mainstream narrative surrounding its past. It has whitewashed its ugly past, presenting itself in the past as nothing but a wholesome ideology. This could not be further from the truth.

When you go on Wikipedia and search Stanton you find nothing but lies written about her. On Wikipedia, they actually claim that this racist, supported black enfranchisement the opposite of what she did in real life. They have deleted and whitewashed all the negative information written about her on her Wikipage, which initially contained vivid accounts of her racist past,

People are being brainwashed and lied to by feminism. They have been led to believe that feminism used to be good that it used to fight for 'women's rights' and that it somehow lost its way. This could not be further from the truth!!!! Feminism has always been as bad as it is now, but thanks to censorship most people don't know!

Let me quickly give you an example of the lies of feminism.

Feminism has convinced people today that the suffragette movement, what feminists call 'first wave feminism',  in the late 1800s to early 1900s fought for and won women voting rights. This is not true!

The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) a British socialist, marxist, communist union known more popularly as the suffragettes, a union led mostly by man-hating lesbians, disbanded in 1914 with the eruption of the First World War. It was disbanded by the leader of this union Emmeline Pankhurst and its deputy, her daughter Christabel after they were bribed with a substantial amount of money to do so by Stanely Baldwin's Conservative Government. They then quickly proceeded to turn the WSPU into an agency for the British government to pressure men to enlist and die in the First World War through the White Feather Campaign. In this campaign they went around the streets of the UK attacking men and young boys, hanging white feathers on them as to shame them into enlisting, fighting in and dying in the First World War. They repeated this campaign in the Second World War.

The suffragettes disbanded their movement FOUR years before the Parliament in the UK gave all men and women the right to vote through the enactment of the People’s Act of 1918. This change was not in any way shape or form motivated by the suffragettes and their movement, but by men dying on the front lines in the First World War. The Parliament in the UK argued that men, most of whom at the time also lacked the right to vote, deserved the right to vote because they were dying for the country and if they were expected to die for the country they surely deserved the right to vote. It is this that caused the parliament to enact the People's Act of 1918 allowing all people in the UK the right to vote, not the suffragette movement which had disbanded four years prior to the enactment of the People's Act. As in, contrary to feminist claims, it wan't feminists that allowed women the right to vote, but men dying on the front lines of wars!! For god's sake, read the Handsard records of the debates leading up to the People's Act of 1918. There is no mention of suffragettes anywhere!! They played no part in the total enfranchisement of women. Hardly anyone knows about these things.

Millicent Fawcett, feminist and leader of the suffragists in the UK supported, protected and promoted concentration camps set up by the British Government for the Boers in South Africa in the Boer War, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent  men, women and children by virtue of nothing but the racial identity group that they belonged to. **How many people know this about the genocidal past of feminism**? How many people today involved in gender politics know that early feminism played a pivotal role in genocide? Clearly, not many, because we recently had a statue erected in London to celebrate Millicent Fawcett:

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Millicent\_Fawcett\_Statue\_02\_-\_Courage\_Calls\_%2827810755638%29\_%28cropped%29.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Millicent_Fawcett_Statue_02_-_Courage_Calls_%2827810755638%29_%28cropped%29.jpg)

Feminists control the mainstream narrative. They have whitewashed their history. They have presented a false account of their past to people, a past full of just as much perversion, violence, ugliness, lies and hate as that of feminism today.

Below you can find a headline for an article published on April 20 1920 in the New York Times on the sinking of the Titanic. This article was exposed in Women First, Men Last by Steven Adams:

[https://i.ibb.co/nQCyxMd/Women-first-Is-the-Universal-Rule-says-Sylvia.png](https://i.ibb.co/nQCyxMd/Women-first-Is-the-Universal-Rule-says-Sylvia.png)

In this article, marxist, communist, leading figure in and daughter of the leader of the suffragette movement, Sylvia Pankhurst argues that women must always come first in disasters and conflicts, justifying the disproportionate number of male deaths in the Titanic incident.

I replied saying that she's literally a prostitute so she's probably more mature than most people her age (this seems logical to me since ya know, she gets fucked by guys for a living and obviously learns about their relationships)

She said something like ""don't refer to me by a slur, fuck you!""

I reply ""it's your job cry more""

Ok, she broke two rules and initiated aggression but she has no ban

They obviously banned me for my first message since sex workers are a protected class but I made a good counter argument and it doesn't actually break any rules so they quoted my second message as the reason for the ban 

So ""don't refer to me by a slur, fuck you!"" Isn't a ban but ""it's your job cry more"" is, hmmmmm.

I took this following passage from a clandestine, but seminal feminist journal. The passage was authored by prominent feminist theorist/activist Betsy Warrior (pictured above). Its journal was distributed underground in the late 1960s/early 1970s, amongst women in the feminist movement. The authors of this journal were and are still considered some of the most influential feminists of all time. Most of them secretly promoted genocide against men. I hope you find this insight into a prevalent and widely celebrated side of feminism that feminists like to keep hidden from the general public eye opening.

“If men are going to destroy the planet Earth and all its inhabitants with violence and wars? **all men should be killed**, to preserve the rest of humankind. If they decide they don't want to keep on in the direction they're heading, they will have to control and subdue their inner nature as they have outer nature.

**Like many other organisms in biological history, man has become an obsolete life form.** He is an anachronism in this technological context. His muscles are no longer needed. The built-in obsolescence of his physical and emotional nature is now apparent.

The aggressive, destructive drives of man lack proper reasonable outlets. He is being phased out by technology. Sperm banks and test-tube babies can take over his last function, his only function that has positive effects for the human race. All the rest of his functions, can be performed by females much more efficiently, minus the destruction.

In an agrarian society man could expend his energy tilling the land and caring for animals. In a hunting culture he consumed his energy fishing and killing animals. These special drives aren't needed now for survival, now **they are an evolutionary hangover.** In the present era the same demands aren't existent. Now men consume their energy devising ways to kill and killing each other. Their energy lacks outlet and makes man consume himself, like a frenzied shark eating his own guts. **MAN HAS PASSED THE STAGE WHERE HE IS JUST UPSETTING THE BALANCE OF NATURE, HE IS THE IMBALANCE IN NATURE!**

With the growing size of the human race, **population control is necessary** in some situations. But to consider only the quantity of the population, is to see only half the problem. The quality of the population is just as important to the future welfare and survival of the human race. Those who love war-games and destructive exercises to expend their energies, are just as much of a threat to humanity as overpopulation.

**The qualities of man make him unfit for life today**. And like all harmful factors his life should come to an end. Due to great famines, plagues, and wars the population once had built-in checks. But that was a very miserable, cruel and inhumane way to insure the survival of some. The best didn't necessarily survive only the most aggressive.

Today science has found ways to alleviate famine, conquer germs that cause plagues, and check the size of the population itself. **One germ hasn't been identified and destroyed; the germ that causes wars and destruction. That germ is man.**

It is not in his interest to acknowledge his role in human suffering. The male has a vested interest in denying the implications and consequences of his existence, and that interest is the instinct of self preservation. As long as man is in power he will never admit the necessity of his demise from the Planet Earth for the achievement of a humane evolution.

The tyrannosaurus had to become extinct. Because of the dinosaurs huge size and voracious appetite, other life forms were unable to develop and survive in its geological era. It needed all other life to feed on, to sustain its own life. After eating all other species it could use for food, they died of starvation Only with their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period, could other better life forms come into being and evolve.

**Like the tyrannosaurus, man is blocking evolution and sustaining his life at the expense of other better life forms. Until he gives up existence, either voluntarily or by force, there will be no relief from suffering nor any moral progress on this planet.**”",153.0

This is agaist Reddits rules!so is hate speech, sexism and mass spreading of damaging misinformation. 

There has been a spate of subs being permanently banned for being misogynistic, men only or against women in anyway shape or form. I do not understand why FDS which is a toxic echo chamber that refers to men as ""scrotes"" and ""LVM"" which means ""low value man""... is not only allowed to continue but make money aswell. They spread bullshit about mens intentions, needs, mental health and much much more, an ""LVM"" is any man that is not willing or cannot provide a lavish, celebrity like lifestyle while being totally subservient and controlled all while having absolutely no expectations of these women at all. They demand a rich superman version of the traditional man while totally refusing to be traditional themselves, truthful, committed or even contribute to the point of ridiculousness. They are literally an incel creation machine, any decent guy would morph into a voluntary celibate, women hating incel after being chewed up and spat out of that degenerate hell hole. A sub so backward and dumb they inadvertently manufacture the type of guy they scream hatred for with their ridiculous attitude, expectations, philosophy and total hatred of men.

They use their sub to brigade other subs and get them banned, they use vote manipulation with their sheer numbers, breed hate speech and lies, warp expectations of new young women, are definitely misandrist, they're  openly sexist and autoban any male or anyone associated with any other male subs, spread misinformation about male mental health and think men deserve no human rights... and now on top of all that they are making enough money to buy and run severs, a website and an official app!

880,t3_qer4mx,"The Feminist Notion Of A Glass Ceiling Is Not Only False, But Is Also A Narrative That Ends Up Harming Women.","A common narrative spread by the feminist movement is the idea of a glass ceiling. Some form of barrier that blocks women from entering executive positions, in an attempt to maintain the workplace as some form of ""boys club."" This idea doesn’t do the situation justice. First, the primary function of the wage gap isn’t always subconscious bias, but rather the choice made by a lot of women to have children. Let's say we have two employees for a company, Mark and Mary. Mark and Mary both put in a lot of time to work, on the order of 50-60 hour work weeks, and both Mark and Mary make $50,000. However, Mary decides to have a kid, and has to dial her work week down to 40 hours a week. Mark on the other hand, is still working 50-60 hours a week. Mark ends up getting paid more by promotions and raises, simply because he has dedicated more time to his job.

This brings me to the second flaw in the glass ceiling argument, a lot of women are less willing to put in large amount of hours to their work. When asked to list what was valued in a workplace, women were much more inclined than men to value work-life flexibility. While this does have the benefit of improving women's mental health as they are not as likely to overwork themselves, it comes at the expense of financial gain, as it is hard for an employee working 40 hours a week to compete with an employee working 60-70 hours a week. This is also why we don't see many female CEO's, as a lot of women don't want to take on the burden of working 70-80, maybe even 100 hours a week to get there.

The third flaw in the idea of a glass ceiling is the idea that men and women are doing the same exact work. Putting workplace habits under a microscope shows this to be false. Women were significantly more likely to volunteer for more altruistic tasks when working than men. While these altruistic tasks, like organizing company events and serving in low-ranking committees do help the company, it comes at the expense of the individual. This is because these altruistic tasks are less likely to get someone promoted than say, an employee who put 60 hours of work into a company project.

The depiction of the workplace disparity as a glass ceiling is also a label that misdiagnoses the root of the issue. A sticky floor is a much better description of the issue, with the adhesive being the lack of confidence held by a lot of women in their work. A recent study revealed that women were much less likely to self-promote their work, even when revealed that it would help with career advancement. This is further manifested when asking for promotions and raises, where lack of confidence in their work would certainly short-change women.

Finally, the biggest obstacle for women in the workplace would in fact, be other women. An analysis of workplace incidents in 2012 revealed that 68% of workplace bullying was between the same sex. 80% of that 68% was women picking on other women. A bit of math equates 54% of all workplace bullying being women picking on other women. This in turn harms women, as lets say in a group of women, one woman advances in the corporate ladder. Statistically, she is less likely to give a hand to the women below her, but rather kick them off the corporate ladder. If women didn't stall the advancement of other women, then we might not even have this issue (glass ceiling, or more properly, sticky floor) in the first place. This is also why I say the idea of a glass ceiling is harmful to women. By shifting the blame on men, it diverts any attention away from toxic practices by women that may hold them back.",64.0

Anything that they get specifically that other genders don't. Women are not special, and they are not ethereal angels or gods to get anything more than basic human rights and laws. Women do not deserve reduced sentences, or to rape men and get away with it, or any other privellege other genders don't get.

916,t3_qdl400,The most hilarious thing happened recently in Spain,"One of the most popular writers in progressive Spain is Carmen Mola. This enigmatic crime writer wrote a whole series in which the protagonist was Elena Blanco - ""a peculiar and lonely woman who loves grappa, karaoke, classic cars and sex in SUVs."" No wonder then that she has become the darling of progressive feminists in this left-soaked country.

People liked it so much that it eventually won the second and most important literary award in Spain - the Planeta Publishing Award. However, what was the surprise of the audience at the awards ceremony when they saw ... three middle-aged men instead of a strong, independent woman. As it turned out, Carmen Mola was just a pseudonym, and the authors of the crime novels were Agustín Martínez, Jorge Díaz and Antonio Santos Mercero, by the way well-known screenwriters in Spain.

Some appreciated the writers' clever plan. ""The idea for a mother of three children, who is also a university professor, a woman teaching algebra in the morning and writing brutal, macabre novels in scraps of free time in the evening, turned out to be a great marketing operation"" - noted the newspaper ""El Mundo""

But as you can guess, feminists did not like it, as they got a lot of pain in their backside. Beatriz Gimeno, a feminist, writer and activist who previously suspected that the novels signed ""Carmen Mola"" did not come from a woman's hand, said: “Besides using a female nickname, these guys have spent years giving interviews. It is not just a name - it is a false identity used by readers and journalists. They are scammers, ”she assessed on Twitter.

To make it funnier, when the identity of Carmen Moli was not yet known, one of the departments of the Women's Institute recommended her work as ""which helps to understand the everyday life and experiences of women in different historical periods, and also contribute to respect for women's freedom and women's rights."" In addition to the name of Mola, the recommendations include, among others, such a feminist as Margaret Atwood.

I love how feminist fantasies are quickly brought down to earth by brutal reality. A young, gifted writer who is an icon of modern feminism, in fact, turned out to be three middle-aged white men, even Monty Python would not have thought of that.",58.0

Edit 3: are there any recommendations for cheap lawyers?

975,t3_qb062x,Funniest thing about FDS,"The most hilarious thing about FDS is the fact that they're so damn sensitive, to the point where they set up a bot that bans users who never even participated in the sub... for simply posting on subs that they dont like. They're so sensitive, that they cant handle opposing viewpoints not matter what. Any opposing viewpoint that comes their way, they automatically silence it. That's one of the easiest ways to get radicalized. When you have absurd beliefs and silence literally any viewpoint that doesn't align with yours, you are paving the way for yourself to get radicalized. 

FDS is an echo-chamber cesspool. The same opinions get posted all the time. The same type of content everywhere you go on the sub (and this is because they literally ban anyone who doesn't agree with them, leaving only the people who do agree).

In their deranged minds, FDSers believe that they're never wrong. I dare you to go on FDS and try to find at least one member who opposes any main viewpoint in a post. I bet 100 dollars you can't. Its just one big fucking echo-chamber lmao, they spend all day just saying the same shit, all the time. What's the end goal? Don't they ever get tired of seeing and talking about the same shit constantly? Are their lives so boring to where they can talk about the same recycled delusional bullshit 24/7 and not get tired of it? It's damn near a cult at this point. Do they ever question what they're doing with their lives? 

Always remember this. The MAIN REASON why FDS bans anyone who doesn't agree with them, is because they know how ridiculous they sound and they don't want anyone else calling them out for it. Deep down inside, they know how fucking stupid and delusional they are. Because if they didn't know, why would they feel the need to ban users who dont agree, and even ban users who never even participated in the sub? They're trying to protect their deranged asses from being destroyed with logic and reasoning. Because they know that the moment they allow rational and normal people to post on their sub and debate them, their delusions will shatter into pieces",20.0
