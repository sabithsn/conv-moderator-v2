0,t3_rw1ix9,AITA for calling the town on my neighbor,"My neighbor's yard slopes down toward mine, during the past few heavy rain storms I have noticed significant water rolling down from his property onto mine.  Recently, he has had a lot of dirt and top soil dumped and worked into the property via a bobcat or excavator. 

When I asked him about it, he kind of just blew it off and said something like ""just trying to fix all this shit in my yard.""  But it clearly looks like they are packing extra soil atop the lawn and adding to the slope into my back yard/side yard.  

We both just had French drains installed (by the same landscaper) and while mine was being installed  I overheard him ask the guy ""can't you run a drain pipe from my yard straight back into his"" meaning from his yard into my yard.  The worker told him ""He's only doing one side"" So I would obviously know if there was a 2nd random trench being dug out where I didn't want it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Considering his answer when I brought it up to him initially, and me overhearing him talk about draining even more into my yard I feel he's not trustworthy so I called the building department to have them do a casual drive by.  Should I have done more with talking to him? AITA for calling to building department?",1.0
1,t3_rw1irk,AITA for withholding my daughter's birthday gift until she does what's expected?,"My daughter is now 17. I've done my best to instill in her good manners. Every Christmas and birthday she's been a consistent thank you letter writer. It's just proper. Before she learned to write, I transcribed for her, but as soon as she could I had her writing her own. It was excellent penmanship practice too. Everyone always commented on how well behaved and polite my daughter was and getting a handwritten note showing her appreciation was the highlight of their day. My parents even have a box full of every thank you letter she ever wrote them. It means a lot to everyone, and all it takes is a little work from her to show how much they mean to her. 

Apparently this Christmas, she has decided that she doesn't want to actually write them out. She thinks that a call was enough to show her gratitude, which is frankly is so impersonal as to be an outright insult. I raised her better.

Her birthday was yesterday. It came and went with no presents, but still a happy birthday and a nice breakfast because I would never completely ignore her birthday. Normally I'd give her her gifts, take her out to dinner or we'd watch a marathon, but this year, none of that happened. She asked a few times leading up to her birthday if we'd do a dinner or anything special, mentioning a movie she wanted, or asked to take the day off school, but I reminded her of our deal. She had asked for a set of artist markers and a specific brand sketchbook. She was warned long in advance that due to the price, that'd be her only present for her birthday. She happily accepted that arrangement when we first discussed it, and when reminded she stopped asking.

We didn't celebrate it for a combination: she was lazy about her thank yous, didn't show her gratitude, and we had already agreed that she would only get the markers and sketchbook. 

I told her, in light of the fact its well past Christmas and she still hasn't bothered even with the rough drafts, which I reminded her is breaking her grandparents' hearts, that until she is polite and shows her appreciation, I wouldn't be buying her the gift she asked for. 

She immediately started tearing up and wouldn't talk, so I coaxed her to use her words, to which called me unreasonable bitch. I sent her to her room until she could have a civil discussion. Instead, she slammed the door and said she wanted to go home aka her father's. All over a set of markers and the consequences of her own actions.",1.0

I wasn't aware where bcs I didn't bother asking, I thought we would talk about it after we met. When we met one of my friends said that we could go to his house, since his parents aren't home so I thought why not, I told my bf where we were going but didn't ask for permission.

3,t3_rw1fre,AITA for not giving my brother a ride after my mom backed out?,"I’ve had my license for quite some time now and I’m always the one who is asked to give people rides. I’m usually happy to do it but sometimes I have other commitments so I can’t and most of the time it’s cool but sometimes there are issues.

My mom and I had the day off yesterday and my brother just started a new job so he needed to get some new work clothes. He works today but he is known for waiting until the last minute so he waited until yesterday to ask one of us. My mom offered to do it because she was off so I went ahead and offered to go into work for a few hours. A few hours later, about an hour before I was supposed to leave, my mom fell asleep. My brother went to go wake her up so they could go and she said that she was too tired but I could do it. I told her that I couldn’t because there was no way we will get back in time and I already made a commitment to go into work. She said that my boss wouldn’t care if I didn’t show up and I told her it was the principle of the situation and she already offered. 

We went back and forth for a while and I put my foot down and said that I wasn’t gonna do it, so he didn’t end up getting his clothes. He didn’t get in trouble but he said that he felt somewhat embarrassed because it’s a nice restaurant. My mom hasn’t really spoken to me since then besides to call me selfish that I didn’t just tell my boss no. She seems to think that they’re going to take advantage of me and she doesn’t feel sorry if that happens. I’ve reminded her that she promised and it’s not my responsibility to correct her mistakes, but she doesn’t seem to get it. My brother is not mad at me because she understands my position and my mom was the one who left him out to dry. My older brother found out and he is glad that I put my foot down but he thinks there could’ve been a way to compromise. AITA?",2.0
4,t3_rw1emk,AITA for not wanting to give money to my ex towards the purchase of a house to keep a promise from when we were together?,"We started out as friends with benefits.  I am pretty successful and I have a habit of giving expensive gifts and presents to people I am seeing.  So over the course of the 2.5 years in this relationship I ended up paying for her grad school and some flights along with a number of other gifts. During this time my feeling started to grow and I fell in love with this person.  So after 2.5 years as friends with benefits we became exclusive.
Since I was in love with her when we became exclusive I told her I had a slush fund that I used for dating and to buy gifts for the many ladies I was dating and since we were now exclusive and was not dating others I told her I would give her the contents of this slush fund to use towards the purchase of a home that I know she was looking to do in the near future.
We were in an exclusive relationship for 4 months.  During this time I got her jewelry, expensive coat, started to pay her rent as well as flights for travel she did by herself.  I covered the costs of 2 flights in North America as well as business class flight to Europe along with hotels for her trip with family to Europe. I did all these things because I was in love with her.  After about 4 months she broke up with me as she did not have the same feelings towards me and we decided to stay friends.
After 2 months of just being friends she is in process of purchasing a home.  When I went and saw the home she was buying I noticed that the washer and dryer were really old and I told her that I would buy her a new washer and dryer set as a house warming present.  This upset her as she felt I would honor my previous promise of giving her the money in my slush fund to use towards her house. 
After some thought I told her that I did not feel it was appropriate to give her money towards the house as we were only friends.  This upset her even more and she felt that I never truly loved her as people don't treat people they love this way and that I was being spiteful because she did not return the feelings that I had towards her and that I was not the person she thought i was because I should not makes promises and not keep them.
Now I am really confused, even though I feel it is highly inappropriate I have always been a man of my word and so I am thinking maybe I should look to see how much money was in the account when I made the comment and give that amount to her. ( not necessarily the growth which was significant over the last 6 months)  I do feel that if I ended the relationship I may be more agreeable to giving her the money but she ended it.
This has obviously put a strain and added a dimension of coldness to our friendship and I am not sure how things will play out.

5,t3_rw1cym,AITA for walking away after my friend made another warning to me,"I 18f am friends with this guy Z 19m who lives across the hall from me in the dorms.

For background I grew up in a religion that messed me up quite a bit. I moved to an area where a good percentage of the population are members of that religion thinking that I was practically over a majority of my anger towards the religion just for the cheap tuition. Z lives with a few roomates and one of them (M) is a member of said religion.

One night while I was at Z's dorm M came out and joined the conversation. The topic of religion came up as I was able to talk to M about the church but he's never seen me in church. He asked why I left, I explained my reasons, and from there we got into a pretty heated argument about church and it's truthfulness.

It ended with M leaving himself from the conversation and I was still pretty mad. It didn't hit me till maybe a day or two later that I was an asshole to insult and bash on M's religion despit my experience growing up in it. I've since apologized to M and accepted that I was an asshole there.

Since the whole thing tho Z has been giving me warnings that M is gonna be around and that I need to watch what I talk about and not start any fights. M and I are on okay terms, pretty much as okay as you can be with your friend's roomate.

I've told Z that I've wanted to move on from that because I've since talked with M about it and have actively been avoiding any topic that might make M uneasy. I don't want another argument and want to move on because it's clear I still have some work to be done surrounding my own trauma.

Well Z and M came back from winter break the other day and when I arrived Z gave me another warning that M is around and I need to wach my tongue. I got mad and just told him straight up that M and I are okay now and that I've been watching my topics since apologizing so there's no more arguments or negative feelings. And if Z wasn't willing to let it go as M and I have then maybe we shouldn't hang out.

And then I left.

6,t3_rw1ahy,"AITA for making a ""homophobic list"" at school?","I'm a lesbian and a lot of my friends are lgbt or questioning. We're in high school and we sometimes get crap for it. 

Something we've always done to look out for each other, is if someone acts bigoted to one of us, we tell everyone so everyone knows to steer clear. But the kinda sadly funny thing is that our mental list was getting too long and hard to keep track of, like we'd forget who a friend had warned us about.

So me being the Type A student I am... I made a shared Google Docs spreadsheet and shared it with my friends a few years ago.

We just each put in the name of each person who'd ever given us shit for being queer, and a little writeup of what they said or did. 

It was just between our group of 7, and it was great for a couple years. We all ended up having a lot less trouble at school if we knew this stuff. It grew to include a section on teachers and staff, including two teachers, the school cop, one of the guidance counselors, and the sex ed teacher.

It was so helpful when we were picking classes or going to talk to guidance counselors about college. And also knowing who to avoid. Having that knowledge passed down helped us a lot! 

Most of my friends and I are graduating this year and we thought it'd be good to pass on the list to some of the underclassmen since having this knowledge passed down helped us so much.

Over the holidays this year, one of the freshman girl's moms went through her phone and found it. This girl was telling her mom she was straight so she just tried to brush it off as school gossip. And her mom brought it to the school. 

Without any of that context, the school saw it as gossip too. And my name's right there as the owner of the spreadsheet. 

So I was called in to talk to a guidance counselor and the principal. And... It only gets funnier from here, the counselor was the one on the shit list!

I still went ahead with what I planned to say, that this was an invasion of my privacy, that this girl's mom read something private to myself and a small group of friends. 

And that I also did not intend it to be gossip, it was intended to be used to keep my friends and I safe, and stay within a small circle of people who needed to know that information. 

The principal told me that the school administration needed to know, and I told her that if the school administration wanted to be trusted with this sort of thing, they needed to demonstrate competence handling it, and they have done the opposite.

Even today... It was the most brain dead thing I could think of, to have a meeting where homophobia needed to be discussed, and to invite the counselor from the list!

They called me insubordinate, the principal defended the guidance counselor to my face saying she was ""a professional"" and said that the next conversation would be with my parents.

AITA for this list? The school is acting like I did something bad, but I feel like I was doing what they wouldn't!",1.0
7,t3_rw1994,AITA for wanting my daughters to get along?,"I f52 have 2 daughters who are 28 and 25 with my lovely husband who is 55. My daughters have never gotten along since my oldest felt like my younger daughter was better than her. When my youngest daughter got a boyfriend when she was 17 this made my oldest hate her even more which resulted in her trying to break them up. Me and my husband constantly had to break up their fights and ground her. The problem that broke my family happened when me, my husband were at my youngest graduation. She had invited her boyfriend but he declined to come because he was very busy. She was upset but she understood. We were driving home to pick up her oldest so she could come out to the car and we could go out for lunch. She wasn't answering her phone is we decided to go in and get her. We heard moans/noises coming from her room so I went up because she knew we were going out. My youngest was following me and I opened the door to see my oldest daughter and my youngest daughter's boyfriend in bed. I was disgusted because this boy just turned 18 and my daughter was 21. My youngest started yelling at her and throwing all the studs in her room at her and calling her a whore. My husband had to carry my youngest out of her sister's room while I closed the door and let them get dressed. Like all cheating boyfriends, he tried to make an excuse up but my husband wouldn't let him near her. I was very disappointed in my daughter because she betrayed her sister. The whole summer my youngest was in her room and she wouldn't even look the same direction her sister was in. I knew my oldest didn't feel bad and that's why she started dating her sister's ex. She was introducing him to us like we have never met him and she announced she was pregnant which made my youngest upset. My oldest moved into her boyfriend's place and soon my first grandchild was born. I was delighted and I was gonna love this child because it had nothing to do with the way it was bought into the world. I encouraged my youngest to do the same. My oldest bought her family over a lot and me and my husband were overjoyed. I told my youngest to get over it and oh well her first relationship didn't work. About 3 years later they announced they were getting married and I straight up told my youngest if she didn't go to support her sister I would kick her out. Me and my husband went to visit my oldest and her family for a few days but when we came out my daughter and all her stuff were gone. We tried calling her but she blocked me and my husband. We called the police but they said she was not a minor and if her all her stuff is gone and probably moved out. I was heartbroken because all I wanted was for my family to become one again. It's been years since any of us heard from my daughter except when we go to her new husband's Instagram. We see alot of pictures of them together and we hope she will stop being so hateful and contact us. My grandchildren deserve to meet each other and my oldest deserves to have her sister back.

8,t3_rw1895,AITA for taking away my friends role of godmother and giving it to someone else?,"I (23f) and (21f) had been friends for around a year. During this time, I had found out I was pregnant and instantly asked her to be the god mother. She said yes. 

Over the course of the 9 months, my friend went through countless hospital admissions for illness’ as well as mental. One time I had to physically hold the door shut so she wouldn’t run off and into oncoming traffic during a mental breakdown; we were waiting for the police/ambulance to arrive. 

She was constantly in and out of hospital, and every single one of our conversations was about her, her sickness, how she felt, ect. ect. 

I remember one time she said; I know this may trigger you but I’ve been throwing up so much I’ve lost weight!  She said this to a heavily pregnant woman who had struggled with a past history of disordered eating. 

Towards the end of our friendship, I started to break contact, not respond as much, if I did, it was often dry. I was mentally exhausted by our friendship, and it was taking a toll on my physical health and baby. 

One morning, she suddenly asked if we wanted her to be the godmother anymore and I said no, we’ve chosen someone else and we’re sorry but it’s what’s best for our daughter as the now god mother, has a job, a car and two kids of her own and knows what she’s doing and isn’t constantly sick and in and out of hospital. She also has a full home and not a tiny one bedroom apartment. 

She then went on a whole rant of “why even ask me?” ect ect. And made me feel like shit for putting my child and their future above her

9,t3_rw17g3,AITA for talking to someone I was told was a “stalker”?,"I used to be friends with this one guy, let’s call him Jake, but I dropped him because he was toxic.

Couple months later, I’m talking to his ex gf, let’s call her Zoe. Zoe tells me how he’s been stalking her and applied to the same college just to be with her. She was afraid to leave her house and was fearful of the upcoming year. She then told me not to tell anyone because she was not ready to tell the public yet.

This got me worried because I know that Jake was mentally broken, and if it continued he could end up in a lot of trouble. To keep it a secret, I told my girl best friend without mentioning their names, and she told me the best thing to do was to talk to him because after all, he’s the stalker anyway, so you’re not releasing the secret “to the public.” 

One thing you guys need to know is that Zoe and Jake have a problem with lying, and Zoe has lied to me before, so this could be a situation where Zoe was lying to get revenge at Jake for the abuse he’s put her through.

I called Jake, and neither of us yelled at all, and we actually had a pretty civil conversation. He said that the “stalking” incidents were coincidences, and that he was going to a different university which turned out to be true. To this day, I don’t know if he actually stalked, but here’s where things get a little bit ugly…

Another girl starts texting me, let’s call her Kee… Apparently Jake told her about it, and she starts sending me these nasty texts, telling me how he was not dangerous and his ex gf was not traumatized. Mainly she was mad at me that I went off on him, but I tried telling her that I had no intentions of being angry at him. All I wanted to do was get the other side of the story. I tried sending her SSs of the texts me and him had, but she then got mad at me that I sent them without his permission. I felt as if she was just trying to find everything I was doing wrong. TBH, it was pretty hard to get the points she was trying to make because of her aggressive attitude.

There were also other weird things she said, like how she was being “loyal” for always letting Jake be friends with her again, no matter how much she was hurt by him. He and Zoe were two of the five friends she relied on, and she’d trust her dad with everything. But the worst thing she was doing was bombarding me with “you’re so immature” statements, all while cussing me out. Then she blocked me…

I tried telling my Jake about what happened, but then he blocked me too, so I guess our “civil conversation” is over… Since then I haven’t talked to any of those three people, and I’d like to keep it that way. But Kee’s messages have been taking a toll on my mental health, and I question if I really deserved being talked to that way…

10,t3_rw1715,AITA for not caring or really wanting to meet my best friends new boyfriend?,"So recently my best friend has gotten into a relationship with a new guy which is great for her but from the start she’s always been hiding him. Usually when she meets a new guys she’s interested in, she will at least mention it and let’s me know how the dating is going. This time, it for some odd reason…she just didn’t. We recently took a girls trip out of the country(in august) and had a great time but I quickly noticed that when the someone always called or she wanted to call that person, she would leave to a different room in our air bnb or if we were out somewhere she would leave me behind to go talk to him. I found it a little odd since she wouldn’t do that when her family members called or other friends called but again, I tried not to see anything of it because it is her business at the end of the day. 

Fast forward to Early October, she finally tells me about the guy and that they’re official. At this point I still didn’t really have any clue that she was even speaking to a new guy let alone was dating one. I was shocked and little hurt that she kept this away from me because like I said, we’re best friends. But, I let it go and decided to be happy for her. She only told me his name and I said that I can’t wait to meet him to just all around be supportive and also wanting to find out who this mystery man was. She then got kind of defensive when I said that and said that she wasn’t ready to have him meet me which I didn’t understand but I just reassured her that whenever she’s ready is fine. 

Fast forward to December. I’ve barely heard from her. My birthday was on the 4th of December and my other friends planned a birthday dinner to which she of course was invited to and she never showed up. Not even a text saying she won’t be avale to make it. I of course thought the worse until I opened Instagram mid dinner to see her on her story posted 4 minutes again her in bed cuddling obviously with her boyfriend watching movies. I felt extremely hurt by that because I never missed out on her birthdays and if I did I would make them up. 

The rest of the month she just sent me a simple merry Christmas message and happy new year text. Now two days ago she texted me saying she wanted to have dinner at her place so I can meet her boyfriend.  I decided to finally snoop around to find out about this boyfriend of hers. I found his Facebook which he is pretty active on and found a whole lot of homophobic things on their as well as hurtful memes about women in general and fat people. 

I fit all of those categories, I’m a plus size bisexual woman. So everything sort of clicked, she either feels ashamed of me or ashamed of him. So now after all the secret keeping &amp; the missed birthday dinner I don’t care nor want to meet her boyfriend and I ask am I the asshole in all this? I just simply don’t feel like we’re going get along, I’m everything the dude hates.",1.0

I made a quick Hollandaise sauce to top it with.  Like clockwork, my roommate comes into the room asking what I’m making.  I’ve gone to ignore mode with them.   I had some Hollandaise left, and my roommate grabbed some bread and put it in the pan, and started eating it. I grabbed the pan and put the sauce down the sink.  
I told my roommate to buy his food.  He started giving me shit because I get food stamps.  I told him that’s not the issue.  He goes off in a rant saying his taxes pay for his food, and it’s still technically his food.  
He said I shouldn’t eat the way I do on government funds, and it was an extravagant breakfast.  He told me how I made salmon the other night.  I said my boyfriend bought that for me and made it for both of us.  You guilt-tripped my boyfriend into giving you some.  I told him to stop being pathetic and cook for himself.  He said he didn’t know how to cook.  I said learn. My boyfriend texted me and wanted to know what happened because my roommate texted him and called me a ghetto bitch.

12,t3_rw1392,AITA For making my mom feel bad,"So a bit of a background explanation. My family is from Mexico and sometimes we go to the border to hang around especially in Mcallen and Laredo where many people speak and/or understand spanish.
My mom usually believes in everything she sees online (Facebook mostly, but also whatsapp groups). I am the only one who speaks english in my family
Now off to the story.

We went to Mcallen to get the third vaccine since there was a chance available. 
There was no issue arriving to the border, but soon we arrive at a walmart to check if they are vaccinating there.
We ask and indeed they are but not until the next day. Now another thing you must know is that she often gets distracted with clothing and other trinkets at stores. We go to pay and then we realize you can pay yourself without a cashier. So already we were a bit disoriented. I pay the items we bought without much of an issue but then she gets mad at me because I wasnt able to scan her things and buy them, so she goes to a worker thats with a family and pretty much interrupts him so that he explains how. She usually does this so I just calm myself and move on.

Then we went to CVS pharmacy and then ask for the vaccine. The first thing she does walking in is to see clothes and not help me finding the clerk. I began to ask the clerk about the vaccine in English (Even though he also spoke spanish I wamted to practice my English) 
He gives me the info and then I go to walk out back to the car, but then my mom cuts me off and asks in spanish the thing that the clerk explained to me, and she did not even say thank you once he explined it.

To finish it all we go to a McDonalds nearby and once again I speak In English to practice and begin to look in the menu to see what my family wants to order, and once again she cuts me off in Spanish and asks for a MCTrio (Big mac, fries, soda), but Idk if in the States they call it a Mctrio or what.

At this point I am tired and just want to eat my burger and then shower in the hotel. 
I tell her at the hotel how bad it looked like she cut me off everytime I was speaking. Then she looked Like she was sad and told me she felt bad because I pointed how she was behaving.

13,t3_rw0yvv,AITA for wanting a new extension cord?,"TLDR at bottom. I'm currently living in a house with two roommates. One parks in the garage, the other parks in the driveway directly behind the garage door. I park on the street. Both my vehicle, and the vehicle in the driveway get plugged in at night. In the morning I typically unplug my extension cord from my vehicle, but leave it plugged into the house outlet, this way the one end is propped up, making it more visible where it crosses the walkway along side the garage leading to our front door, reducing the chances of tripping if we get a skiff of snow. One morning the roommate that parks in the driveway unplugged their vehicle, coiled up their extension cord, and hung it on the front gate, which is the first time they've done that this year, they typically unplug it from the house and their vehicle just leaving it laying on one side of the walkway. for some reason at the same time they also unplugged my cord as they share the same double outlet. But instead of coiling up my cord as well, they just left it on the ground. That day it snowed quite a bit, our roommate that parks in the garage arrived home first, took out the snow blower for the first time this year to clear the driveway and walkway, caught the cord in the snow blower, and completely destroyed it. I'd like to think if my cord was left plugged in, it would be clearly obvious that it was still there, but since one of them unplugged it, allowing it to be completely covered in snow they couldn't tell until it was too late. The extension cord I use is a 50' heavy gauge 3 plug end with LED power indicator that cost me nearly $100 and was brand new this year. I arrived home from work that night, they both told me right away what had happened, even saying that one of them was the one who had unplugged it. I said well that definitely sucks, but shit happens, get me a new one and there's no hard feelings. They both kind of jokingly danced around that suggestion leaving the impression that they thought I was going to take care of it myself. A week and a bit later one of them came to me with an old extension cord of theirs that was a bit beat up, but the same length. Saying that I can just have that one. I said thanks but that's not really a fair trade as my cord was brand new, had more features and was higher quality. They suggested that we could save the 3 head end off the old cord and splice it to this one making it the same. I just told them I'd prefer to have a direct replacement to my cord as that was what had been destroyed. They seemed to be annoyed and said they'd look into it. AITA for wanting a direct replacement for something that they admitted was destroyed by their actions?

 One of my friend's cousins (D)  just got engaged to her boyfriend (K) of 5 years. We met through her cousin (E) (a close friend) around 6-7 years ago. She is a pretty cool person, and we've never had any problems. Her fiancé is pretty much the same.
 The issue is that I'm Black and Queer (not publicly) and I know that D and E's family are racist and homophobic. They themselves have done some work to acknowledge that they were raised that way and want to be better.
 I don't know anything about K's family, but I know that K has said some homophobic things in the past and E's sister hasn't spoken to her in years because she's fooling around with a Black guy. We're from the Southern US and I know that it's highly likely that I'm gonna be one of the few Black people there and most of the guests are gonna feel some way about me being there.
 I'm not one for confrontation because if I feel threatened I'm gonna keep the same energy and I know would cause a problem at such an important event for someone I'm cool with.",2.0
16,t3_rw0w6k,AITA for dating my ex's brother behind our families' backs?,"Beware, long post ahead. TL;DR at the end.

I (M18) dated Jan (F20) from 2019 to Feb 2021, but in that short time her family and mine matched pretty well, to the point we still kept in contact even after the breakup.

I broke up with her with the excuse that I was going to start college soon and wanted to focus on that only, while she isn't even sure if she'll keep studying or not. But the real reason I broke our relationship is because I had someone else on my mind and it felt wrong to keep going out with her considering that person was her own brother.

I got along with him (M17) the first day we met, we just have *a lot* in common. I didn't immediately realize I had the hots for him, probably cause I was busy having the hots for Jan then, but I did kept thinking about him or mentioning him constantly, to the point sometimes Jan would get visibly annoyed. 

Las year, on January, he confessed to me that he was gay, and that he trusted me enough to not tell anyone. Of course I promised him I wouldn't, but it also affected me. I never considered he could be gay. I always knew I was attracted to girls and boys, but I tried to ignore the latter cause I never really felt something for a boy before. Yet when I discovered he was gay I definitely started to watch him differently.

After a few weeks I decided to breakup with Jan cause I couldn't even kiss her without thinking about her brother. She was sad about it but accepted it, although as I mentioned before I lied about the reason. Then I texted her brother about me breaking up with his sister, and he invited me drink somewhere so we could talk about it in person. I went with the idea of ""breaking up"" with the entire family, and therefore I thought why not confessing to him since I was never going to see him again anyway. Long story short, I confessed, he confessed, and we ended up making out in his car.

Due to that I couldn't cut ties with his family, and although I like them, visiting them and seeing my ex while pretending nothing was happening was so awkward.

Now, after all that background info, here's the issue. As I said, his family and mine kept in contact even after the breakup, and our parents decided to celebrate New Year's Eve together. Both our families are big and we had some kind of party going, so at some moment I lost my smartphone and didn't even noticed. My ex found it and checked my chats, and that's how she discovered my conversations with my boyfriend (her brother), besides some pics. 

She freaked out and exposed both me and her brother to everyone there, calling us f""gs and backstabbers. She even slapped him when he approached her to try to calm her down. Everything became a chaos after that. Our parents were blaming each other's sons for turning the other one gay, my mum was on denial and kept asking me to deny everything my ex said while I was busy comforting my boyfriend who literally started throwing up. Meanwhile my ex locked herself up on the bathroom and the little ones were crying without understanding what was happening. 

My big sister stayed with some friends so she didn't knew about what happened until the next day, and she says it's my fault everything happened cause I shouldn't have dated my ex's sibling, a guy to make it worse, and that I ruined everyone's new year. My ex texted me calling me a lot of stuff, and she *also* blames me for ""perverting her little bro"".

Everything is still tense, and me and my boyfriend practically don't talk to our parents. My clearly doesn't want to and my mom tries but is clearly uncomfortable.

I can tell from his messages that he's really nervous about the whole situation, and that actually makes me feel like the asshole, cause because of me my boyfriend was outed before he was ready and created a hell in his house.

**TL;DR:** On New Year's Eve my ex checked my smartphone and discovered my chat with her brother, my actual boyfriend. The whole family started shouting at each other because of it, and my sister says it's all my fault for dating my ex's sibling who also happens to be a man.",1.0
17,t3_rw0w5v,AITA for taking my kids out of state?,"Useful backstory:

My partner (M25) and I (F25) moved to Indiana from California when we were 21. It’s  cheaper living out there and IMO and my partner’s a better place to raise our then 9 month old daughter. We moved in with my mother, her cousin, and her cousin’s boyfriend; it’s my cousins house. Long story short, my partner got into a confrontation with the cousin and she kicked him out. He left first, but my daughter and I weren’t far behind. We’ve been struggling to afford an apartment since we got back living in motels and now an apartment with mold and an indifferent landlord. 

My mom wasn’t the best neither was my father. My paternal grandparents raised me and my mother moved to Indiana 10 years ago. We’ve always stayed in contact and had a decent relationship. She’s my mom no matter what happened to me when I was young. She got married this year 10/30/21. She and her husband got c-19 in November and her husband passed away in early December. My mom is having a really tough time. My brother is only 14 and is trying but can only do so much. 

I talked to my partner about moving our family there to be close to my mom and give my partner a break on rent. We pay 1500 base rent for a one bedroom apartment. Our now two daughters 3 and 6 months have the bedroom we sleep in the living room. We don’t like living in California it’s expensive, crowded, and our current neighbors have not beer very welcoming since we moved in. We both agreed to move when we got our tax return. We knew it would be hard to tell our families here (my grandparents and his mother). But we agreed; we planned; we looked at homes; we looked for jobs. We were all excited to start a new life where we felt we could succeed and buy a home. 

Yesterday my partner tells me he can’t leave his mom. He’s not going with us. Just me and the girls. I’m heartbroken and he doesn’t understand why. I feel like I have to choose now to stay or to leave.  I’m so torn. Am I the asshole if I continued our plans without him? Am I the asshole if I tell my mom never mind we’re not moving? 

Thank you for reading ❤️

18,t3_rw0vgu,AITA for being creeped out by a delivery person?,"Some background: I (35/f) am a single mother and live alone with my preteen son. I kinda hate shopping in real life, so I order pretty much everything except perishables online. 

My job regularly requires me to sign from packages received through the mail. A delivery driver for a major delivery service noticed my nameplate a while back and asked if I was the thhhhhrowawayyyyy that lived at (my current address). Somewhat taken aback and wanting to be polite, I said yes I was. He commented about how he dropped off a lot of packages for me there and if there was anything I was in a hurry to receive he could go ahead and pull it for me and deliver it to me at my workplace. I smiled and politely declined, when I want something shipped to my home, I don’t really want to lug it from my office to my car. 

Upon receiving work-related deliveries at work from this man, he’s commented on my home address multiple times (I dropped something off for you this weekend but didn’t see your car; I have to head out to your neck of the woods after I unload this; etc). It’s begun to make me uncomfortable. I’m a single woman and it’s quite obvious because every piece of mail is addressed directly to me, and now I have a strange man regularly making comments implying that he knows where I live. This man has not done anything inappropriate or given me reason to believe that I’m in danger, but I’m still creeped out, and it’s gotten to the point where I try to be unavailable when I see his company delivery truck driving up. 

A coworker has had to sign for a few packages since I try to make myself scarce when I think he may be around, and kinda asked what was going on. I explained the situation the best I could, and she said I was really overreacting and rolled her eyes at me a little. I like and trust this coworker’s judgment, but something about commenting on where I live still makes me think that I’m in the right to be creeped out by this guy.

19,t3_rw0u1c,AITA for having sex in an apartment I don’t stay in?,"Hey everyone! Using a throwaway and on mobile. 

Background: I (25F) currently live at home with my parents in NYC but two friends from college school reached out saying they wanted to get an apartment together and wanted a third roommate so I agreed because my credit’s not bad. However, I go back and forth between my parent’s house and the apartment. In the apartment, I only spend about 1-2 nights there and it’s mostly just a storage space at this point for some of my stuff. I pay 1/3 of rent and utilities but like I said, I’m hardly ever there. They wanted a third roommate for rent and I wanted a place I can be away from my parents when things got too chaotic . 

Most of the time I’m there, my partner comes over to spend the night. They’re never there when I’m not. It’s been about a month since I’ve been living like this and this morning after my partner left, one of my friends pulled me aside and said she felt it was disrespectful that he was here and invading our space (he’s mostly in my room). She said it’s rude that I’m only there when I wanna have sex. I told her off saying I pay the same amount of rent and utilities they do and don’t even utilize all of it so the least they can do is give me a break when I’m there. They also bring people over so I said making it a privacy invasion issue is ridiculous.

20,t3_rw0t4a,AITA FOR FINALLY SNAPPING?,"AITA for snapping on husbands aunt?

So a little backstory, husband was adopted by cousin of his biological mom when he was a baby while his sister was adopted by bio moms grandmother. The aunt is from bio moms side and his adoptive dads (bio moms cousin) sister. 

Aunt has no children of her own but is his sister (the one adopted by bio moms grandma) god mother and her children’s god mother. 

Aunt is VERY, VERY, obsessed with my child. We suspect she is trying to coerce us into making her his god mother by spoiling him. Buying him stuff all the time. We are a military family so we are only home 2x a year. Anyways, when she comes over (which she will come over every single day and stay for HOURS) she keeps my son awake (she works late), she throws off his schedule, plays with him a little too rough for his age, and distracts him during feedings, eating, when I’m trying to put him to sleep because she’s stimulating him by talking to him, making silly faces at him.
This woman literally is taking a week off of work to come and visit my son and to be 
honest it seems a bit unhealthy. She doesn’t let anyone hold him when she’s here to the point where my son is refusing to be put down. She even won’t let me feed him if she is around.

Yesterday was my breaking point, it started when my son had a low grade fever and she tried telling me 99 wasn’t enough of a fever to give him Tylenol (mind her, this is my son and I’m not going to wait for his fever to get sky high before I do something)

FINALLY snapped at night when he woke up because she stayed way past after he fell asleep last night watching tv (loudly). I am currently staying in the living room since my husband is quarantined due to covid. When my son woke up she immediently tried to come play with him so I firmly told her “please don’t stimulate him or else he will completely wake up and be up till midnight”. She walked away, huffed out and left.

21,t3_rw0r48,AITAH for having my ex pay for movers?,"Long story short my ex (31) and I (35) lived together before she moved overseas for a year long work contract. Things didn't work out and we split up while she is still there. Unfortunately, this meant that I had to spend like 2 months or so packing up all of her stuff and arranging the move to a storage unit. Prior to her moving for the job (long before the break up) I had asked her to pack up her belongings because I wanted to move apartments, but she didn't and I got stuck resigning the lease after traveling overseas with her to help get her settled. After spending hours packing her stuff up during nights and weekends (she has a lot of stuff) and paying for all the moving supplies out of pocket I was finally ready to move it all out. She had offered to pay for the movers and truck so I took her up on it. I tried to save her money by hiring the cheapest movers and only having them load the truck at the apt due to a lot of stairs and large furniture. I personally loaded everything that she had stored at my parent's house (a room half full of boxes and stuff) and unloaded the whole truck by myself at the storage unit. After everything was finished I billed her for the truck and movers (~$300) while I ate the cost of everything else.

A couple of days ago she sends me a message basically telling me how she and her friends all think I am an AH for sending her the bill even if she did offer to pay.  She told me she is only paying because she offered, but in her mind I am asking her to pay me to break up with her.  She is trying to guilt me by saying these are the consequences of my actions and that she believes I think she owes me something (I don't btw). 

I am so flabbergasted by this. It's been 1 month since I billed her and I just expected that she wasn't going to pay. I am still taking care of her cat because she never bothered to ask a friend to watch the cat for her. I have done the best I can to make this process as easy for her as I can. I get that she is hurt and upset, but I am stuck paying part of the price of her inaction when it comes to packing and watching her pet. I am trying to be a good guy and do right by her, but this really hurts. AITAH?",5.0
22,t3_rw0o2q,AITA for expecting my partner of four years to live stream outside the four hour window we have together,"I was hoping to get a second opinion on a conversation between me and my long distance partner. I've posted the entire conversation below. I'd like to mention that aside from a quick 'I love you' here and there we haven't spoken much over the past couple of weeks. There is also a five hour time difference and we both work, so we don't have many opportunities to talk. With that being said, our conversation went as follows:

Me (27F): I miss you, can we watch a movie later when I get out of work?

Him(36m): Possible, I'm streaming tomb raider in am hour

Me: Thats much more important  than taking an hour out of the week to spend some time together

Him: You're gonna make me feel bad about streaming now, since its another way to make money. You know what, fine I quit. Pick a movie and a time tomorrow. I'm deleting everything else and quitting my job so I can spend time with you and never hurt your feelings about making money again. 

Me: Did I ask for that, or did I ask for an hour out of the week?

Him: you know I make money off streaming (side note: he mentioned receiving a donation a week ago, fifteen dollars. I did not in fact, know he was using this to make a living)

Me: Then why quit? I never said that 

Him: Just don't do it so I have an hour to watch a movie cause its not important or anything. Thats exactly how you treated it 

End conversation.

Now I'd also like to mention that I support his gaming. I downloaded twitch just to follow him and watch him play. When I want to spend time with him, I don't tell him to quit playing; I know he loves it and its one of his few hobbies. But he does stream for hours a day. We have a four hour window to talk and he's not working right now and spends a good majority of the day streaming/playing his game when he wants. 

Now my instincs tell me I'm being gaslight. But I know I can be unreasonable at times as well and would really appreciate some feedback from someone that wont be biased in their response. Ty for your time!

23,t3_rw0lzc,AITA for not asking my gf before nutting in her?,"I (18M) and my ex (18F) met in university and we were together for a bit but the relationship ended pretty quick, I won’t get into details. Out of all the girls I’ve dated she was easily the most horny, and I liked that. We had sex very often compared to what I’m used to, sometimes a couple times throughout the day just because we could. One day we were out somewhere and she indicated to me she wanted to have sex urgently. I told her I didn’t have condom (we would always use one prior to this instance) and she said that we didn’t need it. I agreed with her because she’s on the pill and she has an IUD. We had sex in a private washroom and it was fine, but once I clearly was done she kinda was like “what the fuck?” And I’m obliviously like “what?” She asked if I had just finished in her and I told her I did. She was unhappy with me and said I should asked first. In the past when I’ve had unprotected sex I’ve never asked about finishing in someone and I’ve never had any complaints. Of course I was fine with not doing it if that’s what she wanted, however she acted like it was my responsibility to know to ask about that specific action before doing it. In fact, she couldn’t even comprehend how I could go about without doing that. I said that hadn’t even thought about it before and then concluded and explained that my thought process was that nutting in someone is an innate part of sex. So if you are expressing ongoing consent and agreeing to the sex, you are also agreeing to that unless expressed otherwise. She also said that past guys who were not wearing a condom had always pulled out due to fear of getting her pregnant (she had gotten the IUD recently I believe). So we both were used to different things. Anyways AITA because it should be excepted to get permission for the specific act of nutting in someone? Or is it something that is closely related to sex enough that it doesn’t require it’s own individual permission? I understand that it wouldn’t hurt to get that permission regardless, and I’ll do it in the future because of this incident, but my point here is that she was acting like what I did was completely wrong whereas I disagree.

24,t3_rw0k5b,AITA for leaving my friends house,"I (34F) have two friends who are married to each other (34F/35F). We have been friends for about 10 years and one thing I've struggled with is that they are constantly late for everything or are flaky with their plans. We have actually fallen out about this in the past. We generally make plans closer to their home (I live about 45-60mins drive away depending on traffic) as there is more to do where they live as I am in a fairly remote area.

There have been times when we are going for dinner 10mins from their home and they'll be 30mins late. They acknowledge that they're late but don't really apologise for it. Or I've had them cancel plans while I'm on my way. After this happened again a couple of months ago, I said to them that moving forward, I would only wait 15mins for them and then I would leave as I believe that constantly being late isn't fair. Of course, I understand that traffic happens and other reasons beyond reach but when it is a habit I think that's not okay.

I had plans to go over to their home yesterday and they said for me to arrive at midday which I did. I rang their doorbell and there was no answer.

I waited 15mins, they hadn't arrived still so then I texted them and just said ""I'm going to head off, hopefully we can catch up another time"".

They think ITA because I know that they are always late and that going to someone's house is a more relaxed plan than going for dinner or something and saying midday is more flexible. They also said that I drove 2hrs round-trip to wait only 15mins which is ridiculous.

I’ve even offered to pay any costs but they have good health insurance and probably won’t end up with much out of pocket expenses.

The problem was that she had thick, full tufts of gray hair that were rooted on the bottom of her septum and curled out of her nostrils. The hair was plainly visible, and extremely obvious, even at eye level (protruding at least a good quarter inch), but when she leaned me back in the chair, it was even worse. When she started working on my teeth, I looked up, caught a glimpse of the hair, and audibly gagged. She said, ""Oh, is that a sensitive spot for you?"" without realizing that I was actually gagging at the sight of her nose hair.

I got up, took off the protective glasses and dental bib (or whatever they're called) they had on me, excused myself, and told her I would be right back. I knew I wouldn't be able to make it through the entire cleaning with this lady. I walked to the front desk and pulled the receptionist aside. I politely asked her if I could have a different person clean my teeth. She said that no one else was available, and asked if there was a problem. I didn't really know how to respond, so I just told her the truth, and said, ""The lady cleaning my teeth has lots of hair coming out of her nose and it's making me gag."" The receptionist seemed a bit shocked by my response, and just said ""Ummm..."" and seemed to kind of freeze up. I realized I was out of luck, so I said, ""If no one else can clean my teeth, I'm afraid I'm going to have to reschedule."" She obliged, and rescheduled me with a different person for the following month.

I got curious and checked their website a few weeks after this happened, and on the ""Our Team"" page, the nose hair lady had been removed and no longer seemed to be employed there, so I don't know if that had anything to do with the incident with me.

I don't feel like I did anything wrong. Her nose hair was grossing me out, and I have no idea how anyone could look at themselves in the mirror every morning and be okay with presenting themselves like that, especially in a professional environment. It looked absolutely disgusting. But regardless, AITA for walking out of the cleaning and rescheduling?

In response to the ""why wasn't she wearing a mask?"" comments, this happened a few months ago and I can't remember what the mask situation was.

30,t3_rw033c,AITA for refusing to clean the apartment when it is my turn because my flatmate skipped his turn while procrastinating doing the cleaning?,"

I'll try to explain the situation briefly. 

We are 3 people living in the same apartment, and we have this agreement that every weekend, one of us would clean the entire apartment (common areas basically). We have a rotation, flatmate 1 followed by me then flatmate 2. 

Everything was alright and we were cleaning whenever it was anyone's turn. Up until the Christmas weekend. It was flatmate 1's turn. He went to visit his girlfriend for Christmas and when he came back, he said he'd clean it on Wednesday of the week leading to the NYE. 

He didn't. And it was my turn now because it was me next on the rotation. 

I made myself perfectly clear that I'm not doing the work of 2 people, and as far as I'm concerned, it is flatmate 1's turn. Am I the asshole for saying this?

No one said anything. And no one cleaned anything.

Flatmate 2 had his parents over since last weekend and one of them smokes. The apartment smells like this lingering smoking odor. I texted him at work to ask his parents to smoke outside or whatever. He apologized then asked me why no one cleaned last weekend and I reminded him of our conversation. 

He said that his parents are leaving tomorrow and he will be cleaning the apartment after. 

I told him I'm cool with that but if anyone is to clean the apartment then it's flatmate 1. He said he doesn't care and he'll be cleaning it cuz of his parents leave but after this, one of you needs to clean. 

I said sure. We can go back to the normal order like nothing happened (i.e flatmate 1 cleans this weekend). He said he'll discuss it with him and see what happens.

I was super happy about it as they had mentioned having struggles doing online school last year and was glad to see that they managed to shake the issue off.

Well, few days later we found out that they had applied to summer courses and when asked why (they aren't usually the one to take summer courses), they started to become super shady and agitated. 

Turns out last year when they were studying at home they managed to fail half a unit for both sem 1 and sem 2, and are now trying to do summer courses to try and hide that they failed. My partner was livid and couldn't believed that our child has been lying to us for this long and wanted to punish them.

Heres where we might be assholes, before starting sem 2 our child has asked for an intermission, stating that they can't seem to catch up with the uni content and that studying at home was too distracting for them. Nonetheless, we told them that they could make it if they try hard enough which they agreed, but then the issue of them struggling was never brought up again. We disagreed with the intermission as that meant they had to extend their student visa which we really did not want to do as we want them to graduate on time.

32,t3_rvzrc4,AITA for extending my sick leave at work?,"I (30F) am a healthcare worker at a very busy COVID testing site. There was an outbreak of COVID at work and one by one half of our staff contracted COVID. Surprise, surprise, I got COVID. In fact, now everyone in our household has COVID. Everyone is fully vaccinated, some of us have had booster vaccines and/or had COVID last year, but COVID is a vicious beast. 

Before I went in quarantine, the CDC released new guidelines saying that healthcare workers no longer need to quarantine for 10 days and instead can come back after 5 days if they are improving. Healthcare workers can even be called into work after 0 days (even if symptomatic) if their work place has a 'staffing crisis'. 

My manager already scheduled me to return to work on day 7 and scheduled me to work 48+ hours/week for the remainder of the month. I normally work 30 hours/week due to this place being physically demanding and having another job. The schedule was made without checking in with me, or asking me if I feel ready to return to work. My energy is still at 50% and I do not want to spread COVID to my patients and coworkers. My coworkers came back to work on day 5 (still positive and still symptomatic) and obviously that turned out swell.

I'm getting a note from my doctor that says that I can't return to work until after 10 days of quarantine. I already know my manager will tell me that I'm young/healthy, my coworkers came back early, they are short-staffed, etc. AITA?",23.0
33,t3_rvzp8s,AITA for being upset with my bfs mom for putting my life at risk?,"I (20F) life with my bf (21M) and his mother (we are saving up to move out because housing market is really bad where we live right now so we do live with her but pay part of the bills).

I am severely allergic to this particular air freshener that she likes to use. It causes me to be unable to breathe and my throat closes up blocking my airways (so it could potentially kill me). His mother loves this fragrance but is fully aware with how dangerous it is when it comes to me.

Recently she has been using this air freshener again and I have started having smaller reactions luckily nothing too bad yet but there has been an instance where I was starting to have some troubles breathing.

I reached out on another forum asking for some advice as I don’t know how to approach the situation with her and she has ignored my partners requests to stop using it. People on this forum were very unkind and told me that if I didn’t like it I should move because it is her house and I can’t make the rules. This has made me feel kinda like the AH because yes it is her house (even though we do pay bills) and I don’t want to ask her to not use the air freshener because I am lucky to even be living there.

We obviously are in no financial position currently to move so that isn’t an option so I have to hope I don’t die from a reaction but I don’t know. I’m extremely conflicted.

TLDR; my bfs mom knowingly uses an air freshener that I am highly allergic to and could potentially kill me.",10.0
34,t3_rvzlbc,AITA for kicking MIL's stepdaughter out of my wedding?,"I've always gotten along great with MIL's stepdaughter ""Maddie"" so when I got engaged I asked her to be in the wedding party. MIL and I don't get along so great but she isn't an awful JNMIL by any means. Maddie and MIL have had a bad relationship in the past (MIL broke up her parent's marriage) but Maddie recently had a heart to heart with her dad about how he was pressured into marrying her mom, stayed out of guilt, and feels no one cared about his happiness. Maddie felt bad (and he gave a bit of an ultimatum about how his kids talk to MIL) and she gets along with MIL better these days.

Now this is kind of silly and embarrassing but here we go. My fiancé played a pretty gross prank recently (we joke a lot but I didn't like this) and he asked me to bend down and pick something up in the shower and then he pissed on my head. He thought it was the height of comedy. I was pretty offended. I talked to Maddie to get her opinion before I set a boundary. Maddie agreed it was out of line. We talked, set a boundary, and it's all good.

The other day we stopped by to deliver Maddie's dress for the wedding (she is staying with her dad while her and her fiancé's house is being built) We were hanging out in the kitchen and MIL was making cookies. FIL was poking at her and tickling her, and MIL said oh my god you are so annoying. He laughed and said at least I've never pissed on your head. She said that's true you are forgiven. They both laughed and I was mortified.

I asked Maddie why she told them. She said she just thought it was a funny story, and she's been trying to get along better with MIL these days. I was pissed and said I didn't want to talk about it and left. She texted me that she was really sorry. MIL is a little smug and thinks she's better than me and I did not need her knowing this.

I told Maddie I can't have her in the wedding party because she betrayed me. she said I was overreacting and she's been a good friend. Finally she accepted it and said then I'm out of her wedding party as well, which I expected. Everyone else thinks I'm overreacting.",30.0
35,t3_rvzl9n,AITA for trying to get my homeless cousin and her daughter kicked out of my parents house?,"I know how the title sounds but please read what I have to say before passing judgment. My cousin and her husband along with there toddler daughter moved in since they didn’t manage there finances well. I didn’t mind nor care, but my dad did ask me to chip in a bit more money than I normally do monthly to help pay for the added people to our house. (I’ll call her my cousin when she’s actually my dads cousin)

My cousin and her husband sit around all day and do nothing. Randomly once a week they’ll clean something and they expect that to carry over for the whole week. My mom watches my nephew for my sister who is only 11 months old. My cousins daughter never stops screaming. And I mean that literally. She screams at all hours of the day and night. For literally no reason. 

This screaming disturbs my nephew and me and my dad. We both work from home and have meetings and it’s quite difficult to remain professional with a screaming toddler in the background. 

My cousin cooks but only for herself and her husband. She’ll use our food but will only make food for her and her husband. But she expects my mother to cook for everyone by herself. She doesn’t bathe her daughter more than once a week. Her daughter has scribbled over our walls in permanent marker but when we confront her she blames my nephew. 

My cousins husband has sticky fingers. Things of value will go missing followed by him coming home with a new item. He’s ‘looking’ for a job but sits at home live streaming on twitch to his fan base of 3 people. But he swears he’ll go pro one day or something. 

He just barges into my room half naked to yell at me to stop using the wifi, while I’m in a meeting. I’ve gotten written up at work twice already because of this and I’m terrified I’ll get fired because of him. 

I recently bought a new gaming pc I saved up for myself. It’s my prize and joy since it took my two years to afford it. I came home one day to find him using it IN MY OWN ROOM. 

My dad installed cameras inside the house to try and catch/dissuade him from stealing. He fucking unplugged the cameras and kept stealing. When he didn’t unplug it, we could hear them bad mouthing us on the cameras microphones. 

I can handle all of this, but my cousin daughter bit my nephew since he wouldn’t share the toy I bought exclusively for him. She breaks every toy so I got him one that’s literally for babies. She didn’t even want to play with it she just wanted to keep it from my nephew.

36,t3_rvzl8n,AITA for asking my stepsisters boyfriend to not fart while we’re doing activities?,"This is stupid, but my whole family is torn now so here we are. 

My family (11 adults) is staying with my dad and step mom for Christmas for several days. My step sister brought her boyfriend who is a nice dude, except for the fact when he farts, he makes no show or effort of hiding it or moving to another room. 

Last night while we were all playing games, at least 5 times he farted loudly at the table. I think it’s bad manners and on top of that, I’ve recently gotten diagnosed with OCD and it sets off a thought spiral. 

I hemmed and hawed and decided to talk to him and my step sister this morning and ask that he either leave the room or make some effort of hiding it when he has to fart. I explained that it was a trigger for my OCD and how it makes me feel like there are microscopic bugs crawling all over my skin and inside me for nearly an hour after. 

Him and my step sister laughed as I was trying to explain and said that it was their vacation too and if he wants to relax and fart, he can, and that they’re not responsible for my triggers. 

I agreed with them, they are not responsible for my triggers, but out of kindness and empathy, can they please do that favor for me. My boyfriend got involved soon after and then my step mom, and now it’s a whole family discussion. 

Their side: I’m the asshole for asking everyone around me to modify their behavior to accommodate me and my mental health. 

My side: Him farting, even as ridiculous as it is, causes me pretty noticeable distress and asking him to move to another room so I don’t have an anxiety attack is a reasonable request of someone. Also it’s fucking gross.

37,t3_rvzkts,WIBTA if report my neighbour to the police for trying to quiet my cat?,"I (23F) have been overseas for the past two weeks and I left my cat (4-5M) at home with an auto-feeder and cat sitter coming every other day. On New Years Day I get a message from the cat sitter saying there may have been a potential break-in as the security screen for the window was pushed inwards. My cat was also acting very skittish and depressed which is unlike him (always super cuddly and affectionate with everyone even though he’s a rescue). There were also water droplets on my desk in front of the window which is almost impossible as I have a patio in front of the window which doesn’t let water inside even in the heaviest of rains. 

Now I’ll admit that sometimes my cat can be a bit loud meowing out the window if people walk past or he’s looking for attention so he may have been meowing out the window. One of my neighbours, who I have never met but may be in one of the units above me (I’m a ground floor unit), told me a few months ago when I was passing them by the mailbox to ‘shut that fucking cat up’. This seemed to be quite aggressive to me as we’ve never spoken before, I’ve never received any complaints through the property manager, and have never received a note or anything of the like indicating that my cat was bothering anyone. I let this go at the time but I’m thinking with the recent events that maybe this particularly aggressive neighbour might have tried to get my cat to ‘shut up’ himself while I was gone.

There is thankfully a camera at the front of the complex which should capture my patio (my unit connects to the street but is a part of the greater complex). I’ve asked them to review the footage and let me know what they find.

If the culprit is my neighbour WIBTA for reporting them to the police for damaging the property and traumatising my cat?

38,t3_rvzhss,AITA for not helping to solve our espresso problem?,"This seems like a tiny little thing and very much a First World Problem, but it has been dragging on for a long time, so I thought I’d post about it here.

My husband is really into fancy coffee and our home espresso machine is essentially restaurant-grade. It’s not too big – it’s the sort of machine that you’d find tucked into the corner of a tiny, crowded, European bistro – and it’s more manual than automatic. It does make excellent coffee, I do admit, but it has to warm up for around 20 minutes before you can make a decent espresso (insert espresso-nerd terms like “group head” and “portafilter” here).

Our morning routine includes him making us espresso right after getting out of bed, which means that the machine has to be turned on before we get up. I am a very light sleeper who tends to wake up multiple times especially in the early morning, so it’s “my job” to haul myself out of bed and turn on the machine within the hour before we get up. If I don’t do this spontaneously, then I’ll do it the first time the alarm rings and then hop back into bed to hit snooze a couple of times.

Every once in a while, it slips my mind and we get up to a cold machine, especially if I’m doing some other super early morning stuff (like pulling bread dough out of the fridge at 5 AM so I can bake bread before work starts) that fills up the “early morning chore” spot in my brain.

To fix this, I found an internet-of-things wall-plug timer that I liked. It’s compact, discreet, and configurable from your phone (we live in a smallish open-concept condo, so we don’t want ugly, bulky things in the kitchen), but my husband is very concerned about internet security. Even though I’m an IT professional and confident that I know how to keep us firewalled, he still doesn’t want to risk it and said that he’d find a simpler low-tech solution.

That was almost six months ago.

Occasionally I remind him that he was supposed to find us a timer for the espresso machine, and even point out that he’s made trips to Home Depot without buying one. This morning I forgot to turn the machine on (bread dough again) and when I reminded him that he was supposed to buy a timer, he said, “Sometimes you need to wait for good things to happen.”

I immediately pounced on this and said, “I can’t wait to repeat that back to you!” because usually he is very much the “don’t put off until later” sort of person, while I’m the “why rush?” type. He looked annoyed and seemed to think that I’m deliberately waiting until after his trips to the store to remind him just to trap him into being the forgetful one for once.

So, AITA for not being more proactive in reminding him to buy a timer (or just buying the internet one on my own)?",2.0
39,t3_rvzhao,AITA for snitching on a friend?,"I'll try to keep this short

I'm a volunteer at an international organisation's local branch. I'm under a team divided into various subteams. I have a few very close friends working for this organisation. My subteam has a lot of work to do. Alot of running around, lifting, planning, travelling etc. Another subteam my friend(H) is in has nothing to do currently. They come in at 11, chill and leave at noon while we reach at 8 and stay till night. It's an official rule that if a subteams doesn't have work or if it's done, they have to help the other subteams. But whenever I call my friend, she's chilling with friends or back home. 

I told my team head since this teams members don't have anything to do, maybe they can help us? I didn't take any names or accuse anyone, I just specified two teams that I've seen sitting around with no work to do. I just followed the heirachial order to ask for their help officially. Someone from that team heard what I said and it caused drama. I was called in and asked why I was demeaning their work. I specified that I didn't say they aren't doing work but rather that a few of them didn't have work and we need lots of help to get things running so it'd be great if they could contribute since that is the rule. When they kept prodding for a name, I had to say H was home during working hours while we're short on staff and need help. 

H and her team got into trouble because apparently they did have work that they weren't doing. My whole friend gang and H turned on me and called me an asshole for ratting her out. Tbh I don't think that's true because I did contact her personally and when I didn't get a response, i moved officially.",5.0
40,t3_rvzh3m,AITA for canceling an additional compensation and reducing hours of a sole breadwinning father?,"Throwaway – non native speaker

I’m a head physician at a psychiatric ward at a hospital. Because of non-compliance with Covid regulations I took steps which meant that an employee will have trouble feeding his family (mildly exaggerated…). This happens during a time where financial situations because of inflation are tight anyway. Some of my colleagues think I’m the AH for being too strict. The person in question is doing creative Therapy in our ward.

Since covid and the vaccination became a thing, the hours of discussions with employees have tallied up quite a bit. One employee is especially troubling to me. He didn’t wear masks properly, called the pandemic a hoax, likened the state of unvaxxed to those of the Jews and all the good stuff.

The problem is compounded by the fact that he’s working with critically ill patients. Think terminal cancer and palliative chemotherapy. Since a couple of weeks it’s required by law that unvaxxed employees need to be tested under supervision – he grudgingly went along with it. On one fateful day he was a bit late and went to work with two critically ill patients without testing himself under supervision. After the fact he did the test and turned out to be positive. Luckily nobody died because both patients declined therapy for the day. After I was informed I took steps to forbid his working with oncology patients which means he loses a bonus he received for him working in this capacity and the hours that were meant to work with them.

Of course I think I’m in the right yet he thinks I’m overreacting because “we have two different truths” and to punish him because of “a single small mistake”. Others in the ward also think that the vaccine-hesitant are unduly persecuted and this is just another instance of this pattern.",13.0
41,t3_rvzg1b,"AITA for saying my husband is being unreasonable, if not childish about our housemates speaking their native language and siding more with them instead?","I (Charles, 32m, from Ireland) am married to Osip (39m from Russia) and we have 4 housemates from India, Brinda (31) married to Vijay (30), Frank (25) and Bhavish (27). 

Brinda, Vijay and Frank are all from the same state in India and all speak the same language. Bhavish doesn't share any language outside English with any of them, including Hindi, although the other 3 understand rudimentary Hindi, it's never used between them.

Me, Osip, Bhavia and Bhavish have all lived together since July 2020, first in one large houseshare, then into a smaller flat with 2 other people before Vijay and Frank arrived to replace them - that's a different story. 

On arrival, we agreed as a house we should speak English in common areas as they're all here to learn (other housemates were mostly Brazilian, plus a few Turkish and Mexican, etc - I'm the only native speaker present throughout) but after one insane Brazilian woman created an almighty row over nothing, the Brazilians started using their mother tongues loudly to disturb Osip while he worked. We left in December 2020 because Osip got bullied by several of them which then passed onto me, then Brinda and Bhavish. We all moved together plus a Mexican girl and Turkish guy couple.

Eventually, the Mexican girl and Turkish guy left as they became very spiteful plus they had terrible habits of talking very loudly (and often late into the evening/night) in their mother tongues. It was the volume that was a bother, not the language. They were both gone by August 2021.

(For both these scenarios, there was a lot more going on but that's not the point here)

Between August 2021 and now we've had several replacement housemates, including a guy replacing Frank who is also from the same region as India until the end of this month. Plus Vijay finally moved over from India at last. So everyone except me is at home most of the time.

Recently, Osip has been rather frustrated with Vijay and Brinda using their mother tongue with each other in common areas where he usually is (I'm usually at work in the bedroom). He compared Brinda using her mother tongue with Vijay i.e. her husband, to the Brazilian woman who bullied him in the previous house - a horribly offensive comparison, particularly as we all suffered at that woman's hands, and claims to feel uncomfortable because he doesn't know what they're saying. So his recent tactic has been to sit there with headphones to block out conversations not in English.

Brinda has tried telling him many times it's never anything about him and it's sometimes easier for them to use their mother tongue than English. I agree with that as well. Brinda has even asked Vijay to use English in the common areas to accommodate Osip but to little avail.

However, it has come to light that Vijay could well be doing this to aggravate Osip which I also agree is a bit of a dick move as well and seems petty, especially as he can misunderstand fairly often in English and being in an Anglophone environment can be useful.",6.0
42,t3_rvzdzm,AITA for telling my mother that my big brother is her favorite son even if he’s a bad son because he called her a trophy wife many years ago?,"My (65F) mother has 5 kids by the same man, our father (73M). I’m (39M) the middle one of the 5 of us. My parents are wealthy but that’s not something we tell everyone because they always called themselves comfortable. My parents are so wealthy that they paid my little brothers med school without batting an eye, they paid for my college degree and thanks to them i finished law school without debt. I had my first child when I was 20 and even if that’s not an alarming age to have a child my parents were disappointed with me, thankfully they love my son now.

The thing is that my brother did some things when he was younger. He was very rude and blunt, almost cruel, and I can say he’s still like that. When we were teenagers he had a phase of being very honest, once he called our mother “our father’s trophy” because she never worked and didn’t care that my father had other women, that made her cry for days. My brother stopped talking to her for 4 years after my mother didn’t approve one of his boyfriends. He’s still my mother’s favorite child.

43,t3_rvzdg6,AITA for telling my sister to leave her dog home?,"I (30F) have 2 dogs that are incredibly well behaved, and with the exception of an occasional accident, never ""go"" in the house.

My sister (30F) and my mother live an hour away and visit often on weekends. My sister has a little dog that, according to her, is a service dog that she simply cannot leave behind. This dog has no official service training, and is nearing 4 years old. Every time they come up to visit, I have to lock my male dog away, because her dog terrorizes him, and I do not want to have an accidental injury, as my boy is close to 130 pounds. 

This in itself would be bad enough, but it goes further. This little dog consistently pees on EVERYTHING in my home. My couches, comforters, carpets, my sons toys and beds, and most recently, my Christmas tree. While doing my yearly deep cleaning, I have found multiple places where this little dog has peed, and I'm now stuck cleaning up urine that I'm not sure will ever completely come out, and by hitting it with the carpet cleaner has caused it to absolutely stink in my home. 

Now, I will say that at first, I wondered if my boy had been doing it. However, if you account that the urine is an obvious leg lift, I could eliminate my female off the bat. If you account for the fact that the urine starts about 5 inches up the wall/chair/various objects, it's obvious that my waist high dog isn't the one doing it.

Today, I called her and asked if there is any way she could leave her dog home when they visit to prevent any further problems. I stated that, if she insists on bringing the dog, she will have to be responsible for keeping an eye on him at all times, and not letting it have the run of the house without supervision. I explained my reasoning, and stated that I cannot continue cleaning up urine all the time when it's not my dog doing the deed.

She began to scream and cry, telling me that it's a service animal and I cannot deny her the right to bring him, but if it's that important she would, ""just keep him leashed up all the time, so that I can't blame her dog for my dogs horrible behavior.""

This is where I snapped. I told her that I didn't care if the Queen herself had been visiting with a hippopotamus. If it had been urinating all over the house, I would ask her to do the same, and keep an eye on her pet, or leave it behind.

I know this sounds rude/petty/mean but he had a bunch of gym mirror pictures which I hate.

When we arrived at the restaurant he asked someone out front to take a picture. Fine. I grit my teeth fake smiled and thought we were done but no. He had to check the picture and wanted to take more cause he didn’t like how he looked. When we sat down and our drinks came he again started taking pictures (of the drinks). Im annoyed but fine. 
Conservation was a little dry but it wasn’t too bad. Our food comes out and here is where it got ugly. He spent 12 minutes (I counted) taking pictures of the food. When he’s done goes to take a bite and says ‘this is cold, where’s the waiter’ 

I looked him dead in the eye and asked if he was really planning on sending back the food. He said yes because he paid for a hot meal not a cold one. Which IF it had came out cold is understandable but how in hells bells does it make sense in your mind that after spending 12 minutes taking pictures your food is still gonna be hot?!!! 
I told him that he spent a long time taking pictures and that it’s not really the kitchens fault. He was getting kinda grumpy and called the waiter. He handed her his plate and as soon as he did I asked for a to-go box. I left cash for my meal and tip.

45,t3_rvzcrp,WIBTA if I went to my grandmother’s funeral?,"There’s a lot to unpack here, so I’ll give some background. 

My biological dad was an abusive guy. He tried to kill my bio-mom and went to jail for a few years as an example. My bio-mom is wasn’t any better with the abuse. 

My bio-dad got custody of me when I was eight-ish. He gave me the whole thing about how he loved me and he wanted me to live with him and he’d never hurt me like my bio-mom did. The judge said i could pick. I picked my bio-dad. 

After he got custody, he dropped me off at my grandparents and disappeared. I lived between their house and my aunt’s house until my bio-dad showed back up with his new wife and wanted to play house, I guess? So I would live with him over the week and then I’d be at my grandparents or aunt’s house on the weekend. He wasn’t home over the week either. 

His new wife became pregnant and they didn’t need me anymore so they kicked me out on Christmas Eve and told my bio-mom to come get me. 

I still saw my grandparents every weekend until I was 16 when they said that they were moving to Florida. I was so angry with them for leaving, but they would come back once a year for a week and I’d visit. But then they stopped coming up because most of the family lived in FL and once my bio-dad and his new family moved down, my grandparents didn’t come back to visit.

Home life with bio-mom was rough. I ran away regularly until finally one day I just didn’t go back. 

Fast forward: I was legally adopted by the family who took me in. My bio-dad received the papers, he could have refused to sign and shown up in court but he didn’t. 

Fast forward to Sunday, my grandmother died. Her services are this coming weekend. 

Here’s the WIBTA: I want to go to her wake. My bio-aunts all said I could and should go so to say goodbye. They said that my gram always loved me and wished she had been in better health to take care of me. My bio dad doesn’t want me there. To be fair, I am legally not part of the family anymore.

I of course said yes. After the weekend, she asked if they could stay the week, and after three weeks, when it had become pretty obvious that this relationship was beyond repair, I said (unprompted) “hey, why don’t you stay here til Christmas, that way you have some time to process all of this and work out what you’re doing”.

A bit of background: I’m single, late thirties, live on my own by choice. I have a spare room, and I used to rent it to flat mates, but I stopped because I really just wanted my own place. 

I offered the spare room to my friend because she needed it - her only other option would be to rent a place at great cost, or flat share with people she didn’t know at a really rough time. I let her use my car and paid for the insurance on it so that she could drive to work and not have to share with her ex. I didn’t charge rent or bills or anything else. I said until Christmas because that was a timeframe I felt I could commit to without resenting it. I was happy to be able to help, and I didn’t want anything in return, but my boundary was three months.

Just after Christmas, I heard from mutual friends that she had told them that I had made it “very obvious” that 30th December was the deadline to be out, and that I should have offered to let her stay longer because she was anxious and sad about moving back to the flat her husband and she used to live in together and I had the space. 

We obviously talked about the breakup whilst she was here. I would ask “has he given you a timeline?” and “is he working on getting another place?” But always from the POV of supporting her in getting what she needed from her ex (i.e. access to her own home) and in the context of how she was feeling. I never once mentioned a “deadline” for moving out after that first suggestion of Christmas I guess there is a chance that I was displaying behaviours unconsciously, because truth be told I was really ready to have the space back after 3 months, but I really did try to live by “mi casa su casa” whilst she was staying. I didn’t offer to extend the stay because I didn’t feel that I needed to - she now has a place she can go to, and I instead offered to help her redecorate it so it feels more like her own. And yeah - I do want the place back to myself, and now that the immediate need has passed I don’t think that’s unreasonable. But I am feeling really hurt that she took this line with our friends, and that she clearly thinks I am ungenerous for not continuing to share my home with her whilst she is still healing. I guess I can see that from her point of view it’s a spare room that no-one else is moving into.

47,t3_rvzahh,AITA for not forgiving my friends even though they were “Just Kidding” ?,"My husband (20M) and I (20F) have some friends that also happens to be my husband’s coworkers. The coworkers have known us for almost 2 years now and no problem has come up until recently. These coworkers are all about 10+ years older than us and most have SO of some kind. 

So for background, my husband and I like to shower together. I would say we shower together more often than we don’t. This is a mutual decision and there is no problem if one of us takes a shower by ourselves. We just prefer to shower together and it’s been this way since we were 17 or so. 

I have been very forgiving of the “rumor mill” at his place of work up until now. About a month ago my husband was talking to one of his coworkers. It had been brought up that we shower together in a off hand comment. (It’s not like it’s a secret 😂) This coworker had told him that it was disgusting that we shower together and she couldn’t imagine doing that with her husband. From there my husband watched her go to each coworker’s office. Later he found out that she told everyone that I was controlling when my husband could shower and that he could only shower when I said. It was to the point that my husband’s closest work friend took him aside to see if he needed help getting away from me. This really hurt me also because this person I considered a good friend… 

This friend later told us that he thinks she was just trying to make sure that my husband was ok and that it wasn’t malicious. I didn’t believe that for a second because I feel like if that was true she would of talked to my husband privately. Later she told my husband that she was just joking around… not even an apology. 

Some other rumors have happened in the past 6 months of knowing them, but I was able to forgive them because they were lesser.

48,t3_rvz9vx,AITA for telling my ex I would only pay for her dogs surgery if I got the dog?,"
I(29m) was dating Chloe(27f) for almost 3 years before we ended it last March. Chloe has an 8 year old daughter. When we were together I got a dog, Ginger. I paid her adoption fee, and most of her expenses, but I guess Chloe felt like Ginger was her dog, because when we broke up she insisted on keeping her, and threatened to take me to small claims court to get her, so I just let her have her. 

I had talked to Chloe a few times for work purposes since then but she sent me a text last Thursday. She said that Ginger needed an expensive surgery done and asked if I would pay for it. 

I'm not sure if this changes anything, but when we split up I knew and the vet knew that she would need this surgery at some point, but we didn't know when. I assumed Chloe knew as she had been to vet appointments but she claims she didn't know. She said since I knew about it before hand and didn't warn her I should pay for it. It's more expensive than you would expect or have on hand for emergency vet visits. 

Anyway, I told her I wouldn't pay for her to have Ginger's surgery done, but if she let me have her I would get the surgery done. 

She freaked out at me. She said I was “blackmailing” her and using someone in a vulnerable position to get something I wanted. She said I was awful for even suggesting taking the dog away from her best friend(Chloes daughter). 

I told her the only way I was paying for the surgery was if I could have Ginger back. She said I was being ridiculous and that she knew I could afford to pay for the surgery so I was just being petty by not, and that if I wasn't paying for it then she couldn't get the surgery done at all. 

I didn't think I was being unreasonable but I've had a few people tell me I should try to “blackmail” someone into giving me a dog.

49,t3_rvz71b,WIBTA for telling my wife that her best friend is in love with her and is causing issues between us on purpose?,"My (31M) wife (29f) and I have been married for 5 years. Things are going pretty good. We usually have open communication and the occasional argument. The problem is that 70% of our misunderstandings and occasional arguments are caused by her best friend surmising against me to my wife and generally making her feel insecure about the smallest things.

Example: My wife wanted to go to the club Xmas night with her friends, I didn’t care. Told her she looked beautiful on her way out and spent the night watching horror movies. Her best friend told her a man who loved her would put up an argument about her going out. I don’t put up a fight because 1) who cares 2) when she comes home half drunk we always have amazing sex.

During this argument, she spent the night with her best friend (as she usually does if we need a break from each other) and her best friend offered to orally pleasure my wife. My wife told me about this later when we made up. After she told me this, I started watching her best friend more and I’ve caught her best friend doing INSANE stuff. Her best friend checks out my wife’s body in a sexual way, she has tried to kiss my wife on the mouth in front of me, gives her sexualized compliments and I have even caught her best friend taking photos of my wife while she was undressing. 

Just like I would be uncomfortable if my wife had a male friend doing these things, I’m equally uncomfortable. My wife said that it doesn’t matter because they’re both women and that’s how women play, when I made the best friend delete the non consensual photos.

WIBTA if I laid it all out and told my wife to look at the facts?

Mini Update: I texted my wife asking if she’s ever let her best friend touch her in a sexual manner because of one of the comments you guys made and it came out that they do so often. She said that that’s just what best friends do. She said it’s not gay if women fool around. Now I’m lost from here and I don’t think marriage counseling is enough.",65.0
50,t3_rvz5y3,AITA for not wanting a friend's boyfriend to attend our wedding?,"First some background: me (M34) and my fiance (F30) are from different countries (The Netherlands and Lithuania) and since our families and friends won't all travel to one country or the other, we decided to just get married somewhere completely different and have a small party in each home country afterwards. Our eyes fell on the island of Madeira, so we planned to rent a house there for us and two witnesses (her best friend and my best friend). We'll be staying there for a week together, and then the witnesses will go home after which we stay two more weeks as our honeymoon.

My fiance is very close with her sister, so next to her witness she wanted her sister to be there as well. I'm ok with that, I understand. Then she also really wanted her best friend from the Netherlands to be there as well. I get that as well, her witness is her best friend from Lithuania, and since she moved to the Netherlands she didn't see her that much anymore, and also doesn't have many friends here, except for that one friend, who was always here for her. So we're now at 6 people in total: two witnesses, two guests and us. Since we both like all those people, we thought it would be great, having a nice time with some friends for a week on a far away island. We found a nice house that we can rent that can fit exactly 6 people, so it would all be perfect.

In comes the boyfriend. My fiance's friend from the Netherlands refuses to come without her boyfriend. I really, REALLY don't like this guy. He's always super smug, shouts over everything, is a know it all and if that wasn't enough I hate him even more for the way he treats his girlfriend. And I'm not alone in this, my fiance also doesn't like the guy and has on several occasions needed to comfort her friend when she was in another fight with him. However, my fiance REALLY wants her friend to be there and says that we have to change our plans, get a different house that would fit 7 (which  will be a lot more expensive), and deal with him being there. I really liked the house we found, I really looked forward to that week with friends. Now I just feel like shit about that week, dreading having THAT guy there at our wedding. Besides, my best friend doesn't bring someone else, nor does her sister or other friend. I'm specifically not inviting other people because we decided to keep it all as small as possible.

Now my fiance is mad at me for not wanting to deal with her friend's boyfriend and her friend is mad at me for not wanting her boyfriend at the wedding.

51,t3_rvz3k4,AITA for demanding to do all the chores in order to pressure my partner into letting me slide on long-term goals and tasks?,"My partner of over three years is a hyper-organized, ultra-neat, laser focused person. I am a scattered, frenetic slob. A partial explanation (though of course not an excuse!) for this is my ADHD, which I was re-diagnosed with and finally treated for at his urging about a year and a half ago.

He is incredibly understanding and supportive of my difficulties, but the fact of the matter is that I have made zero progress on managing my symptoms since starting treatment. I’ve read all the books, take meds, work with an ADHD coach/therapist, exercise regularly and eat well, use reminders and post-its and to-do lists and a task whiteboard…but none of it has worked. I still interrupt, get frustrated, misplace things, accidentally lock him out of the house, forget conversations, am lazy, and fail to meet my long-term goals/priorities.

I’d been really in denial of how bad things got for him after we moved in together; I felt like since I was crushing it at work, my finances and driving record are great, my personal life is full of close family and friends, and I was doing more than ½ of the chores, I was doing “enough”. But recently we had a *really* uncharacteristic fight, during which he presented me with a list he has been adding to for weeks, detailing all of the things I said I would do but never did. They ranged from the majorly selfish (promising to pack up my junk in the basement and take it to storage) to the minor and personal (mentioning buying a better electric toothbrush but not getting around to it). I was crushed and humiliated to see how many ways I had let him down so deeply. 

At the same time, I was finishing a book intended for partner of people with ADHD, which really opened my eyes to what an enormous burden it is to be with an ADHD-er, and focused repeatedly on how problems in a relationship are ALWAYS the fault of the ADHD-er, never the partner, especially when the ADHD-er is female and the partner male. 

So I vowed to do what I can to ease the burden. I know it’s impossible for me to truly live up to my obligation to function just as well as he can in every way—there’s no way I will never again show a single symptom. But I CAN amp up the short term work I can do, namely chores and household executive functioning (paying all the bills, doing all the planning, making both of our appointments, etc.)

But now he’s just as frustrated that I’m doing everything before he can get to it, he says it makes him feel like a jerk to watch me shovel snow for an hour or focus solely on his enjoyment in bed or do all the cleanup for a meal I planned/bought/paid for/cooked myself. He feels like I’m doing this on purpose to make him feel bad for being honest with me and trying to communicate. But I feel like if I do ALL the chores, he’ll have to be a little more chill about me not getting my laptop fan fixed within a few weeks of mentioning it. Am I out of line for trying to control the situation, for knowingly making him feel bad like this?",7.0
52,t3_rvz316,AITA by not giving my mom money for a furniture payment for her house when it puts her in the negative?,"To start off, I have lived with my mom for almost my entire life, and briefly lived with my grandpa while I finished high school. My brother also kind of lives off and on at her house. I just moved into my new apartment yesterday and I’m still buying stuff for the apartment. I was hit with having to pay the rent for the month of January, which we were all expecting it to be us having to pay in February for both months, which is why my finances are short right now. For the past year before I moved out, I have had to pay for my own ubers to and from work because I don’t drive. She could take me to work but she chooses not to. So for the past year and a half, I’ve paid $20-$30 to and the same amount back almost every day almost completely single-handedly. Sure she helped with an uber here or there but for the most part it’s been me. Which caused me to live from paycheck to paycheck and barely having money left over. But, now my new apartment is much closer to my job and both my roommates drive and I’ve offered to pay them to help them pay for gas. 

To reiterate, I still have a lot to pay for with the apartment and I can’t really afford to spend what I have left which I need for the apartment and as an emergency fund until I get paid on friday. Am I the asshole for not giving her $75 for her furniture payment for her house when I don’t really have the money to give to her even though she said she’d pay me back this upcoming friday? I would if I had the money to give her, but I still need to eat and be able to have money left over. 

I will also add that after telling her I couldn’t afford to lose $75 right now, she started to gaslight me and make me feel guilty for not giving her the money for it which would cause her to pay extra for the insufficient funds in her account.

Me and my nephew are very close I’m a (M28) and my nephew (M14).  When he was born I was 14. My brother was still in collage so was his future wife. There both great people. But this lead to me babysitting for them a lot. Will In those 14 years I got married settled down and plan on having kids of my own one day.  I have a pretty big house. Me and my wife make very good money when combined. 


Anyway on to the actual story 

My nephew is like a son to me. No he is a son too me. I helped raise him and I do consider him a son. Anyway my brother is not as fit as me and has some back problems. While my nephew loves to run around throw baseballs and footballs or just shoot the basketball. But I’m pretty fit and I can still do that type of stuff with him. Me and my brother live in the same neighborhood. So he comes over a lot. He even has his own room in my house.  Me and him love to watch football. And if he needs to talk about something or get something off his chest I’ll set there and listen. There have been times during the winter where I light a fire and I just set and listen to him for hours.  I love him so much. His a great kid really. 

The event happened Friday. My and my nephew were watching the collage football playoffs together. We made a day out of it pretty much. But his grandma and his moms side of the family came over. Idk really how close they are to them.  But apparently there was a big fight over if he spins to much time with me.  and how’s his never around when his grandma comes over. He did end up staying the night and went back home Saturday at around 6 pm after watching some more bowl games and going out to eat.

54,t3_rvyu2d,AITA for not taking a bad review down?,"So- My family takes my dog to a doggy daycare that’s right across the street. I personally had no issues with them- except one time I was bit late picking up my dog. They charge $1 a minute that I’m late. I was around 15 mins late, because I forgot they closed early on Fridays. I apologized profusely, paid the late fee- and the employee was a bit rude. This is the second time I’ve been late after almost a year- and she had a bad attitude. I didn’t say anything because I know it was wrong to be late. I didn’t mean to, and she was obviously inconvenienced. I think the attitude was unnecessary, but I understood. 

Now to the issue: my mom normally drops off and picks up our dog because I have work. I pay $300 weekly for the daycare (my dog needs a lot of exercise, and they have a huge fenced in yard where he plays while he’s there) and anyways, I guess he was wet and dirty and as the employee was loading him in the car, my mom said, “Oh, he’s wet!” 
The employee got pissy, took him in to dry him off, and in doing so, slammed the car door really loudly. 

So my mom wrote a three star review- said the place was nice but the employee was rude. 

I didn’t know this had happened. 

I then get a call from the owner stating that “none of the employees wanted to serve my mother- and that they would appreciate it if I could do drop offs and pick ups from now on.”

I agreed- it would be a tight fit with my work schedule but whatever. I then spoke to my mom and asked her about the review, and she said what happened. I believe her, because the employee who slammed the door was rude to me as well. But whatever, I let it go. 

Yesterday, I went to pick up my dog, and another employee asked me why the review was still up, and that they’re boss wanted them to ask. I explained the whole situation, said my mom didn’t want to take it down, and while I was super understanding, that particular employee was a bit rude. 

Last night the owner left me a voicemail asking to talk.

Before this though, whenever I could I would correct any unacceptable comments made about same sex relationships. I come from a middle eastern Christian background so my family was definitely raised to believe some untrue and prejudice things. 

Anyway, my gf is very vocal about social issues, such as homophobia, racism, ect. This causes regular arguments when I bring her to family events. She rarely ever has a good time with them no matter how much I try to correct my family or at least try to not say anything stupid whilst we’re around. I definitely saw how unhappy she was around them so when she asked not to see them anymore I didn’t disagree. 

I however was still seeing my family. I grew up with my cousin, we’re very close in age and he is one of my best and closest friends.

We both recently graduated a year / a year and a half ago. I’ve been growing more independent and I got a job in my field vs the part time job I had before and I make much more now and full time. He still works at his part time job where he makes minimum wage. We live in NYC so the rent is very expensive. His parents still help him with things and recently told them they will be cutting him off. 

He’s really immature with money. He didn’t have a savings account until I suggested one like three months into dating. He didn’t save any money from the 800+ weekly unemployment. We spoke about budgeting recently The last two weeks or so he hasn’t really had any money so I’ve been picking up the slack. He finally told me about all of these debts he has yesterday and said he won’t be able to save or do much for the next couple of months. 

But AITA for getting annoyed that despite that conversation yesterday, my boyfriend decided to call out of work to hang out with his friend today (his friend works there too)?

It feels like he is not being mature. His card has declined a lot es because he’s “too scared” to check it. I worry about our financial future and I’ve expressed this to him…many times. He always says he understands. But I don’t think he understands how frustrating this is being on the other side.

I told him he wasn’t being an adult and it was hard for me to support him when he makes questionable and immature decisions and that at this point I’m moving out with or without him.

I don't know what level of caring and lookout I should have for another adult, because I've never needed people to look out for me. It worries me because despite being adults, I can't be certain my friends will react the same way.


The specific situation is this: I'm a well-connected person due to my job and often get invited to ""fun"" events that are not always available to the public/less wealthy.  The people who invite me to such events are what I would hesitantly call friends, but certainly not fall under the category of calm/safe people. 


They have money, they're connected, and theyre fun to be around. They're also slightly manipulative, arrogant, and know that they have money/power. They're perfectly nice to be around but you have to stand your ground. 


My friend ""K"" is F20, and often sees me posting about such events and likes partying and mentioned to me last week that she thinks it would be fun. At first I thought nothing of it and said ""sure"" but now I'm not so sure. What if these older guys hit on her? Give her strong drinks? Try and pressure her to go home with them?

We've had a good few small issues due to living together caused by some different problems, but everything had been good for a while until now. I love my family a lot but it has been really difficult recently thanks to these issues and my own mental health tanking. 

So my sister has been back in town for the holiday season and has had my mom cut her hair in the past and its usually turned out really good. She came out from another cut with my mom and she still had a pretty good cut, my mom's not a professional but she's always done pretty well with her. Now my sister's hair is much longer and straighter than mine, so that could've caused this whole issue. My hair was shoulder length and extremely curly and after a really long time dealing with some general body issues, I was really happy with how I looked (this was entirely linked to me taking care of my hair since I loved the look of it) 

After my sister's haircut, I'd mentioned wanting to get my hair cut back to my mid neck since I haven't really gotten a haircut in two years. My mom offered to do mine and I was happy to let her! It was cheaper and it didn't seem too difficult to knock off an inch or so of hair. I had to take off my glasses since they were in the way, but I let her begin. 

It was honestly near the end that I'd noticed something was wrong since I could really feel how far up she'd gone, but it was already too late. I'd very explicitly asked for it to go to my mid neck, my hair is now right above my chin and it is BAD. Imagine a slightly longer haired coconut head and you'd be spot on. A lot of my self esteem was tied to my hair and this broke me. 

Anyways I spent most of last night an absolute wreck and nobody in the house has really acknowledged it all this. To be fair that usually happens though. It hasn't been too long since it was only last night, but I'm genuinely really mad or sad about this whole thing. 

I can't help but think that this all was on purpose since I think someone would really have to mess up to take this much hair off without intending to do so. She said something about evening it out with my hair in the front, but the hair had always been a bit shorter in the front. Thinking she did this on purpose is probably crazy, but I can't help but be extremely mad and anxious about this whole situation. 

So AITA For being genuinely upset about my mom giving me a bad haircut?",3.0
62,t3_rvyctb,AITA for not giving up my train seat?,"I had an incident on the train last week and it's been bothering me since it happened. I'm wondering whether or not I was the asshole. My family are split and the whole situation was upsetting and left me pretty shaken.

I was traveling down to visit my Uncle for new year who has been struggling with cancer and couldn't spend time with the whole family during Christmas. I had to take the train with my two kids (ages 4 and 7) and it was a pretty last minute booking as we weren't sure if me and the kids were going to be able to go.

It was about a 7 hour trip all around with about 4 of that on the train, and my kids were really tired and everything was a bit overwhelming so I didn't see a problem with sitting in the seats marked as reserved whilst the train was still pretty empty.

The journey was quiet. We got to have a bit of rest and have a few drinks and some food which the kids appreciated since it was such a long day for them. When people came on looking for their seats I stayed quiet and hoped their seats weren't ours. A man walked up and down the train a few times before starting to ask people if they could move (so he could see the numbers on the headrests), which I thought was pretty rude when he could easily have just sat in another seat for now (the train wasn't that full)

Anyway it turned out that my daughter was sitting in the seat this guy had reserved and when he aggressively said to her that she was in his seat she kind of looked a bit startled and looked to me. I had been watching this guy be rude to other passengers and I was pretty angry that he'd speak to my daughter the same way, rather than look to me and ask politely. She's seven and is obviously with me. I told her to stay where she was as there weren't any other seats she could move to that were next to me and suggested he sit somewhere else as there were more than a few seats dotted around.

He goes off muttering and I assumed he was going to sit down but he came back a few minutes later with a member of staff and was shouting at this point how we had stolen his seats that he'd paid money for and we weren't even supposed to be on the train. The woman checked our tickets and I explained to her that we were just tired and didn't think it would have been a problem to sit in the seats whilst the train wasn't full. To his fury the woman told us not to worry and also suggested that he sit elsewhere.

He started shouting about how we had stolen his seat and children weren't above the law. Long story short he was told that he needed to get off the train at the next stop as he wasn't welcome on the service. At this point both of my kids were pretty shaken and I regretted the whole journey but wasn't sure what I could even do at this point.

Was I the asshole here for creating this situation, part of me thinks this man was just crazy and was going to cause an argument with somebody even if it wasn't us but I'm not sure?",86.0
63,t3_rvycj5,AITA (20F) for not wanting to do my BF's (21M) assignments and secreting listening to a convo between him and a mutual friend?,"Backstory, I have been dating my boyfriend for a couple months. We argue sometimes but he is mostly quite sweet and caring to me, though he has the tendency to be quite controlling with who I can be friends with etc. He is the athletic type and I am more of a workaholic person.

To the main point, we both go to the same college and he studies Sociology while I study Computer Science. However, I have to help him do a lot of his papers and quizzes, and even his online exam. Yet he is quite reluctant to credit me, often saying that he could do better if he was interested in the subject, but I am doing work OUTSIDE of my own field and still manage to do pretty well. 

Sometimes it gets rather irritating as he would ask me to help him with his work overnight while he goes out to hang out with the guys or go to the bar.

One of my friends got quite pissed off after hearing him brag about his grades and told me their plan to have a call with him and record their convo for me.

Main point of the convo is that my friend asked him if he could survive college without me, and he said that I voluntarily helped him and that he could do it all on his own if he wanted.

This was quite upsetting as my courses were quite demanding and I was also balancing a couple part time jobs in addition to helping him with his work. When he found out this happened he was furious and said I betrayed his trust for telling my friend about our relationship and being manipulative.

I know it's kind of a dick move and invasion of privacy to do that, but AITA for wanting him to credit me and talking to my close friends about struggles. He doesn't really like to talk about my problems together, and I really cannot take the emotional stress and burnout.",22.0

We are in a rush to sell our place for reasons I won’t get into on here- however the reasons are to help HIS family. If we sell and don’t have a new house by closing, we can live with my parents for a while. Their house is 1.5 hours from his workplace. In early discussions, he mentioned staying in a hotel and I said absolutely not. It would be so expensive PLUS we have a baby which wouldn’t be fair to me or her. He agreed.

We have 6 kids together (ages 11,9,8,4,3 and 5months). His sister came who hasn't spoken to their mother in months with her daughter who will be 3. We have a lot of kids so I know more money is spent on them.  My 3 year old got 3 blue's clues toys (a block puzzle, a karaoke machine and a handy dandy notebook) and a outfit. His sister made a comment that blue is a girl. So his mother gave the blues clues karaoke machine she got him to his sisters daughter. This made me mad because my son kept walking around with it he really liked it. And his sisters daughter got a scooter, learning table, jewelry box and a outfit and we got her a singing poppy doll. This is the second year it happened last year she tried to give one of my 4 year olds toys to her.

66,t3_rvya4r,AITA for refusing to watch my niece and nephew?,"Ok for context i love my niece and nephew very much and have a great relationship with both of them. They are my brother in law’s kids and we both live in the same metro so me and my wife look after them and take them out to eat/to the movies quite often. My BIL and his wife are currently on an 10 yr anniversary trip to Italy for about a week - kids staying with my MIL. My wife bought me an oculus for xmas this year and had mentioned it to MIL. 

This Saturday my wife and I were both free after a busy week so we planned on doing a little date night at home and getting drunk and maybe playing around with the oculus (we both love video games). Friday night my nephew calls and asks me if ive tried out the oculus, tells me he’s so excited to play it tomorrow. I was caught off guard, worried I had made an obligation to take care of the kids that night and forgot about it. 

Talked to my wife and she was as confused as me. We call MIL who tells us she has a very important meeting to go to Saturday night and was meaning to ask us if we could have the kids over and let them play with the new ‘video game toy’. I know this meeting was not something mandatory ad she has been going to a ton of MLM and get rich quick seminars in her retirement (delusional hopes of saving up for a $1600 Gucci mink coat). I told her that we had made date night plans and wouldn’t be able to watch after the kids. She got really pissed and ended up calling me a ‘playground bully’ for not wanting to ‘let other kids play with my toys’. Wife found out on Saturday that MIL still went to the meeting and left the kids bored at home with leftovers. We were already drinking so we couldn’t go pick them up - part of me feels like we let them down.

67,t3_rvy9u5,AITA for calling my sister a narcissist,"My sister 'Jane' 20F and I 23F are the closest of 3 siblings. However, she has narcissitic tendencies and is very self centered. This has always been the case ever since we were young. She has never wanted to share anything but she expects everyone else to share. She constantly bashes everyone in my family and talks in a very condescending manner. She is otherwise an ok person and we have always seemed to get along ok.

She is in uni doing engineering and has constantly belittled me for not doing well in Math and is always going on about how hard her course is and how easy mine is (I do law). She gets angry at people and is very vengeful when they don't want to do what she wants them to do. Recently she asked me to help her out with some paperwork but I was reading for my upcoming bar exam but she wouldn't have it and she got really angry at me.

At the moment we're all home and I'm down with a very bad flu but she wanted me to get out of bed to help her choose some outfits. It seemed like she had clearly decided what she wanted because she kept refusing all my suggestions and would only go with 2 specific dresses. I told her that I want to go to bed because I was very sickly then she started saying how I don't care for her and I am not willing to help her. I then told her how narcissistic she is and now she would not talk to me. I feel very guilty and I should have probably kept the comment to myself because I feel like I've ruined a good relationship with my sister. So AITA for calling my sister a narcissist?

68,t3_rvy81s,AITA for removing books my MIL gave my infant son because I don't approve the content.,"I have a 5 month old son, he is our only child and will probably not have any brothers or sisters .

My husband is the only child of his mother, and is very close with her. 
His background: there was a nasty divorce with a worse custody battle that they dragged my husband through and she, IMO became emotionally dependent on him and is her entire life. My background: oldest of 6 kids, but a daddy's princess, I was raised to believe that parents do not show big feelings to kids.

Back to the story. My MIL snuck a book on his bookshelf called ""Grandma says Yes."" Now, normally I don't believe in book censorship in ANY way. But he is a young child and I don't want him getting any ideas that just because Grandma says yes, that all 4 of his grandma's and me should say yes too. So I read the book to MY mother who didn't like it all the way. So I hid it.

69,t3_rvy57v,WIBTA if I call my new guy friend out over a potentially creepy/suggestive text he sent me at 2:30am?,"I (22F) met ""Z"" (23M) 7 months ago at an internship. At first he insinuated that he was romantically interested in me. I made it clear that I am in a 4 year relationship and not interested in Z. He respected it, and we maintained a platonic friendship. I maybe hang out with him once a month, because he is not in my main friend circle.

I made it pretty clear that I'm not super comfortable talking about my sex life, so I do not talk about mine. Z, however, talks regularly about missing his ex, going on tinder dates, and feeling lonely, which I respect and listen to because I try to be a good friend. I gently call him out when I think he's over the line on certain things, so it's not like I don't set boundaries. I change conversation topics when I'm not interested in talking about certain subjects.

Recently it snowed in my city. The city meme pages were posting about the snow. I liked one that was an ""overheard"" text post. Even though I'm in a healthy relationship and very satisfied with my sex life, I thought it was funny, because I've heard the horror stories from my other friends about dating in our city, which has a toxic dating culture that results in frequent baiting and lying. The post said the following:

*""Two friends walking in the snow*

*Friend 1: 'There's no way this is six inches of snow'*

*Friend 2: 'Every man wishes this was six inches'""*

Z sends me a screenshot of my like on the post with the text ""not you liking this uh oh 😳"" at 2:30am. I woke up to it, and it honestly creeped me out. I don't know if I'm reading too much into it. I have a history of being stalked and sexually harassed, which he knows about, and I'm not sure if this is influencing how I'm interpreting the situation. I also feel weird receiving this text, because when we first met he was interested in me. I showed my boyfriend the text, and he also felt weirded out that Z would send something like this to me.

I want to call him out, but I'm not sure if that would be blowing things out of proportion. To me this text feels disrespectful to my boyfriend and I. Z didn't know my motive behind liking the post, so why assign it one? I can't tell if it's a playful joke, but to me it seems like a weird indirect way of flirting. I also feel like I'm slightly out of line, because what if it is my trauma projecting itself and social media is public.

WIBTA if I told him that his text made me very uncomfortable given my history with exes and former bosses stalking (including monitoring my social media) and sexually harassing me?

**TLDR:** A guy friend, ""Z"", I've known for 7 months, who was initially romantically interested in me, sent me a potentially creepy/suggestive text about a post I liked at 2:30am. I'm in a 4 year relationship and made it extremely clear to Z that I only want a platonic friendship. I can't tell if my trauma from past stalking and sexual harassment warping my perspective on the situation. WIBTA if I called him out?",3.0
70,t3_rvxx3x,AITA for refusing to help out with my siblings?,"Another post about my mom, if you haven't seen my other posts, then hello! I'm a 15 year old girl and my mom is a 34 year old woman who had me as a mistake in college, she had to drop out to raise me and I get reminded of this often but that has nothing to do with this story.

My mom likes to go out and party with her friends, she does this once or twice a month which wouldn't be so bad if my siblings weren't both mentally disabled and she expects me to take care of them for her while she is gone. 

On the night before Christmas, I wasn't able to go to sleep until past 5 am because my mom was out partying all night and I had to deal with my little sister and brother. My sister is a year younger than me but she is way stronger and taller than me, her doctor estimates that she will grow to be around 6'7. She also has a body type similar to Luisa from that new Disney Movie Encanto (I know this because my sister is obsessed with it and forces the whole family to watch it over and over again with her at full volume)

During the night, I had to help my sister with deep-cleaning her room, my brother turned the big heater on and caused the breakers to trip, and my sister insisted on waiting until my mom came home for us to go to bed. At 5am she finally got tired, but not before throwing a huge tantrum and yelling at me to call mom. My mom never answered that call and came home sometime around 6. 

She was also too hungover to let us open presents in the morning and I got pissed and told her that I was tired of taking care of her kids for her while she went out and got drunk. She yelled at me and said that as a adult, she had the right to go party and having kids doesn't change that. I told her that if she wanted to go out partying until past 6 then she shouldn't have had kids. She decided to remind me that she didn't even mean to have me that that the ""damage was already done"". 

I told her that I was done helping her parent her kids and have been refusing to help out at all unless it was doing dishes or something on my normal chore list. Whenever my sister starts throwing a tantrum, I just get my phone and leave. My mom insists that I'm being petty and that I should help out since they are my younger siblings",116.0
71,t3_rvxwzx,AITA for telling my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend to stop texting him about their kids during the holidays?,"My boyfriend has 2 children with his ex-girlfriend. They were together for 7 years. The relationship ended 3 years ago, very badly. It was a very toxic relationship; they were both alcoholics, there was a lot of infidelity on both sides, and as a result of the alcoholism they lost custody of their children. The children are with a temporary guardian, who is their grandmother, and my boyfriend and his ex get separate visitation with them twice a month and on holidays. 

The ex-girlfriend has been calling my boyfriend, and texting him, every time he has the kids. She asks to speak to them (he usually says no), and she tells him that she misses the kids so much and misses being a family. She also texts him whenever she has the kids, sending him pictures, telling him how much they all miss him. 

I've had a problem with this for a while because it has really felt like she wants him back and is being emotionally manipulative with the situation. 
She doesn't know this but my boyfriend has been sober for a year and has been working very hard on getting custody of the children again. I know it is triggering for him every time she sends messages. I also feel like it is confusing the children because the youngest one continues to ask ""where is mommy?"" randomly throughout the visits with their dad. 

I briefly brought up the concern to my boyfriend that maybe she wants him back. He assured me she doesn't want him back, she has a boyfriend, and she is just feeling a lot of regret for her decisions and is really in a low place.

Well, a few weeks ago my suspicion was confirmed when she sent him a text begging him to leave me and go back to her. She said she promises things will be different and if they are together she knows the court will give the kids back to them. He sent her a text back and told her it was never going to happen, their relationship was terrible, it was terrible for the kids, he's happy now, and they should both move on and work together for the sake of the children. 

Again, over Christmas, she sent him texts asking how the kids are doing, wanting pictures, going on and on about how they should all be together and how she really misses being able to talk to him. Yesterday, my boyfriend told me that it was the first time in a year that he had that familiar, overwhelming feeling to go drink and not stop until he was fully drunk. 

That was it for me. I decided to send her a message on Facebook. I told her to stop doing this, when he has the children it's our time together with them, it's confusing the children when she brings it up to them, and he is trying to live sober and her messages are putting him in a bad headspace. She never responded.

My boyfriend said he wished I wouldn't have done that, that it's only going to make things worse, and I should've left it alone. Am I the asshole?",7.0
72,t3_rvxw3e,AITA? So today a client blocked me because she didn’t receive her package yet…,"For a bit of background information, I’m an artist. I created this customer a custom digital work and she ordered a canvas of that piece. She ordered it during the beginning of December, during December things can take a lot longer to get delivered because obviously holiday season. Anyway this particular customer was ordering me around and refused to say please or even check the parcelforce link herself. 

Today she complained her package hadn’t been delivered yet. I checked the link and it said they tried to deliver it twice before Christmas on the 23rd but failed for reason unknown. It said they were trying again today. Now, I’m sorry but in my opinion I’m only the artist and I’ve done my part and sent off her package with a tracking link and proof of postage , I’m not the courier… it seemed like she was incapable of calling the courier company up herself and actually asking about her package but instead wanted me to do it and in fact she did order me around a few times on *Christmas Day* might I add, demanding I tell the courier to redeliver it. Today I had enough and basically exploded at her telling her that the world doesn’t revolve around her, I won’t let her order me around and that I’m not the courier. She called me rude and said that it’s my responsibility to check where the item is and get it delivered, I already did this I was even dealing with her on Christmas Day and taking time on my phone to contact parcelforce for her to check what’s happening with her package, when I could’ve been with my family. 

I’ve gone above and beyond for this customer but she’s repeatedly been rude to me, orders me around and seems to just think that I can magically make the parcel appear. I’ve asked a few small business groups on Facebook if they would do the same as me in the situation and many said that yes once I sent off the package, the item was her responsibility it was her responsibility to check the link I provided and keep up-to-date with the courier company.

73,t3_rvxu2k,AITA for walking out of my date?,"I went on a date with a guy last week. He’s someone I’ve been talking to for about 6 months online.  We met in a Star Wars fan group on discord. 
The only meat I eat is fish, so I checked out the restaurant beforehand and saw a salmon dish I would like.  I have told this guy this, and I had no problem paying for myself.  
I was excited to meet him and talk about Star Wars and the new Boba Fett series.  He seemed off when I met him there and was kinda rude.  He ordered my meal for me.  The black bean in lentils burgers.  Don’t get me wrong, I love a freaking good impossible burger, but lentils make me 🤮
I told him I wanted the salmon, and he said I could get the salmon next date.  I can have the burgers now.  At this 🚩I was like, nope.

74,t3_rvxpi4,AITA for calling my dad horrible in an argument about his car?,"I 21F live with my father 60M. We are struggling with money a lot for various reasons but mostly related to the poor job climate and the fact that he smokes a LOT of a certain illegal herb. Originally we are from Zimbabwe but whole family moved when I was very young. Mom divorced dad and sister is happily living in a different country with her partner after getting a uni degree (proud). Parents have been abusive/neglectful throughout my whole life. 
Dad has 2 vehicles, a van he recently bought from a friend for a good deal. He has another car (not on road). Dad says he wants to give his car to a different friend. Other friend lives miles away from us and is also struggling with money. He asked my opinion of this change, and I was honest. I said I think it's a bad idea unless he decides to sell the car to other friend, or perhaps sort a rental agreement out where she pays x amount monthly for use of the car. 
It became an argument as dad disagreed and couldn't answer some of the questions I was asking like would there be a legal contract drawn up, how long would it be borrowed for, has he considered selling it for reduced price? Dad does not appreciate my wording and goes on to speak on how the English Language has declined since my generation took over, that word meaning has been completely distorted and no one has been educated properly on Eng Lang compared to how he studied in school. I literally have an Eng Lang A Level, and am pretty darn tired of this man questioning mine and my sister's qualifications. This kind of thing is common from dad- last time he did it to my sister she threatened to send him her uni transcripts. 
I said to dad if he's going to question my education he can go [out of room]. He left shortly without a word. 
Later, we have a small talk about what's best to do with the car. I explain we should at least try and get some financial compensation for lending car out, even if it's only a small amount per month it will help. Convo doesn't go well as dad says that nothing he ever suggests is right. We argue some more and I return to my room. 
He later comes back and plainly states that I have no respect for my culture. A huge argument ensues but I am often accused of insulting him when that's not the case so I am always careful with my words to make sure he won't take it the wrong way/have feelings hurt. He accuses me of rejecting my culture and its values. I tell him with Zims' views on LGBT+, gender, race etc it's easy to see why I would struggle with that part of my culture. He says I am learning about my culture from other people and know nothing about my own country. I tell him if he was so invested in me respecting Zims he should have taught me about it himself as I was 2 when we left Zims and I grew up in the UK. We argue a lot with him telling me I'm hysterical as I am crying at this point. I reply that he does not get to regulate my emotional reactions when he is the one insulting me and being horrible. ",2.0
75,t3_rvxnlj,AITA for banning my mom from my house after she stole my wedding dress?,"My mom has a tendency to be very reactive. she is also extremely superstitious and sentimental. I am not.

I am currently planning a wedding and we are both broke students, so it is pretty low budget. My MIL asked if I wanted her wedding dress. She got married in 2019 and it lasted nine months. I'd refer to the wedding as some type of internal crisis where she believed she had to be married by 40, and was trying to make another man jealous. She cried the morning of the wedding, and kissed her boss on the lips in front of the groom. She is now very bitterly divorced, but happily living with her boss.

MIL offered me the dress, and hey it's a beautiful dress. We are the same size and it is from a bridal boutique I could never afford. I'm happy and not at all worried about her failed marriage. my mom told me she thought it was a horrible idea and the dress would bring bad energy. I said I'm not into that stuff and I'm going to wear it. She called me spoiled and materialistic, and cited that MIL doesn't even like me (MIL doesn't really like anyone but her boss, but I'd say she likes me well enough) and that MIL disapproves of the wedding (she thinks we are too young, but she isn't that invested) I told my mom that I get where she is coming from, but I am wearing it.

Well my mom came over recently and she fucking stole the dress. I called her and confronted her, and she said that she is disappointed that I am shallow and want to wear a dress from an adulteress with a failed marriage. I told her she had 2 hours to return it or I was calling the cops. She did return it intact, but I said she is banned from my house forever. 

My mom did apologize and she cried. she feels like since the dress is ok I am being too harsh. She cited that if I have kids it wouldn't be fair to keep her banned, and said I should understand that this is hard for her and when your kids grow up there are always ""growing pains""",540.0

I was out of town for Christmas and he was staying at my house. I have security cameras and had a notification and when I checked it I saw that his ex and his son were at the house too and saw that they were having sex on my sofa (I have an indoor camera to monitor my cats when I'm out of town). I said something to him and he apologized, but the ex was still there when I got home from my trip. She was here new year's weekend also but he at least asked that time.

I told him, ""you didn't even ask me though, you didnt even tell me she was coming over."" and explained that it's really upsetting and feels like he's disrespecting me and my home by not asking me first. He asked if I wanted her to leave and I said ""well that would make me look kinda of shitty of I made her leave now"". Well he went in there and had her leave anyway.

78,t3_rvxj4n,AITA for brushing off a family member," I have 3 sisters. My mother and one of my sisters have late stage Lyme's disease. My mother has coddled her since she developed Lyme's.

When I was 19-20, my father died. My mother was progressing downhill due to Lyme's at a fast pace. I spent the time I wasn't at the college helping her around the house and doing errands. A year later, my mother was having issues getting to the bathroom without aid. My mother found a program where the state would pay you to help a disabled person around their house(IHSS).

My mother insisted that I not be allowed to leave without her being able to contact me, which I had to pay for, but also that I pay rent and other misc. bills of hers. Eventually I was paying over 100% of my paycheck to her in various bills to continue working. My middle sister didn't leave. She was verbally abusive to me daily. Every time I would bring this up and ask my mother to put a stop to it, I was made to be the bad guy, even going so far as to tell me that I was ""an asshole"" for asking for money back for my mother's misc. bills. I escaped a decade later.

After the town was hit by a national disaster, I wound up in Florida and my mom wound up in Washington with my middle sister. This was against the advice of my twin and I, both of whom had been victims of middle sister's wrath and could see what was going to happen.

A few months ago, my mom calls me almost crying. My middle sister was doing EXACTLY what we'd warned her was going to happen. Not only that, but the EXACT same thing my middle sister had done to me. I replied with how she'd been defending this and how my twin and I said this would happen. My mother, not getting the instant sympathy she wanted, went straight from almost crying to Karen-like ""Well then, I guess I'll just hang up now."" and did so.

I didn't think about it until a few weeks ago, when my mom called my twin because my middle sister had started ramping up her abuse in ways I'm not allowed to post on sub. When I mentioned the prior conversation with my mom to my twin, she called me an asshole. I admit, I was cold to my mom, but should ignore the decade of theft and emotional abuse my mom and middle sister put me through. They both have a condition that gives them both memory issues. I can't even tell at this point if they are gaslighting or genuinely don't remember, not that they haven't gas lit me before. AITA?",5.0
79,t3_rvxfpb,AITA for installing cameras without telling my housemates?,"I (F20) live in a shared house with 3 other girls. I will call them Sara, Kate, and Zoe. Kate is friends with Zoe, the rest of us aren't really friends. Whilst I'm on ok terms with Sara and Zoe, I've never really liked Kate.

We have a shared fridge, where we have a shelf for each of our stuff. I have noticed that my food and milk constantly goes missing. I see multiple times a week that a large portion of my food and milk is gone. It's unbelievably frustrating, and also very time- consuming and expensive having to buy/cook new food.

I always believed it was Kate because
1.) She is awake late in the night (1-4am). I am asleep then, and I tend to notice my stuff missing in the morning
2.) I have asked all of them about it. Sara and Zoe both deny taking my stuff, but Kate gets all defensive and says I shouldn't accuse her when I have no proof

I was complaining about it to my friend, and he said he was in a similar situation and he got a fridge camera. I thought this was a great idea. I got one, placed it discreetly inside the fridge, and decided to wait a week.

Sure enough, it was Kate, raiding my food daily. I confronted her about it, because now I had proof. I showed her the footage, told her to never do it again, and that she should repay me for what she took. 

She went apeshit. She said how dare I put a camera in the shared kitchen without asking the others first, and how it's so invasive to record others in their own home.I explained the camera only recorded the inside of the fridge, not the whole kitchen, but she didn't care. 

She has since said she'll never be able to feel safe in her own home again. Zoe has sided with her and they're both calling me an AH and saying I should've asked everyone first, even though this would've defeated the whole purpose. I said none of this would've happened if Kate hadn't been stealing my food and lying about it. Sara has taken my side, so it's pretty tense in the house atm.

80,t3_rvxdx7,AITA for abandoning my(23) mom(47),"Hi. This is my first post so please be patient. Also english is my second language and I am not the best at it.
The thing is, I am verry close with my mom. I used to tell her everything and we talked a lot. She gave me good advice and encouraged me to discover myself while she supports me and loves me unconditionaly.
But 2 years ago she had doubts about my dad's fidelity and asked me to install a spy app on his phone. I did and she found out she was talking at his work about all the women he had and stuff. They fought a lot and he addmited that he said that and it was a joke with his coworkers, not the truth.
Anyway, since then, she spies on him all the time and her girlfriends tell her where they saw him, with whom, if she looked at a woman, anything. It became ridiculous because they are very mean and exagerating
My mom wants my support. And I've been trying to do so. For 2 years I stood and listen for hours what he did what she heard, how horrible it is. They started to fight all the time and she would come for me for emotional support. Wich I was more than happy to offer. The thing is, every time, she gets mad at me because she says I am not totaly on her side. That I don't belive everything her friends say about him or that I don't understand her feelings and I just talk like I wouldn't do the same in her place.
She says she talks to me as her friend, but... a friend should support her 100%. I don't think I can because this is my family too that is crushing and my dad, idk if he did all of those things to her, but he is an amazing father for me. he loves me to the core.  I feel that the only way she would feel 100% supported would be if I would directly cut the ties with him. I don't want to hurt him like that, I don't think he deserves it from me. 
To make the matter worse, she has her own place that she goes and she moves back and forth. She says she wants me to stay with him so he can support me financialy untill I finish my studies, but gets mad and mean with me, ignoring and sassy comments when I come here once at every few days. She says I she is alone.
Anyway. Today we had another conversation. I have very important exams this month, but I listen to her. She got mad I didn't belive something her friends said and I she left for her place after she got mad that I mad her problems about myself.
I sent her a message after asking her if for a while, untill I pass my exams, can I be just her daughter and not her friend, as I need space to heal myself. My family is a mess too, not only hers.
Idk, did I do wrong? I don't want her to feel abandoned.
AITA for abandoning her?

81,t3_rvxdts,AITA for telling our nephew that being a teen parent is a bad idea when we were teen parents ourselves? It's upset our daughter greatly.,"As the title says, my wife got pregnant when we were both 18. And at the time, we felt the best decision was to raise our child. We got married and really struggled our way through raising our daughter.

Don't get me wrong. It was a very difficult life at first. But our daughter was the best thing that happened to us and we don't regret it. We raised her with a lot of love and we were a happy family.

Our oldest daughter is now 19 and we have a younger child who is 6.

My nephew, who is 19, recently came to visit after self-isolating and we were having drinks one evening. The talk slowly turned to how his girlfriend was pregnant and they were deciding what to do. I stupidly said out loud that looking back, going through with the pregnancy when we were 18 may not have been the best idea because of young we were. And he should really think about all of his options.

Especially considering how much we struggled to support our family. My wife was also there and was agreeing with me.

My nephew then had a fight with my daughter a few days later, and he told her that my wife and I wished we had aborted her.

This spiralled into a complete breakdown of our relationship. My daughter was screaming at us and called us awful names. She refused to hear us out and moved out to my mother's.

She's told everyone that we wished we had aborted her. She posted it on Instagram.

Everyone turned against us.

Any attempt to reach out to our daughter has been shot down.

Saying what I did is probably the biggest regret of my life.

But I really feel like my words have been twisted out of context.

82,t3_rvxcm7,AITA 5 Types of Feet?,"My significant other just walked up to me and says ""do you know your foot can tell you where you're from and there's only 5 types of foot"". 

Apparently some (bet my bottom dollar but I assume it's a) woman has collated enough research to say there are only 5 types of ""foot"" in the world .. but the types are even more outrageous than the claim there are 5 types .. 

Apparently the types are: Celtic, Egyptian, Roman, Greek and German..... 

As a mild history enthusiast the titles themselves are corrosive, it's as useful as saying there's a ""Soviet foot"" or a ""European Union foot"" but when my significant other asked me to actually show my foot, to actually use this measuring system plucked freshly from some pink haired cabbage gobblers ass crack was the last straw. 

I told my significant other that I didn't care what foot they had and I would not be showing my foot as that would be showing solidarity with nonsense. Apparently I'm no ""fun"". 

In response to my partner's visible displeasure I asked if they knew there is only 3 types of gullible. Very gullible, quite gullible and gullible plus. 

For context a large part of my genetics are from a people group who had no contact with those 5 ""groups"" for a good 16,000 years depending on who you ask so pretty confident I don't have a Celtic foot 🥴

I’ve also been dating my boyfriend since we were 16. I asked my mother if she was okay with me going to my boyfriend’s (22m) beach house for a week. He requested off from his job the entire week for his birthday and asked if I could stay down there with him for the week as I work from home and my computer is pretty easy to move. I loved the idea, I only get to see my boyfriend on weekends because of our work schedules but I get to at least be in the same house as him for a week even if I’m working.Well I texted my mother f(40) about the idea and this was the conversation 

Me: Bf requested the week off for his birthday from work, he was wondering if I could bring my computer and work to stay the week. I understand if that’s not okay though

Mom: He must not need money to be taking off. You’re an adult I don’t know 

Me: That’s was really passive aggressive not helpful I’m asking because I care about your opinion

Mom: ttyl

After work, I went downstairs and my mother looked ready to unravel her thoughts and this is how it went.

Mom: I told dad about your request, you know the consequences so I guess go ahead 

Me: Okay I really appreciate it 

Mom: Oh and your boyfriend will no longer be welcomed to spend the night on weekends anymore. We allowed it for a while but I don’t want it happening again.
Is he getting a place soon? His own place? 
As my daughter I have to look out for you, I’m afraid your boyfriend may trans. He’s highly feminine and not macho like your father. Your father would never paint his nails or wear earrings, if you and boyfriend are just friends that’s great! But if your not then make sure he’s not just using you. 

I was in utter shock, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. My face got extremely red and my mother said “wow. Your face got red fast.”

I told her my boyfriend is not afraid to show his style, but just because he wears earrings and nail polish does not mean he is trans. I told her we just hit our 5th year mark and how dare she say we’re just friends after all this time. I don’t feel good, I felt like throwing up because I truly plan on marrying my boyfriend and he is the absolute sweetest guy and I feel so angry at my mom but I simply said okay and went upstairs.

84,t3_rvx7kn,AITA for not coming to work?,"I work in a lawyer's office as an assistant. I help with organising his appointments, replying to some of the not so difficult emails etc. 
I don't have a set schedule. What I have been doing the past years is I give the receptionists the dates I am free to come to work, she checks with the lawyer's schedule and puts them into system and let's me know what days I am working and what days I am not. She also let's me know if there is any change (e.g. don't come to work, he is not coming, come later, he changed his hours from 9-12 to 10-12, so you are only needed after 10) and so on. And that's been working great for me. 

My issue is that since this receptionist got promoted, we hired a new one, let's call her Alex and she has been working there for a little more than 5 months. The first time Alex forgot to let me know not to come for my shift as it was cancelled,I dint make a big deal out of it as anyone makes mistakes, but asked her to tell me next time, as I live an hour away. I haven't kept track but I have told her this several times and I have probably had around 2 cancelled shifts she didn't tell me about in advance and maybe around 4 changed hours I wasn't told about (resulting in me scrolling on Instagram for however long it took for the lawyer to come). I resorted to either call her myself to ask if my shift was still on or if the hours haven't changed or logged into her computer to check the schedule for the next day (if I was at work and was also working the next day). And this worked perfectly, until today. 

I haven't worked from mid-December, so during my last December shift, I checked the schedule, it wasn't yet organised so I just let the receptionist know my free days in January. She didn't let me know during the whole Decmeber what the schedule was so I expected I wasn't working today. Just to be sure, I texted her today in the morning if she could text me the schedule or at least let me know if I was working tonight as I needed to make plans accordingly (A friend asked me to drive her to an appointment). She told me she will get back to me in a minute. 

I had 3 exams today, so not a lot of time so after the friend came to me and asked me for a third time if I could drive them or not, I said yes (I haven't got a reply from Alex so I figured OK, lawyer is probably away, as I anticipated, otherwise she would tell me to come). I finished the exams and texted her that I have made plans so I hoped the lawyer wasn't working tonight. She replied straight away and blew up on me, sent me probably about 20 messages. Called me a cow and some other stuff, told me I should have checked with her before making plans, not just conclude her lack of reply meant I was free as she forgot to text me that I indeed was supposed to work tonight (I probably should have but I really didn't have time during the exam + she should have let me know automatically).

86,t3_rvx66e,AITA for not talking to my friend because they joked about my mental health,"I (16) have very bad anxiety so it's really hard for me to talk or chat with people over call or ft.
My friend (21), let's call them S, asked me to join them on a call over discord. At first I denied but then they kept on nagging me about it so I gave in. I joined them over that call but kept my mic muted. 
Our mutual friend was always there so I got even more anxious about speaking up. Although I was replying in the chat instead of actually talking to them, they still were trying to get me to speak up. 
I was trying but the moment I went to unmute my mic and prepared myself to talk, it felt like all the blood drained out of body, it always does. They started joking about my anxiety. 
It started with some light jokes which I was fine with but then my friend 'S' started saying how I won't get a job because of my anxiety and how I won't be able to survive because of my anxiety and what not. The other friend started laughing. It hurted so bad. Those words upseted me a lot due to some things that were said to me when I was younger.
Before you say something like ""they are right tho."" I don't get anxious while talking to people irl/face to face and also it was none of their concerns. 
I didn't say anything at that time but later in a gc, some topic came out and I talked about how hurt I was by that mutual friend as I didn't expect her to laugh while 'S' was making fun of me. It suddenly triggered 'S' and they was going on about how I'm such a snowflake and it's fine for them to make fun of my anxiety as they're my friend and said how I'm so trashy, egotistic, super sensitive and so many other disgusting things. I couldn't say anything in response to all of that as I was having an anxiety attack. None of the people in the gc came to my support and was siding with 'S'. Also these are the same people who post stuff about mental health.
They made me feel like I was being a snowflake and said how I'm too sensitive. Was I being too sensitive and a snowflake?

87,t3_rvx4pm,AITA for blowing up at my fiancé's stepsister over her fiancé's proposal prank?,"My fiancé has 4 stepsiblings through his mom's marriage. MIL married when he was 16 (and he lived with his dad) so while he is close with two of them, I wouldn't call it a sibling relationship. We got engaged recently after 5 years of dating. MIL's younger stepdaughter ""Leah"" has been with her BF for 2 years and she is one of those people who plans everything down to the exact minute, and definitely wanted to get engaged. Leah seemed a bit annoyed when I got engaged, but everyone told her to relax and she had to know hers was coming.

MIL isn't too bad but can be snarky and judgmental. MIL is also super romantic, loves to celebrate things, likes men to dote on her. MIL was very underwhelmed by my proposal. He proposed in our room after i came out of the bathroom wearing pajamas. He just handed me the box. I admit it is something I am a little insecure about (but I would never tell him and I know the proposal doesn't make the marriage)  MIL is horrified and had to be nicely told to STFU about it.

Well Leah got engaged recently. He did a nice proposal at a hot springs during a ski trip. We saw them recently, and she was really giddy about the proposal. Leah also said he was an ass and he fake proposed to her the day before the went on the trip. They have the type of relationship where they troll each other, so I didn't think much of it, but then he laughed and said he recreated my proposal just to see Leah's reaction. Everyone laughed and MIL said she would have cried.

Leah said she panicked for about 30 seconds and then realized he would never do that to her, as if it is something so awful that was done to me. I finally lost my cool and was like I'm sitting right here. They tried to brush it off, but I yelled at Leah that she is a bitch for bringing it up and she didn't even have to tell that story, and that she is clearly as shallow as MIL, which is funny because she talks a lot of shit about MIL (MIL and SFIL are semi aware of this)

Leah texted me that she was sorry for hurting my feelings but said I went too far. Everyone else thinks I acted crazy and it was just a funny story.

My mom wants to come and visit and she wants to quarantine with us.

The problem with that is she wants to come at a very important time of year for me at my work, I can take time off...but she's asking I take time off for her quarantine (I can't have her quarantining at my home, and go to work) plus time after. I told her this would easily cost my wife and I $5,000+ in terms of lost income/etc and only way I'd agreed is if my dad compensated us for our loss income (which he could do)

Naturally, the answer was no. 

I said fine, come and quaratine. She then said ""but medical"" she does need monitoring of a condition the thing is the healthcare in this country is not only on par but superior to where she is coming from at significantly lower cost.

Finally, she admitted she doesn't want to spend 14 days in a hotel. And I was like ""Well..yea you can't quarantine with us""

Also her quarantining with us would knock out a huge portion before my wife and I vacation time. Basically she can afford the hotel quarantine, but doesn't want to spend the time in the hotel and instead force my wife and I to take time off work so she can quaratine with us costing us time and money.

I have two dogs; one of them is a corgi who is on a diet because he is a little too fat and can't have surgery because he doesn't respond well to anesthesia. Corgis can have severe back problems that require surgery if they get too fat but in his case the vet said she couldn't do it.


My uncle has been living in our house for around a year, he left for a few months and came back yesterday.


He always gives his dog a few sugar cubes every day and leave them on the ground when his dog doesn't eat them, sugar is bad for dogs on his own but with a dog that can't get fat or could die it's even worse, I sometimes have to take 5-6 cubes out of my dog's mouth in one day, I tried to talk about it but it didn't change anything.


When he decided to come back, my mother promised me she would talk to him and that it wouldn't happen again but today Shira found a piece of chocolate cookie that my uncle had given to his dog and ate it before I could react, I had found a few other pieces but didn't see that one.

I'm pretty pissed because she knew I was worried and promised me it wouldn't happen again but finally didn't do anything but blame me for ""always exaggerating."" It got even worse when my step father heard it and started insulting me and saying I pissed him off with my dogs and they could die.

93,t3_rvwg6h,AITA for demanding my MIL treat me like her MIL treats her?,"I am getting married very soon and my future MIL has been nothing but drama. She isn't particularly close to her son or possessive (they have an ok but not warm relationship) but she doesn't like others getting attention, and she comes from a culture where shitty MILs are pretty normalized.

We've had so many dumb fights this past year that ended with her saying I'm not her child, not her family, and she owes me nothing. This is mostly over little things like not acknowledging my birthday, not giving me a Christmas gift when everyone else got one, talking about her stepdaughter's wedding in front of me and not asking any questions about mine. She tried to exclude me from a family girls spa day, and it is just the feeling of death by a thousand cuts. The worst thing she did was trick me into dressing wrong for a party. That one was severely dealt with by her son.

MIL is very close to her own MIL. She lets her kiss her face (despite MIL not even liking to hug her son) They hang out together at least twice a week. Her MIL babies her, constantly makes her food, buys her gifts, helps with MILs weird sleep issues when SFIL travels, and generally treats her better than most people treat their own adult kids. She also treats MIL completely equal to SFIL in terms of gifts, acknowledging birthdays, and has a shrine of pictures of her. I am aware that that isn't the typical MIL DIL relationship, but this woman was MILs nanny and MIL's dad's affair partner for years and pretty much raised MIL.

I got really annoyed the other day, because MIL didn't tell me the peloton was soaking wet when she knew I was going to use it (super briefly staying there waiting for our next apartment to be ready), so I got my ass wet. MIL then said she didn't have to tell me and didn't feel like talking. Not even five minutes later, MIL wanted part of a muffin that her husband's mom was eating and demanded that she put it in her mouth. She actually did and I turned to MIL and asked if she saw the hypocrisy. MIL rolled her eyes, and I said she clearly has a double standard and she should treat me how her MIL treats her. I was kind of kidding, but just trying to get a point across. 

MIL said I'm gross and she doesn't have to love anyone, and said I'm creepy and why do I want her to touch me (lol, I don't) MIL then took a deep breath and started poking jabbing at me, and I was like WTF and MIL said she is treating me like her MIL treats her ""get used to it, bitch"" I guess she tickles her because MIL is so hard to wake up, but still eww. MIL stormed off and her husband said I really offended her and i'm not respecting her ""rights"" I literally just wanted to prove that she is a huge hypocrite.",4.0
94,t3_rvwdw3,AITA for bringing up my friend's ex to make a point?,"I have a great job in a very competitive industry and my husband is a SAHP and a painter. He used to work as a server before we got married.  I make enough money to provide us a great standard of living and he is an amazing husband and we have a wonderful partnership that works. 

I was cathing up with my friend Amy who had visited our city for work. She kept bringing up my husband career and insulting it and she joked that he is a trophy husband and she kept trying to trash him. I don't know why but she kept asking about him and how he fit into my family; Everyone in family loves him but I think she was trying it make me feel like that I settled for him. 

I was fed up with her and I asked her if she was still with her ex boyfriend. I knew that they had broken up recently and  She had turned down an amazing career opportunity which would have transformed her career. I had made a similar move to a similar company but she hadn't been able to do it because her ex boyfriend didn't want to move to our city and she really regretted that decision. It really ruined the conversation she withdrew and I knew it was a really sensitive topic. 

I was catching up with Amy's best friend and she told me Amy had been very upset when I had brought up the ex boyfriend and she had broken down crying when she talked about it later.  Amy felt that it was very cruel and her friend told me that I shouldn't have brought up her ex when I knew turning down that job really cost her and I knew it fucked her career for a while and I feel like I overreacted and I should have handled this with grace rather than be passive aggressive about it.",21.0
95,t3_rvw85v,AITA for not telling my bf that my mom was sleeping over?,"My long term boyfriend (M23) of 4 years and I (F20) recently moved into a new apartment together. We split everything 50/50.

3 weeks into moving in, my mother (who lives 45 minutes away) mentioned she was in the area and asked if she could come see me and our new home. Of course, I invited her to come hang out and have dinner. I told my bf and he said he was fine with it. However, as the time grew closer for her to come, he started acting weirdly moody and acting as if her coming was an inconvenience all of a sudden. Mind you, my bf and mother have an amazing relationship and she had even let him live with us beforehand for about a year (expense free).

My mother arrived and my bf remained in the bedroom, playing video games instead of greeting her. I gave her a short tour of the apartment and he remained in the room the entire time, only speaking when she asked him if he was okay. Every time she’d ask him something, he’d mumble and stay focused on the game. I started to get annoyed because I found it incredibly rude.

Anyways, she and I decided to run to the store to get some ingredients for dinner. While at the store, my mother mentions that her recent trip to the eye doctor yielded that she has night blindness. It was getting dark already so I insisted she spend the night and leave in the morning, as I didn’t want her driving 45 minutes in the dark. We return and my bf is still hiding away so I try to lighten the mood and ask him to help me cook and I would prepare us some drinks. He agrees and seems in a better mood… until he sees my mother blowing up the air mattress. Immediately, he gets cold again. By now, my mother is starting to sense something is wrong.

Once dinner is finished, my bf makes his plate and goes back into the bedroom, leaving my mother and I to eat. At this point, I am baffled because his entire demeanor had been rude and cold all evening. I go to check on him after my mother and I finish, and he claims he’s fine but that he was bothered I didn’t mention that she was sleeping over. I apologized for not mentioning it, but that I thought it wouldn’t be an issue as she was only spending one night, and I didn’t want her driving home in the dark with her poor eyesight.

Even after explaining this, he still continued to say how it was his day off and he wasn’t going to “kumbaya” with my mother. Mind you, she was more so there to visit me, not him.

I was shocked by his behavior and what he was saying and angrily left the room. My mother, now worried, asked me if everything was okay. I assured her and then she said “I can leave if I’m inconveniencing you guys”. 

This broke me, I was absolutely mortified. Not only is she my guest, but she’s my mother.

To my dismay, she ended up leaving and driving home in the dark. My bf maintains that we “misinterpreted” things and that he’s not to blame for anything.

My thing is, actions speak louder than words and he didn’t apologize to either of us for ruining the evening. But I dunno… AITA?",26.0
96,t3_rvw3es,AITA for refusing to talk to my mum after comments she made about sexual harrassment?," I (25F) went on a work night out about 6 months ago which was a leaving do for one of my colleagues. It ended up being just me and a few of us, maybe 8 or 9.

On the night out one dude (late 30s) gets way too drunk and shouted something very sexual and inappropriate to me across the table, probably thinking he'd get a laugh from the guys. I brushed it off, but the other guys seemed too stunned to do anything. Other people in the bar were heard it and were looking over at our table, all very awkward and uncomfortable and I end up making excuses and leave. 

One of the guys apologised to me the next day for not saying anything at the time, but the one who got too drunk and said the horrible thing never did. I refuse to work with him as it made me very uncomfortable and don't feel safe alone with him. When a manager found out not long after they said I should raise it as it happened on a work night out and previous issues like this have happened in the office so they take it very seriously. The manager sent me the guidance for a formal complaint to review, as they cannot do anything unless I make the complaint.

I was unsure and having never dealt with this stuff so I ask my mum for advice, send her the documents then she calls me to talk about it as I live a long way from my family. Her response was I shouldn't raise a complaint as it was my fault, I was asking for it and that if I was my sister she would support her making a complaint, but she doesn't think I'm capable or resilient enough to get through the process so I shouldn't. 

I flip out on her, not over her saying I deserved it but more the fact she compared me to my sister and hang up the phone to calm down. I went through with the complaint anyway and my friends all supported me in it and the issue was sorted. 

However, I may be the AH as I pretty much went no contact with her since the call. She's sent several texts, packages and cards which I didn't acknowledge, I missed my sisters birthday (but sent her a present) and didn't go home for Christmas. I sent them Christmas presents in the post which my mum acknowledged by text and said she wasn't going to send mine up, but next day flowers and chocolates arrive at mine, which I thank her for in a short text.

A final Christmas card arrived a few days later from her saying she misses me. But the thing is I don't want presents or cards or flowers from her, I just want her to say sorry for what she said. I'd say it's very obvious why I cut all contact (and even told my sister as much when she asked why I wasn't going to come see her for her birthday) so I can't see why she won't apologise. Part of the reason I don't want to just accept her back is she's made comments in the past which I just let go, like saying I'm hard work, difficult to love, etc.

I still talk to the rest of my family over text infrequently, but they've made no real comment either way on what happened which makes me feel like the disapprove of the way I'm treating her.

Andrea has a habit of making fun of peoples looks, usually celebrities but sometimes people in real life. She will call them fat, ugly, low class looking etc.  In fact the other day I did actually snap at her because she showed me this picture of this couple and she said “ he must be in it for the money” when referring to the guy. Implying that the girl was ugly when she really wasn’t, and I told her only insecure people make comments like hers, she went silent.

Anyways today she starts talking and says, oh I have to tell you something about Emma (some random family friend) and I said okay sure. Then she was like nevermind you will get mad at me if I say it. Here’s where I might be TA. Jokingly I said “ Are you gonna say she’s fat or something”. Then Andrea was in shock and she was like “yeah how did you know?” I didn’t but I replied with “Because that’s the type of person you are”.


She got super upset at me and demanded and apology. I told her that maybe she should change the way she acts so me and other people don’t get that impression out of her. She also called me a hypocrite because I said this child in some tv show was being annoying.

98,t3_rvvnar,AITA FOR CALLING MY BROTHER SELFISH AND IRRESPONSIBLE?,"So this just happened and I'm still pretty pissed but I wanna know if I'm wrong. 

I 21f and my brother 25 male both live with our parents due to financial issues. My mother had received an electric scooter for her birthday from our father. But she does not use it. My brother takes it whenever he wants and because he uses it more often. He started waiting to leave for his work at the last minute. Maybe 5-10 minutes before his shift starts he'll leave the house. I don't usually have an issue with this. 

Here's the issue: I started therapy about 2 months ago for mental health. I talked with my mom about it and she agreed that I could use the scooter to get back and forth from therapy. My brother said he was alright with it. But has constantly made it an issue with me taking the scooter to therapy. He went has far saying I stole his keys and he couldn't get to work until I came back. (I didn't he just wanted to scooter). He makes demands that if I take it I should drop it off at his job so he doesn't have to walk home (its literally out of my way I would pass the house if I did) etc

Today he was called into work. I was half asleep and I heard I'm getting ready I thought he was off but I paid no mind to him. Until I opened my eyes and saw him near the scooter. I asked him what he was doing and reminded it that it was Tuesday and I needed it for therapy. (Note on the scooter I usually get there 30 minutes early for safety/I don't want to be late) he said that they called him in and asked if I knew what time he had to be work. Obviously I didnt so I said no. He replied exactly and that he waited last minute to leave so he could take the scooter and and he wouldn't be late just so I could go to therapy. I started crying cause I'm very emotional and I just started waking up and I called him selfish and irresponsible for always pulling this behavior when it isn't even his scooter. He doesn't even ask our mom to use it anymore. 

I told my mom about it and she just sighed and said yeah but I had to figure it out because I knew my brother. Almost like she didn't really care.

99,t3_rvvfv1,AITA for backing out of my dad's wedding because of a joke he made?,"Growing up it was pretty clear that my parents weren't happy. They have nothing in common and he always seemed miserable when he was home. He lived and breathed his job (neurosurgeon) He was an ok dad, pretty bad husband, and when I was a senior in high school he left my mom for his affair partner ""Abby"" who was also a surgeon at the hospital.

My mom was humiliated and it took her a long time to heal emotionally. My brother and I didn't talk to my dad for about a year and slowly have resumed contact. He proposed to Abby nine months ago, and while I saw it coming, it still felt like a blow and I was upfront about I don't know if I want to go to the wedding or not.

He's been with Abby for almost three years and he acts like a totally different person. He is like a giddy teen and it's really weird to watch. Objectively I get that she is much better for him. He had nothing in common with my mom, and he needed someone who was more ""driven and passionate"" Also my mom hated all of his hobbies (camping, hiking, beach) because she didn't want to get dirty, and they just weren't compatible. Abby is a bit more of a tomboy and they do everything together. He's really happy and I guess I'm happy for him.

I recently visited them and agreed to go to the wedding. My dad and I had a private talk and I said I will never fully forgive him for cheating, but I can see that he is really happy. He said he wishes the best for my mom, he didn't understand how important compatibility was when he was young, and then he laughed and said and if they didn't want him to cheat he wouldn't have a bed at work.

This pissed me off, because from other jokes I've heard (from a mutual friend, not him) The two of them were fucking around at work, hopefully not in the hospital, but it just reminded me of my mom being the last to know, and how he always couldn't wait to go to work. I snapped at him that he is such an asshole, can never resist the urge to make dumb jokes (he teased way too much when I was a teen and it effected our relationship) and said I wasn't going to the wedding.

I stormed off and he just texted me sorry and nothing else. abby sent me a long message about how it was a pretty tame joke and just his personality and I'm being too sensitive. she asked me to reconsider. The wedding is the end of January, so I don't have much time to decide .",1550.0
100,t3_rvvbpt,AITA for calling my grandparents names over weight shaming,"A little bit of refrence, I come from a very strict Asian household. So respecting your elders is taken very seriously and talking back, whether you are right or wrong might land you in a lot of trouble. Also body shaming is not as big of a deal in my family as it is here in the states. This is just so you could understand the perspective of my family better

My (17F) grandparents came over to visit me and my parents for a month and to spend time with the family over Christmas. Don't get me wrong but from what I've seen my grandparents can be extremely toxic at times, I've seen them talk shit about their own daughter and their son and age shaming their granddaughters and they can be extremely homophobic and sexist too. I love spending time with them but when they start talking stuff like that I just walk out of the room to prevent arguments.

Also, I'm graduating soon and in between studying and and looking into colleges, I barely get any time throughout the day. Everytime I do have free time I like to sit in their room and spend some time with them. But for the past 2 weeks or so, every time they tend to make jokes about my studies and my weight, except I've mentioned it countless time to my mother and my grandparents that I'm extremely sensitive about my weight and my studies and to please refrain from commenting on it.
(For reference I used to be an overweight kid and have always been ridiculed for my weight and I managed to lose a lot of it into my mid teens but during the beginning of the pandemic I became extremely sensitive about my weight and was anorexic and managed to become underweight. Since then I've tried to improve my eating habits which has led to weight gain, and please note they are aware of all of this, they told me to just stop ""dieting"")

After about 2 weeks of just staying calm or just leaving the room after being hurt, I finally snapped. I had a full blown meltdown and yelled at them for constantly weight shaming me when and referred to them as toxic and sexists.
This was on the 1st of january, I ended up crying for hours in my room, my parents came up to check on me. My dad sympathized with the issue but told me to ignore what they say at times, while my mom was extremely angry with me for embarrassing her in from of my grandparents. I argued back saying that whenever I tried interacting with them they would constantly make jokes about my weight. The next morning too, my mom told me to knock it off because I was being butthurt over a joke and my dad even said that I was overreacting and the crying wasn't necessary.
I have since then refused to speak to them or to my mom.
It should also be noted, that I was really loud during the fight and I did say some disrespectful things to them. I feel like I messed up with that meltdown. AITA?",59.0

My best friend (27F) Brittany and I (27F) have been best friends since we were kindergarten. At the end of elementary school Brittany moved away but we always remained close. We would facetime and Skype one another constantly so even though she wasn't there it was like she was. We come from different religious background though. I was raised Jewish and she was raised ""Christian"". Her family maybe went to church once a month if that so I'm not sure how ""christian"" she is. Even to this day. 

This is relevant to what happened as it was about a month when it started I guess? End of November to the  beginning of December was Hanukkah. Brittany did not give me any gifts or presents during.this time but she did wish me a happy Hanukkah. I never responded as she isn't Jewish and doesn't understand the meaning behind it so it felt empty. Fast forward to Christmas I know it's Jesus birth and Christmas tend to celebrate. Since she is not really Christian I never wished her a merry Christmas. I thought that was it. 

We were at a small new years gathering (all vaccinated) and Brittany was giving me a cold shoulder and a weird vibe. She practically ignored me all evening except for the occasional glance I saw. After everyone celebrated the new year and people were cleaning to leave I asked Brittany why she had such a stank on her face. She claimed she didn't feel valued as a friend and through my lack of response and no wishes meant I didn't care. I do care but it's not like she understands. I think this is where I am an ass. I told her to stop being sensitive and a pre Madonna if she gets that hurt over not receiving a text she would be terribly disappointed in life. We are all adults with our own lives. 

After the event I thought it would be over but instead I got a text message from Brittany claiming I hurt her feelings again by my lack of care and being callus. She asked for space from being my friend. I simply asked when she became a snowflake and when did not wishing someone a merry Christmas from someone who doesn't celebrate Christmas make them an ass. Now I have had a bunch of our friends texting me saying I was really rude and questioning my character. I don't think I'm an ass because she isn't Jewish and not really Christian either.

104,t3_rvuut9,WIBTA if I turned on the lights after my roommate's alarm?,"I (19F) am living in a dorm with this girl (23F) and we don't get along. She's wakes up after noon and I try to go to sleep before midnight and wake up at 7-9. Things are tense between us in general, where I feel like she could be more considerate. When she's sleeping and I have to get up, I walk slowly, close the doors slowly too, but when I'm trying to fall asleep around 11pm, she walks like a tank, closes the drawers forcefully. We live in the same room, her bed is next to mine, so it is quite... cramped.

The other problem is that she has troubles waking up in the morning, she has told me that if her mom wouldn't pull the sheet off of her before school and wake her up, she would just miss the classes all together. She has also told me she has a deficiency, I think its a vitamin B or something with low blood. Because of this she can sleep for many hours and has harder time waking up, but most of the times if she has classes at 9, like me, she sets her alarm around 7:30 and gets up instantly, which is about the time I set mine, which is fine, but the problem is with exam days.

On the days she has a bigger test or an exam, she sets the alarm at 5:40 am, then snoozes it many times until she finally gets up. The first time she snoozed until 8 am, then instantly got up, consumed a cup of coffee and barely made it where ever she had to be that day. But that doesn't change the fact, that she woke me up at such an early time and with the snoozes every few min kept me from falling asleep again.

Today she also woke me up at 5:40 and kept snoozing and sleeping in her bed. I was pissed at this point, I count the days I still have to live with her. At the time I texted my mom, she wakes up early to work, so she told me to get up and turn on the lights, since she wants to wake up so early (one time at 11pm she turned on the bright ceiling lights on me with no warning too). Around 6:20 I got up and turned on the ceiling light. She instantly shot up and went to the kitchen. For the rest of the day things seem tense, she isn't talking to me and even left the ceiling light on for me, as if revenging me, since I don't like using is and I rather use my table lamp, since the light is softer.

I have a feeling, since this month is our exam month, she'll set the alarms and keep snoozing again, my head still hurts from not sleeping enough today, so next time she wakes me up, I kinda want to get up instantly and turn on the ceiling lights, as if to get ready for the day and not wait untill 6:20 or so like today.

Answers to a few questions - 

the picture was not inappropriate, just a funny face! My sister was the one making the funny face, and she likes the pic. everyone else looks normal. It isn’t getting posted anywhere. 

I didn’t just straight up say “no” (I lied about planning to delete it) because saying “no” to my mom usually ends in an argument. 

Yes, my mom is like this all the time. Yes, it’s exhausting. It’s also why I came here to double-check if maybe this time she was right, and I should *listen* and not *defend* myself like I usually would. She’s still not exactly talking to me, so who knows, I may not have to do either lol. 


OG post:

I (20F) went on vacation with my parents and sister and obviously we took pictures. While looking at them, we noticed my sister (23F) looked a little funny in one of them, and all laughed (sister included). But then, we happened to scroll by it again and my mom started telling me to delete the picture because it was bad. And I was already scrolling past it so I said I’d do it after we finished looking at pictures (I didn’t really want to delete it or plan on deleting it - I thought she might forget). 

My mom started getting annoyed and said “you won’t listen to me? Fine I won’t look at the pictures.” So I said “okay” and kept scrolling through them with my sister. I would have deleted it if my sister told me to (because she was the one that looked a bit funny) but she also thought it was a hilarious picture. We kept scrolling and my mom left to go to the bathroom, and my sister told me to save the picture in my “hidden” files so my mom would think I deleted it. I told my mom I deleted it, but she said it didn’t matter anymore because I didn’t do it when she asked and I didn’t help her gain that “bit of trust” because I want to do everything my way (a bit of paraphrasing here) 

My problem was that my sister was the one that looked funny in the picture - if she asked me to delete it I would have. My mom looked good, and wanted me to delete it on behalf of my sister that DIDNT CARE . But at the end of the day, my mom was asking me to delete a picture (maybe she had a problem with the way she looked aswell, but she could have told me if she didn’t like the way she looked) and I didn’t. Now she’s upset and kind of ignoring me.

106,t3_rvuprg,AITA for telling my boyfriend and his family that I didn't think Spider-Man: No Way Home was good?,"Ok, so, me (f19) and my boyfriend (m20) have lots in common when it comes to things like food, gaming, music taste, etc. but we tend to disagree about movies a bit. Just because we have different preferences, but this seems to really bother him sometimes and he can go off on long rants. So, I’ve learnt to just kind of agree when he says something is good, because why cause a drama about it? 

But I made the mistake of not doing that when we and his family went out to see the new Spider-Man film. Now, I have huge nostalgia for Tobey’s Spider-Man, and I love those films, so it’s not like I’m anti-Marvel or hero films, but I didn’t enjoy this one.

We leave the cinema and he’s going on about how great it was, how it lived up to his expectations, and he called it a cinematic masterpiece. He was clearly so excited, and I love it when he’s in that mood, like – when he’s happy like that, everything is so good between us. So, after my boyfriend is done talking, his mother asked me if I liked it, so I just smiled and nodded. But my boyfriend wasn’t satisfied with the answer and was like, ‘Is that it?’

I just shrugged because I hate lying but I know I don’t want to annoy him, so I didn’t really know what to do, but he caught the look on my face and said, ‘Seriously? You didn’t like it?’

And his good mood was soured like that, and he asked why. So, I just explained that I didn’t really like the plot, the writing felt a little off, but that it’s a Marvel film so I wasn’t expecting a masterpiece. That got him pissed, cause that’s what he called the movie.

Anyway, he said I undermined him and made him look stupid? We got into a fight when we got home and he’s accusing me of always doing this, of intentionally trying to make him look stupid and talking down to his preferences like I’m a ‘film critic snob b\*tch.’ This really hurt my feelings, because I literally just didn’t like the movie. Am I being an asshole without knowing? I told him to just respect that not everyone has the same views as him but apparently that means I'm invalidating his feelings.

Dad passed away recently leaving the bulk of his estate to a trust that lists myself and my half-bro as beneficiaries. His will is clear, the bulk of the estate goes to the trust, which I manage. Dad never married my bro’s mom and had been broken up for 12 years, but he continued to support her. He left her some of his 401k and life insurance (approx $200k), but everything else, including two homes, one of which she lived in, go to the trust. The biggest asset is a payout from his pension. He worked for thecompany for over 45 years so it is sizeable. The terms of his pension plan state if he was not legally married (he was single), the payout goes to his estate and, per his will, anything paid to the estate rolls into the trust. My bro’s mom feels she should be entitled to a portion of the pension for her years spent raising his kid. She is in her early 60s with little income so I don’t think her desire is unreasonable but she made a choice to not protect herself all those years and my dad was very clear in his wishes, knowing the bulk of his money would go to his kids. I am trying to work out an arrangement where my brother can retain ownership of a house and she live in it. Though he is 18+, bro is still young and naive and won’t have control of his $$ for years.

108,t3_rvukly,WIBTA for pretending to be my brother so our father doesn't get offended?,"We're Spanish so rather than Christmas, we tend to exchange presents on January 6th.

My father (54M) has always been pretty unfaif and refuses to gift us anything on birthdays, Christmas, etc... I genuinely cannot remember the last time he bought something for us. However, he gets incredibly angry if we don't get him stuff in his birthday, Father's Day, etc...

This year and after buying my father's gift, my brother (16M) suddenly decided he wasn't giving it to him. I can't really blame him, since I hate giving him any present myself but I end up doing it because I hate the tension and arguments our father starts otherwise. I'm the kind of person that can't stand family arguments or yelling at all.

I talked with my brother about it and said I'd gift our father something else so he'd assume my brother was the gifter, pretty much pretending to be him. My brother said he doesn't care, but he isn't spending any money on our father no matter what.

I've thought about it for a while, and while this plan has several good points (calm Christmas, no arguments, everyone happy) it also pisses me off somehow, both because the extra spending and because in the end I'm ""enabling"" (not sure if this is the most appropriate word choice) some shitty behavior, possibly setting up a bad precedent.

109,t3_rvuinh,AITA for not wanting to dance with my family at my quinceañera?,"I (14) am Mexican and I'm about to turn 15 and my family has been planning my quinceañera. Generally in quinceañeras one of the traditions we have is a dance with the escort and the dad. But in some cases, apart from the dad, you dance with your grandpa, and some uncles and cousins and that's what my family wants to do. My family has been waiting for this moment, especially my grandpa (67m) who's always asking me to dance but I always say no. I have anxiety and I really hate doing things like dancing and singing in public, and I feel like I'm being judged 
 and my problem isn't even being heard or seen, it's being able to see people while doing it, like I don't if they're watching, as long as I'm not watching them watching me, since at least my mind won't make me see them judging me even if they're not. But obviously I'm not gonna ask everyone at the party to go out while we dance.
I told my family I didn't want to dance but now they're telling me that I'm ruining the mood and putting sad faces and I'm starting to feel bad.

110,t3_rvuio1,AITA for telling my cousin my salary when he asked?,"For my (24F) entire life, I've never had much money, so for Christmas I would always get my family cheap or diy presents. This year, I have been at my job for about a year (software engineer) and I could actually afford some nice things for people so I spent a decent amount of money on my immediate family. 

My immediate family exchanged presents on Christmas eve this year (Dad, Mom, lil Bro &amp; me).  I bought my brother (19M) a nice alienware gaming laptop because the laptop that he was using for school was my old one (that I used all through school) and was in bad shape. He is a comp sci major, just like I was, and I knew how much he needed something that was going to last.  Plus he can get some stress relief by playing games on it. 

Christmas day, we went to my grandparents house and my brother was telling my Uncle and my cousins about the laptop at dinner. My cousin (22M) looked up the laptop on his phone and saw how much it was and told everyone. My uncle said that it was nice of my parents to buy my brother such a nice laptop, and my dad chimed in and said that -myname- bought it.

My cousin asked how I could afford to give such a nice present and asked how much money I make.  I told him a ball park number and my Aunt said that I shouldn't be making that much money just to play on the computer all day.  I got defensive and said that I worked really hard to get my job and I deserve it.

That night my uncle called my dad and said that I was being inappropriate at dinner and shouldn't be ""flashing money around"" when I know that my cousin is unemployed and having a hard time. 

Am I the asshole for answering the question? I probably should have made a joke about it, but he came off as serious like he may have wanted to pursue a software engineer career so that's why I told him.",2640.0
111,t3_rvuhi9,AITA for not inviting my aunt to my birthday celebration,"   Every year on my birthday my mom, father and I travel to my grandpas house to spend the day with family. There’s usually only 9 of us including my father, mom, aunt, two cousins, my uncles, grandpa, and I. We don’t really celebrate on that day but we usually just hang around and eat food and talk.
   Last year on my 18th birthday my aunt decided to not show up. She only sent me a happy birthday text at 8am then ignored me the rest of the day. I sent her a text mentioning that I was annoyed that she decided to spend time with her new boyfriend instead of family for one day. Our family is busy with work and lives far away from each other so we don’t get to see each other a lot. Everyone in my family was pissed at her for not only showing up but for the the stuff she’s been doing for the last year.
   The stuff she’s been doing for the past year is stealing 1000$+ from family, neglecting her two kids (15 and 12) by leaving all day and night and not stocking kitchen up with food  since she doesn’t have the money because she refuses to work “because all the jobs require a Covid vaccination” when I have come across many jobs that’s don’t, always treating her kids like shit and yelling at them for the smallest things like having a messy room that she caused by going through their stuff, taking advantage of family members because she knows that we will do it for her two kids, taking illegal drugs in front of her kids such as meth, constantly being caught in a lie, and putting so much stress on her kids that they repeatedly break down when they spend time with us without her. Plus so much more. Her daughter (12) pays for her own stuff like clothing and food because she can’t get her mom to pay for it and is constantly giving her money because she needs it.
Later near her birthday she decided to spend a day with us and mention to me that her birthday is coming up and asking what we will do and what I’m getting her. Not even mentioning or apologizing for my birthday. And that boyfriend she ditched out on our family for is a convicted felon, can no longer drive due to the amount of DUIs he has had and within the last 13 years he was constantly in jail and no longer can see his two young kids. 
   My group of 9 family is very close but my aunt ruined so many things at this point we are having trouble trying to help her and our relationship.
I don’t care about my birthday and prefer not to celebrate it, I just want to hang out with family and for my 19th birthday we are still going to my grandpas house like every year but I’m thinking about telling my aunt she is not invited but my two cousins are. I don’t want to be hurt again by her and I don’t want fights to happen because of her if she does show up.    Am I they asshole for not wanting to invite her? So far my family is fine with it but I feel as if I’m being rude. 
  Before I end we are taking care and I’m always their for my cousins because they are like my brother and sister to me even though my aunt isn’t being the best mom currently.",9.0
112,t3_rvucno,AITA for putting my dog in the bathroom,"My gf and I got a little dog recently. My gf has stated she does not want the dog in her bed at night when we stay at her place. So the dog stays in the crate. Last night, the dog would not stop whining and whimpering. It was constant for literally hours. He would not stop. I must have gotten up 30 times in the night to try to get him to calm down. He was fed and did not need to use the bathroom. After maybe 4 hours or this I got up and moved the crate into the bathroom and closed the door. The crate is normally in the bedroom with us but I needed to put some distance between me and the dog at this point as I wasn't getting sleep. 

This morning my gf is seemingly very upset that I put the dog in the bathroom.

113,t3_rvuatt,AITA For Donating Money In My Boyfriend's Name For Christmas?,"My (m18) family has a lot of money, but we live very average. We have a two story house with just enough bedrooms for everyone, an art studio in our garage, and a nice entertainment center in our basement. We only go on one vacation a year and it's to visit my parents' families back in France (we live in the US) during summer. My boyfriend's (m18) family does not have enough money to feed everyone or have power half the time.

On birthdays and Christmas time, because my parents have always told my sister and I that we have everything we need so instead of gift giving, we do charity. Sometimes we run meal stands for the homeless people, we donate lots of money and food to areas, ect.

My boyfriend and I have been friends for about two years but this was our first christmas as a couple. He's always known the charity thing and he's always thought it was a great thing. For Christmas, he got me some rings and earrings off Amazon. I gave him a printed out screenshot of the email I got for donating money to a local animal shelter in his name.

He made a face looking at the paper but it was in front of my family so he smiled and said thank you, kissed my cheek, and moved on. I could tell it bothered him, though, so I brought it up a few days later and he told me it didn't have any thought or care to it. I thought it did have a lot of care. He volunteers for animal shelters sometimes and loves animals to death. He constantly talks about adopting a dog when he has his own place.

I was honestly really surprised he was so upset about this as a gift. It's been days now and his texts are dry and usually only a word or two. He ""didn't feel up for it"" when I asked if we were spending New Years together. I'm worried now I may have made the wrong call. Was it really that insensitive of a gift? How can I make up for it?

Edit: A lot of commenters are saying I should have helped him with the money instead of giving it to charity. My family already helps him all the time. We give him food money for his sister and him all the time. When we found out he sleeps outside a lot, we got rid of our couch in the basement and replaced it with a pull-out so he would always have a place to sleep. I thought getting him something like a gift card for groceries or whatever would be more rude than anything else.

My intention with this as a gift was to show he's apart of the family now, seeing as it is a family tradition. He never expressed any desire for a material gift (or that he was getting me anything) so I assumed he knew/didn't have a preference for a gift. Had he asked, I would have gotten a different gift. I thought it was thoughtful, as it's something important to him while I would have given it to a different organization had it been in my name. (Not that I don't think shelters are important, I'm just trying to get across that I was thinking of him when I picked where to put the money.)

Edit 2: I feel really horrible. I'm taking a lot of comments to heart and I understand now how tone deaf it was of me. I only had positive intentions behind the gift, I never meant to hurt him :( I've been giving him space the last couple days but I'm going to reach out later today and apologize for what I did. Thank you everyone for opening my eyes to my behavior :(

Also, I am going to get him new gifts. It'll come out of my savings but it'll be worth it. I'm not sure what would make some good gifts, though, I've never given/received ""normal"" Christmas presents before. Please drop some suggestions, if you have any!! He really like video games, so I'm considering a PS5 if I can get my hands on one. Maybe a new TV? His is so old, it isn't even a ""SmartTV"". I'm going to take us out to dinner. I'm really worried about spending too much on the gift and just making him further uncomfortable with the use of money. I don't want to make him anymore uncomfortable. He works in a factory that is really hard on him, so I am also considering a massage/spa day together??",11.0
114,t3_rvtu8p,AITA for getting mad at my concerned husband when he spoke rudely to me,"So I have a chronic problem of headaches due to my temperature dropping into the low 96/high 95 degree area. This morning, when I woke with a headache, I thought it might be a migraine, which causes me to be sick to my stomach and incapacitated. So I was sure to eat before the nausea set in and took some medicine. 

My husband felt my head for my temperature, and said I was cold. My automatic response was ""you're warm."" Now I understand it is hard to inflict tone through text, but in my mind, I responded in my normal speaking voice.

Hubby responded ""saying why do you say that? It's bull-poop."" And he got upset. 

I got angry. In my mind, we were just having a normal conversation, but he decided to be rude to me. Instead of arguing, I kept getting ready for work.

After I got out, he asked, gently, how I was feeling. I said I still had a headache. He asked to feel my head again, and I said no, and that I was angry. His explanation was that he felt my response was sarcastic as if I don't belive him. I tried to explain that no, I wasn't and it was just my response, but I do t deserve to be spoken to that way. We argued that he both feel bad at the others response, but I don't think my first response was rude.

Just some extra info, my husband does have minor ASD, which comes out to him not understanding sarcasm. And he is very touchy when upset. Normally, I try to be accommodating, but this morning, I just couldn't let it go and told him it hurt me when he spoke rudly. 

So reddit, am I the A-hole for getting angry at him? I mean, he could have said simply that what I said upset him and I could have explained it was not a sarcastic comment, but a simple response. I would have apologized for making him feel that way and things would have been fine.",1.0

She wanted dad to hook it up to her computer so she can control and monitor what i do on my own computer, bought with MY money at any time.

116,t3_rvtdu0,WIBTA for partially charging my roommate for a situation that’s my fault?,"So yesterday my (24f) roommate A got locked out of our apartment when arriving back from travel because the key in the lockbox had been taken out by my sister, who stayed in the empty apartment for a few days while we were all gone.

The key in the lockbox belonged to roommate B, who I had communicated with about taking the key out of the lockbox since they were hers. I didn’t know A was reliant on those same keys to get back in as I assumed hers were on her, and didn’t know when she was planning on getting back. So A had no idea my sister was staying at the apartment. 

So at 11pm yesterday A couldn’t get in, and my sister was deep asleep and slept through all the knocking and intercom buzzing. I was woken up at 4am to this situation (I am traveling) and panicked on A’s behalf and kept calling my sister. I felt so bad so in that moment I claimed I would cover whatever if my sister didn’t pick up and needed to go to a hotel. 

I suggested a hotel (though she also has friends in the city) but she decided to go with a locksmith because she hadn’t slept for 24 hrs and didn’t want to move. This whole ordeal took 3 hours from start to finish and eventually the locksmith replaced the whole lock and now we all need new keys. This cost $320.

I had no idea how much this would cost and now I feel like asking her to chip in since this wasn’t technically her only option and it feels like a lot. But at the same time I told her I’d cover costs (albeit in panic mode on 3 hrs of sleep) and the whole situation is a result of bad communication on my part (as well as roommate B who didn’t tell me A would need those keys). So would I be the asshole if I had her pay some of it or should I just cut my losses?

Five hours before the flight, my wife found out she had a miscarriage. She was rushed to the hospital, but I was now stuck between staying with her and visiting my terribly sick mother.

We bonded over the fact that we are both mentally fucked up. But it really does seem like I'm always there for him and he's never there for me.

Granted I'm not a very open person, but he's really the one person I'll open up to. He's not very open either, but a hella a lot more than me.

To the conflict:

Recently, I fell in a bad place. I was very stressed and depressed. I wanted to delete something I worked very hard on during this time (I ended up convincing myself to delete it)

I went to him saying something like: ""I can't do this anymore. I fucking hate it."" Things like that.

He either didn't open it or left me on read. I don't think anything of it, because he could have not had his phone on him. 

He then responded an hour later and said ""Why""

I told him why and how I was feeling. But again I got no response.

Then when he did finally respond to me (about an hour later), he completely ignored the fact that I was in this mental drop and started talking about how his relationship is going and then about a cute text he just got from his boyfriend.

I was in shock. I couldn't believe that he had just disregarded all my feelings and made it about himself…

The last thing I said was ""This is why I don't open up because anyone fucking cares I guess. Thanks for your help❤""

Then I blocked his messages from coming through.

Like 2 days later, I unblocked his messages and had a bunch of messages come in. He apparently had gone into a down the day after I blocked his messages. A bad one.

I texted him if he was ok. And he went off on me.

I'm not going to repeat things here, but the ending ones were hurting, because he said I was never there for him and I'm rude. Things like that.

This is probably the second time I wasn't there for him when he needed me. I usually drop everything and come to make him feel better, but I'm rude because I miss this one after he didn't even make an attempt to help me and just ignored my feelings?

But he really thinks I'm TA because of this and our mutual friend seems to think so too.

119,t3_rvt9oo,AITA for being petty about parking?,"The parking situation at my flat recently became annoying! There are four shared spaces and some of us have also a garage. The man upstairs (TMU) had always his place on the side of my garage on space one and I had my car next to him on space two while hubby used the garage. We all have a understanding about who ‘owns’ the spaces, and we got told when moving in where NOT  to park. So not on the third or fourth space cause someone else ‘owns’ them. Then winter hit and TMU’s cousin started clearing snow outside. Apparantly we missed one time and they called the landlord on us, saying we must look out for when the snow clearer comes cause there is no way of letting us know. So since we questioned this, as he is the cousin of TMU they kept asking us to move our car. so we moved my car to next to our front door to ease his snow clearing. Who has the time to sit and watch for the snow clearer all day? I have kids to run after and stuff to do, and sometimes I do venture outside my home. We agreed that ‘my’ space would be empty. 

Then TMU’s gf put her car in my space, the minute I moved my car, suddenly she has my space and have stood there for over a week. She even missed one snow clearing! But no one said anything! I asked her to move her car and she refused, they even called our landlord which told us we did not own the space, its actually guest parking and everyone has equal right to those spaces. 


So yesterday they switched places, she on TMU’s space and TMU on my space. Or what we all have thought to understand was our spaces. 

So I put my car in his space now where his gf had her car wheb she left this norning, even tho there is room at the front door. I did this because of equal right to parking and because no one owns the spaces.

120,t3_rvt1z4,AITA for ruining my family's dinner at a restaurant?,"My sister has a wonderful family, they have 5 kids. All generally well-behaved. I've gone out to dinner with them to restaurants every so often. As soon as the kids hit 3 or 4 years old, they're neat and clean and don't make much of a mess. 2 years or under, and they get food all over the restaurant floor. 

I would call the amount of food on the floor a copious amount of food, but not a comically large or ridiculous amount of food. Again, I'll stress this: the kids are well-behaved. They're not throwing food or spitting food or intentionally dropping food on the floor. Babies and toddlers just can't keep it all in their mouth, or their bib, or themselves, and it ends up on the floor. I still look at the amount and feel uncomfortable even though they're not my kids. These messes have happened at chain restaurants like Olive Garden, ""dive"" restaurants that are obviously family owned, and more upscale restaurants where kids maybe shouldn't go for other reasons.

I finally called my sister out on it during dinner at a nicer restaurant. The restaurant had carpet, and the amount of food on the floor had almost gotten to the ""comically large"" size. We had a party of about a half-dozen adults, and not other person thought these kinds of messes were abnormal. *""This happens all the time; the restaurant staff understands; don't be ridiculous.""* There was an argument, and it became very obvious to me that I might be complaining about something I shouldn't be complaining about, that perhaps my thinking is in the wrong and that I ruined a nice dinner for everyone because of that.

I don't have kids, so I wonder if I'm not ""in-the-know?"" Such that these messes happen all the time at restaurants, and that the parents leave an extra 2% tip with a wink-and-a-nod to the restaurant staff, ""thanks, sorry we made a mess,"" followed by a empathetic smile from the waitress, ""I have kids too, it's no problem!""

I know I'm in the wrong for calling my sister out during dinner in front of her children and other adults. I should have saved that conversation and pulled her aside at an appropriate time. But I didn't want to see another shopvac being pulled out as we left. Am I being unreasonable for making an issue out of this?

So I went into our server's console and used a teleport command on him, thinking it would show me the coordinates of where he was. However, I accidentally teleported him to the middle of nowhere.

To provide an even judgement, he said that he didn't want to be with myself and the other person on this world, and he didn't give any real ways of finding him for that reason. I'm kicking myself now cause I might have just ruined our friendship because I didn't respect what he wanted to do...

I understood that and let him sleep but by the time he woke up to finish watching the movie i was already sleep. So next thing i know i wake up to him asking for money to get breakfast. I told him i can send it digitally but i dont have cash cause he took the last big bills i had now i all really had was 3 dollars. He didn't want me to send it digitally for some reason. And so i got up asked him how much time he had he said he only had about 5 minutes. So i asked him why didn't he just make something quick and go? Why wait for me to get up if i clearly am not hearing him cause i'm sleep. He said cause i wasn't supposed to be sleep because i knew i had work the next night and needed to be on schedule for it. And that since he's getting ready for work he can't make himself food. And i responded with I honestly didn't know i was sleep until i woke up. But i hurried up as fast as i could and made his food so he could go and while he was eating he was complaining about the fact that he might be late.

123,t3_rvssmo,AITA for being involved in surprising my GF?,"I am sorry for my use of English, it is not my first language. Also, this might be a long one. 

I (20m) went to this new years party. Me and 11 of my friends, so a gathering is maybe a better description. However 1 important person was missing my GF (20). She chose to celebrate new years at her parents because of the current advice here to only have 4 guests per day.

It might be important to know that I chose to go because it had been a while since I had seen some of these friends, and I knew I would really regret not going because I did that last year and celebrated with my GF and her parents. Also me avoiding my friends because of the pandamic really affected my mental health in a bad way. My GF and I wanted to split up the group to celebrate new years at different locations and videocall eachother, but the rest showed no interest in that. 

The day before the party my GF and I invited to of our friends (they are closer to her) to my place. They were also going to the party the next day. The topic of her missing the party came up and decided on video calling her at midnight.

However, these same girls came up with a different plan at the party and after a few drinks. They wanted to go to her house and surprise her. I tried to warn them that she wouldn't like if she had to come outside, because then the whole not meeting up with people would have been for nothing. Therefore I suggested calling her outside her window so she could see we thought of her and missed her, but honor her choice. 

During the walk to her house I got a blister on my heel and it hurt a lot. Therefore, I took my shoes of which slowed me down, because I was looking at the ground constantly to see if it was safe to walk on. This meant I arrived to late to stop what had happened. 

The same friends from the day before had asked her to come outside. When I arrived she was already outside. I panicked and became speechless (it is a problem I have in difficult situations). She made an excuse saying her parents wanted to go to sleep which may or may not have been true, but I knew she wanted to get out of the situation. I still couldn't say anything.

My plan was to go home (10 min walk) switch shoes and more importantly call her check how she was doing. But before I could she called me, in tears, and before I could explain what happened she started blaming me for what happened. And here is where I might have been the AH, I couldn't be there for her while she was so angry at me and I didn't want to apologize for something I didn't do, so it took a while to actually apologize for what I did do.

My current husband (M37) saw no need for the kids to attend the funeral after I said they were going with me, he said they're still young but I said they had every right to be there for the final goodby. He suggested he go with us then and I wasn't sure but I contacted my former inlaws and they said it was fine.


My husband drove us to the funeral and kept making comments to the kids telling them how to behave which was uncalled for. We got there and I brought the kids to stand near their grandparents, while My husband kept introducing himself to strangers then went to stand next to the kids.

I was standing from a distance but could hear the kids crying, I then started hearing my husband telling them to quiet down repeatedly. Not gonna lie I felt bothered wishing he'd stop.

While the kids were crying he loudly said ""Stop crying, really there's no need for this....it's not like he can hear you"" and the kids just started sobbing at this point. I was stunned, I looked and saw my inlaws staring at me. I felt horrible I walked up to him and whispered I needed a minute with him, I made sure we were away and lost my temper asking what he was doing, he said he was just trying to comfort the kids and help them get a hold of their emotions, I told him what he said was horrible and everyone heard it. He tried to argue that he was just trying to help but I said he had no right to tell the kids how to grief their father and demanded that he leaves the funeral but he threw a fit and said I was overreacting. I insisted then he left later.


After the funeral the kids started avoiding me, they wanted to stay with their aunt and I went home by myself and found my husband there waiting with an angery look on his face. He picked an argument saying I shouldn't have kicked him out of the funeral after he came to support me and the kids but I told him what he said made the kids refuse to even come home with me, he said the kids are using him as an outlet for their anger after he's been generous with his time and effort and this is how we repay him? By making him out to be the bad guy? I refused to keep going but he kept pushing for an apology for this blatant disrespect I showed him.


For more details/ my husband never had a good relationship with my children's father, I was confused when he said he wanted to come to the funeral but then I thought he did it for the kids.",11212.0
125,t3_rvselu,AITA for asking my friend to pay the rent?,"English is not my first language so sorry for the mistakes.

I (20F) and my friend (20F) lived together in the apartment that my parents owned in another city, where we started university. When we moved in on September 1st, we decided to split the taxes in half and additionally she will pay the rent, that went to me, and I lived off that money and some that my parents gave me. Also we decided that she will live and pay here until July, but we never sined and contracts. We have been living together for 2 months and then the second wave of covid hit.

I didn't think much of it and just stayed in the apartment, but my friend decided to come back home live with her parents, because all the classes moved to online space.

At the end of November I texted her and asked for her half for taxes, and she send them right away, with no questions. Then on December, I asked her for taxes money again, she send them right away, but I was confused, because she never send the rent money.

I am one of those people that is not realy comfortable to confront other, especially when the talk is about money. 

But in the beggining in Janurary I finally asked her about the rent money. She was very shocked that even if she is not living there, I expected her to pay the rent. I simply said that she never had a conversation with me, about not wanting to pay or pay less money, and overall, all her stuff was still in the apartment. She argued that because this is my parents apartment I shouldn't ask her for rent. Going back and forth, for about 30 min she finally said okey, I will send the money. But that wasn't the end.

Then she started ignoring me when I asked for money, after a month this conversation happend, also after that never send taxes money either. And I started worrying that I will lose a friend over money, I was lost. 

After another month she said she wants to moved out, but, she still did not payed for 4 months rent and 2 months taxes. After all I gave up I just asked her for 3 months worth of rent. She send them the next day and it was the end.

After a while I met with the other friend (19F) and and she told me that that friend that I lived with, send her a whole paragraph how I was unreasonable for asking for a rent money when she don't even lived there and how I was a disgusting person to ask her for money when we are in a pandemic and more awful things. The friend group that we shared split because of this situtsion and I feel so guilty for that, but other people are telling me that I did nothing wrong.

This post will include me (19f) my brother (16m) and Mother (40f). My brother and I haven't argued in years. This all started 5 minutes before New Years. My brother had grabbed all the sparklers (The sticks witch you light up on one end and then they sparkle). I was really excited about them so I asked him if I could get a pack of five. He said no, because our mother had told him that he was supposed to hand them out outside. I was so hyped up about them ( I was even the one who picked them out at the shop in the first place) that I took one pack from him and said that I could hand some out too. He then called me a bitch witch I ignored. Once we were outside he went straight to our mother and told her that I took the sparklers. I said that I would gladly give them back if he said sorry for calling me a bitch. My brother then began on a rant over how much of a bitch I was etc. I didn't really listen because at this point I was talking to my mother. She looked irritated at me and said that i should just hand them back because it was 5 minutes until the clock was 12. In shock over the fact that she was mad at me and not my brother I gave them back and went to my room. My mother then came to my room and asked me to go outside with them. I then managed to scream ""how could you let him talk to me like that"" while in tears and then i said i didn't want to go outside with them.

Later that night me and my mother calmly talked about the situation and I expressed how hurt I was over the fact that se would let anybody talk to me, her child, like that. She explained that she didn't want to start anything that close to new years, and that mye brother just felt like i never trusted him in his decisions. 

I have avoided them both the last couple of days (we all live together) and my mother brought it up again. We went trough the same conversation as we had the night of the fight and she asked me to just let it go and stop ignoring them, but I can't stop feeling hurt about it all.

tldr; parents are broke to throw me a party so i planned it all out myself and secured all the finances behind their backs &amp; i never asked for monetary help. now that the party is in a few days they want me to cancel it.

128,t3_rvs9qt,WIBTAH for kicking out my roommate for not cleaning,"Remove info to shorten 
So my (20 f) whole family members came over for Christmas dinner and my place was a huge mess before and I asked the roommate (22) to clean it since it was mainly theirs and I was going to my dads and didn’t know what time I would be home at and they said okay

The kitchen was still messy so I cleaned it When my mom got there she as usual nit picked my cleaning and help me clean off roommates desk and she did the dishes from said desk while I vacuumed. Roommate got home just as I was serving and I made a joke about how they where supposed to clean last night but didn’t. They laughed and said “don’t worry I’ll clean this all up tomorrow” 
They was in incident that they where a part of that really pissed me off so when I got home I moved my desk in my room. Now the only reason why I was going into the kitchen was to grab a few snacks here and there. I haven’t really been eating the last couple of days because I don’t feel well. Because of the incident I told roommate that then when they get home to just clean the place like they said they would because I will not be doing it.  
Last night my roommate called me over to ask me when I’m cleaning the mess up. I said that to them that they said they where gonna do it. They just denied ever saying they would. I just went back to my room and decided that I will just bight the bullet and do it tomorrow. I was mad that they went back on their word. My friend Emily came over today to help me out because she was at the dinner. I probably would have never gotten it all done without her there.  

At one point roommate moved the pot to the sink and covered them with one that looked empty so I never paid much mind but when cleaning them today the other pot where still full of food and covered in mold. I talked to my sister later, she told me that roommate noticed it starting it to mold a few days ago and said and did nothing about it. 

When roommate got home from work Emily said to roommate “great your home I don’t have to help” then went and sat on the couch and roommate went straight into their room. I was pretty mad at this point. I told them that next time if you put pots in the sink make sure they are not full of food and if you notice something is rotating throw it out don’t wait for me to do it.  Then they say it’s not their responsibility, when they said they would clean. They once again said they never said that and it was “my” party and since my mom helped me clean up she didn’t have to do it this time. If I knew she was never gonna clean it up I would have done it sooner. My problem right now is that this is that is not the first time she has left me to clean up her mess in the kitchen. I feel taken advantage of and that she has very little respect for me. at this point I want them out. My name is on the lease and I told them when they moved in I wont be adding them to the lease for 6 months in case we don’t like living together.

129,t3_rvs8gc,AITA for pushing my brother too hard academically,"Hi, my brother (11) is currently trying to get a scholarship to a highschool that I have gotten in the past. 

I will admit pretty objectively that he isn’t really that dedicated to working very hard on studying and generally has about 6 hours of screen time a day. 

Anyways, my parents have given me the task of helping him prepare for this, which I take really seriously. I’ve been giving him some really good books to read, writing guides to improve his writing, checking his work and providing feedback on top of all the studying that I have to do since I’m trying to get into a medical school.

Today he spent all day studying, which I was really impressed with. I told this to my parents but my mum replied pretty confused saying the work she had given him was not that much.

I looked at the work, and I totally agreed it was not much at all. In my opinion 2 hours max. So I confronted him about it to ask why it had taken him so long, mostly to check whether it was too overwhelming for him, and he got really defensive saying “I worked all day”. 

I dropped it and instead brought up whether he was sticking to the 1 hour of screen time that we had agreed on (and set up an award system for which took me a long time to come up with). He said he’ll start from tomorrow, and for me that seemed a bit suspicious so I checked his screen time. 

5 hours of YouTube. Throughout the time that I had praised him so much for studying. Look to be completely honest I don’t care how much time he spends on yt, my screen time isn’t great either I just feel pretty betrayed that he lied to me. I told him I felt this way and explained why it was important not to get distracted that much while you are studying. If he had finished the work in one or two sessions and then did whatever he wanted after or during breaks, I wouldn’t have any issues. It’s just he has everyone under the impression, including me and probably himself, that he was studying all day, when he really wasn’t. I just want to teach him to be efficient and learn more, because if he watches 30mins of YouTube for every 15 minutes of work he does he isn’t learning shit and it’s wasting the whole day.
  
This isn’t the first time this has happened. I understand that he is a child and this is honestly the time he should be enjoying, but I really do wish he would take a bit more responsibility for his future, since this school would really help him. He is a smart kid, and I just want to push him. 

But when I confronted him about these things, he started crying a lot and stopped responding to me so I am currently feeling very guilty. Am I being too hard on him? AITA?",1.0
130,t3_rvs48t,AITA for feeding the boars in my neighborhood?,"There's forested areas near where I live, as I live in a veyr small city. There's a wild boar population too. They're really cute. There's this one massive boar, he must weigh over 110 kg, he's bigger than I am.

I used to see them a few times a month, in the morning they come over to my area. I'm not sure why they were there. There's usually 3-8 of them. They run around and play.

One day I got some vegetables and I went up to them and I gave them some. They ate them out of my hand. They came back the next day, and I did the same thing. I feed them almost every day and they've come to like me. They let me pet them and one of them even rolls on his back so I can pet his stomach. Some of them lick me and nudge me with their snouts.

Well this has pissed a lot of people off. They're telling me to stop and I told them no, they're on my propety and I can do what I want. Some of the neighbors have tried to push them away. The boars ignore htem. I told my neighbors I'd file for trespassing if they ever stepped on my property again so they stopped.

They tried getting the ""city guard"" (straż miejska) to get me to stop feeding the boars. They didn't do anything.

Last night half hte nieghborhood came to my door and told me I need to stop as the boars are making them feel ""unsafe"". I told them to fuck off and I closed the door.

We're in Europe, boars are not aggressive here. I know in North America, there's a problem with boars but those are hybrids, they're a mixture of the various 16 subspecies of boars and farm pigs. We don't have feral pigs that attack people everyday like in the Southern US. The only times boars attack is when hunters shoot at them.

There's talk of getting wildlife authorities involved. I think my neighbors are ridiculous because this has been going on for 6 months, and noboyd has been hurt, the boars have not destroyed their property or otherwise harmed anybody. Again, 6 months and nothing has happened so they're being ridiculous. ",0.0
131,t3_rvrno3,AITA for being mad at my BF for watching a TV show without me?,"My boyfriend (41M) and I (30F) have been living together for almost a year. Most of our TV show and movie interests overlap. I’ve been trying to get him to watch a certain TV show with me for months. I’ve seen the first season but just got behind on it. There are 4 seasons now. I know this is a show that he will enjoy because it has all the elements he loves including some serious 80s nostalgia. Other friends have confirmed to him that he should watch this show and agree that it’s one he would love.

Recently his oldest son and his girlfriend (both 18) moved in with us. His other son (17) is in town for Christmas and going home tomorrow.

Well tonight, while I was resting because I was feeling rundown, he started watching this TV show with his kids. They watched two seasons of it!

I got upset because he knew I’d been wanting to watch it together from the beginning since it’s been years since I’ve watched the first season. I also really enjoy sharing things that I love with the people I love. And as silly as that sounds I include TV and movies in that. It makes me really happy to share something with someone for the first time and see their reaction when they’re enjoying it too.

He says I’m over reacting because it’s just a TV show and we can start it over together. He said it’s what the kids wanted to watch and he was spending time with his youngest before he goes home.

I feel like he could have watched something else with the kids. Something that they like that I don’t like anime or horror or something. He also could have come and told me they were going to watch this show and asked if I wanted to come watch too.

Am I the asshole for being upset?

Edit:

So I guess all of this is coming from a place of feeling neglected. And while this one incident seems trivial, in my brain it feels like part of a pattern. Since the oldest son and his GF have moved in I’ve found that my time with my BF has been cut drastically. I’m a very solitary person and often spend time alone in our bedroom because I can’t handle all the extra goings on in the house. We have two other adult roommates as well. Since the son and GF have moved in there have been times that we were supposed to spend together that wind up being spent with them without me. No purposefully excluding me. Just not in a situation I’m comfortable in either. Either I’m burnt out on socialization for the day or they are outside smoking for 30 minutes to an hour and sometimes longer and talking. I recently quit smoking so I don’t go out with them because it’s very tempting. One night we were supposed to lay on the couch and watch TV. He went out for “a quick smoke” and was out there for two hours talking to his son and GF. No time together that night. 

I also could have just given up on watching it together after months of trying to get him to watch and just watched it on my own. But we both work 48-60 hours a week and any time that I would have to watch something we’re both home and watching something we agree on.",0.0
132,t3_rvr7wi,AITA for being rude to a friend when she stayed with me and my parents for a few days?,"
I (21F) am a college student and my college is about 6 hours away from home. My friend (21F), who I will refer to as F, is also in the same college. 

My parents came to visit me and were going to stay for four days. We were staying at a guest house. We invited F to stay with us for two days (not planned but just happened). Someone in our college tested positive so F ended up staying for the the whole 4 days till other people got tested and got their negative result. I was fine with F staying over but what got on my nerves was that she didn't let me spend any quality time with my parents. Anytime I was alone in a room having a conversation with my mom or my dad she would just come in and sit in the same room and listen. She would constantly ask me to take her out ( I can drive) shopping or to eat even after I told her that I didn't want to and she is free to go if she wants to (everything was walking distance and in a safe neighbourhood). We went shopping once and had lunch at a restaurant (just the two of us) another day. The other days we would go to eat with my parents. We didn't force her to stay with us. She was comfortable with my parents, so it wasn't that she didn't like them. By the third day I was very frustrated and ended up ignoring her a little. 
I apologised to her for it later, but I wanted to know if ai was an asshole for not treating a 'guest' well?

EDIT: 
I told her I wanted to spend time with my parents a few times, but she would insist on going out for 'just half an hour' and she went out with other friends a few times. 
Also the reason I didn't want her to be in the conversation between my mom and me was because my mom had recently lost her father and she would talk about how sad she was when it was just the two of us, but when F came into the room she would stop and try to act normal. I told F about it but she would still do it. It was a 3 bedroom house and she had a room.",6.0

I have not been on a lot of family trips cause being in the same room with them makes me insane and he gets angry at the littlest of things and is even worse when out on holiday. He even swore at my mom in a holy place we visited. I got placed a year back and hadn't left home for a year and a half. My sister moved to another city for her studies and I wanted to treat my mom and my sister so I planned a trip around that city. Before we left, my dad says nothing, asks us to enjoy ourselves. We came back yesterday and he was playing the biggest victim in the world. Said you are dead to me, which he has said to me before, said he hopes for my downfall, and I should move out and I dare not go to grandparent's place or he will beat everyone up there. Other family members from my dad's side have been telling him about how I am saving so much money by living with him and I should give that to him instead and we are all very mean for not asking him to go with us. He has been on several trips without us, we haven't said anything once. And I get that he feels unloved and left out but I can't stand to be around him.

My mom's parents have given him a lot of money before which he has wasted and they have strictly asked me not to give him anymore money. But they don't have to face his wrath and idk if it will be easier for me just to give him the money. He was talking about how he is the one who is going to be there for me and if I get corona he will put me in some terrible hospital and wish for my death, and how he has worked so hard for my education although it was my grandparent's who paid for it. After that, this morning he comes and asks me to recharge the wifi as if nothing had happened. I am so appalled that after all these years he doesn't know how much he has bullied me and gone out of his way to destroy my confidence. There was an episode like this a month or two back and he kept calling me to tell me mean stuff so I blocked him and he kept asking me yesterday why have I blocked him ?! How does he not know, how does he not see? And to my dad's side of the family I am now the villian for not helping him out with money, as they don't want to give him anymore money and think I should bear the burden.

136,t3_rvqibg,"AITA, inheritance talk at Christmas dinner","Inspired by a recent post, I am humbly looking for impartial Internet judgement.

Key players are myself (M25) great aunt &amp; uncle (early 70’s), mother &amp; aunt (40s). Also here were my two siblings (12 and 9), cousin (7), step father and uncle. 

We all got together for an immediate family only Christmas/birthday dinner on Boxing Day. I had driven down to my great aunt/uncles place and spent the day with them helping prepare, hanging out etc. 
When the rest of the family shows up we all begin having a lovely dinner, however my mother mentions that one day she’ll be hosting these dinners as the matriarch of the family and how she’s so excited to inherit all the recipes, dining sets, expensive cutlery and all that. Honestly this comment very much rubbed me the wrong way. Anyways as dinner progresses my mother and aunt continue making such comments, and my great aunt has become visibly upset (to myself and my great uncle, all others were having a great time). 
Brief aside: I grew up in my great aunts house unlike my mother/aunt or any of their other children. We are extremely close, and have a very good relationship as we have very similar views and senses of humour. She loves us all equally, but it is clear that she and I just get along well. 
After about 20 minutes of this non stop inheritance talk my great aunt puts her foot down like only she can, with very few total words and the most stern tone I’ve heard she says “lowkey is both the executor and the only beneficiary of both our will’s, he will inherit everything with no exception and will treat his siblings and cousin as he sees fit”. She clarified this is because she trusts me more than others present and because her other great nephews are still too young. 
Cue loud protest from everyone at the table, at which time I’m now fed up and say something like: no wonder the wills name me exclusively, you’ve both been trying to put your family in the grave and rob their tomb while they are sitting beside you, in perfect health, not even retired, finely ready to enjoy life to the fullest. I did use some names I shouldn’t have, dancing around calling them selfish and the like. 
Dinner wraps up quickly, my parents and aunt leave while my great uncle and I watch Star Wars (our tradition, usually shared with my aunt who skipped for the first time in 15ish years). I proceed to get multiple calls and texts over the next week exploring each way I was the AH. For speaking to my mother that way, swearing in front of my younger siblings, allowing unfair treatment, being a disrespectful little child (25, degree + mba + ft job, engaged).

The other day my dad was sitting on the couch watching some weird video on youtube; I decide to sit next to him due to boredom. I look up at the Tv and its displaying ""top 15 evilest Screamo/Metal musicians"" referring to criminals and what not.

This is when my dad looks me dead in the eyes and says ""This is why you shouldn't be listening to that Metal screaming crap! Its not real music""

At this point I rolled my eyes.

""Dad, I make sure the bands I listen to aren't secretly racists or anything, I'm fine""

My dad grunted, ""I don't care if you have or haven't, it's still not *real*  music!"" he Really drew out the real.

at this point I was frustrated and irritated

"" I'm not your little bloody girl, dad! I can like what I want to without you bossing me around!"" I yelled, it was pretty bloody loud.

&amp;#x200B;

"" I miss my little girl"" he yelled.

I grabbed the pillow next to me and screamed into it before throwing throwing the pillow at\* (i should've phrased this better, threw it down next to him) him and going to my room.

we've made up but its still bugging me, others I've told about this have called me an asshole for this behaviour so.. AITA?",5.0
139,t3_rvpqkc,AITA for making my coworker feel bad by telling her she is too slow?,"I work at a McDonald's, as most people must know fast food restaurants have been having problems hiring new personal, this happened at January first. I came back to job after 3 days out, I had collapsed (fainted, too much stress), and that they we had 10 members of the staff missing. For those who doesn't know, we have 2 minutes to get the order ready at the kitchen, to function well we need 8 people just at the kitchen, that day we were 10 at the entire restaurant, 11 if we count the manager. The following is a conversation as exact as I can remember.
Manager: Mumbles to my coworker
Co-W: she is going to get mad
Manager: just do it
CW: Don't bite me, Don't go crazy on me
Me: I'm known for biting (joking)
Manager: OP, CW is going to work with you on the kitchen
Me: Okay? ( I see X and Y - other coworkers- leaving the kitchen) So, Cw is going to be with me? She and who else?
Manager: just you two
Me: Wait, what?
Manager: X and Y gotta get lunch
Me: but CW doesn't know how to prepare hamburgers!
Manager: you can teach her on the march
Me: that's not my job! (I'm not a trainer)
Manager: well, figure it out
Me: okay...But don't you dare to hurry me up, I'm not taking responsibility of keeping it on time
CW: (Leaves the kitchen) I'm not working with her. 
Manager: (goes into the kitchen) what happened
CW: you hear how she treated me, I'm finally showing interest on learning how to make hamburgers and she treated me like that
Me: Sorry, I didn't mean...
CW: No, I'm not working with you
Manager: Okay go and work as the cashier
Me: ok (I took off my apron and take the cashier position along with delivering the orders) 
She was left in the kitchen with other coworker, let's called him Z, after 10 minutes I was sent out to get lunch. When I cameback after lunch, I saw her talking with some partners about how bad I treated her, and she had left Z on the kitchen by his own,  I tried to help him, while keeping doing my work taking orders and delivering them while she kept talking to others about how bad she felt. That till another manager arrived and told her, and other coworkers to help me and Z. 
Since then CW has told everyone at the restaurant how bad I am, and people is giving me the cold shoulder, when asked to explain the situation I had decided to remain in silence. Work friends are divided between telling me to try to apologize her to calm down thing and not doing anything.

So, I'm the asshole for ""calling"" her slow and making feel bad about it?

Extra information: 
No, CW is not a new hired, she has been working at the restaurant for over a year, she doesn't know how to prepare hamburgers because she always find an excuse to not work on the kitchen. 
She asked me to trained her before, which I refuse, first, because the company doesn't pay me to do it (there are trainers (more paid) at the restaurant, I'm not one of them) and second, she has been telling everyone she is going to resign in February, so I told her ""I won't waste my time teaching someone who is going to leave in a couple of weeks"".",0.0
140,t3_rvpn5w,AITA for telling my partner I cannot change the way I talk?,"My partner of 7 years has recently complained about my sentence structure. English is my second language. The trigger sentence in question for the current fight was me saying this about our Airbnb: ""Our ad is not correct. I hadn't noticed, but the suite has a..."" here I get interrupted, he rolls his eyes and is annoyed at me, saying me that he doesn't understand what I'm saying and I don't make any sense. I asked if I can finish my sentence, but he kept interrupting me. I finally get to talk and said ""If you let me finish, you would know that I was going to say that the suite has a CO2 monitor alarm and I had never noticed, therefore it is not in the ad"". 

Edit: I started talking without context after just entering the room, hence his confusion.

After this the conversation went downhill, into how my sentence structure is all wrong, my bad grammar, how I don't make any sense etc. He said he didn't let me finish before because I often leave sentences unfinished.Then I said that he is the only one who says this in my life, that despite being ESL, I am a supervisor and a trainer at work, without issues. He just said nobody has to live with me or would tell me to my face how impossible I am to understand. 

At this point I got very upset, and started crying.  But I stood my ground,  and told him that I feel like he is trying to find a way to dislike me just because, and since he cannot find any major issues with the way I am he wants to make a massive deal out of something that could be discussed calmly. He said I don't listen if he says things calmly. And that I  do the same to him (for context, I complained that he is not showing excitement about the baby coming soon, and that he does not want to participate on decisions or spending an equal proportion of money on the baby. He said I cannot tell him how to feel, and I am also just trying to find defects)

He also argues that I cannot expect him to memorise and deal with the cognitive load of all the background info I provide before getting to the key issue. I think this is where might be right. Maybe I am an asshole for saying I cannot change my speech patterns as an ESL, and expecting him to understand my gibberish. Maybe I sound a lot more confusing than what I think and people just don't tell me. At work sometimes people need further clarification but I usually think it's just my accent and normal confusion when trying to learn complex processes. I'm doubting everything now. I also feel like an asshole because I asked him why is he with an ESL SO if he hates being confused so much. Also told him he is disrespectful to me and will model this disrespect to our future daughter. He answered saying I will model my confusing communication pattern to her. I just said in a frustrated and annoyed tone: ""SHE WILL GO TO SCHOOL! HOW DO YOU THINK THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS MANAGE?!"". Maybe I'm wrong, and I'll set her up for failure with my poor speech patterns. Maybe he is so tired of telling me the same thing that now is getting frustrated.",508.0
141,t3_rvpmub,AITA for correcting my brothers friend in an admitantly hostile way?,"I (16M) am part of the LGBTQ+ community and am out to all my and my brothers (19M) friends. Just about 15 minutes ago one of his friends (19F) said “yeah i’m unfortunately straight” I asked her what she meant by that and she talked about how hard it was to date boys. I stopped the conversation and corrected her by saying it’s a common misconception that dating someone of the same gender is easier, and that being gay comes with a lot of really hard moments.

After they left my brother got really angry with me saying what she said really wasn’t an issue and that I shouldn’t have said anything. When I pushed back by saying this was an issue he said I was being too sensitive and looking for things that weren’t there.

142,t3_rvpigb,AITA for making my sister feel insecure,"So it was Christmas Eve and for the first time in more than a year the whole family got together for Christmas. 

Me (25m) and my sister (32f) were outside smoking, when out of the blue she confronts me saying ""you never give me compliments, never in YOUR LIFE have you ever given me a compliment"" this took me by surprise, and it just seemed like an out of the blue confrontation, during a nice meal with the family. I thought it was a ridiculous question, because of course I give her compliments, maybe just not as frequent and obvious as she would like, I don't know. I tell her this, and she scoffs, and goes on to say ""you make me feel insecure as a sister"". This comment really boiled my blood, as I felt it was extremely hypocritical of her, as she is the one who constantly patronises, humiliates and generally make me feel like shit. 

When I told her this, she got angry and demanded I give her examples. I gave her the most recent one which happened only the day before when I was trying to tell her about my recent ex, who I was still fighting feelings for, it had been a difficult year for me regarding this, and I wanted to just confide in my sister, who is older, has more experience, but more than that, I just wanted her to listen and be there as my sister to offer me some comfort and let me vent and get these feelings off my chest. When I try to talk with her about this, she immediately deflects it and says, ""well, what did you expect, you don't have a job, and you're living back with your parents, did you really think she saw a future with you."" She goes on to then vent about her problems and how they are much bigger than mine, and basically just making me feel like shit and that everything is my fault. When I tell her this example, she defends it by claiming she was just being honest, and if I'm not ready to hear the truth, maybe it's because I'm just too sensitive. 

We haven't spoken since, and I feel horrible, because I don't want her to feel insecure, especially if she claims that I am the one causing that. But at the same time, I feel like she is gaslighting me, because I've always been the one who calls her on the telephone the past year, and listens to her problems without interfering, just allowing her to vent. And it's frustrating that she seemingly can't do the same for me, and then makes me feel like the one at fault.",4.0
143,t3_rvphhu,AITA for letting my junkie sister see her kid?,"The title sounds bad, but it’s complicated. My (22 F) sister (30 F) has a 9 year old daughter (k), i was only 13 when she was born but i must say i had a lot to do in raising her, my sister has been heavily into drugs and alcohol since she was 19, while i was at school my mother would often watch k and whenever i was home i would watch k. My 3 other siblings had already moved out and often it felt like she was my child. I never knew where my sister was and she would disappear for days on end and then come back and play mum for a few days and then leave again. When I turned 18 i moved out with my then boyfriend now husband and my best friend, we rented a 2 bedroom apartment and my niece stayed with me most of the time and slept on the lounge, shitty , i know but it was the best we had for her as my parents both worked and my other siblings had jobs and kids of their own. After 2 years me and my husband saved up, bought a house got married and now have a kid of our own. My niece moved in with us and I haven’t seen my sister since i was 19. My niece is a great kid, she does well in school, abides by our rules and i can tell she is genuinely very grateful for everything. Well last week my sister showed up at my house, I don’t even know how she got my address, and said she wants to see K, i asked why and she said that she is getting sober and understands that i have done a lot for her and thinks that that k living with me is the best thing for her right now but she would like to be in her life.

144,t3_rvpfto,AITA for not apologizing to MIL?,"Throwaway cuz some family knows my real account. 


So this is still causing issues and I'm on the fence about my decision and if I should apologize. I'll call his mom MIL and sister SIL for simplicity. 


Context: been together six years. I (24M) had to put my dog down, my BF (25M) had to put his down a few months after, and my BF's grandfather has Parkinsons that has gotten worse throughout the year. This was likely our last Christmas with him. 


Christmas day morning we always have at my parents (mom, younger bro, and step dad). We then go to my MIL's (lives with her husband and my SIL.


This year we were going to have MIL's parents over for dinner at hers. That morning her dad's Parkinsons was flaring up and he couldn't use his feet, so they didn't come. 


MIL was worried all day, shed a few tears when her dad was mentioned and left the room each time. Me, my BF, and SIL went to see his grandparents for about an hour before dinner time so we at least got to see them on Christmas. Both my BF and SIL were pretty quiet after the visit (I drove).  My BF then got an email from his dad. He has cut his dad off, his dad knows my BF doesn't want to talk to him, but still reaches out once in a while (has the mindset of pretend there is no issue then there is none). Long story.  My BF shut down, I stepped aside with him to talk and he felt he had no time to process what he was feeling. 


Christmas eve we went to my grandparents, they have a big dog that reminded him of his dog. With his dad's email, his grandpa being unwell, it was a lot. I suggested he go to the bathroom upstairs to have some space to cool down away from everyone and then join us for dinner. He agreed. 


My MIL noticed and snapped ""Where you going? Dinner is almost ready"" He said he'd be back and she huffed at him, but he went upstairs. 


I helped set the table with SIL and MIL who cursed ""what the fuck"". My SIL asked why she said that and my MIL said ""he should be strong for me. Doesn't he know how hard this is for me?"" My MIL has never been good with emotions. It has to be about her feelings and everyone else has to ""buck up."" 


I said ""it's hard for him too. He's just taking a moment, he will be right back."" She said ""it's not all about him"" and I snapped (not shouting) that ""it isn't all about you either."" 


She went back to the kitchen and my BF came downstairs. We got through dinner, had light conversations as if that didn't happen. My MIL left to visit her parents with her husband and we cleaned the kitchen up  and went home. 


My BF said he heard everything. Fast forward: he has talked to MIL about how he was feeling, but she is demanding I apologize for what I said to her. I said no because she was being really rude about his feelings and if she claims she will do better then she would be apologizing to him. He agrees, but she's not talking to either of us now and says I was out of line for saying what I did to her.

145,t3_rvp4ou,AITA for being upset over pizza leftovers?,"Tl;dr: fiance ate my pizza leftovers i was looking forward to, didnt ask if he could have or offer me any and i got upset. We fought and now we're not doing well.

We're both on the end of recovery from the virus right now so we have to scrape by on what little money we have. Well yesterday, we ordered a half n half pizza. There was 16 pieces total, and it was thick crust. It was made so well and tasted sooo good. It was also $30.
We both ate half of our halves and were stuffed so i put it in the fridge. I was really looking forward to finishing what was left of my half of the pizza for dinner, but i wasnt hungry yet.
So my fiance goes in the kitchen and i hear the microwave. I assumed he was eating his pizza. I went in the kitchen to get something for our room, and i see him eating my pizza. Now wait a min, i have no problem sharing my food (and actually like sharing with him) and we usually always share anyways.

So i say, ""you're eating my pizza?"" He said yes im hungry. Which was also fine, i dont want to him to be hungry, but i opened the box still in the fridge, and all that's left is a half a piece of my pizza. Like a one mouthful piece. I was very upset because not only did he finish his AND mine, but he left a tiny piece, didnt ask me if i wanted any or if he could have it, if he had, i would have even given it to him and said to just leave me one good piece or two. Shit i woulda been happy with one good piece and that mouthful piece.

But anyways, i took the piece left and put it on his plate and told him he might as well eat that too. I can agree that maybe THAT part was kind of asshole-ish. But i was really upset because i was looking forward to it, and he didnt ask if i wanted any or anything. So i go back into the room and im almost about to cry over this pizza. He comes in, and offers to go get me a burger or a replacement pizza. But that's not the point. It was perfectly fine pizza that i wanted. I wanted THAT pizza. Burger does not = pizza. Plus i did not want him to go out because of our condition. He says i spit the offer back at him when i did not accept his going out to get me something different. But I politely declined. And we were supposed to go out tomorrow anyway because our shut in ends tomorrow. And now we're on the outs over a pizza... I spoke calmly and tried to tell him my feelings were hurt because he ate 75% of the pizza and didnt offer/save me any except a tiny piece.

He thinks the whole thing is petty and stupid, and i even apologized for being upset. He went out anyways and got me mcdonalds of all things... I thanked him but before that he said to accept it or it was gonna go into the trash and that he didnt care either way and has no respect for me now. And he says he hates me now because he's disgusted with this argument. But all i did was try to talk to him calmly and express my feelings but he got mad at me and talked/yelled over me.",12.0

147,t3_rvp1ns,AITA for shouting at my Mom?,"So, I (15F) and my Mom (33F) have always got along very well. But recently we just haven’t. 

For the past 3 months, I’ve had trouble eating. Usually, my mom doesn’t notice as it only lasts for a few days but it hasn’t now. My Mom has noticed now as I avoid having dinner everyday. She says that I will develop an eating disorder and gets really angry and shouts at me when I don’t eat, which doesn’t help.  
I’ve been trying a lot to eat normally again and have slightly improved although at a slow pace. I ate about half of one meal a day. I know this is bad but I can’t help it. I physically cannot eat. (For example, last week, I was starving to the point I felt tired and my stomach was hurting. I got a chocolate bar from the cupboard and thought I would be able to eat it. But I held it in-front of me and began crying. I physically couldn’t eat it. I did end up eating half of it which was a pretty big improvement for me lol.)  
My Mom keeps saying how I’m going to develop an eating disorder too.  
(Mistake me if I’m wrong here since I’m not that educated on ED. But I don’t eat to loose weight. I don’t think I’m too fat or too skinny and I’m not doing it i’m order to loose weight. I just don’t want to eat.)

Anyway, my Mom told all of my aunties about it. Which I was *sort of fine* with but I asked her if she just wouldn’t tell anyone. She didn’t say yes or no so I assumed she knew not to. 

Yesterday, I went with her to her friends house. Her friend offered me food and I’ve been doing a lot better recently and I was about to accept the offer until her friend said- ‘Oh. I’m so sorry. I forgot that you don’t eat.’ I was a little hurt by the comment but she’s a sweet lady and I know she didn’t mean it in a rude way. I politely laughed it off and said I would have some food anyway.  
I ate the whole meal which I was happy with. But then my Mom screamed- ‘Oh My God! She’s ate a whole meal for once.’ in front of everyone. It felt embarrassing but I think she was just shocked I’d ate a whole meal which I was too. 

I reacted wrong and shouted at her after in private for not keeping her mouth shut when she knew I didn’t want people to know and how hard it is for me to just eat.  
She’s still mad at me for shouting. I reacted wrong, yes, but the amount of times people have commented on me eating is just upsetting and it’s not something I’m proud of and want everyone to know.",5.0
148,t3_rvp193,AITA for not letting my son learn how to program and telling him to pick a different career?,"I (53M) have a son (14M) who is quite passionate about computers. He got a hand-me-down from one of my co-workers son who recently went off to college and for his birthday I upgraded the specs. Granted it's no powerhouse but it can do stuff quite well.

But the thing is, he has autism, which predisposes him to be more affected by the blue light of screens. I've noticed that when he spends more than a few hours on the computer, he gets more irritable and hyped up, which is not good for him as it causes us stress and is not a healthy behavior to carry into the real world.

This came to a head when he recently went to a summer class focused on game development. The students there would spend up to 7 hours working on computers, and that's when I noticed his irritability and hyperactivity was at the worst. So once the program was over, we told him that we would be setting time limits on his computer so as to prevent him from being too wired up, and he's becoming nearsighted and computers make it worse. On top of that, he is to choose a different career that isn't as heavily focused on computers.

He didn't take this well. He got mad at us and straight up said we were ""full of shit,"" which only proved my point and offended me quite honestly. I put my foot down and told him either he accepts the limitations or he won't have a computer at all, to which he begrudgingly complied.

Not too long ago I couldn't sleep so I went down to make myself some chamomile tea, and that's when I saw him on the computer, and he had gotten past our time limits. I immediately got on him and told him to turn off the computer now and that he was banned from it for defying our authority, but he told me that he ""did his research"" and I was wrong about the blue light, and after I told him he couldn't pursue a career in computers he felt like he had no choice but to go behind my back, and called me unsupportive and punitive.

This is where I lost it. I immediately demanded him to get out of his seat and I got on to see what he was doing, I found out he was learning a coding language called Rust, which further upset me. As punishment I deleted it off of his computer and all the programs he was working on, which he did not take kindly. He immediately began to cry and tell me not to do it as he approached me, but I told him that if he lays hands on me or gives me lip then I would call the cops and tell them he's harassing me, and he went to bed crying.

Since then he's refused to talk to me, or even acknowledge that I exist, and only does his chores when I say I'll take something away. His mood has been quite low, and today after he refused to eat dinner with us, my wife told me that I went too far, that I ""crushed"" my son and he's going to probably never see me in the same way again, and all of this has me feeling quite terrible about what I've done.

It has been 3 years since I have spent Christmas with all four of them. 

They were all going home for Christmas. I contacted them to see what day would work best. We all  agreed that the 26th was best. They said that they were spending Christmas Eve and Christmas morning with their mom. Two of them were having dinner with their partners parents and the other two were staying with their mom for dinner there.

I let ex know that we agreed that Boxing Day was when I would be getting together with them. I also said I wouldn’t mind a few hours Christmas night if they felt like coming over. She said ok. I was super excited and looking forward to it. I got a nice hotel suite with living room and kitchen/ bar for the occasion as there would be 9 of us. 

My parter and I arrived Christmas Eve and checked in. We hung out and relaxed. I texted the group to let them know we had arrived.

My daughter’s boyfriend invited us to their family dinner on Christmas night. After spending an enjoyable evening with them we returned to the room. I texted the two that were at their moms and said we’d love to see them if they were not busy. They came and spent about an hour and a half visiting.

The next day (Boxing Day) we all met at our room at about 1:00 PM. We opened gifts, played games, had snacks, pizza, and a few drinks. About an hour before everyone left I get a wall of text from the ex. Accusing me of taking all the time, being selfish, thinking of no one but myself. She went into all the work she did inviting them, making her house nice, making dinner etc. It was a rant and a half, she told me not to say anything to the kids because this was all my fault. I responded with a few lines saying I felt it was fair and that I had driven 10 hours. I left it at that and said my good nights to the family and they all left by 11:00 PM.

She sent another wall the next morning going over again how much of an asshole I was and how I made the choice to move so far away so why do I deserve any time. She also bitched about me arranging time in the summer to spend with them, saying they all had to take time off work. We spent  weekend together hiking. This was followed by a short text saying she missed the kids, her parents and she shouldn’t text when she was upset. 

I did not respond to any of this as I had a good Christmas and didn’t feel like engaging.

Let me explain. 
Wendy’s brother (Donald) had a problem with his friends. They would say even as a bisexual he couldn’t find love and he came to me to help him because they knew Wendy. I agreed to help him because I didn’t like seeing him upset as I consider him a good friend and I knew Wendy wouldn’t want like seeing him like that either.

I was ready to go in and play but Donald abruptly said no and explained that he didn’t want to be friends with them anymore since they as they were too toxic for him to be around. I silently hyped him up and drove him home after the fight was over.

I’ll admit we aren’t that bright but we thought it was a good idea at the time. She didn’t like that and said we could’ve come to her and asked her to help instead of doing what we did.

151,t3_rvoxkw,AITA for not letting my brother have my car?,"I (19F) received my current car (a used subaru crosstrek) as a surprise for my eighteenth birthday. This was during the first lockdown, and I was missing my friends, my senior prom, and just life in general. So getting a whole car as a present made me overjoyed. When things started opening back up, I used it almost every day (both to work and to go out with friends).

However, I couldn’t bring my car with me to college. I’m going to a college three states away, which would be a three day drive for me, and my family didn’t think it would be worth it. In addition, the town my college is in has pretty high prices for parking. So for the past year and a half, my car has been at home. I plan to get my car back as soon as I can, but, like I said, it’s expensive and a very long drive.

Recently I learned that my parents want to give my car to my younger brother (14M). He said that he doesn’t want my car, he thinks it’s a bad car. Which, yeah, it’s not the best but I love it, so to me it’s great. He also said that he would want to go fast (it doesn’t go very fast), and he would want to drag race and do other crazy stuff with it. This made me very upset because, in my head, I saw my car totaled on the side of a road (it’s very safe, so I’m not worried about my brother).

I brought this up to my mom, and she said that I would have to figure something out for my car since she and my stepdad don’t want it taking up space in their driveway. She told me to talk to my landlord and get the fee for my car added to my lease. For context, my apartment charges around $200 per month to park a car, in addition to the $850 I already pay in rent per month.

152,t3_rvosp4,WIBTA if I cut off a grieving friend due to my relationship issues?,"Okay, this is going to be long so bear with me. I have been dating someone (long distance) for more than 6 months now, and it has been amazing, even though we have had our fair share of fights. My bf studies in a very academically demanding uni, so his time is always divided into 70% study time and 30% free time for eating, showering, laundry and stuff. Whatever free time he gets has to be divided between friends and relationship (including the small breaks between classes, walking from one work thing to the other, stuff like that). I don't have that rigid or strict a schedule, so I used to feel like I was always available for him while he only talked to me when he felt like it (I have since realised that it's not a good place to approach a relationship from). We have had fights over it, but over time both of us have managed to figure it out well so now we are doing much better. We both think we have a healthy balance between work, relationship and social life now.

Two of our really close friends (R and T) recently started dating and have a similar situation as ours. R is in the same uni as my bf, and has a slightly more hectic schedule because of additional commitments. T has been feeling the brunt of this because R doesn't get to talk to her as much. She usually would come to me with ""how did you two manage?"" questions, and even though I told her how we figured it out, both me and bf believe (and have been vocal) that every relationship has it's own issues and we cannot and will not solve their problems and that they have to communicate with each other and not to us. Recently, R and T had been having a lot of fights, and she would constantly ask if she should leave, or if I would have left if I were in her place.

The thing is, I was in her position, but it didn't cross my mind to leave, ever. They broke up three days ago and she has been a mess ever since. She keeps asking me if it was the right decision and she makes it all seem so realistic and sometimes I end up questioning if I should have left (I dismiss it because we managed to work our way through and it's going really well). She started ranting to bf as well and he has been getting very insecure lately, constantly thanking me for staying even though he was a jerk and stuff. I don't like this dynamic, and both bf and I agree that this isn't healthy. We can't cut her out because we're the only people she trusts but it keeps wearing us down. Long distance had been really hard for us and we are still very gentle around each other, and her comments are genuinely bothering us at this point.

So, WIBTA if I go low contact with her?

**Edit 1:** I feel like I should clarify this, but I have already mentioned it to her to not constantly bring my relationship into the conversation, but she still chooses to do so, along with saying stuff like ""You wouldn't know how it feels because you have a perfect relationship"".

**Edit 2:** Wow I worded this horribly, but my only issue here is that she keeps comparing our relationships, and it's making us really uncomfortable and whether I would be a jerk if I cut her off because she won't respect that boundary. But yes, I see that I shouldn't let my relationship be affected by her words. 

tldr; friend recently had a breakup and keeps questioning my relationship, which is creating an unhealthy dynamic between my bf and I.",10.0
153,t3_rvosei,AITA for not wanting to give my mom 15k,"So my mom randomly came to me and said she’s been saving money for us and that my share was 5k and that we need to put it in an account. Knowing my mom and how she only thinks of money I was very surprised she was giving it to me. I am 24 and she has not once paid for anything for me after 16. Doesn’t even ask how schools going
Or how I’m paying for uni. 

She said that the money is for me to use when I settle down and buy a house. Okay….. so she makes me go to a bank with her and open an account. I still think this is weird so I ask her “is this so that I can save it for you? So that it’s under my name?” And she immediately goes “NO! how dare you even say that!? It’s yours!” 

So every couple weeks she’s bugging me about adding small amounts like $300-500 in. When she knows damn well that I only made about $1600 monthly back then and my rent was $1050 so where the hell would I get that amount that frequently. So fast forward 2 years and it’s come to about 15k because she added a 3k and my brother and I added more money. 

So she tells me today that she found a house she wants and that she wants me and and everyone else to give her the money because “you aren’t going to buy a house soon so give it to me”. I’m PISSED. How can she ask me this? She said she won’t borrow from banks because they will cost her interest but we should be happy to give it back to her because we didn’t use it. The audacity is insane. 

Now she is mad and crying because her kids are not “treating her like they should and at least I’m not forcing you to buy a big house for me” Am I the Asshole for not wanting to give her the 15k? 

TL;DR : My mom gave me 5k to start a saving fund and now wants all of the 15k that’s been saved up the last 2 years.

154,t3_rvoq7s,AITA for asking my dad to clean up after himself?,"I (21f), along with my younger brother (19m) currently live with our dad (55m) while we attend school. We moved in with him partly so we could go to school, and partly because our mother was extremely toxic and unfit to care for us at the time (we were 16 and 14 respectively). He's always emphasized to us that we didn't need to worry about contributing to household funds until we graduate, as he wants us to focus all our energy on schoolwork, and we're both extremely grateful for his support. He's a great guy, and he's honestly the only reason my bro and I turned out decent. That being said, he's not without his issues (who is, right?). Most of them are easy enough to overlook, but there's this one thing that's starting to become really annoying.

In repayment for our dad's support, we do everything we can to help out around the house, and handle the majority of the household chores. One of the major ones is regularly cleaning the kitchen, since it tends to get messy quickly. However, the reason it gets so dirty so quickly is because our dad will constantly leave food and dirty dishes out on the counter. When he makes food for himself, he leaves all the ingredients out on the counter, sometimes *overnight* if my brother and I aren't around to put them away. It's especially bad in the spring and summer, because all the food attracts bugs. Not to mention it's just a complete waste of food in general. It's gotten to the point where we have to deep clean the kitchen near daily, all because he can't be bothered to walk two feet over to the sink and fridge.

Every time we ask him to clean up after himself, his response is either *'that's supposed to be YOUR job'* or *'i pay the bills, so i'm allowed to be a slob'*. Mind you, it's not like we're asking him to clean up the whole kitchen or anything, just to put his used dishes in the sink and put food away when he's done with it.

I don't think this is a particularly outrageous request, but idk. I just feel like you shouldn't insist that someone doesn't need to help out with bills, only to then turn around and use that as leverage when you start getting called out for your behavior. My brother and I are starting to get frustrated, but since he clearly isn't going to budge, we're starting to wonder if we should just let it go. AITA?",21.0
155,t3_rvopbd,AITA for snapping at my dad,"Hi, hello. This is my first time writing a post on a subreddit, still somewhat new here so bear with me. 

So today, my family got together for a late new years lunch like we always do every year (just immediate family, I (26F) live with my parents but my sister is married and moved out). So my immigrant boomer dad (55M) was discussing with my older sister how he moved here and had to abide by the rules and regulations. He claimed that people in the Sikh religion shouldn't be able to wear their religious head covering if they work as a police officer and should wear a police hat like everyone else. He didn't seem open to learning the reason behind why they have to wear it all the time, and didn't seem interested in changing his mind either. He was arguing that they shouldn't change the rules to make one person happy. He also claimed carrying their concealed ceremonial/religious/sacred knife with them (not well versed in this religion), is equivalent to carrying a concealed machine gun, because you can kill someone with the knife, and it's ""illegal"" (I'm from Canada). He kept going on and on, he even touched on how being gay is wrong, and how he'll never accept someone for being ""that way"". This hit home since I identify as a bisexual woman (he doesn't know).

I ended up snapping at him and saying something along the lines of, ""This is why no one talks to you about things, you always ask why? Why? Why? Whenever they bring up their opinion and then turn it into an argument."" The room went completely silent. I believe what I said is true, but I kind of blurted it out without thinking in the heat of the moment. He replied, visibly upset with, ""Thanks, anxiety penguim, just what I wanted to hear."" Finished his drink, and then sat on the couch for a few mins before taking off to his room. I felt bad afterward since I know he's very sensitive even though he claims to be the opposite, like a macho man who never cries.

Afterward, I went up to my parents room to apologize for my outburst at my dad. He said ""there's nothing to apologize for. You're entitled to your opinion."" Clearly still upset. I've been thinking over about this conversation since it happened, hours ago. I regret even opening my mouth because I know he provokes these arguments just to get a rise out of us.

Tldr; in a heated debate on conservative vs liberal views, I got heated and told my dad no one talks to him about stuff because he always turns everything into an argument. 

Anyways, with all that being said, AITA?",4.0

(Mainly for the fact of me wanting to live with my father). 

I come home from Thanksgiving vacation with my Dad(38m), where I had to get my cat put down, (Rip King), and I'm told that my room has been moved to a room that was initially meant to be a walk in closet for my 11(m) Brother. My brother has 3 baby kittens that are pretty horrible, but I move on.

After having Christmas with my dad, I come home to my room trashed (which I had clean before I left.), all the money I had in my backpack stolen, and my bed was wet with cat piss. (My brother's cats aren't housebroken and are the worst.) Whats worse is that I can't close my door because the door is too big for the frame.

His cats constantly go into my room and at this point, it's been a month and a half, I'm tired of this. I go off on my brother for his poorly trained cats and how he can't keep them in his room (which they are not supposed to be free roam cats as my cat wasn't) and I go off on my mom for allowing him to have them when I couldn't have my cat.

My dad is having my back on this and he usually does (but if I'm in the wrong he wont.) And my mom is saying ""You're just emotional because you can't have YOUR cat so you're reflecting on your siblings.""

She, in a disrespectful tone, told me she was, and as I had other things to deal with and did not want to deal with a rude teenager, I told her, perhaps in a tone that could be considered yelling, to go upstairs to her room and get in bed if she was so tired. I know for a fact that she stays up till past ten, and if she’s always so tired, should go to bed earlier, but she does not. As punishment for being so disrespectful, I canceled her eye contacts appointment, and later, heard her crying in her room.

160,t3_rvoct2,AITA for asking for compensation and an apology for my cats?," So this happened three years ago, but brought up at a wedding on NYE by Brandy. Hence why it has been brought up again.

I(21F at the time) was living in an apartment with my husband Leo (25m), his best friend Erin(26M) and a close friend Derek(30'sM), including my two cats (4F&amp;M).My cats have big personalities, but generally have never shown a lot of behavior issues. Sally (Female cat) has always had a thing about doors being closed, aside from the front door. She would mainly just whine and attempt to open the door, but would give up. Well during our lease there something switched in both her and Jack(male cat). Jack is strong about boundaries, but he doesn't bite. Or at least he didn't until this big switch.

I had been upset because Erin had invited this 18yo girl Brandy to stay at our place and Brandy had to use me to call her mother and lie that she was just at an apartment with only women around and that she was sleeping in my bedroom. I wasn't asked if I was okay with this. I was put on the spot and I felt gross having an 18yo sleeping in a bedroom with a 26yo. I was working three jobs at the time so I wasn't home much. I had just assumed the arguments and general disrespect directed at me was what caused my cats to get really distressed and anxious.

Jack began to bite us in a clearly distressed state, unprompted. He was later diagnosed with bipolar and our vet asked if anything traumatic happened to cause this. We didn't know. He will be on antidepressants for the rest of his life.

Sally goes into a full panic attack when doors are closed, has ripped her claws out repeatedly trying to open doors and I've found blood on my floor from this. She also slams her body against the door on top of this.

This has been going on for 3 years. I've found a solid routine that keeps them happy and feeling safe. We have few incidents and generally I've found inexpensive vet care. Now to the present.

We went to a wedding and Erin and Brandy are there. They're now dating. She got drunk and at one point is sitting at a table I'm at and brings up my cats. She mentions that she used to bring them into Erin's bedroom despite him telling her not to when she was alone at our apartment. She mentioned doing this multiple times. First question I ask her is did she close the door? Yes. She then laughs and says ""I hope I didn't traumatize them more than they already were."" I told Leo later that night. Then I confronted Erin to see if he knew. He didn't. I asked if he could provide me Brandy's payment info so I could bill her. He freaked out on me, dragged Leo into it, and continues to say it wasn't her fault and that this isn't that big of a deal.

I'm being called an ah for this, and I've made it clear that at this point I don't even care about the money, I just want an apology and to make sure she understands the gravity of the situation. If you have any questions ask away.",3.0
161,t3_rvob1l,AITA for causing drama at a family gathering?,"I (30F) have been happy single almost my whole life, but I come from a really conservative culture and all my relatives assume I'm very unhappy due to the lack of a man in my life. So a few days ago, my elder cousin was getting married  and of course all the elders wanted to play matchmaker, so I was introduced to the groom's younger brother (Let's call him A). We did hit it off instantly but there wasn't any romantic inclination from both the sides. 

As the wedding was coming to an end, A's mother came to talk to me and said she was very happy about our decision and can't wait to be my MIL. I was very confused because I never agreed to marriage or anything of the sort. I kept saying about how A and I were just friends and none of us intended to marry. A's mother refused to listen to me, took me and A on stage and announced to everyone that we were getting married soon. 

 I looked at A and understood that he didn't have any part in this. She then passed the mic to me and asked me when i would like to get married. Naturally I took the mic and said ""never"" and walked off the stage. In fact I could hear the audible gasps from the audience as I was walking off the stage. 
I left the venue as soon as I could and as I was reaching home my phone kept blowing up with calls and texts from my family.

I ignored them all until the next morning when I called my mother and she kept shouting at me about how I should've just said ""soon"" and respected A's mother. I didn't understand how i disrespected her but i spoke to my cousin after this and she said it's all my fault and her in laws are treating her bad for everything that happened the previous day. Now my cousin wants to cut me off and all my family members won't talk to me until I apologise. I haven't spoken to A yet, because I don't know if I should apologise or not.

So AITA for causing all this drama at my cousin's wedding? 
(I'm sorry if there are any grammatical or spelling mistakes, English is not my first language)

Update: So I called A and we planned to meet and sort things out. He seemed pretty cool about everything. Turns out he's been dating a woman of a different ethnicity and was going to propose to her and that's why his mother was so hellbent on getting him married to someone of the same culture. He told me I didn't need to apologise to anyone. He also said my cousin and her husband are moving out of their in laws place and getting a house of their own and A is planning to go no contact with his parents. 
My parents are still mad at me but I'm pretty sure they'll come around. As for my family, I cut all of them off except a few relatives who reached out to me in support. So I guess all's well and I'm going to meet A again and his girlfriend in a few days. FYI A showed me a picture of her and they're a gorgeous couple.",254.0

We never had any problems with each other or disagreements about anything and this arrangement has always worked for us.

Recently my roommate has gotten into a serious relationship with this girl, and it didn’t take long for her to be over all the time. Then eventually she just flat out moved in, no discussions with me, not even a simple heads up. Whatever, fine I was cool with it.

Idk if it was just miscommunication on my part or just me assuming we were gonna be splitting rent 3 ways now, but when rent was due the next month I assumed I’d only be paying 1/3 of the rent due to there now being 3 people in the apartment. I then told my roommate that his gf needs to pay her third of the rent and his argument was that they share a room and they’re now paying the rent for their room together. I totally disagreed with this point because in my mind there’s 3 people living here now rent should be split 3 ways.

So then I talked to them both and stated that if she’s not paying her share of the rent she needs to leave instead of trying to leech off my roommate and she immediately started packing her stuff and throwing a huge tantrum in the process calling me disrespectful and all sorts of stuff.

Me and my roommate have been arguing about this for 2 days straight now he even told our friend group and everyone seems to think I was in the wrong.

She's very calm in general, but she's acknowledges that she gets really frustrated around a even the slightest lack of cleanliness.

Although some of what she said was a bit rude, and she also acknowledged that, I explained that it was likely because my laundry machine has been on the fritz at a bad time and I'm in the process of getting it fixed. Plus, I was almost late, so I forgot to put deodorant on before I left my place. I took full responsibility, validated the frustration I could hear in her messages, and gave an apology. She then said, ""I'll respond better after work. I'm your friend, I just want to help. The frustration of is also just with my current life. Don't worry.""

I just got out of an abusive situation where my old roommate's frustrations with her life were regularly taken out on me, so I'm I the asshole for setting this boundary with my friend?

""I got the sense that there was probably something else in your current life going on as well. Not that it invalidates your point about the smell and the frustration around it. But if you are feeling frustrated about things in general, I just ask that you refrain from bringing up any issues you have with me at that time. When you're not feeling that general frustration, I 100% want you to vocalize anything that I've said or done that's bothered you. Only because the general frustration can unjustly conflate the frustration you have towards me, which is normal, but also not something I shouldn't have to deal with. You know what I went through when I lived with Sam, and I realized after that situation I have to set a boundary right away around anything similar, as to protect other people's stuff from being taken out on me. So in the future, I need you to refrain from bringing up any issues with me during times when you're feeling frustrated about stuff in general. I know it wasn't your intention, but even some of the comments you made that you acknowledged were rude, brought me back to stuff Sam's said that I'm still getting over. The point is, if you have any issues in the future tell me when other stuff isn't going on. Then we're good.""

That escalated things. She said, ""Wow! I was legit trying to help. Just lay off me!! I always have something going on so looks like I'll never talk to you again.

Sibling told me that I was being insensitive because parent wanted their friends there because they don’t have any family and me showing them our planned guest list threw that fact in their face. That was in NO way the intention, it was just the topic. 
Fast forward, me and parent settled things and it was happy again. A couple weeks later my sibling sends me a rather mean text explaining how selfish it was not to invite so and so. Having been through this before I snapped and told them “Look if they have an issue they can come to me but who we have decided to invite was based on who we were close to and wanted to spend our day celebrating with and is our decision.” We went back in forth and ultimately decided to cut contact. 
Sibling got my parents involved. I was made to feel selfish because they said “it’s your way or the highway apparently, fuck your family then.” All because I wanted things a certain way for my special day and wanted specific people there, yet I compromised on a lot of people and decor and even the clothes. Heat of the moment and tired of all the stress and fighting the whole wedding was causing, me and spouse cancelled it. We sent out a general statement in letters apologizing for the inconvenience, but we were going to elope because it was only necessary for us to be there. I began getting hate texts from my family and friends and guilt trip texts and told them all I’d been dealing with the narcissism and manipulation my whole life and I was done with it and them. 
One of my parents came to me after things cooled down and asked that I join them for a talk at the local coffee shop, hesitantly I said yes. The whole thing was them calling me sensitive and giving half assed apologies and requesting I put the wedding back on. I declined and now we’re not speaking. I got eloped without them.

168,t3_rvny2h,WIBTA if i start charging my friends for reading/editing their essays for them,"i’m a senior in the middle of app season rn and i have multiple essays to finish before dawn so i’m going to try to keep this short.

bc much of my academic background is in writing, my friends view me as essentially their free admissions counselor and have been dumping their essays on me to read, edit, and go over with them meticulously. which i wouldn’t care about if they sent them earlier but they always send them a few hours before the deadline. 

we have a typical agreeement without strings where i might casually read over essays from time to time. but since apps started, they’ve been exploiting this obligation i feel. like i just spent the past 6 hours reading over long essays. i’m now many hours behind on my own applications, all due today. i might have to stay up for the next 24 hours.

none of them have offered (and when asked, have refused) to edit mine. they don’t provide substantial commentary even when editing mine. and when i say i’m busy because i truly am, they call me crying or spam my phone with angry messages.

i’m fed up, my energy and time and care spent toward their futures over my own (when i more than them need all the help i can get) has been wasted.

169,t3_rvnuou,AITA for not wearing my engagement ring?,"I know it may sound bad, but I think I am justified. My (29f) now fiancé (31m) recently proposed about a month ago after being together for 5 and a half years. He and I are very open with each other and value communication above all. We had the “do you want to get married talk” a few months before, mostly talking about what scenarios we’d prefer to propose in (like if he proposed to me I wouldn’t want a crowd, stuff like that). When he did propose he was very respectful of everything I had told him, except one thing. I had explicitly stated that I did not want a big, expensive ring because 1)I don’t like rings so I’d take it off all the time and 2) if I took it off, there’s a good chance I would lose it. He knows that I’ve never been one for jewelry, and he knows that I lose things very easily. But he bought me a ring worth several thousand dollars (I had said a reasonable price would be at MOST $2,000, this ring was well over triple that). He said he consulted both his mother and mine when he went to pick one out and they all agreed on that one. 

I love the ring, it is beautiful, but I am far too afraid that I will lose it and just putting it on makes me stressed. Instead I’ve been keeping it in a safe place. My fiancé seemed okay with it for the first two weeks or so, but then he started asking if I would ever wear it out. I told him maybe if we went to a fancy place or somewhere with our families, but other than that I just wasn’t comfortable. I believe shortly after that he told our mothers, and now I am getting endlessly pestered by several family members on both sides for not wearing it and they keep saying that I’ll be a “bad wife” if I won’t wear my ring. I’ve been trying to negotiate with my fiancé, and I even said that if we got a less expensive ring, I’d wear it everyday that I could stand it. But I think I’ve really upset him and he hasn’t talked to me as much as usual for the past few days. I really want to give in and wear the ring, but every time I put it on I get so stressed that I can barely pay attention to anything else because I’m too worried about the ring. And I know that if I lost it, we would both be really upset. How should I go about this now? Do I need to apologize to him?

Tl:dr, my fiancé got me an expensive ring when I didn’t want one, and now everyone is upset that I won’t wear it.",15.0
170,t3_rvnqh6,AITA for not dropping off my sister a cheesecake I made?,"I (22f) made some personal cheesecakes that I am selling just for fun yesterday. My sister (25f) messaged me saying that she wanted one. Now before I go on, I would just like to not that she is currently getting over a cold in which she most likely caught covid since her husband tested positive. I am about 7 months pregnant and also she lives in another city 20 minutes away. Okay so since she messaged me, I told her she could have one once she felt better. As to which she responded “I don’t want to wait.” I just left it as that afterwards. Well the next day, being today, I sold some to a friend that lives in the same city as her but he picked them up from my apartment. He posted about them once he got home and my sister messaged me saying “You did not deliver this to him in lodi and forget about me :(“. I told her that she was right I didn’t deliver to him and that he picked them up. And again that I was not gonna deliver to her house until she got better. She proceeded to tell me that I didn’t have to come inside that I could just drop them off. (Mind you she has stairs leading up to her house and so do I but I get lightheaded or afterwards it’s hard to breathe) So I told her that tomorrow I have an appointment out of town passing her town and that I can drop one off since it’s on the way but also told her that (this is where I feel I may be the asshole)  “It makes no sense for me to waste gas to drive to your city to drop something off and then head back home. If you really wanted it, you would’ve came and picked it up. I’m not trying to be mean sister but think about it. You want something that I’m selling. For me to drop it off and gain nothing from it doesn’t make sense. Luckily I’m heading that way tomorrow so it’s on my way.” After I said that she said don’t bother.

173,t3_rvnhak,WIBTA if i (18M) bought a present my partner (18F) planned to buy for me?,"TLDR: my girlfriend said she would gift me something for me for christmas, but didnt, said she will sort it out soon (edit: a few days after) Christmas day and hasnt mentioned it since, but i really want it (keep in mind its worth roughly 15 dollars). WIBTA if i bought it for myself?

now, its very likely im overthinking this, and its very likely nobody cares. but here i go.

so, this last christmas, my girlfriend (18F) bought me (18M) a jumper for christmas, which was fantastic, but it wasn’t everything she planned to buy me. were pretty transparent in what we buy one another, it removes the stress of christmas for her (she doesnt like surprises), as theres basically no incidents of one party spending far too much money, making the other uncomfortable. honestly, i dont care much about having bought her more gifts than she bought me, or whatever. she was happy, and that makes me happy.

we come from two very different financial backgrounds, and are in two different financial situations. while im still looking for work but have savings, she recently started a new job and spent her savings on a car, (with her mum and ex-step fathers help). while my family is pretty much fine with money, things are quite unstable as of late for her. which brings me to christmas. 

by all accounts, she didnt have much time to prepare her present for me, she was on holiday in another state for christmas, however she did tell me what she was getting me about a month (or perhaps more) before christmas, which includes the item in question she did not buy for me but i want. my opinion, she was very preoccupied with the trouble at home, didnt have much money to spend at all, and chose to buy the thing she wanted me to have the most (the jumper). 

now, she is working quite a lot, and with expenses like registration and insurance on her car, i dont think she has much disposable income, even with how much she is working. she has shit to save for, theres more important things for her to buy than a book for me. plus, our anniversary is coming up, and shes indicated she plans on buying me something, i dont know what. 

while i would be fine with buying the book myself, i would like it more if she bought it for me. it has sentimental value for me, and to an extent her as well. i will still enjoy it, its part of my childhood which im now leaving behind me, but it feels strange nonetheless. 

i think its possible it will hurt her feelings if i buy it myself, but its hard to know. going fully transparent and asking if shes bought it and saying if she hasnt, i will, feels harsh and i dont want her to feel self conscious about the imbalance in gift reception, which would definitely be exacerbated if i do this. also, buying it and not telling her is off the table because i dont want her to waste money in the case she has or will buy it for me. + i dont think shed give it to me for our anniversary or my upcoming birthday, wed both find that awkward i think.

so, WIBTA?

EDIT: just to be clear, the gift exchange went ahead on the 29th, a day after she got back from holidays, and she said she would get the rest for me later when i pulled out the jumper from a christmas bag",0.0

175,t3_rvnacw,AITA for refusing to apologize for swearing at my dad?,"I, (18 trans M) live with my parents and siblings - two brothers and a sister. All older. One of my brothers has autism and doesn't really grasp drama in the family, so I'm going to leave him out.

My father and I have always been at odds. One night, we were watching an LGBT movie together, and started arguing about it. I was speaking about how he reacted to my coming out as transgender and bisexual, and how his reaction to it all wasn't exactly accepting right away. He became defensive, and the argument escalated from there. It became heated, and I swore at him. His response was to kick me out of the house. No joke. Nothing left out. The exact exchange was ""Fuck you."" ""Get the fuck out of my house."" He then proceeded to chase me up the stairs, tell me I had 5 minutes to pack, and forced me to leave. I barely had time to say goodbye to my sister and mother, who were barely waking up from the noise. (This was late at night, for context.) My brother witnessed it all, which is very important.

So I left, spent a couple hours on the street, and eventually made contact with my friend who agreed to let me spend the night with her. My siblings came to find me before my friend arrived to pick me up, and we talked the situation over. It turns out, my father had told my mother and sister that I had left of my own accord, and that despite trying to stop me, there was nothing he could do. I insisted. This, of course, was a lie. My brother confirmed this, and told me that he watched my father manipulate the situation to make himself seem like the victim. I left with my friend shortly after, but we decided that the next day, we would inform my mother about everything and confront my father.

The next day, my mother invited me back home, and we sat down with my dad. We confronted him with the lies, how he kicked me out, how he acted, and how he had completely destroyed my trust in him. His response was to focus on what I had done wrong: swear at him. Whenever we would bring up anything that he did, his response was to get increasingly upset at me for swearing at him. This is something that my siblings and I do to both parents, and something they do to us. It has never been an issue up until this point. My mother and siblings said I should apologize. I refused. I wasn't going to apologize to him after how he reacted. It wasn't that I didn't feel sorry for hurting him, it was that I didn't want to take the heat off him. A part of me also believed that he wasn't actually upset, he just wanted something to blame me for. My siblings say they understand where I'm coming from, but my entire family thinks I'm being a jerk.

176,t3_rvn7gp,AITA for being upset that my husband barely acknowledges me because he is focused on gaming after barely seeing him for weeks?,"My husband of 16 years is an avid gamer, one of the things I love least about him, but I knew it when I married him and love him too the end of the earth anyway. He is almost always either playing when I come home from work or watching someone else playing on his computer.  Since we don't have much time together (we work opposite shifts) when I come in I want to watch something with him or play a board game, or a cooperate video game (anything but first person shooters, I will literally throw the controller at the tv in frustration) before he leaves for work. Usually I try to patiently (I admit I do not always succeed) wait until his is done, which could take up to an hour or two.  Most times he finishes the round, then we do something together.

In the last three weeks my job has been insane with half of my staff out sick, so I have been pulling 14 to 16 hour days with no time to spend with him. Last night we made plans to watch a little TV when I got home.  He was watching someone on the computer, so I sat reading AITA and waited. An hour later he asked if we were going to do anything and I said I was waiting on him. He got frustrated and said I should have said something. As tired as I was (I worked from 11am to 2am) I know I over reacted and got upset, then showered and went to sleep because I just did not want to deal with him. 

Today finally had some time, brought home dinner, and waited again while he finished his game. An hour+ later I asked when he would be done, and he got frustrated with me again for not saying something earlier. I told him I didn't have the energy for this again and left the house until he went to work.

177,t3_rvn4p1,AITA for telling my ex he needs professional help?,"I dated my ex for just under 8 weeks. He’s a great guy, we were compatible, but I kind of freaked out last week.

My ex has a high stress job and told me he needed me to be dependable and consistent. He began needing help with anxiety attacks. Sometimes he would call me when he was spiraling and I would talk him through the attack until he had color in his face again.

Then he started becoming distraught over minor medical issues. He thought he was seriously ill because of a rash, and wasn’t sure if he would make it through the night. 

I didn’t have a problem with helping him. I care about him. I’m a caring person. I’m not judgemental.

However his intense anxiety started to turn into him being controlling of me. He would have a meltdown if I didn’t respond for a few days because I was sick. Then he needed me to send my location, or use the bathroom at specific times, or other weird things like send him selfies before I went to bed. He said I could no longer turn my phone off without telling him the duration of the time.

We had an argument because he forgot the name of my universit where I currently study. Honestly I was upset because he has been continually needy, stressed, and he can’t remember any details about my life.

I admit I lost patience and told him I think he needs professional help. I told him I felt like a therapist, and as someone with mental health issues, it’s not healthy and I’m drained.

He has since stopped speaking to me. It’s been a week. He said he wants to date other people.

We flew back to our home town in the Midwest for winter break. He went hiking and gave himself a minor injury, so he decided to get a sports massage to hopefully help. I decided to book a massage for myself at the same time just because I like them, and we could hang out after.

So after we got done around the same time, my friend was making small talk with the masseuse while paying. The guy asked if he’s in college and then asked where he goes. No one from our area ever goes to Ivy League schools or even East Coast schools at all. There’s a weird sentiment here where schools outside the state are demonized, especially selective institutions. Most people have never met an Ivy League student.

My friend gets super weird reactions when people ask where he goes and he says Harvard. They either act shocked and bombard him with questions or get weirdly confrontational. No matter what, it makes the conversation weird, and he’s introverted so he doesn’t like that.

But I was surprised when my friend straight up lied. The masseuse asked where he goes to school, and he said Boston, and the masseuse asked which school, and my friend said BU. I reflexively corrected him and was like “uh, he goes to Harvard.” Then the masseuse got weirdly passive-aggressive really quick. He was like “Harvard, aren’t we fancy? Well, I was a lowly community college student, but I still managed to become a successful masseuse. I never left our state for the East Coast because I know my roots. I’d never want to go near the coasts.” He was rambling unprompted. It was weird.

It has gotten progressively worse. It has affected her life a lot. She has spent the last year working out excessively, fasting and trying fad diets, and cutting calories everywhere she can. We cannot take photos without her freaking out about “how fat she looks” and she is constantly texting me telling me she’s having a mental breakdown over “how fat she is” where I have to spend a considerable amount of time reassuring her. 

She is by no means overweight. I don’t know her exact weight, but I do know she wears a size 2 or 4 in pants and Small or Medium in tops. After her year of obsessive healthy living, she is more muscular but pretty much the same size. I’m no expert, but I think it’s because she didn’t have a lot of fat to trim to begin with. No amount of telling her she is not fat will convince her otherwise. 

Now, today she texted me in one of her breakdowns. She went out tonight and took some photos and “can see her fat” in them. She has slacked on her routine this past week or so because of the holidays. I snapped. I told her that I no longer know how to respond to her delusions and that she needs to seek therapy for possible body dysmorphia or something. She argued that she was feeling skinny before the holidays but because she spent a week eating unhealthy that she is fat again. I told her that it is physically impossible for one week off to cause a major setback. She sent me comparison photos, the most recent being before the holidays, to show me how skinny she had gotten before taking a week off. I told her there is almost no difference in the photos except that she is visibly more muscular. She got upset and said “now you are making me mad. Are you saying all that working out was for nothing?” I said I was just trying to show her that she was never fat to begin with and that her weight is only a problem in her head. She has not responded. 

She recently got engaged, and before the end of our convo I asked if she was gonna let these thoughts ruin her wedding.

I wanted to talk about insecurities, lack of appreciation, and Kota, a mutual, toxic friend and a lot of criminal details were later revealed about them.

We all agreed to meet that Friday, Dec 17th, but we didn't decide on a place to meet at. Come Friday Melon skips out due to her sister needing help and school work. Which is completely fine, school is important but the cancellation made me disheartened. We rescheduled for that Saturday, Dec 18th, at 6pm.

It is now Saturday a few hours before the meet-up, and I was very stressed from the fact that my sister asked me to spend time with her. I had to make a choice and I originally chose my friends. Mango got to our meet-up place early, but Melon was not there. She had gone to go see a movie and was running late (No one had informed me of this beforehand). 

While getting ready I had realized if Mango or Melon had approached me telling me they needed to talk about something serious, I would have dropped everything in order to be there for them. This sent me into sobbing fits, mild anxiety attacks, and mild hysteria. My family had told me if they would not make time for me then I should go to the hockey game with my sister. I did so, telling the two friends at 6pm that I was not going.

After that I later sent a text addressing what I wanted to talk about. To summarize Melon and Mango see nothing wrong with putting other things before me, but this all just made me feel like a second priority. That I should be grateful for being able to make it into their “packed schedules”. This conversation made me feel like I was not as important to them as school, work, and family. I feel as if the effort I put towards them is not matched. 

I later sent each of them a dm. I said Melon needed better communication skills, just like all of us. Mango, I quoted her words and explained in detail that she hurt me by saying this, and I also made the huge mistake of mentioning her family. They were all based on assumptions, but I had gotten all of them from Mango. I haven’t heard her ever speak kindly of her family. My point with bringing her family up was that they are the foundation of our relationships, and her relationship with her family sometimes infects our friendship.

Melon and Mango were both hurt by the dm, and I felt like our friendship was going to be a lost cause all due to my fault. Melon and I somewhat repaired our relationship, but I still have mixed feelings. Mango does not even want to talk to me, she ignores me the entire day.

I was on vacation with my family when my Mom started opening up about what was going on her end, starting with ""don't tell them I told you, but...""

I was deeply troubled by the fact that she was telling me something she told me in confidence.  To make matters worse, I felt like she was trying to insinuate to me my sister was mentally unstable, the exact kind of gaslighting she went NC over.  

I don't fully trust my parents side, and went to my sister and told her everything my parents said, my feelings about it, and asking for her side.  She got understandably upset about it and confronted them about it.  

After they learned I told her, everyone else in my family is *pissed* at me and saying I violated their trust.  I don't understand why what they did wasn't wrong or violating my sisters trust, but me telling her was violating their trust.  My mom even accused me of victimizing her, and when I responded depressed told me to stop playing the victim.

Waking up and seeing their excitement was such a special moment for me. I loved every minute and profusely thanked him for letting me be a part of it. He said he enjoyed having me be a part of it as well and I left feeling the happiest I have in a long time. Fast forward to NYE, and everything in the relationship had been going well. The guy was having a small gathering of close friends and his girls at his house to watch the ball drop. The girls spent the majority of the night with me until they started to get sleepy (For transparency, I did nurse a cider and their dad nursed a glass of wine while they were up). When the girls went to sleep, I had a few more drinks with the group. I definitely was not sober but I wasn’t belligerently drunk either. As I’m talking to one of the wives, I noticed that one of the new girlfriends keeps hanging all over my boyfriend and only my boyfriend, putting her arms around him and just hanging on him, kissing his cheek, etc. At no point did my boyfriend tell her to get off of him. I passive aggressively made a joke in my drunken state that I might have to smack someone. I know I shouldn’t have said it, I was just annoyed that my boyfriend didn’t respect me enough to deal with the situation. Ironically, everyone else knew it was a joke, because I’m 5’2” with no upper body strength and cry if a bug gets smashed, but my boyfriend got angry that I made a scene. I was hurt and dumbfounded but moved passed it. As everyone is chatting, one of the twins wake up and call out for their dad to move her upstairs to her bedroom. I follow him to help move the other twin as well, like I’ve done other nights, and he yells at me to get out, they’re his girls. It felt like a punch to the stomach. I had helped put them bed before, I’d taken care of them all night, and then he was angry? Worse, the entire group heard and stopped talking. It felt like they were all looking at me with pity and I had to step outside to maintain my composure. I was embarrassed and couldn’t understand how only 6 days prior, he included me in such a special moment While the boyfriend moved his children upstairs, I packed up most of my stuff and quickly left with one of the wives without him knowing. He’s now blaming me that I overstepped with his girls and shouldn’t have made a scene about the girlfriend hanging all over him. He will only talk to me through text, and I’m pretty sure we’re done.

Most of the music is stuff I listened to as a teenager which I still love now. In fact I have tickets to see one of the main artists in the next couple of months, but I’ve already seen them 3 or 4 times, met them once.

My parents never liked my music. I think at first my mum thought it was ‘devil worship’ music, but I always thought she got over that thinking (for those who are curious, my favourite band is My Chemical Romance and what I listen to is usually similar to them).

During Christmas, my mum was fiddling around with the Spotify playlists on our shared family account. Then today I felt like listening to some of my old music. But it wasn’t there.

My entire 30+ hour playlist was gone. I don’t know if it was on purpose, but I’m assuming it wasn’t. I feel like it would be petty to bring it up to my mum, but it still took a long time to create it and I’m kind of upset about it.

191,t3_rvlch2,AITA for letting my adult son choose his room first?,"I have 2 kids, a 22 year old son, and a 15 year old daughter. We're currently moving into a bigger house, and it has 5 rooms. One of the rooms is a basically a mini apartment, with a mini kitchen, bed and bathroom. It is also relatively far away from the other rooms, as it is on the other end of the house. 

My son still ""lives at home"" but in reality he travels for work a lot. I mean, pretty much he's traveling for work every third day, so it just doesn't make sense for him to spend money on his own house when he's not even in it half the time and wouldn't be able to properly maintain it due to the lack of time. 

He also makes a boatload of money due to his job, it's a pretty public market and he's relatively famous so I won't give any more details than that. 

My daughter obviously lives with us, and needs her sleep due to school and whatnot. The issue this brings is that my son often has flights come in at 3:00 am or worse, and our new house has thin walls. 

When we were moving in, I decided to let my son choose his room first, and he choose the mini apartment room. I was happy he chose that because it meant nobody else would get woken up by his entry and exits. I also think it'd be good for him to have that room because it might encourage him to get his own house, because he'd see how great living alone is. 

My daughter made a stink about it because she wanted that room as well, saying it was unfair that he got that room and she didn't. She is claiming that I love him more than her, but the thing is that she doesn't need that room, her room is big, has it's own bathroom, and really is what a normal teen should have. 

I'm trying to cater to both their needs, but she just wants to take as much as she can.

192,t3_rvlbr5,WIBTA for trading all my old game systems for a Switch and then making it my Switch?,"A couple days ago I (26M) found a listing on Facebook where this dude wanted to trade his switch for some retro/old consoles and handhelds. I have several old consoles that I haven't played in a long time. My wife (of almost 3 years) had the idea that the switch could go to her parents house for the kids (6, 7, and 9) to play over there, where they also have a WiiU. We just bought them a switch for Christmas. They spend about 4 days a week at their grandparents house when wife and I work. I got upset and told her no, the switch (from the potential trade) was not going over there, as I was using all of my old systems to trade for it. (Partially because I need to let go of them, also because we just don't have room to store them all anymore.) I offered the solution of letting the Christmas switch go back and forth between houses if grandparents got a dock for their house. She didn't seem to like my opinion that because the consoles are mine the switch should be too. WIBTA?


Also I feel I should mention, before anyone says something about giving up everything when I decided to get her pregnant, I claim these kids as my own. I am their dad. But I am not their father. 2 different fathers for the 3 kids. And I will edit as more details seem to be needed to be brought to light.


EDIT: After reading through a few of the comments, I realized I forgot to mention, I was the one that said no to the Christmas switch going back and forth initially for two reasons. 1. My kids are hard on stuff. And I didn't want them destroying it and whatnot. 2. I wanted to see how they would act if the were only allowed to have it at home. As another added note I should also mention, their grandparents got them 2 other games for the switch which have been at our house this entire time. (About 2 weeks.) Which I don't mind them going over there with the switch to play, but it is partially their lack of observation that makes me worry they will end up breaking the Christmas switch.

193,t3_rvl3m6,AITA for not responding correctly to my sister’s vent,"Okay, I’m positive I’m the asshole here so I’m mainly posting this because I don’t know how to interact with my sister (or anyone, probably) when it comes to her venting.

So today my sister (R) and her SO went to the store with my oldest sister (L). Where they were at caused both R and her SO to become extremely overwhelmed and overstimulated. L didn’t know this and wasn’t helping, accidentally stressing R more. They picked up my brother after, who was also being incredibly annoying. Overall it was a bit of a shit show for her today. 

An hour after they got back, R relayed all of this to me, explaining that her SO got so overwhelmed that they started crying.

The things about R is that she is more emotional and empathetic while I am not. My lack of emotionality is definitely more of a character flaw than not. (I promise I’m working on it)

While she is venting all of this to me, I’m not sure what response she is looking for or how I should act. I learned that it can be good to ask questions when someone is feeling emotional, so then they could come to their own conclusions. I’m sure this is bad advice because I just ended up sounding like a therapist and that isn’t what felt appropriate. I also asked if she talked to L about this but she said it wouldn’t change anything (I disagree). I tried to switch the tone and said that getting a car might solve some of those issues (*current circumstances make getting a car a non-issue). This also wasn’t the right thing to say. She ended up just walking out.

Cut to a few hours later, she told me I made her feel bad because she was only trying to vent and I kept saying the wrong things. But she knows me to be a blunt person and I just didn’t know how to interact in that moment. I didn’t handle the situation great but I also did the best with what I knew how to do.

So AITA?

Edit: I’m editing this about 30 minutes after I posted this because I move quick. As per advice from some commenters, I talked to my sister about it. We were able to connect on what to expect out of the other when talking and communicating. 

We did, however, get really stuck on the whole “car” topic, which derailed the whole thing. Basically, she thought it was irrelevant to her vent because it didn’t solve what already happened, while I thought it was incredibly relevant because it would solve the future issue. We left the conversation probably more frustrated then before but I assure you tomorrow we’ll be shootin’ the shit.

Not with her, she kept bouncing around the TV stations trying to find a NYE special she liked, but then kept complaining there wasn't a good one on.

195,t3_rvkvjx,AITA for “ruining” Christmas?,"My wife and I (36F, 36M) have two children Nora (10F) and Hayden (8M).

In the weeks leading up to Christmas, Hayden’s started to get in trouble a lot and had really bad behavior in general, which is surprising considering this has never happened before. We would often get notified by his school that Hayden has been getting himself into trouble. He has also been falling behind in his schoolwork and has often been getting low grades at school. His behavior isn’t as bad at home but he can still sometimes be disrespectful to all of us and he has been verbally aggressive a few times. 

My wife doesn’t punish him and is going easy on him because he says he is struggling to cope with the fact that his best friend is now gone. Hayden’s best friend moved away over Thanksgiving and it has been pretty hard on him. They have been best friends since Hayden was only 3.

Both my wife and Nora have been gentle with him and have done things with him to keep his mind off the fact that his best friend is gone. It works for awhile but then it seems whenever Hayden goes back to school, the bad behavior comes back up again and Hayden gets in trouble. Personally, I think Hayden deserves discipline for the amount of times he has gotten himself in trouble. 

Right before school got out for Christmas break, Hayden had been physically and verbally aggressive at school with both his classmates and his teacher. As a result, he was excluded from the class Christmas Party and had to spend that afternoon in the principal’s office. I was livid, because Hayden’s behavior was not getting any better and my wife was not doing anything about it.

I decided that Hayden had to be disciplined because that was the only was his behavior would improve. After my wife went to bed on Christmas Eve night, I decided to take all of Hayden’s presents and hold them until next year. I also took everything out of what we put in his stocking and replaced it with some coal.

On Christmas morning, Hayden started crying after he saw that he didn’t get any presents and got coal in his stocking. I told him that because he had been bad these past few weeks that he was put on the naughty list and that he should learn to behave if he wants any presents next year. 

My wife didn’t know about this and took me aside and said she was infuriated that I would do such a thing and that I should have known how hard it has been for Hayden that his best friend was gone. I told my wife that discipline is the only way to fix his behavior and that he will get those presents next year, so it’s not like he will never get his Christmas presents.

Hayden was grumpy the whole day and it seemed to make everyone else grumpy. My wife told me it’s all my fault for ruining everyone’s Christmas, but personally I believe it was Hayden’s behavior that ruined Christmas, because this wouldn’t have happened if he wasn’t being such a brat these past few weeks.",34.0

197,t3_rvkh5f,WIBTA if I asked a friend to not speak to my immediate family at my wedding?,"I am getting married in about 2 months to the most wonderful man in the world. We have a group of friends who are all obviously invited. 

One person in this group, let's call her Jamie, lives with my fiancé and another person in the friend group. She and I have a somewhat strained relationship. I'm not exactly sure how we got to this point. I think mine and Jamie's opinions are often polar opposites and she takes that as a personal attack on her instead of just realizing we have different ways of doing things. Most of the time I am blindsided because while I am doing/saying whatever she is not on my mind and does not directly involve her. I have no problem with her and generally brush off any snarks by the next morning. 

So why don't I want her around my family? 
My sister was planning to come out for 2 weeks and help me with wedding planning. To save on drive time my fiancé asked if my sister could use the guest room for a couple nights. I thought it shouldn't have even been a discussion, the room was not in use and we would be out most of the day anyways. It's not the first time a roommate has had a friend or family stay over. Roommate seemed surprised, fiance stressed it was only a couple nights, we could keep to ourselves. She ended up saying no because she was getting her second covid shot and 'didn't want people coming in and out of the house while she was recovering'. By that time it didn't matter anyways because my mom was able to visit as well and they got a hotel room, but I was still thought that was a lousy excuse. 

The following weekend (vax recovery over) I was at fiancé's house and my family came by to pick me up. They were inside for less than 5 minutes and somehow Jaime managed to insult me to my mother. Luckily it was pointed so it went over my moms head. I tried to forget about it but I still can't get over the audacity. The next time my mother came up in conversation she used it to say that my mom is not a good pet owner because one of our dogs got out frequently, (A rescue dog that took a long time to realize this was home now and could jump an 8 foot fence, despite them paying $$ to raise the height. She will stand at an open gate all day long now). 


Ultimately I want to protect my family and not allow them to be put in an awkward situation at the wedding. I don't want her trash talking me to them and I don't want them to unwittingly agree to some veiled insult at me. But I realize this is not giving her the benefit of the doubt and making some unflattering assumptions.

All of my life I have been sending money overseas for my oldest daughter since she was about 13 up to about when she was 31. The reason i had stopped sending then was because of an incident that occurred when the youngest traveled but also because when i sent the oldest 3k to buy land for her own wellbeing, she decided to splurge it and call it 'dirty money' As a result i decided she was old enough to fend for herself and that i needed to focus on the youngest (a minor at the time)

After a few years I got in contact again with the oldest thanks to whatsapp. For two years i tried to help her flower business by sending money and packages filled with stuffed animals and things she could sell in her business but she kept giving away things to her aunt that she grew up with and her sons (who are beyond over age). My daughter had a minor herself (16M) and i had repeatedly reminded her that she had to look out for his welfare. The youngest tried to help her get a visa to the US but ultimately the oldest said she didn't want to come to the US because she heard its hard work that she doesn't want to do.

I was skeptic at first because my daughter has lied about being bedridden by covid (i sent someone to check then) and promptly received various swears and curses by my niece for being a terrible mother by being uncaring.

Today its been confirmed she has a tumor in her liver and that she will soon be tested to see if its cancerous or not. My family has blasted me and called me the asshole for not wishing to get involved economically nor emotionally.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to call even though my oldest daughter hasn't reached out to me at all?

EDIT: 
Hello thanks for the responses, i wanted to add the INFO people have been requesting:
The oldest doesn't live with me because the time i immigrated from Ecuador was when the banks collapsed around the 90s. At the time the currency in Ecuador was sucres which converted to USD would make people rich back home. I considered this my best option and any risk was worth putting food on the table for my mother and my daughter who was a minor at the time.

I want to add that yes she has called me out on abandoning her but i hadnt immigrated legally at that time, i left her with my mother due to the situation. I did try to get her to immigrate before various times throughout that 13 - 31 range but she claimed she was too attached to my mother and she didn't want to immigrate.",10.0
202,t3_rvjo8k,AITA for refusing to take my coworkers shifts?,"I (19F) work at a small grocery store that everyone in town uses, doing E-commerce, pickup, and Courtesy clerk. I essentially work 2 departments as E-commerce and pickup are meshed together. 

Most of the people I work with are young teens with the understanding that my job is only an influx of money while I wait for my Military enlisting process to finally send me to basic training. 

I have one coworker in particular that got ahold of my personal phone number in November of 2021. If that didn’t irritate me his messages every other day about picking up his shift that day, really did. 

I went up 2 hours away from where I live and work to MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Station)in December, with all department staff knowing. I had checked into the hotel, gotten into my room at 15:00.

At 16:00 I had a call coming through, sure enough this coworker (17M) wanted me to pick up his 17:00 shift that day. 

When I told him no, he tried saying that if I actually needed money while waiting on the military I “should just pick up extra shifts.” 
Granted I don’t announce when I pick up a shift I just show up and get my work done, I was a little stunned to hear that. 

I tried to remain calm and explained where I was and that I had announced the day before I was unable to work. He just repeated that I don’t actually care for the money. 

I lost it and told him he is not to ask if I want to cover his shifts anymore and that if he does try to call or text again I will be blocking his number. 
Shortly there after I informed management of the situation and have yet to see this employee since.

203,t3_rvjnxu,WIBTA if I missed a funeral due to work?,"CW: Death

My spouse (34NB) and I (33F) found out over the holiday that a friend of ours passed away suddenly. This loss was particularly hard for my spouse because they lived with the deceased for a number of years before we eventually moved in together and got married. I was also a friend to the deceased and saw them frequently at gatherings and parties and such over those years. I have done my best to be supportive of my spouse through this time. After I heard about what happened, I reached out to my supervisor after Christmas and told him that a friend passed away and I was planning to go to the funeral whenever the arrangements were made known.

I have worked with my company for seven years. It is unionized and I make decent money. Every January, no one is allowed to call off of work. Bereavement is usually reserved for immediate family. I became aware of the arrangements today. I also found out today that my department has mandated overtime for the entire week next week.  My spouse is scheduled to work the evening of the service but they might take the day off. 

I want to go to the funeral to support my spouse and pay respects to our friend. My work schedule will not allow me to go. I will feel awful if I miss this service.

I take some evening classes as I am more of a night owl and unless I get a early class will normally sleep in until 12pm. My grandma has started calling me early in the morning which wakes me up. I can't put my phone on silence since both my parents have health problems and if something were to happen I am their emergency contact (I am a only child). I talked to my grandma again requesting she not call me before 12 pm. Once again she didn't listen and called me at 9 am. I had been working the night before and did not get to go to bed until 5 am. I decided to get my mom involved and asked her to talk to my grandma. According to my mom she got hurt saying she wouldn't contact me again and wouldn't bother me. I called my grandma and said I am grateful for her always thinking of me and I didn't mean for her not to bother me, just to please take in account that I don't have a normal sleeping schedule and won't be awake as early as them. She said it is fine, but still seemed upset.
My mom says I need to compromise with my grandma and just let her keep bringing her food. I told her I tried to talk to my grandma again and we have talked several times about times when it is ok to call me and that she isn't respecting that. I want to keep hanging out with her but she needs to respect when I need sleep. My mom says I need to just get over it since I don't know how much time I have left with my grandparents and that my grandma is hurt because of this now.
A new semester of school is approaching and I have two evening classes the latest getting out at 11 pm. My earliest class starts at 9 am. Between my job, class, and completing class work I need to use the time I can to sleep. I mentioned this to my mom, but she said just quit my job and her and my dad can pay for everything and I need to compromise with them. They already pay for part of everything, anything I can't cover, and not working would be nice. At the same time I feel like that can be considered taking advantage of them and I start getting anxious when I'm not doing something.
I can't help but feel guilty now and wonder if maybe it's just because of lack of sleep that I wanted to lash out and that my grandma was the easiest target, so is my mom right?

205,t3_rvjjnt,AITA For refusing to work with my colleague,"This story is very brief due to character counts, apologies

So I (17m) work in a supermarket (Tesco clock and collect)
The whole story began with 2 of my colleagues. 1 of which I knew for years (50f) we'll call Lucy. The other being my colleague (27f) who I didn't know before working there who we'll call Haylee. Finally there is one of my good friends (17f) who we'll call Emma. 

So on my first ever shift on click and collect I was working with Lucy and Haylee. Near the end of the shift it BLEW UP between Lucy and Haylee in an argument about Haylee not doing a job that the manager had asked her and Lucy to do. Since this was my first shift I felt very awkward and stayed out of it. On that night I told both of them that I did not want to be involved in the situation.

A few months went by where I was mostly working with Haylee and Lucy separately. I got along with both well and a few people told me about other arguments Haylee had with other colleagues and she had made many accusations which turned out to be false. I just assumed these examples were exaggerated.

By this time Emma had gotten a job in click and collect and she had worked a few shifts with Hazel and Lucy similar to me She also knew Lucy as she's friends with her daughter. So the night after my shift with Haylee, Emma was working with her, and on that night Haylee had basically accused me of picking sides e.c.t. Emma messaged me that night and the conversation went roughly like this...

Emma: do you tell Lucy things that Haylee tells you about her

Me: nothing thats bitchy or anything bad so nah not really. Do you?

Emma: nah I don't but Haylee was accusing you of telling Lucy information about stuff she had said to you. She also sorta accused me.

So at this point I was pretty annoyed as I didn't see why she would just make this accusation and the whole thing was based off of someone (we still don't know who) telling Haylee that Lucy had reported her... First of all there was never even a report filed against Haylee.
Secondly I knew when I started that job that there was a lot of drama that went on in that department especially so I told myself that I would not get involved in it at all costs.

Emma literally had no reason to lie and I've been friends with her for 11 years and I know she doesn't get involved in drama similar to me. So she was really nervous at this point as she had only just started and didn't know what to do. Haylee even said to her ""I think you're a really genuine person but if you've told Lucy things then that will change"" this is what really annoyed me because I said many times I don't want to be involved and neither should Emma. So at this point I was just trying to avoid being involved with the whole situation. So Emma and I asked our manager if we could be taken off any shifts we had with Haylee

I am steaming mad. I went home for college and then traveled with my family down to my grandparents. I have been out (biromantic) to my parents for quite some time, and they're accepting but, at the same time, they really don't understand it. My grandparents, I really don't know here they lie when it comes to LGBQT+ stuff; they are relatively democratic, but everyone has their own opinions. 

Well, we were having dinner and somehow the topic of the LGBQT+ come up. My grandparents know that we, my sisters and I (f20), are very much pro lgbqt+. We have gone on protests and have participated in groups. The convo goes something like this:

Dad: Yeah, the reason OP supports it is because she's bisexual herself.

Grandma: Really? I would have never guessed. The again, she could change her mind.

Me: It doesn't really work like that.

Mom: And get this, she's also asexual.

Grandpa: What does that mean? I didn't know you can be more than one.

Me: It means that I don't participate in sexual activities. Though, it differs for every asexual.

Grandpa: So that means no great grandkids for us? 

Me: Well, not anytime soon with college.

I kind of zoned out at that point because I was SO SO SO uncomfortable. Again, I just turned 20 and I am a student athlete in college, in no way am I having kids anytime soon. The dinner finished rather uncomfortably, and I excused myself to go to our room and I balled my eyes out. I was so angry. They weren't unaccepting but they didn't seem to. be accepting either. My sisters came to check on me and comforted me. My mom then came in my room and ask what was wrong, and I told her angrily, though as quietly as possible, that she outted me. I didn't want them to know and she did it without my permission and that I couldn't trust either one of them right now.

She told my dad and he tried talking to me, but my sisters protected me and I refused to talk to either one of my parents for the rest of the day.

I don't know what to do. I am so angry and betrayed, my sisters are with me but I don't know how the heck I am supposed to face my grandparents again. My parents don't understand why I am upset, but I think I am in the right for being mad. I don't think I can ever trust them with something this important again.

For context: every spot in our garage is assigned. There are no free or open spots. We were on a waitlist to get one

I live in an apartment complex with a garage. I pay $80 for the spot every month, which to me, isn’t a small amount of money. There are frequent car break ins where I live and the area is pretty sketchy so I pay for this garage spot.

I came home last night from running errands and someone was parked in my spot. My assigned spot is in the corner against a wall. I left a note on their car letting them know that they were in my assigned spot and that they should call me if they want to get out. I parked my car in front of theirs and they were blocked in because the car that parks next to us was home. I parked my car in front of theirs because I pay for my assigned spot and I did not want to risk getting broken into for the night. 

In the morning I find a long note on my car word for word: “IDIOTS! What type of idiot parks in the parking garage not even in spot blocking residents from getting through if your car is not out of this garage tomorrow even if you're in a spot. I'm sure you don't own that spot &amp; management will have you towed I have pictures of your car &amp; license plate so remove yourself!! Nonsense”

They also wrote “try not to be a bitch this year” on my note and stuck it on my car. They were able to get out of the spot because the car that parks next to us had left. I went back to the garage and saw their car parked in a different spot.

210,t3_rvjeyf,AITAH for “berating” my mother over text,"
AITAH for “berating” my (30M) mother (55F) over text. For context; my wife (32F) and my mother’s relationship never started off right which had a lot to do with my mother treating my girlfriend, now wife poorly, I.e saying I should leave her due to her depression and anxiety, trying to not include her in family photos, stating she was only with me for my money (which is not a lot, she was just unemployed at the time). 

With the birth of our son 3 months ago they have made an effort to be more civil towards each other, until the start of December. During this time my recently divorced mother was more preoccupied with dating around than seeing her grandson but would often speak to relatives claiming we were “keeping him away from her.”  We spoke to her about this and offered a solution where she can see him, as long as we didn’t have any plans, but she had to ask first. 

This came to a head yesterday; our area has had a large increase of cases since the 26th and so we we’re refraining from visiting all family until cases died down; however my mother has continued to ask to have him visit. The real sticking point came when I went to her house by myself to drop off gifts for relatives when she told me she had a close contact with a confirmed case on the 24th and she only found out on the 27th but states her rapid test was negative; the issue is I had my son to visit on the 25th for a couple of hours, he has been fine but I was just so dumbfounded that she withheld that she had been in contact that I just left. When I got home I saw that she had texted saying, “it wasn’t a big deal and I was keeping him from her.” I told her how selfish it was to withhold the fact &amp; to continue to push to see him against our wishes, she asked if I treat my in-laws this way and I told her, “ I don’t have to, they’re doing everything we ask but apparently I have to tell you.” She is now telling family that I “berated her” and claim I’m “overreacting” and “treating her unfairly.” My wife is on my side and claims I took it easy on her.

So I moved in at the beginning of 2021 with my close friend from school lets call him John and his girlfriend lets call her Johnita and we are renting off of his mum who bought the house. My housemate John also happens to co-own a really cute dog with his brother and the custody arrangements are not unlike the one my parents had with me (basically bouncing back and forth haphazardly with no real pattern). That was all part of the deal really and I signed up for it and I love the dog he’s super cute except he is very poorly socialised not quite bite an elderly person and get taken to a farm with plenty of room to run around on more like he cant tolerate strangers so will aggressively bark for up to 30min upon meeting someone like a friend of mine or one of my family members or anyone who comes to the door or makes a human sound outside the house he can hear. 

He also frequently forgets I exist and will run in and bark when he hears me from another room only to realise he knows me then is a happy boi again. He usually takes 6+ frequent visits from someone to get kinda used to them. Also his bark is really loud like ear-ringing-cannot-yell-clearly-over-it loud. The worst part is he doesn’t respond to any sort of scolding and doesnt really understand any form of no or disapproval so he is a true unstoppable force. 

One fun occasion is when i brought my childhood dog around to hang out with for the last time cos he was old and sick and gonna be put down the next day but johns dog wouldnt stop barking (non playfully) at my dog and Johnita who was home at the time had to wrangle him upstairs and hold him in a room while i took my dog outside and then he still wouldn’ stop so eventually Johnita had to message me to politely “ask when my dog was gonna leave” after like 5 minutes of him being there. 

I have brought this barking issue up with John on a few occasions and to be fair i could have been more direct and serious with my complaints but i wanted to keep it kinda friendly and respectful but iv just been sorta laughed off and no action has been taken. I’ve even brought it up more seriously with his mum (our landlord) and basically said “listen the dog barking is really bad I just had an online invigilated exam and he barked for about 40 minutes non stop” to which the reply was something along the lines of “aww thats terrible haha”.

I just had a baby a couple of months ago, and as you can imagine, the weight doesn’t just magically disappear right away. I work at a prestigious animal hospital and we have a strict dress code and are all required to wear matching scrubs in a very specific color. I spoke with my practice manager (we’ll call her Nicole) when I became pregnant and told her that unfortunately, they don’t make maternity scrubs in our colors. She was very understanding and said it wasn’t a big deal. She is also understanding of the fact that I still only fit in my maternity scrubs. Today, however, my co-worker came up to me and said, “Hey, Dr. B (veterinarian/hospital owner) wanted me to ask you on his behalf why you aren’t wearing your uniform within our dress code.” My co-worker knows the reason why, but the doctor kind of forced her to be his little messenger anyways. I could tell she was embarrassed to ask me. I think it’s pretty obvious considering I still look like I’m pregnant. I stepped into the hallway and confronted Dr. B and said, “In case you’re wondering why I’m not dressed like everyone else, it’s because I’m still too fat to squeeze into regular clothes.” I was partially joking but also annoyed that I even had to explain myself. He seemed really embarrassed and caught off guard that I confronted him face to face about it. But also, I was really embarrassed that he felt the need to bring up something with an obvious explanation and then drag my co-worker into it as well. Not only that, but my practice manager (Nicole) is well aware that I can only fit in maternity clothing still. AITA for the way I handled this situation?

Our senior vet tech who is a good friend and has worked with Dr. B for 15+ years is a larger woman, and Dr. B allows her to wear a different brand/color/style than everyone else because she also cannot fit in the preferred style of uniform that they require us to wear.",4855.0

He tells me how he’s feeling crappy again and needs his rest. He goes to bed. I settle the kids but they’re still up so I go to lay down but put on the tv so I don’t fall asleep before they are. He throws a fit that I’m being disrespectful. So, AITA here? My kids are 7&amp;9 for reference. Normally I’d be happy to hang in the living room but I was exhausted and wanted to be comfortable. Also, I had the TV noise playing through my phone not the tv so it wasn’t loud.",7.0
218,t3_rviqeg,AITA for having a mental disability?,"So right off the bat, i need to explain that i am an able-bodied male with ADHD, so I'm not brain damaged or anything, just naturally less attentive than most people. My wife knows this, but still contestantly gets mad at me for basically having ADHD. Forget one or two items on the grocery list? Unacceptable. Lose track of time after a full shift at work (i work 4 ten hour shifts a week)? Silent treatment. Watch YouTube or play video games on my day off (again, 4 tens, but I work a lot of OT) and not notice something the dogs are doing? She rants. I'm not intentionally ignoring her or maliciously being inattentive. I just don't have the same level of awareness as she does. I tried explaining this to her, but she thinks I'm just being lazy and using my ADHD as an excuse to ignore her, saying how attention is something you can improve and I just need to work on focusing more or being more attentive. AITA?

Edit: Since a lot of you in the comments have asked if she's tried learning about my condition; yes. She has read a lot of online research about it and watched a lot of YouTube videos, even broadening as far as studies on ASD and nerodivergence in general. Despite this, she has flat out told me ""ADHD isn't permanent, you just have to learn how to change it."" I love my wife, and I'm not trying to make her look bad here, nor to victimize myself, but it's really starting to bea lot and make me wonder if I really am at fault

Edit 2: Again, addressing multiple commenters with one update. I'm seeing a lot of advice to get pharmaceutical medication, since I mentioned in comments that i mostly manage using CBD and other natural remedies. For clarification, this is actually a decision my wife DOES support me in, as she both sees the remaining side effects AND has had issues with ""prescription drugs"" on the past herself.",0.0
219,t3_rvipbw,AITA for not being thankful for my mom asking for forgiveness.,"Tried keeping the back story short but failed, sorry. 

So I (19) don't have a good relationship with my mom (40s) and live with my dad and stepmom (both 40s). Until I was twelve I spent two weekends with my dad and the rest of the time with my mom and half-sister (teenager). 

I'm sure my mom tried her best while raising the both of us but to be honest, she messed up. She occasionally used us as emotional support, made us move almost once a year, had a new boyfriend every year/year and a half, told my sister I was crazy while I was having a panic attack, told me my dad cheated on her and that she thought he had a kid with someone else,... You get the picture. The last one wasn't true and I recently found out she actually cheated on my dad.

We lived in two different trailers for a total of probably 2-3 years and my mom always told us we didn't have a lot of money so we HAD to live in a trailer and always told us she wasn't sure if she was gonna be able to pay for everything. Keep in mind she told us this starting when I was like 8-9 so I now feel guilt every single time I spend even a little bit of money, have to ask my parents for something, receive presents, ...

That's of course not all that happened, but I'm just trying to explain why I decided to go low contact with my mom. I see her about once every 4 months and talk to her a couple of times a month through WhatsApp. 

After about a year she sent me a message that I'll try to accurately translate and summarize: ""I'm sorry for whatever it is I did, I didn't mean to make things hard for you. I understand you had issues with the relationships I've had but that's just what happened and who I am. I'm sorry that was hard for you."" After that she made some excuses for things. For clarity about the relationship part: I've never been disrespectful to any of her boyfriends but did tell her (when I was 15 probably) that I didn't want to meet all of them/have them in our house while I was there (which was two weekends a month) until they were more serious.

So on to the actual issue:
Today she sent me a message that said that she thought about me a lot recently, that she loves and misses me and asked if I could forgive her. 
I wasn't too happy about it since the only ""apology"" she's given me was followed up with excuses and wasn't even an apology in which she actually took responsibility for her actions. So I found it weird she was asking for forgiveness when I haven't even gotten a real apology yet. 

I showed my dad and stepmom and they both thought it was good and expected me to be exited, happy or thankful or something. I wasn't, because, again, I feel like you need an apology before you can ask for forgiveness. 

I told her that maybe we could talk some time soon because I am wiling to talk to her and hear her out but I also feel like I might be an asshole for not being greatful that she asked for forgiveness.

220,t3_rvio7m,AITAH for asking guy to stop poking my seat on 5 hour flight?,"Had 5hr long west coast to east coast flight. ~40yr old male was sitting behind me poking the touch screen on the back of my seat. These touch screens were not the older style ones, they don’t need as much “push” for it to register what you are touching on the screen. But he seemed to not know or care, and was pushing the screen pretty forcefully.

I put up with it for an hour and a half straight, hoping he would stop on his own or find a movie. 

I turned around and said “can you please stop poking my seat?” 

He LOST IT on me and started screaming how he is “looking for a movie.”  I said “I’ve put up with it for an hour and a half; it doesn’t take an hour and a half to find a movie.” He made a big scene. Called me a bunch of profanities and that I’m a moron, dumb idiot. That he can touch whatever he wants, as long as he wants. He kept doing it for rest of the flight and randomly purposely shook my seat any time I was trying to fall asleep.

Am I the ass hole here somehow? I thought I was more than fair by putting up with it as long as I did.

Touch screens on the backs of airplane seats need to be abolished entirely. Some airlines just let you connect your smart phone to onboard WiFi and then that’s how you access the inflight entertainment.. that’s a much better solution IMO

EDIT: To add insult to injury, a lady behind the guy somewhere was talking to the ass hole at the end of the flight about his military service. I think he had an army shirt on or something. She said ""thank you for your service and all you do, sorry you had to put up with that incident earlier.""

221,t3_rvin7z,AITA for refusing to show bf’s dad my bank account,"I, 24f, moved into my boyfriends home in August after he recently graduated college and couldn’t find a job. We thought we’d wait until he could find one and perhaps I could save some money in the interim. 

According to the MIT Living Wage calculator, my income is currently below the living wage and it’s a professional job I got a bachelors degree for. I am, however, about to get a raise, which supposedly started Jan 1st that would put me just 50 cents above a living wage in my area. 

I’ve been super honest about my financial situation to my boyfriend which took a bad turn the past couple months. Medical bills, car trouble, the works. I have been unable to save very much since I moved in, but I have been able to save *some*, probably enough for first month’s rent and I probably have about 2 months to get enough for a security deposit and have another month’s rent in my savings which I feel like is doing pretty good, especially since I’m getting that raise. I told my boyfriend all this in confidence and he even advised me in most of these situations, each one agreeing at the time that I did the best I could.

Ever since I moved in, bf’s dad has been flirting with the idea of charging me rent and then giving it back to me when we move out. I mostly feel like I wouldn’t live here if I had to pay rent. Like I would rather live on my own. I like his parents as people but I don’t want to live with parents anymore. I think dad is trustworthy but I also don’t really trust him to give it all back exactly when I need it. And it feels controlling to have to beg someone else, who especially is not my family member, for money out of my savings if more unexpected expenses come up. 

Now the talk is that I need to be paying rent or I need to allow bf’s dad to look at my bank account to confirm that I’m saving. This feels super scary and controlling to me, and on top of that, I frankly feel like I’m being treated like a child. I’m a super independent person and I’ve been living on my own since I was 18. I’m insulted that I’m being treated like I’m irresponsible and can’t be trusted to save, especially when Ive been super honest with bf about my financial position.

On that note, I feel like trust has been violated when I had asked bf specifically not to share my financial information with anyone else. And by the way, I think I’m doing fine financially especially given the circumstances. But now we fight about how I should have done this or that, when he was involved in all those decisions.

Basically bf thinks I should surrender to whatever dad says because he knows best and thinks I’m being ridiculous for refusing and not saving right in the first place. He said things like “I need to be able to trust that you’ll pay your half of the rent if I live with you.” He also thinks that dad has the right to charge me rent since I’ve been living here for free all this time too. I disagree for the reasons stated above. AITA?",60.0
222,t3_rvimgx,AITA for making sure my sister didn't get a specific gift,"So this happened a while ago but it's something that still bothers me if I did the right thing.

I was working at a coffee shop while going to college at the time I was lucky enough to be able to stay with my mom and step dad as well as my step sister and my blood sister. 

My blood sister (BS) has always had a bit of a financial balance struggle. Never good at holding her money and always asking others for some. I've had some problems with her in the past about her wanting to use my car and then emptying the tank without refill. Leaving buds of weed in my car, which at the time could have gotten me kicked out of the programs I volunteered at etc.

Most of this I have shrugged forgiven I just didn't need to care about that.

But then one day I get a text while I'm on a coffee break of her asking if she could borrow 10 bucks normal I would but I was working and needed my money for some running around afterwards and she had no way to come get it from me. I didn't get a response back so I once again shrugged until I went on my lunch only for my break to inform me I had e-transfered to her account.

So to explain, I had the bank app on my tablet and my login stayed linked on the app and she knew my tablet password. (All this has since been changed and my app no longer has immediate sign in)

I did try talking to her about it but she said it was only 10 dollars (even though she probably owes me over $360 just from borrowing)

A few weeks go by and my mom confides in me she's having issues with my BS with respect and other such issues she then told me she had bought BS a nice camera that she had been asking for this year but didn't feel my sister at all deserved it but didn't have a concrete enough reason to not give it to her. So I opened up and admitted to the situation that went down.

And so my sister didn't get to open a new camera on Christmas

223,t3_rvik8k,AITA for Playing video games when my wife didn’t want me to,"Ok so this has been an ongoing thing for 7 years.  My wife has an evening ritual of wrapping in a blanket on the couch, staring at her phone in a trance not to be disturbed for 20-30min, and then abruptly putting down her phone, rolling over and closes her eyes to go to sleep (until I wake her up to go to bed bed).    

There is no conversation to be had during this tail end of the night, which is fine - it’s her decompression from the day.    The problem is that though she’s not watching the tv it has to be on as background noise.    I don’t like watching tv really, I’d much rather play video games or read to decompress.   She gets angry, though, if I try playing until she’s 100% asleep.

Tonight she had been glued to videos on her phone for 20 min so I said screw it and turned one on.   A few min in she realized it and got mad.   I told her if she wanted to watch a show with me or talk I’d happily turn it off but that she’s been zoned out for quite a long time and we both know she is going to be asleep in five minutes.   Her response was that “she likes falling asleep to the sound of TV not video games”.  

I held my ground that it’s not really fair and sort of a self centered demand.   She got furious. 

I feel like I’m in the right to say it but she seems pretty pissed so perhaps not?

Background people will probably ask - no I don’t play a lot.  In fact I never play video games except when she’s asleep - this is the only window and I’ll go months without playing regularly.  I only get back into it if a new game comes out.    During the days I’m spending my time with the family and helping around the house.",84.0
224,t3_rvifiv,AITA for offering to sell to my brother's wife breast milk?,"Edit1: title is inaccurate. I never offered to sell to my brother's wife. I only communicated with my brother. 

Edit2: it was my wife's idea to offer

Edit3: I lived 140 miles away at the time. It would have required getting dry ice to transport the milk. 

This happened over a year ago and they are stilled pissed about it. My wife had a kid and my brothers wife had a kid like 2 months later. My brother's wife had breast cancer a few years prior and had her mamory glands  removed. 

Around the time of this historical event, covid hit and my company cut my pay in half. We had an excessive amount of breast milk so we decided to sell it online. It was good money. There's alot that goes into it. You can get alot of germs and bad things through breast milk. You gotta do a ton of testing.  We got approved to sell on a couple of sites.

 Around that time, a family friend had a kid and they were a low producer of breast milk. After some general conversation, we ended up selling to them some milk cheap after doing copious paperwork. Given that person's desire, I figured I would offer to my brother if he was interested in buying some. I explained that we were getting ready to sell it online and that if he wanted some, we would sell it to him at a discounted price. The discounted price would honestly have been equal to him just paying for the gas of me delivering the damn milk (we lived far away at the time).  

He flipped out and said how I should be offering it for free at the time. A year or so passed. No mention of it.  Dude brought it up again the other week and went off about how fucked up it was.",70.0
225,t3_rvie6k,AITA for telling future in-laws they were not welcome at the wedding?," i(31M) and my fiance(34M) have been together for 4 years, engaged for almost 2. My parents were happy to welcome him into the family. His parents disliked me the moment we met. The reasoning behind it is that they hate the idea of their son being with a transgender person. 

I came out as transgender when I was 15 and started the transitioning process when I turned 18. I started on HRT and cut my hair short. I changed my name as well and let everyone know my new name. My fiance was very understanding and promised there would be no issues. My parents did talk about the transition period with his parents and mentioned my old name. 

It now seems to be like a running joke amongst his family. We went over for the holidays and his mother smiles and says Hello Laura, what would you like to drink? His brother and SIL also will call me by my old name. My fiance is disgusted by his family's behavior and has gone very low contact with them. 

The wedding is planned to happen in spring 2022. His parents invited us out for dinner asking to talk. We were hoping that they were going to apologize and we can start fresh. Instead, they continued to call me by my old name and told my fiance they were disgusted with his choices. I told them that they were not welcome at the wedding. My fiance was on my side and he hasn't spoken to them.

226,t3_rvi8e6,WIBTA if I don’t turn up to the staff party?,"So I (F18) quit my job (retail) at the end of November due to issues with management making me feel like shit to be honest. We had a staff new year party planned for tomorrow and we all planned a secret Santa/gift swap as a belated Xmas celebration as well. I was told I should still come as the money given from head office for the party was given due to me contributing to the targets we’d hit so they said I’d earned the staff party despite quitting. I feel like I’m only invited out of politeness because I was there when it was planned.

The party is tomorrow and I’ve purchased a present for my assigned person however not one person has mentioned it to me so I don’t know the exact details or date or time or place and, to be honest, I really don’t want to go. My last few weeks I worked there made me feel so depressed, I was crying constantly because of the treatment I’d received. I can think of nothing worse than going into the store to meet them all before heading out and putting on a smile and act like I’m happy to see them because I won’t be. 

I could easily just message one of my friends who still works there for the details but on the other hand I feel like if I don’t know the details and nobody has reached out for me, that’s enough of an excuse to just not turn up? I’m worried that not turning up will make me look like an AH because my assigned person in the gift swap will be without a gift.  However I’m aware that there are new staff now who are not on the list for the gift swap so part of me is wondering whether they’ve maybe made a new one without me included as I’ve left? I have purchased a gift for my assigned person and I’m trying to think of excuses I can think of to drop it off at my friends house who still works at the store and give a reason as to why I ‘can’t make it’. (When I say ‘friend’ I must add that these are purely work friends, not outside of work friends). On the other hand I’m also pretty certain that my assigned person likely won’t be attending the party anyway as he’s 40 with young kids and the rest of the staff are a lot younger so he doesn’t often attend these things. But I can’t say for certain he won’t be there because I have no idea what the plan is and haven’t had contact with management in nearly 8 weeks. 

I don’t want to get on the bad side of management as I’d still like to shop in the store when I’m feeling less hurt by my leaving circumstances. I just feel like if they genuinely wanted me to attend then they would have given me actual details of the plan. I’m not going to feel hurt if they don’t want me there, I just don’t want to upset anyone.

227,t3_rvi1nw,AITA for boycotting lunch with my sister?,"Several months ago I (46F) told my big sister (49) I probably wouldn't meet her for lunch with my son to celebrate his 18th birthday. She was going to be in the city where he lives that day.
Background: She told me she would be visiting the city nearest us to go to her friend's 50th birthday party for the weekend. We live miles apart on different islands of the same country and I have always been the one to visit her with my two kids. I'm a single parent bringing up two kids on one (low) income. 
She has two kids with her husband and they are quite well-off and own a farm (ranch) worth millions. Her children are younger than mine and one has special needs so I have been happy to travel to her and help them out whenever I can. This meant giving up time with my own children or dragging them with me to look after hers, taking time off work, taking them out of school. Note she has reimbursed me for my time, but that's not the point. Work stacks up at home when you go away.
In 18 years she has visited me once. It was shortly after I had my firstborn. She has not been back since.
They have managed trips to Rarotonga, a resort town in our country (which I drove miles to reach in our shitty little Toyota with my two kids so they could see their cousins, and so I could look after my nephews on my sister's wedding anniversary, letting her and my BIL celebrate at a nice restaurant), and other overseas trips before their kids were born, but not a single visit on her own or as a family to us.
I offered to drive to the airport she was flying into for the weekend and bring her to our place to stay one night. I said I'd take her back to the city for her friend's party the next day.
I bought a house last year I'm very proud of that she hasn't yet seen. (There's a lot she hasn't seen about my life because a lot has happened in 18 years. But I've been to see her at least every other year.)
She has always found excuses not to visit us. I could have done the same and never visited or helped her over the years, but it would never have occurred to me that was an option.
Anyway, she said no to my offer.
I was so offended by the snub I decided to end our relationship.
I still talk to my BIL and intend to look after my nephews when I can at our parents' place or at her place as long as I don't have to see her. I know she'll probably put my decision down to finding her special needs son ""too hard"" to deal with, whereas the truth is she is the hard one to deal with.

228,t3_rvhxrb,AITA if I tell my MIL to give us back our spare key???,"Just some context beforehand… and it’s A LOT.
6 months ago my husband (26 M) and myself (27 F) got married. It was a small wedding with our parents and siblings and it involved a road trip out of state. We didn’t really honeymoon because we considered the trip more than enough. Due to some financial and personal issues, MIL (49) had to move from Texas (where husband and I are located) to Kansas. The day after my husband and I arrived back from our trip, MIL calls and asks if she can stay with us for a couple of days while she looks at apartments. We were hesitant, but figured a few days wouldn’t hurt, plus she had already bought her plane ticket. 
Long story short, a few days turned into a few months. We live in a two bedroom one bathroom apartment and own two very hyper dogs. Bottom line, I felt suffocated and my frustration was evident. Very early into MIL’s stay, my husband and I found out we were pregnant. After my first trimester,  my husband told her that we really needed her to move out so we can start preparing a nursery, and it wasn’t until I was 22 weeks, when she had finally moved out. I hold some resentment because I feel like she robbed my husband and I of a very important time, but I haven’t voiced my feelings to her because I don’t want to create any hostility and she can be VERY sensitive.
Now onto the current dilemma: it’s only been 2 weeks since she moved out, but she has started popping by when we aren’t home to ‘visit the dogs’ and using the spare key she kept. I only found out today because she left some cooking utensils she borrowed on our counter. I asked my husband about this, and he doesn’t think it is that big of a deal. MIL isn’t married, and he said she is probably just lonely. While I understand his perspective, I do not want these unannounced visits to become a regular occurrence. My biggest fear is that once our baby is here, her unannounced visits will become a daily routine. I told my husband that he needs to get the key back from her IMMEDIATELY, but he is worried about hurting her feelings. I told him that when it comes to our privacy I no longer have concern towards her feelings when she clearly never considered ours. AITA???",100.0
229,t3_rvhnbn,WIBTA if I reported a neighbor's puppy for yowling all day?,"Hello - let me preface this by saying I am extremely nonconfrontational, and could generally give a shit what other people do in the privacy of their own homes, I keep to myself, and mind my own business.

I live in a small apartment ""house""; there are five apartments total, one above me, one next to me, and two below me. Generally, everyone is pretty quiet. The walls (and floors) are very thin, and you can hear everything, which is to be expected I guess in old houses/apartment conversions in this state (RI). I hear my neighbors all the time - kids next door playing, guy downstairs blaring music/talking on the phone/watching TV, whatever. Typical apartment noise that I've learned to tune out in the 3 years I've lived here.

However, the guy upstairs, since the day I moved in, has been getting on my last nerve. I don't know what it is that he does up there, but it sounds like he moves furniture around every single day. Someone (or something) will run up and down the hallway for an hour every afternoon. Heavy things are always dropped on the ground at random times, or knocked over, I don't know which. Fine - again, I've learned to tune all that out, no matter how annoying it can be.

Now, let me say first, that we all have a lease that states there are no pets allowed in the building. I know there are at least two tenants that don't abide by this rule - the people downstairs in the front apartment, and the guy above me. I've heard a puppy howling NON-STOP, for HOURS upstairs. Today, he's been crying since noon - it is now 8pm.

I genuinely don't know what to do. Again, I'm a nonconfrontational person, I typically don't give a shit if anyone has an animal in their apartment (it's their problem if they break their lease agreement, not mine), and I don't want to be ""that person"". But this is freaking ridiculous. I can hear the puppy clear enough that it makes it difficult for me to get any sleep, and for me to concentrate on work (I work from home) with the constant yowling.

I am seriously considering calling the landlord's office in the morning to say something along the lines of, ""Hi, there's been a puppy yowling on the 3rd floor non-stop for the past few days, is there anything I can do about it?"" but I don't want that simple complaint to trigger an inspection of EVERYONE'S apartments, especially since i know there are people in this building that again, do things which break their lease (such as having a cat/snake, and smoking cigarettes and pot inside).

But jesus christ. I am going to lose my mind listening to this.

So, should I just shut up and go buy earplugs and noise cancelling headphones, or would a call to the landlord's office be in order?

EDIT: The guy is home. I can hear him stomping around like he usually does upstairs. I don't know how he's been able to sit through this puppy howling for hours and do nothing about it. It's genuinely like he's just got it in a crate somewhere and is completely ignoring it.",4.0
230,t3_rvhm6j,AITA for arguing with my boyfriend’s identical twin aunts on a vacation over a seat in the car?,"I know the title sounds petty, but hear me out. So me and my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years at the time went on a vacation to go visit Arizona and California. One of his aunts lived in Arizona with her daughter and the other aunt, his grandma, and sister were traveling to Arizona with us to visit them. We were then going to drive from Arizona to California. I will mention that the aunt allowed us to stay in her home in Arizona for free. But me and my boyfriend were both expected to pay our share for the rental car and our part for the house in Cali. We also contributed towards gas and paid for our own food. No issues there. 
To set the backstory up a little bit more, the two aunts rented the van and only got it insured so those two were able to drive and they refused to let anyone else. Mind you my job was to drive a 14 passenger bus on a daily at the time, so driving would’ve never been an issue for me. With that being said I will also mention at this time that I am the largest person of the group by at least 50-60pounds with the next person in size would be the Grandma at about 165 and then his sister at 150, if that. Both of the aunts are very petite women at about 5 foot and no more than 135lbs. My boyfriend at the time is very slender in about 117 pounds and his cousin is only about 12 at the time. Just so you can get a reference I was probably 245 pounds(struggling with the loss of my brother recently caused me to gain weight). Our seating situation was that the two aunts would switch on and off upfront taking turns driving. The Grandma and myself have the two middle seats. And my boyfriend, his sister and cousin were all in the backseat. There came a point in time in the trip when my boyfriends cousin and sister were complaining about wanting to change up seats and that it wasn’t fair that they had to sit in the back the entire time. Mind you both of them had gotten the window seat while my boyfriend was stuck in the middle the entire time. I think this is also where the whole situation could’ve went different was when instead of asking me if I would be willing to switch for a little while or anything like that one of the aunts just said well you and (mentions me) will just switch for a little bit then. I kind of looked confused because I figured I would at least have the respect given to me to be asked to change instead of being told. Not to mention I was a 20-year-old adult. But when I said I don’t think changing seats would help considering the cousin and my boyfriend are already uncomfortable with them as it is, so putting the biggest person back there doesn’t make any sense. The aunt then stated how I did have my seat the entire time and I’ve been comfortable the entire time. I brought up the fact that her or her sister could go in the back for a little while and I would be fine just staying where I’m at considering I paid for my seat. Let me tell you his aunts did not like that and they both started arguing with me at the same time. And it wasn’t like a little arguing it was a full blown scene in a McDonald’s parking lot where we are all yelling at each other. They were Calling me rude and saying I have no right and that they’ve driven the entire trip. I stated back that they chose that and I would have drove considering I do it for work. It went on for about 5-8 minutes. 
I would like to also add at this point in time that nowhere in paying for the house to stay in or the rental car, or even contributing for gas… Were the cousin or the sister accounted for. We had to get a bigger car to accommodate these two people but the paying was still only being split between five adults. We could’ve all squeezed into a normal car, yeah it would’ve been uncomfortable but we could’ve squeezed in just like we’re doing with this van. And getting a car would’ve been a lot cheaper than renting that minivan. So personally for myself I didn’t understand why I should have to give up my seat for someone that did not pay or contribute in anyway. 
I will say I feel like this all could have played out Different if we didn’t all have a certain surrounding circumstance. The one aunt was just involved in a bad break up with an abusive partner and was on edge the entire trip and mean to everyone. But at the end of the day it doesn’t excuse her to be rude to me. I was dealing with the Two year anniversary of my brother dying on that trip.
I didnt move my seat and his family has hated me ever since that day. And I’ve always wanted to know who was right or wrong.

231,t3_rvhl93,AITA for peeing in the cat tray?,"Okay, this is weird and I'm using a throwaway because this is so embarrassing.

Me (29F) and my Partner (25M) have been dating for 3 years and have lived together for one of those. We live in a small 1 bedroom flat that has one bathroom with our 2 cats. I am a diabetic and I'm on number of medications, one of them basically flushes sugar straight through my system and can make me pee a lot. I can go from not feeling like I need to pee to if I don't pee in the next 20 minutes I'll pee myself. It comes on suddenly sometimes. My bf has ibs and he can spend 40 minutes in the bathroom easily sometimes. This hasn't been a problem thus far. 

Today though he had a bad IBS moment and after 40 minutes locked in the bathroom I felt that I needed to pee. I figured he wouldn't be very long since he'd already been in there 40 minutes. I knocked on the door and let him know I needed to pee and ask how long he'd be. He said he'd be a few minutes. No problem.

20 minutes later (so he's been in there an hour at this point) I am kinda doing the potty dance a little and knock on the door again. He's gonna be a few more minutes. I tell him I'm not gonna be able to hold it much longer and if he could just unlock the door and I'll just hop in the shower. He says he can't get off the toilet right now. Fair enough.

Another 15 minutes and my bladder is starting to hurt. And he hasn't flushed or anything yet. I figure fuck it, my bladder hurts and I'm bursting and I figured the cats would forgive me. We have 2 litter trays, one in the bathroom and one in a nook in the corridor. I pop a squat over the litter tray in the corridor and have a tinkle and use a kitchen towel to wipe. I then bag up the litter tray and completely refresh it. 

He comes out another 10 minutes later and says the bathrooms free and I tell him it's fine. He gives me a funny look and I tell him what I did. He looks at me absolutely disgusted and says that is revolting. 

I tell him I'd rather just refresh the litter tray which takes seconds than piss myself and have to do a tonne of washing.

He hasn't spoken to me all evening and he says he can't believe I would do something so gross. I tried to tell him a number of times I really needed to go and he said I should learn to hold it better.

This has kinda left me feeling like I'm the asshole?",9311.0
232,t3_rvhh3x,AITAH for berating my mother over text,"AITAH for “berating” my (30M) mother (55F) over text. For context; my wife (32F) and my mother’s relationship never started off right which had a lot to do with my mother treating my girlfriend, now wife poorly, I.e saying I should leave her due to her depression and anxiety, trying to not include her in family photos, stating she was only with me for my money (which is not a lot, she was just unemployed at the time). 

With the birth of our son 3 months ago they have made an effort to be more civil towards each other, until the start of December. During this time my recently divorced mother was more preoccupied with dating around than seeing her grandson but would often speak to relatives claiming we were “keeping him away from her.”  We spoke to her about this and offered a solution where she can see him, as long as we didn’t have any plans, but she had to ask first. 

This came to a head yesterday; our area has had a large increase of COVID cases since the 26th and so we we’re refraining from visiting all family until cases died down; however my mother has continued to ask to have him visit. The real sticking point came when I went to her house by myself to drop off gifts for relatives when she told me she had a close contact with a confirmed case on the 24th and she only found out on the 27th but states her rapid test was negative; the issue is I had my son to visit on the 25th for a couple of hours, he has been fine but I was just so dumbfounded that she withheld that she had been in contact that I just left. When I got home I saw that she had texted saying, “it wasn’t a big deal and I was keeping him from her.” I told her how selfish it was to withhold the fact &amp; to continue to push to see him against our wishes, she asked if I treat my in-laws this way and I told her, “ I don’t have to, they’re doing everything we ask but apparently I have to tell you.” She is now telling family that I “berated her” and claim I’m “overreacting” and “treating her unfairly.” My wife is on my side and claims I took it easy on her.

234,t3_rvhfvn,AITA for accidentally erasing the Pop bottle count??,"I (19f) misunderstood and accidentally erased my Boyfriend (M18) Mom's (I have no idea what her age is) Pop bottle count. For a little backstory, me and him have been dating 10 months and we already live together in his parents house. I do a lot of chores and help around with whatever I'm asked to do just to help out because I can't pay rent currently neither can my boyfriend but they don't want him to but between My Boyfriend and his brother (M17) (I'll just call him T) whoever gets bottles and count's them also put them away, can returned them for money. 

My boyfriend and his brother were told by the 1st of January that they're mom was going to start keeping her bottles and the bottle money because everyone drinks her pop, Not a problem and everyone agreed with that. Well sometimes during those months. My boyfriend and T would get confused because they didn't erase the bottle count off the whiteboard  sometimes. I'll occasionally ask to make sure no one forgot to erase it after they returned the bottles (this would only happen occasionally. Even so, I would always check) 

Now to what happened. My boyfriend's mom put Mom's bottles on the whiteboard right next to the old bottle count, I got a little confused because the bottle count wasn't under her new mom's bottle count, if that makes any sense. I casually bring it up with my boyfriend, I just asked him about and from what he said I thought it was the old bottle count and erased it automatically like I have done before and no one said anything, I didn't think anyone would.
Calls for both my boyfriend and T then ask who erased it and was pretty upset about it. Saying it was me after a little bit originally my anxiety went up and I couldn't go out there thinking I was going to get yelled at or something or a huge fight was going to break loose.
 (There's no violence in the household at all, if you do something wrong, you just get yelled at and it won't be let go for a couple weeks, it causes me somewhat of anxiety) bottles were recounted, also I meant to say I told my boyfriend that I did it and not her but she heard cuz she was right out the door. We both heard her say that she heard me and didn't understand why I would do that. Comes to the bedroom afterwards and says
 (So Boyfriend, you erased my bottle count?? There was a weird look on her face. then I said it was me and explain how I misunderstood, I thought it was the old bottle count but she still acted like it was weird. Now I feel really bad but  I don't want to leave the room thinking that they're mad at me and that I might get yelled or getting a weird silent treatment.

Hear me out before you judge: My brother’s friend (17M) does not stop talking at all. I cannot stand a conversation with him because I have literally no chance whatsoever to contribute to it. When I have conversations, I want me and the other person to contribute to it. In fact, it’s not even really a conversation. 

He knocked on my door and I answered. He asked me if I wanted to hang out. I said “No thank you.” Because I wanted to remain polite. He asked why and began to ramble on about if I hated him or his interests. I was kind of annoyed, so I just said “Look, M I don’t want to hang out because I don’t feel connected to you. I don’t feel like we’re friends. I can’t have a conversation with you, you barely know me, and you only ever talk. I don’t feel like we have a chance to feel connected.

236,t3_rvh9gx,AITA for voicing my opinion about my mom's behavior?,"I [22M] live away from most of my family for school, but just spent New Years with them, having not had the chance to get together for the holidays. For three of my five day vacation, I was staying with my father [51M], but for the final two days including New Years Eve, I went to stay with my mother [51F] and her husband [55M], as well as my younger sister [19F]. We spent about 30 hours together total, as I went to stay at her place around noon on New Years Eve and flew home at 6pm on New Years Day.

My mother and I spent most of the day together on New Years, including watching two different movies together, one for just the two of us and one with her husband and my sister later in the evening. I had a genuinely good time for most of the day, as I do enjoy the company of my family most of the time and it had been a while since I had seen them. During the second movie, my mom and her husband made a vaguely transphobic joke at the expense of one of the female characters. Not wanting to leave the comment unaddressed, I called the joke ""cringe"" and mentioned that it was pretty transphobic. There was a bit of pushback, but it eventually got swept under the rug. The rest of the movie went fine, we had a good time, celebrated New Years, then went to sleep.

The next day passed uneventfully. However, as she was driving me to the airport, she started to cry all of a sudden, asking whether or not I actually enjoyed spending time with her. She said that I had been intensely critical and judgmental throughout the previous day. Naturally, I defended myself, saying that I loved her but wasn't going to just let her say offensive stuff. I called her out for forcing me into this confrontation in a closed-off space where I couldn't escape. My mom insisted that she only wanted to have this talk where it couldn't be overheard. This argument continued until we reached the airport, and we said a terse goodbye before I got on a plane and left. Below, I've included some examples of stuff she's used against me:

* The transphobic joke debate, to which she has repeatedly insisted she tries her best to be respectful, but she shouldn't be forced to learn all the ins and outs of pronouns and stuff when making jokes in her own home about a fictional character. For reference, the joke was that a well-muscled woman was secretly a man in disguise.
* My brother [26M] has a girlfriend of around four years that my mother doesn't really like. She started trying to talk crap about her, calling her a ""princess"" and stuff but I started kinda defending her, as I like her well enough and I didn't really feel like talking shit behind her back.
* When discussing finances at dinner, my sister (who has her first real job right now) brought up the fact that she had finally put money in her savings account. My mom didn't believe her and insisted that she show her bank account, and I immediately glared at her and insisted that my sister didn't need to do anything if she didn't want to.",12.0
237,t3_rvh8d3,AITA For Wanting To Return My Christmas Gift?,"My birthday and Christmas are very close to each other, with about 13 days in between. This year, my mom asked me what I wanted for my birthday/Christmas as I'm known to be picky and the type of person to just buy myself something if I want it, rather than have others gift it to me.

I explicitly stated that I would rather not receive a gift, and would prefer to have her pay the minimum payment for my student loan for the following month instead. She agreed. 

Despite this agreement, she still bought me an expensive perfume as a gift instead. The perfume is not something I'd wear or have any explicit use for, as I like to buy my own perfumes and have a picky sense of what notes I like to wear, which this perfume did not fit. She did not pay the loan minimum, the only gift I wanted, which was in a similar ballpark to the perfume.

I thanked her for the gift but as I mentioned before, did not have any real use for it. I let it sit there for a few days trying to figure out what to do with it but ultimately decided that I would rather just return it for its cash value and use that to do what I had initially requested my mother do.

238,t3_rvh8a3,WIBTA if I told my dad that him expecting me to do the dishes EVERY day is impossible?,"So right before winter break, we had midterms and my parents allowed me to come home after my exams (2 a day) with the condition that I did the dishes when I got home. I was fine with this, since obviously I'd rather do the dishes than have to stay at school after taking exams. However, this extended into winter break. Weird, but whatever. Now, last Friday (the 31st) my mom told me to not worry about doing the dishes because she would be doing them this weekend. I spent Saturday and most of Sunday at my grandparents house, and when I got home the first thing my dad told me was that I needed to wash the dishes that I had left sitting the entire weekend. I'm like, really confused and started texting my mom but she didn't respond. Either way, I couldn't do the dishes on Sunday when I got home since my history teacher decided to have an chunky assignment due today, the first day back. Obviously, that was my first priority over doing the dishes. I ended up staying up past midnight working on it (my fault- it's difficult for me to focus sometimes so tasks can sometimes take longer.) so once I finished I immediately went to bed.

Now today. I'm in my room, trying to take a quick like 30 minute nap (still tired from the night before) and my mom comes into my room and says that I either have to go wash the dishes RIGHT now or make dinner. I responded, ""well YOU said you were going to do the dishes this weekend in my place, so I'd much rather make dinner."" We go out to the kitchen and my dad IMMEDIATELY starts throwing a tantrum, asking why is it so hard for me to follow ""direct orders"" and why does my mom think her authority supersedes his. Annoyed, my mom and I just switched and I washed the dishes. As I did, my dad goes ""she KNOWS she's supposed to wash the dishes EVERY day, how is she supposed to last in the real world if she can't even follow basic orders?"" This ticked me off, since the only reason I stopped ""following orders"" was because my mom said she'd fill in. Personally, I think it's ridiculous that I'm the ONLY person ""allowed"" to do the dishes. If my mom or my grandma (she's 56 btw- only mentioning so that a frail woman with gray hair isn't pictured lol) even tries to wash a dish, my dad throws a shit fit demanding to know why I'm not washing them.

I'm a junior in high school. It's January, and I'm about to enter the most difficult part of the school year within the next few months. Frankly, I won't have the time to do the dishes during the week between doing hw and studying for my upcoming exams. WIBTA if I told my dad it's physically impossible for him to expect me to take on that kind of chore when I have much more pressing matters on my plate?

I used to do laundry for the entire house, but when I started doing dishes my parents said that it was fine if I only washed my clothes.",4.0
239,t3_rvh78i,AITA for inviting my dad but not my brother to a party,"AITA for not inviting my brother to an important party but inviting my dad? So my brother (22) is trans (this matters), and he cut my dad out of his life a while back. He refuses to attend any event my dad is at, no matter how important. I’m about to have a party to announce the adoption of my daughter, and I invited my dad but not my brother (we’ll call him H), and H found out. He called and started crying about how he never gets to go to family events because we always invite my dad. I told him I loved him but I also love our dad and want him to meet his now-official grandchild (H has met her before, so has my dad, but this will be the first party with the adoption finalized). He started to accuse me of not supporting him and not loving him and I snapped and said it was his choice not to come to events and I didn’t invite him because I was tired of dealing with it and if I couldn’t have my whole family there then I’d just have family that I know supported me. We haven’t spoken since. 
So quick backstory: my brother is not a stable person, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, but has always refused to take meds. When he came out as trans, we all did our best to support him. But H felt it wasn’t enough and that my dad didn’t accept him. 
Now my dad was not a great dad growing up, but he has worked so hard to become a better person and rebuild relationships with his kids. He went to counseling and he’s grown a lot. When my brother came out, he joined a parents of trans kids support group. He’s a simple man and he really didn’t understand what was happening but he tried hard even if he had a hard time expressing how he felt at times. He struggled a lot with pronouns in the beginning and deadnamed H several times. That was years ago and he hasn’t messed up in a long time. 
Here’s the thing though, H has always weaponized being trans. If you don’t like his outfit/hairdo, you’re transphobic. If you don’t agree with his views, you’re transphobic. If you don’t like Rocky Horror Picture Show, you’re transphobic. Etc. So anything less than total support was, you guessed it, transphobic. 
My dad didn’t even know there was an issue until my brother announced his wish to be no-contact. H has also burned a lot of bridges with the rest of us over the years between the paranoia and mania and the constant manipulation and made it so hard to have a relationship with him. I was scared to introduce my daughter to him because of how unstable he has been in the past. But I did and he’s been a good uncle (I will never trust him alone with her but I let them hang out and stuff like that). But my dad was always supportive and he is a doting grandpa.
I would love for them to both come but I know H won’t go if my dad is there and I refuse not to invite my dad. I just want to celebrate my family and I don’t want to remember this horrible tension for just a little while (of course I wish everyone would be there). So AITA?",12.0

To be honest i didn’t think that she was mad at all until my mom told me that i should quit to let my sister in it.

241,t3_rvh4cm,AITA for writing an essay for school that I knew would be controversial and strongly against my parents' and teacher's beliefs?,"


My English class had a project to write an essay with the point of persuading people to agree with an unpopular opinion.

My family is Christian, most of my community is, I was raised that way but am no longer faithful. But they still are, and say gossiping is sinful.

I thought it would be interesting to write an essay saying that gossip is good.

I came up with a bunch of arguments that I'll give you for context. 

1. Gossip acts as a warning and helps people protect themselves. For example I wouldn't date anyone who I heard was cruel to their exes.

2. Gossip can reveal other people's values and help determine social compatibility. For example if I met a person who gossiped nastily about LGBT people I would know to keep away. 

3. Gossip can be a bonding experience between friends, it is cathartic to vent about emotional events rather than stew in silence. 

4. ""Gossip"" is a gendered term, men's talk is rarely called gossip. Perhaps the reason that talk is seen as negative for women but neutral for men, is that women's voices are often undervalued and demeaned. Also, some people fear the impact of women sharing their experiences and thoughts freely. 

5. When conversations are called ""gossipy"", it can often be out of suppression rather than kindness. For example, when the church discourages negative talk about religious leaders, that is dangerous. 

6. Yes, some talk is hurtful. But it should be called bigoted, racist, or something specific. Not simply called gossip, because calling it gossip minimizes it. 

I turned it in a little nervous about how my English teacher would react because I felt like I picked a really unpopular opinion. She's always telling students not to gossip, so I was worried she might also take it personally. 

Today, my teacher told me that she and the guidance counselor wanted to discuss my essay in a meeting after school this week. I asked why and she said we'd talk in the meeting. I asked about my grade and she said she hadn't assigned a grade yet. 

My parents were also called, and when they found out i wrote an essay called ""In Defense of Gossip"" they were mad. I wanted to read them the essay but honestly they were so mad I didn't think they'd listen to 15 pages.

They said they didn't raise me this way and that I was encouraging bullying, and saying that I was being provocative on purpose.

I feel that's kinda unfair, my teacher told us to defend an unpopular or controversial opinion and now people are mad I followed the assignment earnestly? 

I guess I can see where my teacher is coming from a little, because it might feel like a personal attack since she hates gossip. And my parents too, it might feel like I never listened to the stuff they taught me about kindness. 

But I feel also like I was honest.

We all have the same dad but I have a different mom than my siblings. I don't think I've ever met my bio mom tho and my ""stepmom"" adopted me when I was a baby. 

Megan has never liked me. She liked being the youngest in the family and getting all of the attention and when I was born I became the center of attention. I also have problems with my heart and lungs, which means I took even more attention from her. 

I've needed a lot of surgeries and I've been in and out of the hospital over the past few months. I was getting a blood transfusion a few days ago and Megan asked if she could visit. I didn't really want her to but I didn't want to start an argument so I said sure. 

Something that is kinda important is that I don't like pictures of me on social media. I have a feeding tube up my nose, they started me on a new medicine last year and it made parts of my skin change color and a lot of my hair fall out, and I just don't want people to see me like this. Megan also has a few thousand followers on her social medias and posts everything. Isabella was also hanging out with me and is very protective over me so I knew that if anything happened, she'd take care of it. 

We all hung out for like an hour then I got tired and took a nap and when I woke up Megan was gone and Isabella seemed really upset. I asked what happened and she said that after I went to sleep, Megan started taking pictures and videos of me for her TikTok and Instagram. Isabella said she told Megan to delete them and when Megan refused, she took Megan's phone so she could delete everything herself. Megan got mad at Isabella and Isabella said she said something horrible to her but she won't tell me what she said.

I trust Isabella and I know she wouldn't lie to me so I texted Megan to let her know that I don't want her to come to the hospital anymore because of what she said to Isabella and for trying to post pictures and videos of me. 

Megan called Isabella a lying bitch and sent a ton of texts insulting her. Then she got mad at me for believing Isabella over her, said I'm just like her, and said she can see why my ""real mom"" didn't want me (I sent the texts to my parents and they said they'll take care of it).

She has taught me almost everything I know and encouraged me to start my own planning business. It was a no brainer to have her be my wedding planner. She insisted on doing it for free because I have helped her so much. 

For my wedding, my MIL did the flowers and decor. So the only things my wedding planner was responsible for were setting up the table tops (table cloths, placing the pre-made center pieces, table numbers, putting the wine out) and setting out the parking signs. We were doing buffet lines for dinner so there were no place settings at the tables other than napkins and water bottles. The tables and chairs were already set up where they needed to be. The ceremony started at 3:30pm. She arrived at the venue around 10:30am. Having worked more complicated weddings under tighter time constraints, I thought it would be simple for her. She even had another assistant helping her. 

Later, I found out that the parking signs never got put out (this was extremely important because we were getting married in backyard). The wine never got put out. My husbands grandfather who graciously bought all the alcohol had to get it out the storage area by himself. Two friends of my MIL saw that the reception wasn't set up when they arrived around 1pm so they set everything up in 1.hrs.

I cannot point to anything that she did or did correctly. This is very unlike her. I did ask her after the fact, if something had happened that day and she said ""No, everything was fine."" When I mentioned that some things weren't done right or at all, she said that she didnt have enough time because it was all too complicated.

Unexpectedly, my mum passed in summer under really cruel conditions. Me and my dad (70) are still shocked and miss her every day. At the moment, my dad mostly stays with us from Tuesday / Wednesday to Friday. He helps with the kids etc. The rest of the week, he spends at his house. He suffers even more when he is alone which makes me sad, but on the other hand, he misses his own house where he had been living with my mum for 40 years, wants to be at the graveyard „ and let us spend the Weekend as a little Family without him. You See: he is not an evil FIL.

I told my husband why shouldn‘t we consider moving to my parents house. It wouldn’t be too expensive to modernize with lots of advantages for us (+ no rent anymore + own garden for the kids + better Infrastructure with all schools etc  - important as one kid has special needs so currently I drive 1.5 hours a day to get him to a Special School + extended family in the same town - fast there to support when needed esp. with the kids + take easier care of my dad who has health Problems and will need more help in age).

Yet my husband disagrees. He has developped negative feelings towards my dad since my mum passed and my dad was here a lot. He tells me he feels left out and assumes my dad secretly wants us to divorce (dad never said anything negative) plus he spoils the kids and allows them too much (grandpas do that but I told my dad many times as he lives here half of the week, he is no „visit Sundays“ grandpa and needs to stick to our rules as to what is allowed/forbidden for the kids - not too successful so far). On several occasions, my husband lost his temper and verbally attacked my dad who wanted to leave in tears. In the last dispute, I could’nt stay silent as before.  I told my husband to apologize which he did. No yelling or swearwords are okay for me with in laws out of respect. 

Now my husband claims good to know I always put my daddy on a higher level and neglect him. He‘d only agree to move if doors would be locked for our Family Life and not have my dad upstairs every day. I told him it is ridiculous to be „jealous“ and of course I wouldn’t have my dad eat alone if 5 steps up I’ll be cooking anyway etc. All my life I could 100% rely on my parents and I‘ll now be there for my father. Esp. since I told my mum on her death bed no worries I will take the best care I can of my dad.

AITA for still wanting to move to my parents house and „ignore“ my husband‘s wish to treat my dad like a neighbor?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for contributing. The majority says I am the AH here. Well I always believe in the Wisdom of the Crowd. I talked to my husband again. He says we have not reached a deadlock yet. He is generally considering the move, primarily because of the advantages for our kid with Special needs. Yet we should not only set but insist on our rules. This is the crucial point. It is my job to explain to my father but it seems he ignores it as I am his daughter and vice versa due to my upbringing I felt it was not okay to Chase him for breaking our rules. My husband thinks we need consequences like „if you let them have 3 bars of Chocolate before diner and then Play with them, ignoring me asking Kids and grandpa to please Cole to sit down so we can eat, you will need to leave.“ this will be tough for me because I am fond of him and Fear he would feel insulted and cancel contact. My husband is convinced my dad would Need Time to reflect and this acceptance of boundaries might give us a Future Option to move in with our own 2 floors any my dad in his own fully furnished Apartment downstairs. As some of  you pointed out, 5 months is a rather short period of mourning so we will weit and see how things Turn out.

246,t3_rvgqbe,AITA for not wanting to invite my father to my wedding,"I (27M) am getting married in June. Right before I was born, my biological father broke up with my mother. My mother also died when she was young, so I was legally adopted and raised by her brother. As you can expect, I am not very close with my father. He contacted me when I was 24, and from then on, we only meet twice a year - for Christmas and my birthday (June). Last week, while meeting with my father, I told him that I would be unable to meet him on my birthday, because of my wedding in June. (My birthday and wedding day are only a few days apart). My father assumed that he was invited and said that he was excited to attend the wedding, and that he was excited to introduce his wife and three children to me. I told him he had gotten it all wrong and that I was not planning on inviting him or his family to the wedding. First of all, due to the Covid situation, my fiancee and I want a small wedding, with only close family and friends. 

I'm not that close with my father, so I wasn't planning on inviting him to the wedding. My fiancee thinks I made a reasonable decision. After that day, my father has kept sending me text messages asking me to let him know if I ever change my mind. It makes me feel kind of guilty. AITA?",210.0
247,t3_rvgo6i,AITA for making my girlfriend lose a friend?,"sorry if this doesnt make sense right away, im tired writing this but i need it clearing up

&amp;#x200B;

for a bit of backstory about my girlfriend, she never had a good relationship, every boy who loved her, either well didnt love her, faked his love for her, lied to her, and lied about their age, she wasnt used to such a good boyfriend, then she met me.

and also she gave me her accounts to everything she could, because she wanted my full trust, i tried to decline at first, but she persuaded me to have them

well this happened in june last year me (16m at the time) and my girlfriend (17 at the time lets call her merry)  we were going strong four months in the relationship, my best friend (16m and lets call him zak) got with a girl who broke him terribly he had severe depression from it, she said some things even i have no idea about, it hurt him that badly he didnt want to say it.

then fast forward to the 13th of june, merry had an idea to cheer him up, it was to ""pretend date"", this only included messaging nothing physical, i was hesitant at first but as she has done it before no problems i let it happen, but looking back on it now it was probably my biggest mistake, as for why its my biggest mistake...

i woke up that day with a notification telling me that he called merry sexy, which i just agreed with, and i was also told of that ""pretend dating"" aswell right when i woke up.then at one point she said she liked him but i paid no attention to it until i got bored later on after a video call.

i went on her discord account, as she gave it me and requested i do weekly checks on her messages so i can see if she is messaging in a way i like, so i do that,  then when i went to her messages with my best friend, it was the ""pretend dating"" thing then i scrolled further, zak said he loved her in roleplay way, but merry thought he meant it for real and that they were gonna keep it a secret.

honestly my reaction wasnt the best, i said horrible things in the spur of moment madness, then she wanted a break so she can think about things, and get her mind straight. in the end she chose me, and only me and tried to forget her love for zak

now to present time, she recently started messaging my best friend again, and she told me she thinks she still loves him even after 6 months, and i even felt insecure, so i told zak and he offered to stop messaging her for a while so she can forget her feelings or hopefully so, but merry is upset, due to her losing her only true friend and shes been crying for the past 2 days

i feel like i am to blame for ruining their friendship

t.l.d.r:  i woke up to messages being told about merry pretend dating, i went on her msgs as a weekly routine and found her secret, we had a break, she chose me, fell inlove with zak  again, he stopped messaging her and merry is upset right now and i feel terrible

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

edit 1: for clarification, i dont check her messages now, i realized it was an invasion of privacy, so i only say i do to satisfy her, and the only reason i checked her messages in the first place was cos she was scared of cheating on me, as she cheated on her ex in the past",3.0

I (M25), years ago met through facebook a girl (let’s call her Sara-31) and we found out that we share the same dad but we both have different mothers so we are half-brothers. 

Yesterday she told me that she was visiting my town, so we met for the first time in a bar, she went with her husband and I went with my girlfriend, we had some drinks and it was a really fun night. 

Next day she took a flight went back to her city. Also next day my mom (51) finds out that we met and now she’s really pissed that I didn’t invite her to the meeting. I didn’t invite her because I felt that meeting Sara was something personal and it shouldn’t be a big get together with all the family, also as I said before, my mom and Sara are not linked in any way. My mom said something like “we all should have met at my house and have dinner together” but I don’t think even Sara wanted to meet her, and taking my mom to a bar is really out of place.

251,t3_rvgdxl,AITA for being upset that my boyfriend wants me to sign something saying I own whatever percentage of our future home that I put in?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for some time now and we are getting to the next stage of our relationship. House, marriage, kids, etc. He makes way more money than me and works way less hours than I do. I work twice as hard as he does to make three times less. We currently split all financial obligations now 50/50; rent, bills, groceries etc. He does pay for more going out meals than I do but I would say that it's 60/40.

When discussing house budgets he started off with a number that I can not afford half of. He then compromised and lowered slightly but still not a number I was comfortable with. When I explained to him I think we should start small and we can always upgrade or renovate our home he said no, that he wouldn't be happy unless we start at his budget. He then said that he would pay the difference of whatever my 50% budget was and that I just needed to sign something saying I only own said percentage of the house which would come to about 33%. I told him I don't agree with this since I don't think this is fair, we should agree on a budget together for our future home. He said regardless my equity is the same so why does it matter? I should be happy he is willing to pay more and put us in a nicer home.

He doesn't understand why I'm so bothered by this, and I keep explaining to him its not how I pictured buying a home with my future husband to be, I want harmony in our home and I want to know that we did it together and based on love. I keep telling him this is where we will raise our family, and I don't want to feel like I'm only worth 33%. I thought that we would be going into this as a team, and I can't help but feel like he just wants a business partner and not a wife. I have always taken care of 100% of all house chores; laundry, cooking, cleaning etc. Since his proposal I have suggested that we should now split everything 50/50 to make things fair. I said he should clean after I cook, and that he should do his own laundry now, and also help clean when I clean. He does not agree and thinks I am just being petty now because I didn't get my way with the house. 

I feel like he doesn't value the work that I do and he feels like i'm being unfair and not letting him protect what is rightfully his, his money. I don't want his money. I just want to know he cares about something more than his money. AITA for wanting to stop catering to him now? I'm scared that we are starting down a path that will only get uglier.

252,t3_rvgdcv,AITA for calling my personal assistant a cleaner?,"We have someone, Susan, who cleans and cooks for us. When we hired her, she wanted the title of personal assistant. So that's what we hired her as. She's been with us for about 4 months now and there haven't been any issues until yesterday. I've already apologised but I'm still not sure if what I did was offensive or if she just overreacted.

So I work from home and I was in the office in a meeting when Susan came in with a vacuum and asked if she can clean the room. I said sure, and in the meeting said something like ""Stepping out for a second, moving to another room while my cleaner cleans this one"". Then I moved to another room to finish my meeting. Afterwards, Susan confronted me about referring to her as a cleaner to my coworkers when we hired her as a personal assistant. She seemed quite distraught so I quickly apologised and promised to not do it again.

I feel really bad but my coworkers would be so confused if I said personal assistant. I'll probably say something like ""while this room gets cleaned"" if this comes up again.

253,t3_rvgc01,AITA for expecting my ex to pay for a flight out to see him that never happened?,"On mobile, formatting bad. Blah blah. 

Anyway. I (23f) was in a long distance relationship with let’s say Rex (27m) starting back in the last week of May 2021. He came up to visit me in June and paid for his own ticket and Airbnb while I paid for all of the fun and food expenses. It was a great trip. He left after 9 days. 

We continued our long distance relationship for months. In September we decided that I would come and visit him for Halloween since he thought it would be cute to spend my favorite holiday together. My aunt is a travel agent and got me a really good round trip flight for $267. Only catch was that it was non refundable. We were okay with this because we were so excited to see each other. 

Fast forward to the week of the trip. He finds out his grandfather is sick. I’m understanding and offering all of my support to him. Day before the trip he claims he has to watch his grandmother while his grandpa has surgery. He cancels the trip. I’m upset but I offer my support still to him and ask if even if I went down still was there a way I could help out as I’ve had to take care of my grandmother before her passing. He says not to come, he would just leave me in a hotel room. 

The next day (day I’m supposed to fly out) he calls me and long story short, after small talk just out of the blue breaks up with me. Can’t give me a reason or anything. I ask him for the money for the ticket and he makes a fuss saying at least I have a job and he doesn’t. 

But it didn’t end there. My stupid ass decided to still be online fwb with him. The ticket went to the back of my mind because the way he ended up acting towards me felt like he was trying to make a genuine connection again and get back together. Months go by. Until last week went out of the blue he says we can no longer be fwb, tells me he isn’t interested in getting back together, and makes it clear there was no other girl. I was upset and didn’t talk to him for a week. 

Today I find out that he met this girl Jo (idk how old) online back in October.  The week before he broke up with me. And that three weeks ago when he was still sexting me, they were seeing each other and went on a “date.” I was livid and told him today that I don’t think we could even be friends anymore as I felt lied to and used. 

I reminded him about the plane ticket. I sent him my PayPal and the receipt and told him he owes me the money and I expect it soon. He flipped out on me saying it was mine and my aunt’s fault for booking a non refundable ticket when something could’ve happened at any moment. I told him she worked her ass off to get me a cheap ticket to see my boyfriend who desperately wanted to see me too. He’s bringing up the fact that he canceled the trip because he had to take care of his grandma and that I still could’ve come down. But as I’ve mentioned earlier he specifically told me not to come down. And then of course broke up with me the next day.

254,t3_rvgay5,AITA for telling my gfs mom that she has to get rid of her dogs,"Okay I know that sounds harsh, but hear me out. About a year ago I bought my first house. I didn’t want to buy one yet, but my girlfriend, her mom and I were living with an abusive jackass and they had nowhere to go. Plus I had the money and it was probably a good investment. About 4 months ago my gfs mom brought home two pitt bull puppies- both 10 weeks old. I am very allergic to dogs. They shit and piss everywhere, and play in their own poop all the time. They also shed a lot and it makes my asthma and eczema act up which sucks too. They’re cute dogs but I’m just so sick of it. She was supposed to hold onto them for her brother until he came back home from over seas, and he got back about a week ago and In that time, they got big as fuck. Now her brother doesn’t want them, and my gfs mom is in love with them. I asked her about when her brother would take them back and she seemed offended and kind of ignored me. So the next day I told her that she had to get rid of the dog. I was very calm when I told her and she seemed okay, but then later my girlfriend called me pissed off for making her mom cry and she was saying things like “those are her babies” and all this other stuff like that. Now the vibe here is awful and my girlfriend is acting like I just did some terrible thing. 

And in case anyone thinks it’s weird that I bought a house so they had a place to go- her mom gives me money to help with my bills and her mom is very sweet and we all lived together at her abusers house since I was 19. She can’t buy a house because she has fucked up credit and makes minimum wage. She’s normally great to be around and in 3.5 years of living together we’ve never had any issues.

Jane is super sweet but George has always been a crusty grump and he has never really liked me or any of Jane's friends. Jane is my best friend and she loves my kids so I knew she would answer the door and let us stay. She put us up in her guest bedroom together and made sure we were comfortable but I could hear George grumbling in their bedroom about how having us here was a burden, how we were putting him out, basically how our presence was a burden and how he bet we didn't even actually have a break-in, he said I probably got evicted because I didn't pay rent. (That happened one time, three years ago; I was pregnant, got into a bad car accident and delivered early. My baby had to be in the NICU for a while, I had to have surgery, I ran out of savings, couldn't get a loan, and it was either rent or feed my older kids and I chose to feed my kids. I got my money situation back together within a year and am doing well now.)

In the morning I made breakfast for everyone, hoping that would get George. to soften but he just kept complaining and eventually Jane and he were arguing behind a closed door and it was so awkward and my kids were uncomfortable so we just snuck out and went home and tried not to be scared of the house.

Last night Jane and George showed up at my house in the middle of the night. Apparently there had been a small fire that had made their own apartment uninhabitable and they are going through financial hardship and can't afford a hotel, so they came to me. I agreed to let Jane stay but told George that the way he behaved towards me when I was in need of a safe place for myself and my kids had really bothered me and hurt my feelings. I told him that while I understood that it was bothersome having three kids and a grown women show up at 3am I had had something awful happen and he could have shown some empathy. I told him that he could find other accommodation. George threw a fit and ordered Jane to leave with him, which she did.

My mom (36F) and I never really had a good relationship –mostly because she always saw me as a competitor and someone she had to be ""better than"", and is always comparing my achievements to hers at my age.

On Christmas day our families were having a small gathering, and everyone was having a good time. We were having barbecue, and my mom and my boyfriend's sister (35F) decided that they didn't really want to eat barbecue, and wanted sushi. My mom said that my boyfriend should pay, as a Christmas gift for her, since he hadn't gotten her anything (which she hadn't either). His sister then jokingly said the he didn't get her a birthday gift, and she also wanted the sushi. My mom then proceeded to turn to her and say ""Well, yes, but he isn't f*cking your daughter"".

I was shocked, and didn't really know what to say. My boyfriend's sister was just as shocked as I was, and looked at me nervously, not knowing what to say or do. My boyfriend didn't hear what my mom had said because of the loud music playing, and when he noticed my face, he leaned closer and said ""Sorry, what? I didn't hear you"", to which she repeated the exact same words, and then smirked at me.

A while later, I pulled her aside and away from everyone else, and told her ""I didn't really feel comfortable with that joke, and don't think you have the freedom to make this kind of comment to someone I'm not even close with"". She just looked at me and said ""So what? I'm your mother. I can say whatever I want, and if you don't like it, get a hotel, and don't bring him to my house"" and a bunch of other random stuff. 

Our discussion started to escalate, and my boyfriend took me away from her to calm me down. 

We haven't talked since, and she seems to think she did nothing wrong. I have since found out that this wasn't the first time she talked about my sex life to people, and my father, uncle and grandmothers also heard some type of comment related to that, even if I'm not around.

I know her mother was never open to this kind of topic, and was very strict about dating when my mom was a teenager –which actually led her to move out at 15yo to live an abusive relationship with my father for over 5 years –, but this comment to me was still hurtful.

She has a decent paying job, to the point where she can afford an apartment on her own (my partner and I don’t live paycheck to paycheck, but there’s not much wiggle room either).

She didn’t discuss any plans with her bridal party (3 bridesmaids including me and one MOH). We are all different ages, her MOH is 20, I’m 23, the other bridesmaids are 20 and 24. We all have very different budgets. I’m working full time since I graduated in 2020, but still living at home with family to save before I move closer to work where the cost of living is high. So I am saving, but can be flexible and would be able to swing this trip since she is planning so far ahead (which I do appreciate). The other girls are all still in school, and living at home. 

This past weekend, the bride sent a text to the group chat (that has been silent since none of us are close) with flights and hotels for her bachelorette party. She picked dates without consulting us, and she decided we’d go to Nashville and stay in a downtown hotel. 2 of us live in MA, the other two in NH. She is a teacher, she picked a weekend in August since she is off. She chose to make it a long weekend even though it’s not a holiday so we would go Friday to Monday. She already booked her flight and is planning on booking the hotel in the coming weeks. August is very busy at my work, and I’m not sure how every one else’s time off works. I know I already can only do Friday night to Sunday. The wedding isn’t even until November. 

The total for each person comes out to around $500-600 for flights and hotel only. She wants to party all weekend so food and drinks will drive this cost way up. I’m not sure what to do, I’m not friends with the other girls, I didn’t expect her to pick these dates, and I don’t really want to spend this kind of money on a trip I didn’t pick. But she expects that we’re all going. We’ve already bought $200 bridesmaid dresses, and we are paying $100 each to share some rooms in a hotel for her wedding this Fall since it is out of town.

Two sets of couples, me being in one of the sets (this becomes more important later on). Over this past summer, I went on a cleaning spree: I worked 40 hours then spent close to 30 cleaning. It ended up resulting in me panicking when there was clutter, and me and the other roommates decided on a chore chart. I paid for this chore chart ($20 I think).

I generally pick up more than people realize. I take out dirty glasses, throw out fast food bags, ect. I usually do this either before everyone wakes up or after everyone is asleep. 

About two weeks ago, I fell down a whole flight of stairs. I lucky did not break anything, but I pulled a lot of muscles in my shoulder and my back. This caused me, like any other person, to be in severe pain. I was putting on Icy Hot hourly, couldn’t bend over to pick anything up, generally I worked and came home and was in pain. Only about 5 days ago I started to be able to function without severe pain and clean. When I was able to clean, I ended up doing all of the chore because I felt bad, because even tho I was injured, I didn’t do chores.

This morning I woke up and did my makeup in the bathroom and left the door open. 3 of my roommates complained on me not doing chores for that week and a half, and complained about my SO doing all of his chores in one day.

260,t3_rvfx84,AITA For “kicking a lady out of my vacation/retiring home?,"Edit: couple people asked if there is a lease, there isnt, they let her stay in our place for 750 a month because L’s parents know mine.

First I just want to say this isn’t my scenario but the one my parents are in right now with a lady renting there vacation home/retiring home. I also want to say in my home town in mass it’s common for people to rent houses but stay in the house for one to two weeks during summer.

Cast: D= My dad M= My Mom J=me and L=Renter 

My Parents have a home in Florida they used to go to a lot but not so much any more, because my parents don’t go the home that much anymore they decided to rent it to a lady we Know(L), they rent L the house for 750$ a month and have done so for five years. My Dad has come close to retiring and will in the next year or two. When my parents started renting the place to L they said they could come down and stay in the house for 2 too 3 times a year, they of course give a months notice, L let us but seemed a little agitated. When we got the house it was a complete shit show, holes in doors, outside porch screens broken, and terrible tries at fixing holes in the walls. My Dad was heated, she pays 750$ a month for a place where rent is normally 1500$ a month, he got mad and wanted my Mom to talk to L because my Mom and L are just better friends than my Dad and L. My Mom talked to L and told her the place seemed like there had been really no care for anything in it. L got mad and started saying how she is doing us a favor by giving us 750$ a month(she isn’t, 750$ doesn’t even cover all the costs on the house) My Mom and Dad told her they will be coming back down in July(maybe just my dad tho idk.) to fix up the kitchen and fix up other things around the house, she got more mad, M and D said she at least needs to fix the wholes in doors and paint over and redo the terrible try and covering holes in the walls, she got more mad, this let to my parents saying they will be re doing most of the house and selling it or just keeping it, but in both scenarios they are kicking her out, she has multiple months to pack but she is just freaking out and getting extremely mad. 


I was just wondering if my parents are in the right or wrong, and if the are a holes or not a holes.",45.0
261,t3_rvfwzj,WIBTA if I didn't inform my mom that my bio-mom would be at my wedding party?,"I (27M) and my fiancé (37M) live in the US and will be getting married in February. We're going to be doing a courthouse wedding then later on down the road we're going to be doing multiple parties to accommodate family, so 2 in the US, 1 in England.

Background: When I was about 1 my bio-mom left me and my dad because she wasn't ready to have a kid (she was 17), and it was just me and my dad for about 3 years. He married my mom (technically stepmom) when I was 4. As a child, she was not a very good mom at all. She filled the ""evil stepmother"" role quite well for many, many years, but once I got older it was much better. But still, she was/and still is irrational, vindictive, and pole vaults to conclusions constantly.

Regarding my bio mom, I saw her once when I was 5 while I was at my grandparents house. I had no idea who she was but apparently we had a nice chat. After that, my dad and mom forbid her from seeing me because they didn't want her to hop in and out of my life, which I find understandable. However, my parents pretended she didn't exist for my entire life and I didn't ask questions because I thought it would make my dad upset and that my mom would punish me for bringing her up.

So I waited until I was 17, made a secret Facebook, found my bio-mom and sent her a message. She lived in a different state and was ecstatic I reached out to her. I was 19 when my mom &amp; dad found out I made a connection after my sister found my Facebook and showed my mom. My mom EXPLODED and sent paragraphs of texts just going off on me and her, and how betrayed she felt. It got to the point where I just went full NC. After a few months went by, I reached out to my mom and we got lunch, and she apologized for everything and said she was upset because she thought I was trying to replace her. I told her that she will always be my mom, I just wanted to explore another side of my family. Things were shaky for awhile (mostly my parents disapproving of my ex at that point) but as the years passed our relationship has gotten stronger. While I'll never forget my childhood, my mom is an excellent parent to adult children.

So to my problem, both my mom and my bio-mom want to go to all the parties. This makes sense, HOWEVER my mom is VERY confrontational and I'm terrified about how she will react to seeing my bio-mom. I'm very non-confrontational and I just know if something happened it would ruin the whole party for me and I'd be forced to ""side"" with one of them. My fiancé says we should just not let them come to all of the parties and only send an invite to a specific one. All of my siblings say that I should not say anything, and that I should just let them make a fool of themselves. My friends say that I should give her a notice the day of so she's not completely taken off guard. My grandparents think I should just tell my dad and let him decide what and when to tell her. I'm of the mindset that I shouldn't need to tell her, but I'm wondering WIBTA if I said nothing",12.0
262,t3_rvfwo5,AITA for saying my husband's kid's dog has to go and they can't get another?,"My (36) husband (45) has a son who is almost 16 years old and starting 10th grade. This is his child from a previous marriage and he spends every other week with us sometimes 2 weeks straight depending on the length of the month. In 2020 schools did virtual learning. We learned that his son was becoming depressed from not being able to physically hang out with his friends. He started therapy and one random week when he was with his mom she decided to get him an emotional support dog and decides since it's for their son that the dog should follow the son between homes. My husband just followed her lead with no pushback and then tells me.

I was against this (how is the dog our responsibility when she got the dog?). I let my husband know my concerns: Dogs shouldn't jump between homes so soon. The dog needs to get comfortable and should be potty trained. His son never leaves the computer room, doesn't pick up after himself, doesn't clean, his room and comp room are a mess (husband doesn't discipline them nor enforce rules), sooooo how does he think his son will take care of a dog? Btw, husband and I already have two shih tzus, they are older, potty trained, doesn't really mess with stuff.

Fast forward and I was right. We have carpet up stairs, the dog urinates and defecates wherever it wants, both of the kids just walks over poop and doesn't clean up after the dog. It pisses in their beds and sometimes they don't care to bring the sheets down for them to be washed. It smelled up there. The dog has only attached to my husband's daughter (14) and so the son doesn't mess with the dog at all. He only feeds him when told. Neither kid likes the dog (mom admitted this) and they act the same at her home with the dog, disinterested. The dog is super anxious, only likes the daughter, when he thinks everyone's asleep, he hops on the kitchen table, and he will also try to eat the other dogs' food regardless of if he's eaten or not.

I feel like the dog was never an emotional support dog. He unfortunately was a pandemic dog that the mom decided in a rushed decision to get (while on a trip somewhere) because neither parent knows how to tell their kids NO. Their mom has admitted that she thinks the dog should go back to the shelter and that they could get another. I totally disagree with getting another dog for and think the dog should just stay at her home regardless of if it goes back. Maybe he just needs to stay at one place so he could get use to it? BUT the dog is not ours. I let my husband know that I do not want the dog here anymore and if they get another that the dog is not allowed here. He ALWAYS pushes back, gets upset and asks ""What am I supposed to do?! What do you want me to do?! I can't say the dog can't come over here!"" Is this normal for co-parenting? one parent gets a dog for the kids and pushes it onto the other parent too?

So I feel like I could slightly be TA for saying the dog has to go and they can't have another.",25.0
263,t3_rvfqlb,AITA for triggering my cousin's eating disorder?,"This happened a few days ago but I still feel really guilty about it so I'm posting it here. 

Every year, my (15f) extended family goes away for a vacation during Christmas/New Year, usually just to a ski resort nearby (we're from a snowy region). But we weren't able to go last year because of Covid so this year we decided to go somewhere warmer, so we ended up going to California, which I was really excited about. 

I'm also a pretty serious athlete. I run cross country in the fall, play basketball in the winter, and run track in the spring, and I'm looking to go to college for running so I can get an athletic scholarship. I was supposed to go to a few workouts with the basketball team over break but I couldn't because we went to California so my coach told me to do the workouts on my own while I was away. 

We had a pretty packed schedule on the trip so I normally worked out early in the morning at the hotel gym for the first few days and nobody had an issue with it. But on the 6th day of the trip, I slept in a little later than usual before I went for a run, and when I got back, everyone else was already eating breakfast. My brother asked me where I went, I said I went for a jog, he laughed at me for working out when we were on vacation, and then (here's the part I feel terrible about) I made a comment that was like ""Coach would kill me if I'm out of shape when I get back, I gotta work off all the ice cream we're eating somehow.""

At this moment, my cousin ""Katie"" (16f) stood up from the table and went to the bathroom and slammed the door. Her mom, my aunt ""Emily"" gave me a dirty look and ran after her. Aunt Emily then pulled me aside later to tell me that Katie had been struggling with an eating disorder lately and that the comment I made was really triggering to her. She said I had ruined the whole family vacation, and told me I ""shouldn't make such a big deal out of exercising in the first place"" because it could make other people feel bad about themselves. I felt awful because I hadn't meant to hurt her, and looking back, I never would have said anything like that if I knew Katie wasn't doing well (I apologized to Katie later but she just told me to leave her alone).

While Aunt Emily was talking to me, my dad (Aunt Emily's brother) stepped in and said I had done nothing wrong, and Aunt Emily said that I'm insensitive and need to think before I speak, and it turned into a whole argument that *really* ruined the vacation. We ended up cutting it 3 days short and returning home. 

My dad still insists I did nothing wrong but I feel like such a jerk. AITA?",154.0

265,t3_rvfoml,AITA for telling my girlfriend to answer the phone differently?,"My (F25) girlfriend (F30) does something I consider really rude, but I understand it is most likely a difference in our habits. 

Whenever someone calls when we go out, whether as a couple or to visit friends, she has to answer the phone and talk for (in my opinion) long periods of time. A few examples of this: 

We went to visit our friends (another couple), and one hour into our visit, her mom called and she went into their bedroom without asking to continue talking on the phone. After the first half hour I thought something was wrong, so I got worried and went in to see if she was alright. She waved me away with a smile and continued talking. She spent at least another 45 minutes on the phone while I sat and chatted with our friends. I thought this was super awkward since she didn’t ask and also this was time we were supposed to spend with them. It started getting late and they were tired, but they were too polite to ask me to go get my girlfriend to leave to let them rest. 

Afterwards I told my girlfriend and she agreed not to do it again. I said it’s fine to answer and just say she’ll call back later, but having a full conversation in the middle of plans is rude. 

Again, she was at a family dinner, and stepped away to answer a phone call from a friend. She went upstairs to the guest bedroom and we could all hear her pacing down the hallway and laughing and talking loudly. This continued for 20 minutes before I text her saying my siblings were leaving to go home. She read it and said “okay I’ll be down, just talking to patty,” and the pacing and talking continues. Half an hour later she finally came downstairs. 

I told her again that she should just say she’ll call them back later when we’re out or have plans, unless it’s an emergency. She called me a hard ass and said I’m being controlling and anal. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the input, I appreciate all your comments. This is just to clarify some confusing parts of the original text and answer some common questions. 

1. “she went into their bedroom without asking to continue talking on the phone” is referring to asking permission from the hosts to enter their bedroom. I’m a very private person, so it baffled me that she could just nonchalantly walk into their room and close the door without a second thought. 

2. My girlfriend does not have social anxiety or ADHD. She’s normally (outside of this) very engaged and outgoing during social situations. To clarify, these are (now) mutual friends that I introduced to her and my relatives in these two scenarios, however they are both casual events where she was under no expectation to come, but said she wanted to and was excited to see them.

3. I told her it makes me feel very awkward and uncomfortable because everyone else (including me) is just left in limbo until her phone call ends. She said that it’s just a phone call, everyone can continue to chat without her. I told her that while that’s true, I’m also afraid that we’re putting the hosts in an uncomfortable position. She asked what I want her to do about it since it’s rude for her to ignore her calls, and I suggested that she answer the phone to see what’s going on, and if it’s not urgent then say she can call them back later. She said this is fine, but has continued to have long conversations because she says it gets “carried away.” She has stopped doing this on dates as far as I know, though it could be just that no one’s called her. In our most recent conversation, she called me a hard ass because she thinks I am taking this too seriously and that I’m the only one making a big deal out of it.",3965.0
266,t3_rvfo7h,AITA for losing it with my partner over his dad.,"I (29F) and my partner (30M) have been together for nearly five years. Our relationship has been rocky, to say the least, but we've never really had major fall outs.

I want to preface this with the fact I've never met or spoken to his parents once. I've met his children, but never the mothers of his children etc. I haven't met any of his family but he has met all of mine. Every time we've had time apart he made an effort to text good morning and good night even if I didn't get anything else.

He has also never said a good word about his dad. Ever. His reason for us not meeting is that his dad will belittle him etc. He never visited him. Never made time for him. Nothing.

Ok back to the point. This year, his dad became sick to the point where he needed night carers. His step-mum had organised care previously and it eventually happened that while she worked, my partner would go look after his dad. It wasn't ideal. He would do look after his dad on a Tuesday evening, Thursday evening and then go to his dad's on a Saturday lunchtime to Monday at 2am. 

That was OK. But then four months ago that started becoming five days a week... six days... and then on one of his days off when he was there waiting for his mum to come home, she left. And by left I mean she went all the way down the country without telling anyone and hasn't returned.

Because of this I now haven't seen my partner in nearly three months. He came home for my birthday, a week at Christmas, and then one day this week, but besides that I don't see him. I barely even get texts.

I'm very aware that this is a high stress situation, do not get me wrong, but here's why I blew up at him.

His dad keeps going out, a lot. He's gone to visit his mum. He's gone out and not told anyone where he's going. He managed to look after himself for a week while we had the kids. I'm not asking my partner to stop going to his dad's. What I'm asking is that he doesn't just live there and he doesn't care. He keeps saying things like ""I'll understand if you leave"" when I've made no mention of doing so. I purposefully try to call him once a day to check in and tend to be greeted with ""what the f do you want."" Which is why I snapped today. He's been telling me that when he went back on the 27th that he'd talk to his dad about reducing his days back down to the original lot so he can spend some time st home. But he hasn't done that. Every day he's given me an excuse. ""Dad's out on the bike. Dad's not left his room. I've been busy applying to jobs."" 

I ended up telling him that he used to ""get annoyed at his dad for less"" and that ""if I was acting the way his dad was he'd be giving me hell right now."" I also told him that I feel like his dad's starting to take advantage.

All of this that's happening at his dad's I only know because he actively tells me.

So, AITA for blowing up at him? Probably. Probably is the answer.",4.0
267,t3_rvfjz8,WIBTA If I banned my sister from coming to my home for fear of her destroying stuff,"Throwaway because I don't know if any of my family is on here, also I will not be putting ages in case she sees this but everyone here except for 2 of my sisters are all adults.

So, I know it sounds bad, but hear me out.

I have 4 sisters, 2 are full blood and 2 are half sisters. One of my full blood sisters has ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome. I myself have ASD(Autism Spectrum Disorder), so we sort of relate on the autism spectrum. Her problem is that she destroys pretty much everything she touches. She takes stuff apart and doesn't think about anyone's feelings of someone else besides her owns that thing.

Now she's put holes in the crotch area of 3 pairs of my pajama pants, and they're pretty big holes too, all because she saw a string there, and she's taken the stitching out of sleeves the the bottoms of a lot of my shirts. On another occasion she's taken apart a mini witch voodoo doll keychain that I got from a mall in Pueblo and it was really special to me. And just recently she took apart this little wooden holder for a mini moon lamp I had, but thankfully I could put that back together. Her excuse is always ""I couldn't help it"" or she just says ""Well"" and has this look on her face and she can't think of anything else to say.

I don't have a place of my own yet because my job situation is not the best(I work 3 hours per day for 5 days a week, I'm trying to get a second job) but I don't think it'd be a good idea if she really ever comes to my place when I get one because I know she'll find one thing after another to destroy and some of those things may be irreplaceable.

So, I want to know, would I be the(an) asshole if I banned her from coming to my place if she ever decided to come to my place?

Edit because I forgot to mention this: She lives with our dad and stays in her room watching TV most days and she doesn't have any sort of job or anything like that. Yes, she's an adult, she just chooses to stay home and not do anything besides watch TV in her room. I live with our mom for right now but I have a sort of stable job and am trying to find a place as I mentioned before.",214.0

They said that I was charged an incorrect price and they needed me to come back and pay them an additional five dollars. I was a student and thus short on cash, anyway I found the whole thing absurd. I told them that this was their problem, I paid the initial price charged and I would not come back to pay the additional five dollars. I told them not to call me again.

269,t3_rvfi3q,AITA for making my mom cry?,"Hi, I (17 about to be 18 F) have been having quarrels with my mom (51 F) as of recent years. As the title says, I made her cry after saying some pretty harsh stuff.

To give some history to our relationship: She always treated me like an adult and that I was her go-to person when it came to venting. She even said that I understand her more than my sisters (28 F, 16 F) do. She also, and this is objective because she even admitted it herself, turns every vent conversation onto her and her horrible childhood.

Cut to yesterday, we got into an argument. I think it started after I tried to vent to her about me graduating soon and not knowing if I can get through college. She said that I was stressing her out with my problems and that I talk about school too much. That got me really angry. I told her how as my mother, she needed to be there for me more and that it's unfair for her to shut me out when all she does is talk about herself whenever I try to get comfort from her.

From here, she started laughing. She always does this when nervous or doesn't want to admit she's wrong. Again, that's objective because she also admitted that herself. I told her to stop laughing because I felt that she wasn't taking my issue seriously. She kept laughing and said, ""This is my defense mechanism. If I don't do this, I'll cry."", to which I told her it's okay to cry and that this actually hurts not only herself but others too. She just continued to laugh.

I finally got fed up. I told her that she was a horrible mother and that all she ever did was neglect any emotional need I had. That it's unfair for her to push all her baggage onto me but then get mad whenever I try to vent to her. I swore a bunch and raised my voice while saying all this.

That's when she started to cry. She was telling me about how she didn't want to be a horrible mother and that she knows what it's like because her mother was the same. I know she feels bad but we've been through this before and she says the same thing each time so I don't know if she's actually being sincere.

Regardless, I made her cry and said some pretty harsh stuff. AITA for making her cry like that?",14.0
270,t3_rvfgoe,AITA for being annoyed at my mom for adopting my ex-wife?,"My ex-wife Tara (F32) and I (M36) were together for 8 years, and married for 5. My wife's biological family died when she was very young, she was in an out of the foster care system for most of her childhood but never adopted, and had therefore never had a family. 

Tara always had a really great relationship with my mom, often saying how my mom (F61) was like the mother she never had. My mom also joked a few times about how if we weren't married, she would adopt Tara. I never thought much of these jokes, because I never fathomed it would actually happen.

Tara and I divorced 2 months ago after I found out she was having an affair for 4 months. I won't go into details, but it was messy. I decided I want nothing more to do with her. My mom was devastated. She has still kept in contact with Tara (who is now dating the guy she cheated on me with.) I find this a bit disrespectful, but there's not much I can do.

Last week she invited me over saying she needs to talk to me about something. She told me that after many extensive discussions with Tara, she is planning to adopt her, to ""give her the family she never had."" I admit, I lost it a bit. I flipped out on her, and called her a shit mother for putting my ex- wife- who cheated on me- over her own son. I stormed out.

She called me yesterday and asked if I'd cooled down, which I had. I apologised for calling her a shit mother, but said my stance was the same. I said how the idea of my ex-wife being my sister made me very uncomfortable, especially having to explain it to others. I said I no longer want to have a connection with Tara, and making us literal siblings forces me to (she disagreed with this.) She said I was being insensitive, that Tara has never had a family etc. I told her if she chooses to adopt Tara, I would have to go no-contact with her for my own sanity. She started crying, called me an AH and said I was emotionally blackmailing her.

271,t3_rvffvp,AITA for wanting to never see my MIL again?,"Four months ago, my MIL crossed some major lines during a vulnerable time in my life-- as I (30F) recovered from a traumatic injury. I'm leaving that conflict out because it's very specific and I am not conflicted about whether I was in the right in that situation. 

What I am conflicted about is this: 

I have essentially decided I do not want to have any kind of relationship with her right now. I don't even want to see her. My husband still sees her (though he is definitely on my side about the initial conflict) and I don't prevent her from seeing the kids... As long as it is either not at my home or at a time I will not be home. She made a very bad attempt at an apology at my husband's behest but it was extremely, ""I'm sorry you got so mad about this."" So again, I haven't seen her in months. 

I am actually very content with this. Our personalities never meshed well, I have always found her difficult to be around, and it's a relief to not have to hear her complain or talk negatively about people's appearances or tell me about the latest manager she spoke to (I'm not exaggerating here: she called a company's corporate office because an employee said ""no problem"" instead of ""you're welcome."") She is a very unpleasant woman and the Big Conflict gave me a good excuse to just nope out. 

Where I think I might be the asshole is that it can be sort of inconvenient for my husband and FIL (who hasn't exactly done anything wrong) to work out times to see each other when I won't be around. My kids also love her and don't spend as much time with her due to this. It was much easier for everyone (except me) when they just popped over and hung out without a time limit. I sometimes feel guilty and selfish for stubbornly avoiding seeing her. I know I probably can't avoid her forever but for now I can. 

But I really like my life without her in it! Am I the asshole?

EDIT: One of the first comments is people asking about the initial conflict which I'm not going to share because it's a very long story, it's not the part where I wonder if I'm being the asshole, and I can't think of how to make it less identifying if anyone I know reads this. 

It's all relative and jn the grand scheme, what she did wasn't that serious. She didn't harm me physically or steal my identity or do anything illegal. She just made a very difficult and painful time much more difficult. 

The reason I think the initial conflict is irrelevant is because my question can basically be distilled into: is it okay to cut someone out just because your life is easier and better without them, even at some inconvenience to others.",12.0
272,t3_rvfbh3,WIBTA if I didn't inform my mom that my bio-mom would be at my wedding party?,"Sorry this is long!

I (27M) and my fiancé (37M) live in the US and will be getting married February of this year. We're going to be doing a courthouse wedding with our mutual friend as the witness, then later on down the road we're going to be doing multiple parties to accommodate family, so two in the US, one in England (fiancé is English).

Background: When I was about 1 my bio-mom left me and my dad because she wasn't ready to have a kid (she was 17), and it was just me and my dad for about 3 years. He married my mom (technically stepmom) when I was 4. As a child, she was not a very good mom at all. She filled the ""evil stepmother"" role quite well for many, many years, but once I hit about 16/17 a switch flipped. She was supportive in ways I needed her to be, and I always chocked it up to her finally coming to the conclusion of ""he is your son,"" allowing me to finally embrace her as my mom. But still, she was/and still is irrational, vindictive, and pole vaults to conclusions constantly to the point where all of my siblings and their spouses walk on egg shells around her.

Regarding my bio mom, I saw her once when I was 5 while I was at my grandparents house. I had no idea who she was but apparently we had a nice chat with me asking her ""What did I do to make you leave me?"" as the first thing I said when she asked if I had any questions. Fun times. After that, my dad and mom forbid her from seeing me because they didn't want her to hop in and out of my life, which I find understandable. However, my parents pretended she didn't exist for my entire life. They treated my creation as if my dad was Zeus and I just popped out of his head one day. I didn't ask questions because I thought it would make my dad upset and that my mom would punish me for bringing her up.

So, I waited until I was 17, made a secret Facebook, found my bio-mom and sent her a message. She lived in a different state and was ecstatic I reached out to her. I kept this a secret for years. I was 19 when my mom &amp; dad found out I made a connection after my sister found my Facebook and showed my mom who I was friends with. My mom EXPLODED and sent paragraphs of texts just going off on me and her, and how betrayed she felt. It got to the point where I just went full NC, and I embraced my bio-mom. I went to their house for Christmas and had a lovely time. I did have an epiphany while I was there though. In my head, and my moms head, I had to ""choose"" one. There could only be one mom.

I came to the conclusion that that was BS so I unblocked my mom, and sent her a message that we needed to go to dinner and talk. We got lunch, and she apologized for everything and said she was upset because she thought I was trying to replace her. I told her that she will always be my one and only mom, I just wanted to explore a whole other side of my family. Things were shaky for awhile (mostly my parents disapproving of my ex at that point) but as the years passed our relationship has gotten stronger and stronger. While I'll never forgive or forget my childhood, my mom is an excellent parent to adult children.

So to my problem, both my mom and my bio-mom want to go to all of the parties that we'll be throwing. This makes total sense, HOWEVER my mom is VERY confrontational (she has literally 0 friends and most of our family will only speak to her via text so that way they don't have to deal with the yelling and can plan their responses) and I'm terrified about how she will react to seeing my bio-mom. While I was NC with my parents, I asked my bio-mom how she would react to seeing my dad and my mom and she said it was my day and she'd never do anything to distract from that, but she's not the type of person to fold when confronted with aggression also. I'm very non-confrontational and I just know if something happened it would absolutely ruin the whole party for me and I'd be forced to ""side"" with one of them. My fiancé says we should just not let them come to all of the parties and only send an invite to a specific one. All of my siblings (half and step) say that I should just not say anything, and that I should just let them make a fool of themselves if something arises. My friends say that I should give her a notice the day of, or a week prior so she's not completely taken off guard. My grandparents think I should just tell my dad and let him decide what and when to tell her. I'm of the mindset that I shouldn't need to tell her, but I'm wondering WIBTA if I said nothing...",1.0
273,t3_rvf8zl,AITA for telling my girlfriend to wear socks during a video?,"I run a YouTube channel with a little over 200,000 subscribers and a very active community. I do a mix of content such as commentary and reviews. Anyway my girlfriend has been asking for a while if she could be in one of my videos and I finally told her I'd let her in one. 

So I'm getting us ready to record when I notice she doesn't have socks on. I tell her to go put some socks on before we start. She asks me why but I tell her to just do it. She still wants to know so I tell her that there's a lot of weird guys on the internet and I don't want anybody even making jokes in the comment section about something so innocent. 

She told me that I was being irrational and that she wouldn't do it. I told her that not doing something so simple was the irrationally thing. Then we were both mad, I told her I didn't want to do the video anymore and I just scraped that whole idea and went with something I came up with a while ago.

274,t3_rvf7ka,AITA for not wanting to live with my boyfriend's dad?,"So, I know the title sounds bad, but you may understand later on. I need to clear up beforehand that I love my boyfriend's dad, he's a sweet guy and generally a really nice person. My boyfriend (who I'll call Sam) and I have been getting more serious and have been talking about experimenting with living with each other; like renting a cabin for a week or I move into his house with his family and he does the same at my house for a week or so and I honestly love the idea of living with him.

Now, Sam has been super supportive when it comes to my tr@uma because when I was younger my dad was not a nice person. I was a very big daddy's girl and loved my dad to bits, so when my mum said that he was moving away, it crushed me. I've lived **14 years** without my dad and have only seen him around about 6 times after he left my family. (this is important for later)

Anyway, we haven't got around to doing the moving in for a week thing yet because of covid. But we had a discussion about the future and Sam said that my mum charges way too much when it comes to renting and he doesn't want to move in at my house because he doesn't want to spend that much money when we're looking for a house to buy in the future. I understand that and agreed that she charges way too much. I'm 18 and have to give my mum £150 for a room in the house. But I told Sam that I didn't feel comfortable living with his dad there. His mum passed away last year around June and now his dad has moved back in because of his little brother.

Sam has said that he thinks me moving into his family home may cause some structure in the house because I'm a woman. He says his dad and himself are finding it hard to maintain the house because of his mothers recent passing, and a woman being in the house might actually make everything feel normal again. Sam seems to think that it is rude of me to just say no as soon as he asked me and not give it any thought at all, and I do understand, but I cannot help but feel uncomfortable.

My boyfriend doesn't understand why I can't get past the fact that he has a dad living with him and why I can't just get over it. I know his dad will never lay his hands on me or shout at me but I cannot bring myself to live in the same house as a man because I'm not used to it and I have had traumatising experiences with men when I was a child. I understand that not all men are the same and I'm not saying they are, but I am not used to men being in the same house as I am.

This has caused some heat between us and it won't go away. Sam just can't understand why I (a small, trauma-riddled, woman) cannot bring myself to live with a man I've known for 3 years, and it has caused arguments. I just don't understand why he doesn't understand. I get that he might find it rude and it may seem like I don't like his dad, or I have a problem with him being there, but I have said that I don't NOT like him and explained my feelings.

275,t3_rvf6ij,AITA for bringing in a person's character into a discussion of their skill?,"I'm (27F) a follower of esports (professional video gaming), including League of Legends (LoL), and I have some friends (\~10 late 20s dudes) that I often get together to watch professional LoL tournaments with.

Background: a bit over a year ago, a bunch of texts leaked that were supposedly between a professional LoL player (Fofo, 22m) and his then GF: some where he was really demeaning to her and some that said he wanted to have a daughter so he could take her virginity. I was absolutely floored, and my friends and I all agreed that this guy should be banned from professional play. Fofo released a statement apologizing for nonspecific ""bad behavior,"" was penalized half that year's salary (\~hundreds of Ks USD), and stayed on his team. In late 2021, more texts leaked where he was very cruel towards a bunch of new women. This offseason (Nov &amp; Dec yearly), he signed onto a ""superteam"" with a bunch of top tier players.

Last week, I hung out with my LoL aficionado buddies and a few of their friends that I didn't know. We were discussing the offseason moves, and ""Andrew,"" a friend of my friend ""Ben,"" brought up about how incredible of a player Fofo was, and how that he was a huge fan of that ""superteam."" I said no fucking way, he's detestable. Andrew admitted he hadn't seen the 2021 leaks, said that Fofo was just 20 when he said that other stuff and probably thought it was cool. Some friends (not Ben) chimed in to say Fofo was pretty awful person. Andrew said that we were just talking about what players were good, and there was no reason for me to bring Fofo's character into it. Admittedly I started getting worked up and insisted that fans SHOULD reject Fofo in any discussion to show that people like him shouldn't get rewarded with high 6-/low 7-figure (USD) contracts. Andrew asked me why I was yelling, not to get so emotional because I didn't know any of these ppl and maybe the women were shit too, and I got more angry, said to everyone this dynamic was emblematic of the toxicity in esports and it's the fault of guys like them for letting ppl like Fofo get away with shit. I stormed out tearing, a couple of my friends (not Ben) walked out after me and tried to calm me down but I told them I hadda leave.

Part of my emotional response was because I had a very similar exchange on reddit a few weeks ago (downvoted for bring up Fofo's behavior, partially to raise awareness bc he's not covered in English media), but that's reddit, and this was my friends.

Yesterday, Ben texted me and said that he hoped that I was feeling better and that Fofo sucks, but I shouldn't bring up a player's personal stuff every time we're talking skill and that I was a ""holier than thou douche"" to Andrew.

This is something I doubt and i'm not exactly wanting to dedicate hours and hours to a show I know I won't like especially as once we start it i'll finish it out of guilt, he is upset by this and says he doesn't get why I don't like it when I like Star Trek.

After this, my dad reacted in a completely negative way- he called me slurs, threatened to kick me out and more. My mother appeared to agree, did not defend me, and told me I was “being disgusting” and that I’d “figure out what really matters”. Within the next two years, however, my parents had divorced and my mom had fallen for a woman. 

They are getting married soon, and I even had a hand in helping my mother work through her feelings. I am helping plan the wedding. I still feel resentful of the way I was treated, though, especially since she never apologized. I brought it up during a conversation about her wedding plans in the kitchen once, and she denied ever saying things like that and refused to apologize, saying instead that I was being ungrateful that I had family that accepted me. (For context, every member of both my mom and her fiancé’s families accepted them.)

She wants me to play a love song I wrote about two women who fall in love despite their families disapproval at her wedding on my guitar, and in my anger, I refused to do so until she admitted and apologized for treating me poorly due to my sexual orientation.

I told her Wednesday I couldn’t make that drive because I was working till late and then had plans with my partners family BUT I could pick her up next Friday, I got dozens of texts but only read a few which called me “deceitful” that I “led her on to thinking she was going to see her grand babies” 

It got to the point where I told her she wasn’t ever allowed to step foot inside my home, my brother texted me saying she was “sobbing” and she sent bunches of texts apologising, she just misses me and my kids.

279,t3_rvekq6,AITA for leaving a family gathering and causing divide with my in laws over a prank?,"My husband has two younger sisters. The youngest is currently living with MIL while waiting for her house to be built, and on Saturday we went to MILs for lunch. MIL and I have always had some tension, and I'd say I'm the black sheep in the family. She adores her daughter's partners. 

I have a 9 year old ""Alex"" (born female) who is non-binary. So far it hasn't been an issue. MIL's husband sometimes struggles with the they/them thing, but that has been it. I'd describe my in laws as socially liberal, financially conservative, and privledged enough that they don't really worry about it.

My husband's family likes pranks, which kind of annoy me, but I've learned to let some stuff go over the years. when we arrived the BIL who is staying there was asleep and MIL told SIL to wake him up because she was going to be making lunch. Instead SIL and her sister put makeup on him while he slept. 

When he came down everyone laughed at him. He looked in the mirror and was like ugh fuck off. This prank really annoyed me, because it is implying there is something wrong with a man wearing makeup and I just don't get why that is funny. I glanced over and Alex rolled their eyes, but Alex isn't a huge fan of my in laws anyway. I told my husband I wanted to go and he asked why, so we talked in private and I told him. He said I was totally overreacting and I just hate his family.

We went back to the table and BIL was trying to get the makeup off. MIL made a comment about she tried putting lipstick on her husband once in the car when he was sleeping but he is a super light sleeper and ""so sad she wanted him to go into CVS"" like that. That time I told my husband I was leaving and took Alex and my two other kids and we left. I do not think it is funny to act like men wearing makeup is funny. I do not think pushing gender norms on someone in any way to embarrass them is funny.

MIL asked why we left and my husband told her and MIL said I am absolutely ridiculous, and SILs agreed and now the whole family thinks I'm crazy and just look for reasons not to like them.",39.0
280,t3_rveiwj,"AITA for not wanting to drive my mom's boyfriend to get liquor, and also for spilling the beans on why I don't like enabling either of them with alcohol consumption.","I'm 18 years old. My bio-father died to alcohol abuse on his part (drunk driving accident, no one else was hurt but him), and my mom (who's just my guardian but we'll call her mom) has struggled with heavy alcohol abuse for years. Before she met her boyfriend, she was... well.. occasionally verbally abusive, mostly insults.

Today, my mom asked me to drive her boyfriend to get alcohol. He drinks it like water, so he needs to buy a 30-can case of beer every 3-4 days. I told her no, that I wasn't comfortable with it because I'd be enabling both of them and also have had a rough history with people consuming alcohol, and then she pulled the ""after everything I do for you card"" and got all pissed.

When she got pissed, I went to my room to cool off, and after a bit I decided to take her boyfriend to the store because he thought I hated him. I have nothing against the dude, he's genuinely nice and makes my mom happy, so I wanted to put his worries to rest. I may not like alcohol consumption, but making someone who's innocent feel completely horrible isn't something I'm fond of.

Anyways, on the car ride, we were having small talk but I was visibly upset and was also about to cry. The small talk ended up evolving into a run-down of memory lane. I told him about my past, about how my bio-dad died due to alcohol and how my mom has had a rich history of making horrible decisions while drunk. I told him that she's told me to ""get over my dad's death"" a year or so ago which hurt so much that it still is on my mind, and even invited random guys over while she was drunk whenever I was still a minor. I'm pretty much traumatized at this point whenever it comes to alcohol.

He ended up telling my mom, and she got really, really pissed at me. They were talking to each other (I was in the kitchen, so I could hear) and she went on about how I was making her look bad. She claimed that she does everything for me and that I can't even be asked to drive them to the local store to allow them to purchase alcohol, and that I had no right to tell him about what she's done. She told me that I need to grow up. I ended up telling her that I could hear her, and she yelled ""I don't care.""

After she got all of that off her chest, I simply told her that if she didn't want him to know, she wouldn't have done what she did. I also told her that if she had any sort of compassion and understood my point of view to some degree, and didn't guilt-trip me when I declined to take her boyfriend to the liquor store, none of this would have happened.

281,t3_rveio5,AITA for not telling my friend that her boyfriend got another girl pregnant?,"So my (21f) two friends, let's call them Rose (19f) and Peter (21m) met last year and started dating on and off. They were constantly arguing and causing drama and they split up earlier this year. They were both still sleeping with each other and other people, Peter wanted to have the freedom to sleep with other people and still have Rose basically. 

This girl called Lucy (29f) started coming to the pub which we all hang out and Peter works at, and she instantly got hooked on him. She would come in and not talk to anyone and wait at the bar for him to talk to her. We all found it weird but ignored it. 

One night, Lucy invited me, Peter and a bunch of our other friends to go back to hers after a night out to carry on drinking. While at her flat, she told me that her and Peter slept together once. I was suprised but not shocked, as Peter was sleeping around a lot by then.

A couple of months ago, me and Peter was in a nightclub and Lucy came in. She kept her distance from Peter but kept staring at him in the distance. I felt a tension and asked Peter but he told me to leave it. We went to after party afterwards and I kept asking him about it. 
He caved in and told me that Lucy said she was pregnant and she wasn't having abortion. I was absolutely shooked, he was terrified of the idea of becoming a dad. 

He begged me not to tell Rose, because he didn't want to lose her, as they were still friends/sleeping together. I said I wouldn't say anything, because tbh their relationship was toxic enough, and I didn't want to get involved.

Lucy had the abortion in the end and we all thought that was the end of it. Peter and Rose got back together about a month ago.

On New Year's Eve, I had Peter's coat at mine and I was gonna drop it off at the pub he worked at before going to a friend's new years party. Rose was there and looked really sad. I asked her what was wrong but she wouldn't tell me. I left without thinking much of it. When I got to the party, my friend told me that he was with them the night before, and another girl told Rose that Peter got Lucy pregnant and she apparently had a meltdown.

Really quick, as usual: I am on a mobile and have brain injuries, so please excuse any mistakes! (I also just hit my head again today, so sorry if this is a little rambling)


So, it's as odd of a question as the title implies, and is pretty straightforward.


I have Endo on my intestines, and an illness called Ulcerative Colitis, along with IBS. If you know about any of these, then you know I use the bathroom *a lot* sometimes 2-3X as often as the average person. It's much worse when I travel, because of the stress and usually having to eat less than optional food.


My in-laws seem incapable of understanding that I naturally use more TP than they do. 
Every time we visit, they sit me down (oftentimes in front of others) and have a ridiculous conversation where they try to teach my how much TP to use. 


And every time I explained that I use the exact amount they insist, and I can't help that I have to use the bathroom more often, and therefore use more than they do.


I find these discussions to be humiliating, and feel like after 7 years, they are being willfully ignorant.


They are also oddly offended whenever I offer to give them $ for it, or bring my own. Apparently they think that I'm implying that they are bad hosts and not providing properly. 


But I am sick of these discussions. It messes with my eating disorder and makes me try to avoid eating, so that I don't poop as much. Which is obviously very bad for me. 


We will be there for 2 weeks this time, and I absolutely need to care for myself. So I want to bring my own TP, that I will keep in my suitcase and not touch theirs at all.
I know they will get mad if I tell them, but I also don't want them to use my not using all the TP as ""proof"" that I was overusing it before if I don't tell them.

283,t3_rveggp,AITA for refusing a big wedding gift from my mother?,"Posted about this a while a ago. It has escalated.
I feel like a huge AH and I'd really like objective opinions.

- My fiancé (30) and I (31) are getting married in July.
- We intentionally put in the invites we didn't want gifts. 

Also worth a mention, we both have good jobs and we don't need help paying for anything.

A while after announcing our engagement my mother wanted to meet, I had a feeling and, indeed, she offered to pay for my dress. She put aside 2k (€) and told me ""You can do want you want, it's your decision, but I'd really like to come shopping"". 
I'd already asked my two best friends (who are also my witnesses) to come. I don't want to change that.

We had multiple conversationsabout this and EVERYTIME the subject came up and I was trying to say I don't want to accept, she either cut me off and wouldn't let me speak, told me ""just deal with it, it's going to happen"" and more things of the sort. 
Like talking to a wall.

My reasons,
- It's too much, she could live of that for 3/4 months, covid is still messing with people's jobs.
- Other people should not spend money because fiancé and I decided to get married.
- Her ""condition"" feels like manipulation.
- I feel like we just don't have that kind of bond, it makes me sad to think she does.
- I feel uncomfortable walking around in a dress someone else payed for.
- We had money issues when I was little (because divorce) and I LOVE that my life is so together now, that I can pay for this myself.
- Growing up, I had issues. All undiagnosed until I was in my mid/late 20's. On the spectrum, depression, anxiety, introverted.. All under control, but they'll never disappear. I never got help, nobody noticed.

I told her my reasons via a text (not great but I couldn't think of another way to tell my this without interruptions).
She kept replying short: ""ok/fine/let's leave it at that"". I told her to please not be mad and she said wasn't, only disappointed. I replied that me being uncomfortable/anxious/forced into something on my wedding is not okay. She said she didn't force me and then literally: ""But I also have feelings"".
Here I got mad. I told her the alternative (to me not accepting) was me feeling crappy towards &amp; on my wedding day. I just can not.

She then didn't reply. Things are strained now. I asked if she wanted to talk (but I didn't change my mind). I'm going there tomorrow and not looking forward to it.

Extra's:
- She asked my hairdresser (with: ""OP doesn't know I'm asking"") if she does wedding hair. She does. I already have the hair thing booked/payed. Next time I see hairdresser I get to reject her. Horrifying.
- She tried to get my fiancé to convince me into taking the money. Her thinking he would force me into this.. I just can't.

I have only been divorced 2 years now, so it still feels fresh to me although I am beginning to find sense of normalcy. I do have young kids. Fast forward to about 5 months ago my mother asks me to find the jewelry I said OK let me start getting my crap organized. I did, and started looking for it in my home storage, but it has been freezing cold and I work full time plus being a mom I haven't had time to properly sort through my off-site unit. on Christmas day she ripped me apart and gave me 7 days to find it. My daughter was terribly sick and I have done the best I can but I am not done sorting through storage. When the 7 days lapsed she is dead set that I stole the jewelry and sold it. Dead set that I am lying about simply not being able to locate it. So furious with me that she deleted me off her social media and refuses to speak to me until i admit to stealing it. I have also found out that she has been saying awful things about me behind my back. I dont think we can move past this but I still feel like the asshole for misplacing something that isn't mine.

285,t3_rveepq,AITA for insisting to watch a surveillance tape to clear my name?,"I work in a cinema that frequently has special screenings.
Last week we hosted a charity event with the spokesperson of the charity.
Unbeknownst to me, a collection box was put up for donations.

After every guest left, the charity spokesperson and my manager went into the office and I was left alone to close up.

After 15 minutes or so both of them returned (I was busy closing the hall) and a moment later I heard the spokesperson yelling.
I went back to the counter and asked what was going on and was immediately accused by the spokesperson of stealing money out of the box. 
I was shocked and swore that I didn't touch the box and didn't even know that the box was left alone ""with me"".
I was told that ""a few handful of cash"" were obviously missing and my manager agreed how suspicious it was that I was left alone with the donations and now money was missing.

A back and forth of me swearing that I didn't steal anything and the spokesperson still accusing me of doing exactly that lasted for a minute or so.
I was close to tears at the end and was told by both of them to ""just forget it"" and ""whatever"".
But the way they were looking at me and each other made me feel so horrible, so I offered that they could check my bag and coat.
I was told to ""drop it, it's done now, we will talk later"" by my manager and they were getting ready to leave.

At that point I ""remembered"" that we have a surveillance camera, so I asked that we watch the tape.
I was told that it's late and they wanted to go.
But I was so angry at the whole situation that I pretty much yelled at them that we will have to watch the tape now!
Both of them were really pissed off, but went with me to watch the tape.

And guess what? It showed me behind the counter for a few minutes and dissappering into the hall.
The box was standing there, but I didn't look at it once, didn't touch it, and just walked past it a few times...

There was complete silence for a moment and then the spokesperson just said ""Okay, well then..."" and was getting ready to leave again.
I asked for an apology, but was told, very condescendingly that the topic was already dropped, that I made such a scene at the end for ""no reason"" and made them all stay almost 30 minutes late.
My manager apologized profusely to the spokesperson for the ""inconvenience"" and ushered them out the door.
After that my manager absolutely laid into me for my ""embarassing"" behaviour.
I was told that I could have just it go and we should have watched the surveillance tape on another day and how completely and unnecessarily I escalated the situation...

We left after that, both of us still fuming, and since then the story has made the rounds and half of my collegues are on my side, but the other half thinks that I got way to emotional and my behaviour made the incident into a much bigger thing than it had to be.

My extended family rents out a 12 hour banquet hall for Christmas. We canceled the 2020 gathering entirely for Global Reasons, and 2021's gathering was smaller by about a third because of Continuing Global Reasons and Relatives Who Are Afraid Of Being Magnetized And Therefore Not Invited. Still \~40 adults+kids, so total chaos. We wore masks when not eating, don't yta me for that.

Everyone brings a gift and we do a ""white elephant"" exchange. On your turn, you pick a gift to unwrap or steal a gift from someone else. When your gift is stolen, you can either unwrap another or steal someone else's. Once three ""steals"" happen, that person MUST unwrap a gift and the turn ends. An important note, we did NOT play ""official"" White Elephant rules where items can only be stolen once per turn--just that you can't steal back from the person who took your item. I don't know why that way was chosen, it's just how it was. Important fact to the situation at hand.

My daughter (""Amy"" 14) unwrapped a quilt. The quilt was then stolen from her. She steals her brother's (""Ben"" 8) gift and tells him to go get the quilt. That's the third steal, so the turn ends. Then, when the quilt is stolen from Ben, Amy gives him his gift back and goes to get the quilt. That's again the third steal, so the turn ends.

I don't know how long they had this quilt racket going on, I started paying attention here:

A cousin (20s F) stole the quilt from Ben, Ben stole Amy's gift, and Amy went to get the quilt. The cousin threw up a GIANT shitfit over it being ""against the official white elephant rules"" to steal the quilt back in the same turn. Cue a HUGE debate that ultimately decides we'll follow official rules next year, but the game continues as it has been for this year since it's unfair to change the rules hours into the game. Amy gets the quilt.

Cousin makes a dark pact of her own with another cousin, takes their gift, they take the quilt from Amy, and now there is only 1 ""steal"" left, and Amy can't directly go for the quilt. So bless this child's brain but she goes for the expensive basket of wine that has been THE gift to steal all game long.

The very next turn the wine is stolen from her immediately. She takes Ben's gift, and Ben takes the quilt.

End of the night, Amy comes comes home with the quilt, Ben got a 32-set of stainless cutlery he was hoping??? for??? so they're both happy.

But we're now 2 weeks after, and the family FB group is STILL debating whether or not We As Her Parents should have stepped in and told Amy to let go of the quilt since the point of the White Elephant game is to go home with something random and not to game the system to get a specific gift.

I am NOT planning on making Amy give up her quilt, nor do I feel comfy asking if my kid is an AH, but depending on how the internet feels will determine what tone I take when replying to everyone on FB.

AITA for letting my kid ""ruin the spirit"" of White elephant?

ETA: Absolutely no argument with anyone who calls White Elephant a terrible game, I am in full agreement with all of you haha. But the ""we'd rather not this year"" group always gets outvoted by the ""it's a fun game"" group, and thus, we do white elephant every year.",1207.0
287,t3_rvear1,WIBTA if I paid 3k for the master in the Airbnb,"I know the title sounds ridiculous and tbh honest the whole situation is dumb but I need some external input cause I do not know what to do. So here it goes. 

My little family of four (myself, husband, twin toddlers) are visiting the in-laws (my husband's mother father ect) and we arrived a bit earlier than everyone else because we drove in instead of flying. My husband told me that we'd be staying in a really nice Airbnb and that we'd all be splitting the costs. So I thought sweet, we're first to be here so dibs on the master. My family of four can fit there nicely and whatever. I do ask my husband to text his family (Who I thought would also be splitting the cost if it) if it was cool if we take it. His cousin said sure, she had two littles ones of her own and she had specifically wanted the bed room with bunk beds. So that worked out. Here's the wrinkle though. His sister (my SIL) said that she wanted the Master. She said  we can have it ift pay her 3k. SIL doesn't have any kids it's just her and her husband  While I'm a little salty about moving into a smaller bed room I was just like whatever. She can toss our crap into the other bed room everyone is happy? Right? Wrong. Turns out SIL paid for the entire Airbnb as a gift for the family. I did not know this. My husband had misunderstood the arrangement and relayed the wrong info to me. So I felt really bad. I told her to put our stuff in a different room and that she could take the master but when I said this she insisted we keep it. And then refused to talk about it any further. We ended up taking it but I really want to pay her back cause I feel so bad. I didn't know it was intended to be a gift. I told my husband that I wanted to pay her back but he said that doing that would cheapen the gift. I however feel like the whole situation is soured anyway because she got the short end of the stick due to a misunderstanding. So WIBTA if I paid her the 3K, anyway?",7.0
288,t3_rvea9t,AITA for not paying the babysitter?,"Basically, I was going to a concert with my husband and I needed to hire a babysitter for my 7yo (who is well behaved, generally quiet/reserved, and polite). We have been told by all her teachers and babysitters in the past that took care of her said she was the easiest job ever. Our usual, very trusted 22 yo babysitter had plans, but she recommended this other girl who was 15 and was really great with kids. From now on let's call this girl Anna. 

We offered Anna the same rates (14.50/hr which is really good around here) we gave our usual (7 years older) babysitter and she accepted. We told her we would be gone from 8PM-10PM. This means she would just have to occupy our daughter until her 8:30 bedtime. When we asked her, she told us she had no plans that night. 

It came the day, and my husband and I ate dinner with our daughter, introduced her to Anna, and said goodbye. By 9:30 the concert was over, and we started to head back to our house, expecting to be back a few minutes early. However, there was an accident ahead of us on the way back and we got stuck in a traffic jam. Once it became clear (about 9:45) we wouldn't be back by 10:00, we immediatley called Anna, who picked up. 

We told her that we would be about 10 minutes late because we got stuck in a traffic jam. She got super mad right away and started insisting that she should get another hour's pay ($14.50 extra dollars).   We said that it seemed a bit ridiculous because it was only 10 minutes. She started ranting about expecting us back by 10 and us not warning her in advance. We apologized and asked if our daughter had woken up and bothered her at any point past her bedtime. She reluctantly said no, and we pointed out that she wasn't even watching our kid at this point. She still was fuming and we offered that if she really wanted, we could give her the equivalent for 10 minutes of her hourly wage (about $2.40). She denied, insisting that we give her an additional $14.50. 

We arrived home and the house was empty. No Anna. We rushed to our daughters room, who was thankfully asleep and okay.  We immediately texted Anna and she replied ""I left at 10:00 like you said you wanted me to,"" and then asked us to venmo her the pay. We refused, seeing as she abandoned our daughter. We invited her to our house the next day so we could talk to her and pay her. She denied and we didn't pay her. 

AITA for not paying her? I feel bad about it.

Extra notes:  

She only interacted our daughter for 30 minutes.

The security cameras show while our daughter was asleep Anna finished 1 bag of chips (no biggie), and when she left took a new family sized one from our house with her (Yes, we did offer she could eat whatever she needed, but taking a bag home? Really?) 

She also accidentally broke one of the ornaments on our Christmas tree leaving a few glass shards, and put it back on the tree. She did not tell us about it, and our daughter almost stepped on the shards the next day. 

Edits:
Anna said she was never sitting for us again and then blocked us. We tried to get a hold of yet her again to offer another time to pay her the full pay for 8-10 but she did not reply.

We contacted her parents via text, told them about and what happened, and asked if they could speak to Anna and we could pay her but they said they removed her Venmo account. I offered to pay her in cash but they didn't respond. I don't think the parents are super concerned with their daughter",929.0
289,t3_rve0x1,AITA for asking my dad not to yell while I’m on the phone?,"I (18F) am home for the holidays and I’m living with my Mother (50F) and Father (52M). My father has anger issues and always has. I’m used to it; however, it’s not something I enjoy telling people. It’s been a big issue for me because I never like having guests over or talking on the phone with people anymore unless he’s sleeping or at work because he always yells. 

Earlier today I was talking on the phone with my boyfriend (we couldn’t be together for the holidays so we’ve been calling often) and catching up when I heard my dog bark. 

My dad yells at my dogs very often, he says “it’s the only way they listen”. So naturally when I heard my dog bark I muted myself on the phone because I knew my dad was about to yell (we also have an open concept house so yelling is extra loud and it can be heard from anywhere in the house). He did yell of course. 

I didn’t want to have to keep muting and unmuting myself when I’m trying to talk to my boyfriend, so I texted my dad and said “can you please not yell while I’m on the phone?”

As soon as I texted that he comes into my room and essentially says that I can’t tell him what to do in his own house, that he won’t sugarcoat it, he’ll do what he wants, and to explain to my boyfriend that he yells at my dogs. But the thing is, when my dad yells, he sounds very angry and swears as well. As you can see, it’s not something I want my boyfriend hearing. I tried to tell him that there’s no need to yell and that my dogs listen to me without yelling but he wouldn’t listen. I ended up hanging up the call with my boyfriend because it would be better if I just waited until tonight when my dad is sleeping to call him. 

My mother says that there’s no reason for my dad to yell and I should be able to talk on the phone without fear that my dad will end up yelling at something. 

I thought my dad would understand that nobody likes hearing him yell all the time and I definetly don’t want my boyfriend hearing that because it’s embarrassing. I don’t want to come across as selfish for asking him to stop yelling for a bit but my mother doesn’t like hearing him yell either. AITA for asking my dad to stop yelling?",3.0
290,t3_rvdztr,AITA for not being willing to drive?,"Myself and my boyfriend (both 24M) of 2 years just had a fight and I want to get more views because I don’t think i’m TA but he does and my family and friends are split in their views. 

I can’t drive, I never got my license. It’s not like I have bad eyesight or epilepsy or anything, driving makes me incredibly nervous. I have been in multiple car accidents as a child, I hate when people drive over the speed limit even a little bit and when my friends have gotten me in an empty car park just to try it, I seize up behind the wheel. I am very afraid of killing someone behind the wheel by accident even though the chances are very small. So I don’t drive. 

Yesterday was the last day of our combined Christmas and NY trip but because I don’t drive and he lives 3 hours away, I couldn’t see him on Christmas so we opted for that. 

Today he asked me why I don’t have a license yet (he does) and again I told him my reasons as to why - we have discussed this a few times last year. He told me that I should try again so we can see each other and not rely on trains. I said that trains weren’t really an issue because they are so frequent anyway and it was just because it was Christmas they weren’t running. Also, I can just travel to him earlier next year so we can actually spend Christmas day together. He told me that I’m being unreasonable as he can do it and “it’s easy” and that I can’t avoid driving forever. I told him I wasn’t ready and if I seize up behind the wheel, it’s not like a bike or anything and I could really hurt people or myself which would really put a damper on Christmas. I was trying to lighten the mood and move off topic and now he is not speaking to me at all and said he needs to think about things. 

It isn’t like I ask him to drive me places 24/7. - I have never asked that of him. I understand his view of not wanting to rely on trains but it would cost money for petrol for us to drive to each other if I could drive, so there’s practically no difference.

291,t3_rvdyfx,AITA for not bringing presents for the other kids in this family?,"I am a live-in carer to an elderly couple, ""John"" and ""Mary"". Mary was fairly healthy until her stroke at the end of September. John has some dementia and mobility issues, and has unfortunately been experiencing more issues due to general grief and lack of his wife to care for him. Until Mary's stroke, their 13yo grandson ""Matt"" was also living with them full time. After the stroke, Matt was sent to live with his bio dad and his wife/kids. I was hired right after the stroke so don't know him well but he's come a few times and he's a cute kid who is obviously devastated and grieving the loss of the grandmother he grew up with.

His bio dad invited John/Mary (w/ me) to come to their house for Christmas. John asked me to bring a gift for Matt and gave me a budget and told me what Mary had bought in the past, though he wasn't really in good enough health/verbal enough to take an active role. I had fun picking out a PS5+games+ accessories. I even bought the family flowers and wine on the Mary's insistence.

We get to their house and first of all they only have 1 guest bedroom so I'm sleeping in the same room as my employer and sharing a bathroom with 5 other people but okay fine. I have a lot of downtime and pretty much join them only when John or Mary are feeling up to it. I felt kind of bad for Matt because his grandparents are like rich rich and I know he had like multiple rooms at their house and his bio dad/stepmom are like normal middle class and just have a bunch of other kids.

But things get awkward on Christmas because I bring the presents in from santa ofc and Matt's new stepmom gives me a dirty look right away. I'd wrapped the PS5 and accessories in \~5 presents and of course that was a much $$ present than any of the other gifts. I was actually really happy about making this poor kid happy and sort of having the star gift but stepmom seemed really annoyed.

I suggest we get it set up and stepmom was immediately like great idea kids pick out a game you would like to play and i was like ""umm yes *Matt* here are your choices"" but in the end Matt had to share it with the little kids who were ofc obsessed. The whole week was weird because it felt like the other kids didn't really like Matt all that much and he didn't like them. Stepmom and his bio dad acted like they liked him but idk. I don't know what's like age-appropriate but it seemed like they had a lot of rules/chores for him.

Later the wife pulled me aside and said that she didn't appreciate me saying the present was from Santa because it made the other kids feel bad and I was like okay well I'm here for John, Mary, and Matt, and she was said she knew what was best for Matt and it wasn't ""more shit"" and ""spoiled with a video game in every room"" but then scolded me for not bringing a present for her other kids. The whole interaction was just super awkward.

We left the next day but the whole thing really stuck with me and rubbed me the wrong way. I don't celebrate Christmas though and don't know much about kids (which is why I work with elders lol) so I feel like I don't really know the etiquette.

292,t3_rvdxrr,AITA for not telling my kids to be quiet for our tenants?,"My family and I (30s/40s M/F, 7F, almost 2M) live in a two-storey house and rent out the basement suite. Our tenants are a couple (20s M/F) who have been renting with us for less than 6 months.

We can hear our tenants playing video games from around 9pm-1am frequently. We can also hear them talking or laughing or reading some things out loud in their bathroom, which is right under my son’s room. My son recently has had sleep troubles and has been waking up every couple of hours during the night, and the noise doesn’t help. We have not mentioned the noise issue to our tenants.

On Christmas at 7pm, our tenants sent me a text saying the kids were stomping loudly and asked if they could walk more quietly. This morning at 8:30, they sent another text about the kids being loud and that one of them is trying to sleep! I sent them an email saying they knew about small children when they signed their tenancy agreement. We live in Canada for reference.

I am not telling my children to be quieter, as I think my tenants should have reasonably expected noise from two young children when they signed their rental agreement. AITA?

293,t3_rvdt26,AITA for asking my roommate to pay more of the electricity bill because she showers a lot?,"Throwaway because my roommate uses Reddit. 

So I (24F) live in an apartment with my roommate Kate (23F). 

These years electricity bills have been crazy high, and therefore we’ve been very careful with using too much power. As in turning of the lights and not using too much heat etc.

My roommate is very fortunate money-wise, she has a job and gets money from her parents. While I’m not as fortunate, I get by. However, these crazy electricity bills is really fucking with my economy. She doesn’t really care. I have complained to her multiple times, but she just shrugs and says it’s not that much.

She takes really long hot showers several times a day. Usually two times, sometimes more. It’s something that’s a huge part of her routine. But I’m annoyed because that means we have to pay more. 

So I asked her if she would be willing to pay more, and she got really defensive. She said it’s not fair as she pays more in rent, that she doesn’t use almost any heat, not to mention that the bill isn’t that high and she’s used to it being way higher. I said that she has a lot more money than me and it would be fairer if she paid the whole bill as she has a job and I haven’t. After that she just got really quiet and went to her room.

Well, now it’s awkward between us and I’m wondering if I was an asshole for asking.",14.0
294,t3_rvdpm0,AITA for getting upset that my parents watch my nephew when visiting?,"So background: My sister, her husband and their son as well as my parents all live in Dallas together and I live in NYC, moved out here after college. Unfortunately with COVID and timing I haven’t been home very often in the last year.
My parents see my nephew multiple days a week and babysit him overnight at least once a week so they get lots of time with him regularly. My sister and her husband are free to take care of their child and don’t work nights, my parents just choose to watch him that much. He’s 11 months old now so it takes a lot to take care of him and he needs constant attention.
I’ve visited home three times since he’s been born and every single time my parents decide to babysit him multiple days while I’m visiting. During those times I don’t get to spend much time with them because they’re busy taking care of him. I’m extremely close with my parents so I consider the time I do get to visit as very special and feel disappointed that my time with them is even more limited when they are babysitting my nephew.

anyways, to the thing; my (17f) bf of 5 months (16m) called me yesterday first thing in the morning, full of rage in his barely woken up voice, telling me we were over, then hanged on me. I called him back, asking why, and he started saying he had seen my comments/tweets directed to my idol (idk if this matters, but 22m, a youtuber/streamer that I have been following since 2018, literally saved me from depression).

some of the things I wrote, for context:
instagram comments in his posts - ""I love you sm, I'm really proud of what you've accomplished and who you are today!♥""
""aaaahhh you're amazing and surprise me more every day. proud of you, sending lots of love!&lt;3""
(both comments from almost 3 months ago)
tweets - ""happy new year @idol22m proud of everything you did this year and already excited for what you're going to do next!""
""I appreciate you @idol22m""

the thing is, he found this posts offensive to him. he said he felt like I was inmature, attention-seeking, trying to get validation, and just straight up betraying him by saying what I said. he also said we had already spoken about this before (like a month ago btw, because he got mad I was reposting instagram posts of some fitness influencer I look up to in my stories). I tried to explain that all of comments/posts never had any other intention than to show appreciation to my idol, that I had made them lightheartedly and that the love expressed there was purely platonic, admiration-driven love. he said that either way, I should have though twice before posting things like this as he felt ridiculized and disrespect once he found them. tbh it kinda confuses me because he has one of the highest self steem/ego/whatevers I've ever seen and he doesn't get insecure or jealous by literally anything lol.

I know I shouldn't have done this as I have to know my self worth, but dammit, I love him. I begged for him to rethink things and get back together. He eventually did and we got back together, but he's been saying stuff like ""I don't love you half of what I used to"" ""you repulse me"" ""tbh, right now we are more outside of a relationship than on one"".

early last month i asked in the group chat what our plans were to exchange xmas gifts and was ignored. fine, whatever.

later last month i asked in the group chat about making plans for my birthday that’s later this month. this time i got some answers, but it was mostly all of them arguing between themselves about trying to pick a day. one of them even said she couldn’t celebrate the day of because her anniversary was coming up. her anniversary is four days *after* my birthday. i don’t understand why she needs the four days before it too. and it’s not like i’m asking for much… my birthday is one day a year. we don’t even have to celebrate it the day of! but since i’m perpetually single they told me i don’t understand their lives.

anyway, i finally got so fed up with them going back and forth so much about it that i finally just said, y’know what? never mind, forget i asked. i now plan to celebrate alone. 

there’s been no communication since besides a merry christmas on christmas, but this morning i woke up to a text from one of them asking if they could all come to my house this saturday to exchange our belated xmas gifts. i haven’t responded yet and part of me doesn’t want to respond at all. first off, no one responded when i asked about this a month ago. secondly, they just assume i’m free this saturday even though i feel it’s a little short notice. and thirdly, they seemed able to easily arrange this, but not my birthday? so at this point i’m wondering, do they just want their gifts or something?

299,t3_rvd5f2,AITA for refusing to pay my sister’s bill and giving her information to the restaurant after she ditched me?,"This happened last night.

My sister and her BF recently moved to a town next to mine. I was excited as we’ll be able to see more of each other now. Nearby, there is a downtown center that has a lot of shopping, restaurants, galleries, etc. There is one upscale restaurant that both my husband and I love. A dinner for two will run you about $200-$250 so its not a place we frequently go to. My sister called me last week and invited us out to dinner with them at the restaurant last night. I reminded her it was an upscale place and to take a look at the menu beforehand because they are pricey and we can go somewhere else, tons of other great places. She said they still wanted to go. We hadn’t been there in a while so we accepted. Dinner was great!

At the end of the meal my sister excuses herself to the bathroom and when she doesn’t come back relatively soon her BF goes to find her. After a while, neither of them comes back. We go to check for them and they are gone. I call/text her and she texts back that they’ve left but ‘thanks for dinner, it was just as amazing as you said it would be’. I asked her what she meant but no response. I texted again asking if she really just stuck us with the bill and no response. I then texted that I never agreed to pay for them and that she had 30 minutes to come back to the restaurant or I’ll give the restaurant all her information and they will likely involve the police. No response. At the 30 minute mark I called/texted and got no response. So I stayed true to my word. I paid for mine and my husband's portion and gave all her information to the manager for their portion and then left.

The next day she called me back upset that she’s been getting calls from the restaurant asking her to come pay or they’ll contact the police. I said I’m not surprised since she skipped out on her bill. She said she thought I was paying the tab since I’ve paid for our dinners in the past (I have paid for her+me only dinners where the total tab was $60 max). I said this was obviously different than the other times we met for dinner (this was all four of us AND at an upscale restaurant) and I was not paying the $450 tab and she had to cover her portion. I reminded her that she invited us out and chose the restaurant. I specifically asked if she wanted to go somewhere else but she is the one who insisted on going to this restaurant. I ever agreed to pay for everyone. She then said she thought I’d just pay but when I asked the waiter for separate checks she realized I wasn’t and left for the bathroom planning to ditch. I said that since the restaurant hadn’t contacted the police yet, all she had to do was go in and pay and it would be settled. She didn’t want to do that because it would be too embarrassing and asked me to cover it. I again said no and that she had to take care of it.

Our family has gotten involved and I’m being pressured to just pay the bill. AITA if I don’t and let the restaurant call the police?

Clearly I will not be paying for anything ever again.

I brought this up with my mother recently, and she flew off the handle. She said that, although she regrets giving me my name, it’s disrespectful to her as a parent for me to change a name that they gave me. My sisters agree with her, but their names are normal. 

I know that I have no good reason to change my name. I’m not transgender, and it’s not like my name is Abcde or Ben Dover. But is changing my middle name really so offensive to my parents?",358.0
301,t3_rvd30y,AITA for choosing to listen to my own music?,"I was on a road trip with my sister and two cousins (all 20s F). I have very different music taste from them. 

They wanted to blast the songs they liked and I’m like, no thanks, but of course they don’t want to listen to what I like. So I put on noise canceling headphones to listen to what I want to. Then my sister gets upset that I’m not “participating” and just ignoring everyone for something “petty” like music. They offered to play my choice songs on rotation instead but I really don’t want to listen to music I don’t like. 

What’s the big deal? I get called out for being selfish and stubborn for not wanting to rotate, but I think my solution is way better since nobody really has to compromise. Im not asking for attention, im finehanging in my own corner. I’m autistic so maybe this is just some rule I don’t get?

302,t3_rvd27l,AITA - Our house mate screamed at us for not spending enough time in the house with them…,"My partner and I live with our friend, let’s call them T. We have all been living together for 5 months now, however the issues started 4 weeks in. 
It was the summer, and myself and my partner had been away a lot, coming back and forth from the house and making the most of the time we had being unemployed before starting new jobs. 
I had been away with friends, wild camping and hiking through the evening in pouring rain, I’d frankly had enough, and my partner came to rescue me. We got home about 3 in the morning, and slept through most of the day. 
We awoke to knocking at the door, ignored it, as we were half asleep, only for it to happen again a while later. This time it was more of a bang than a knock, and our housemate was saying our names loudly through the door. 
My partner went to open it, 
‘Where have you been?!’ T says, they’re already annoyed, and we haven’t said a word. 
My partner explained how we’d had a late night, and we’d been sleeping and recovering from it. 
T didn’t seem to like that answer.
‘Is everything okay?’ My partner asked.
And that was it, T was off on one, raising their voice, shouting, complaining how we were never home and didn’t hang out when we were back. He banged his head multiple times against the wall, saying ‘I can’t live in this house anymore’.
‘I’m sorry you feel like this, I think there was a certain expectation of what it was going to be like living together and it hasn’t quite been like that’ 
‘I didn’t have any expectations’ they retort. 
The conversation ended after nothing much more important was said, and with the promise that they’d come and talk if they felt like this again before it built up too much.
As far as we were aware, things were sorted. 
We heard from a friend a couple of weeks later that that wasn’t the case. They’d been going to her, complaining about us to our mutual friend, but spinning the story completely to portray themselves as the victim. 
The ironic thing was, before that point we would always be the ones to invite them to do things with us, go to the beach, go climbing- and they’d reject the offer. After that point we didn’t really want to ask anymore. 

More recently we got a text on the group chat. 
‘Have I done something to upset you both? Seems like you don’t really want to talk/hang out much at all’
This came at a bit of a weird timing, as the night before we’d had our longest interaction in a while, chatting and laughing in the kitchen. 

It feels like we’re getting totally mixed signals, and we’re not sure where we stand with him at all.  Are we the issue?",19.0

305,t3_rvcyuj,WIBTA If I didn't plan an airport pick up ahead of time?,"My SO flew out a few weeks ago for the holidays to spend it with family, (this is welcomed as most holidays are spent with mine, I couldn't go because of work).

On the outbound trip, they spent so much time and energy trying to save money on transport to the airport, they ran out of time, the coach was sold out and then train tickets were too extortionate. I ended up having to do a 10hr round trip (including holiday traffic!). This was despite me prompting and offering to buy the tickets and it left me exhausted and struggling at work the following week. 

Our income is separate but shared; we have our separate accounts to keep track of but money is available for both of us and we have good jobs.

I just realised there may be a chance the return tickets from the airport may not be booked, a quick glance shows the hours are unreasonable and I know my SO may not want to make that journey on public transport. 

However, I'm always the planner in this relationship and my plans are often met with resistance. From a selfish standpoint, I wondered if by not being proactive I was being an AH? I'm also considering just not reminding them and seeing what happens.

Is that too passive aggressive?",24.0
306,t3_rvct0s,AITA for accidentally sending a spoiler?,"A little under a week ago, I sent my friend a post which contained a spoiler for a movie she wanted to see. I didn't know it was a spoiler (there’s no text, just a recreation of a meme). I've spoken to a few of my other friends who have watched the movie, they say it’s barely a spoiler, and just reveals some characters.

Context: Shortly before this, I was diagnosed with a disease (it shouldn't be severe, but basically I was going through a lot). I sent her a text saying how upset I was, and she barely answered.

When she saw the spoiler she responded kind of aggressively. I was very confused, but did research about why it was a spoiler. She then sent me a message saying she hates spoilers but said it wasn't a priority since I was dealing with so much, so I again said it was accidental and moved on.

Context: earlier she texted me saying I messed something up and her heart was broken. It turned out what I ""messed up"" was very minor, so I thought she was just being a little dramatic again.

She then ignored me for a bit before sending a long message about how upset she was with me. I was shocked, since she had said not to worry about it. I was hurt at this point, since she had seemed WAY more concerned about the spoiler than my diagnosis, so I tried to explain where I was coming from and what I was feeling. Then she said some hurtful things (like I don't value our friendship) which was very upsetting because I do a lot for her. I told her that was hurtful and apologized (the apology came late, but she said it wasn't a big deal and I believe saying ""sorry"" is asking permission to stop feeling bad about something. She knows this).

She said we should table this until school starts again (which is two weeks away) and I should focus on healing. I told her it was unfair to use my sickness as an excuse to stop having a conversation when I had never implied I wanted that, especially when she initiated the conversation. She then said she wants to talk in person because we're not getting anywhere. I told her that I felt I had done everything I could to fix this (and reiterated everything I had done) and said it felt like she just wanted to be mad at this point, and to let me know if she could think of anything else I could do, since I've proven I'm trying to fix this. She then messaged me saying I didn't apologize and I was being defensive, and restated that we should wait to talk in person. I said again that I had apologized already and thought that was a bad idea and she hasn't responded yet.

I've spoken to some friends/family about the situation, and they think I'm right, but I recognize they could be biased. At this point, I feel like I'm going crazy, so I thought I'd come here.

Why I may be TA: I sent her a spoiler, and even though it was an accident, that sucks, and I didn't apologize immediately (although I did when I realized how upset she was). She says I'm being defensive but I feel like I've been pretty reasonable.",1.0
307,t3_rvcszd,AITA: His place or his parents?,"My boyfriend is Italian. He’s always told me he has an apartment above his parents in Italy that needs to be finished. 

From this I took it that his parents would continue living downstairs and my boyfriend would have his own place above. 

I just learned that the plan is actually for the parents to move upstairs into the newer apartment and make the downstairs into a garage and one big guest room with the only bathroom being upstairs. (It’s a small apartment)

Once I heard the plan I tried to tell my boyfriend it’s really not like he has his own place in Italy. It’s his family’s home and he’ll have access to a room when he goes rather than the couch as it’s been. Other than that… can someone please explain to me how this is his apartment? 

He tells me it makes no sense for his parents to stay in the old apartment when there’s a newer one upstairs, fair. However, I can’t see it as his place where his parents will stay when his father won’t allow him to build the place exactly as my boyfriend wants it. 

I suggested instead of traditional European bidet he could have a bigger shower which he agreed and his father says no because his mother needs it… in my opinion it stops being his place when he’s building it around his parents wishes and not his own. 

He can call it his family’s place, but not just his. Am I the asshole for thinking this way?",8.0
308,t3_rvcslx,AITA for stealing someone's license plates?,"I live in an area where parking is very sparse and we have to pay for our spots.  One of our neighbors had a party, and their friends took every spot available (my spot, and multiple others).

Now, I know there are no cameras monitoring our parking spaces.  We had a few car break-ins, and discovered this little tidbit when we requested footage from the property manager.  Armed with this knowledge, I went downstairs, removed the licenses plates from the vehicle in my spot, and tossed them in the recycling bin.

I asked politely for her to delete them. She got really mad at me and said “Don’t you dare go there!”

Today, pictures that my other mom ordered when I was out of town last week arrived, including a lot of my senior pictures. There were a few of them that were embarrassing and I hate them.

For context, it’s not a lot of the pictures that are embarrassing to me. Out of the 200+ pictures, there are only about 10-15ish that I hate and want to delete.

I am very torn on if I should suck it up or ask to have them deleted, or delete them myself. I understand that it would be upsetting for my step-mom to have pictures she took be deleted, but just thinking about other people seeing those pictures makes me want to cry.

310,t3_rvcp8r,AITA for calling my younger brother a sexist piece of shit?,"My (16F) younger brother (12M) is constantly making fun of all the women in our family (me, my mom, and my grandma).

When we were visiting my grandparents over winter break, my brother said casually that my grandma has eye bags and a Karen haircut (she’s 80, so she has the typical short hair cut of older women). My grandma has been self-conscious of her appearance ever since and thinks she’s ugly, so she wore more makeup than usual around us.

On the drive home from my grandparents, my mom told my brother that he made my grandma feel self-conscious, and he said he’s just being honest, and we’re all “sensitive, screaming Karens” who can’t handle honesty. Then he said my mom is a Karen (she doesn’t know what that means because she doesn’t follow any part of internet culture) and he started filming her, accusing her of “racism and discrimination” toward him while we argued with him.

He’s literally just quoting his favorite YouTubers and speaking nonsense. He constantly watches this guy on YouTube who goes around accusing random people of “racism and discrimination” and sexually harassing women so he can film them “being Karens” in response. My brother loves his videos and constantly accuses my mom and I of “racism and discrimination” and “being Karens.” He wants to become a YouTube star.

So my brother was filming my mom as she was getting upset with him for saying my grandma has eye bags and Karen hair and him calling it honesty, and my brother was narrating the video and was copying his favorite YouTubers saying “hysterical Karen losing her mind” and “Karen women in their natural habitat.” My mom has no idea what a Karen is, and I said “Don’t worry about it mom. He’s just being a typical sexist piece of shit like all the YouTubers who make these videos he watches.”

My mom doesn’t understand the insults my brother is using, so she was upset that I called him a piece of shit since she’s never heard me cuss.

Edit: Since I keep getting the same comments over and over, my brother only acts this way toward my mom and I. He wants attention and emulates YouTubers like most boys his age I know. Most boys I know his age are in the “every woman is a Karen and everyone is racist” phase. For those misunderstanding, my brother doesn’t act this way toward anyone except my mom and I. His teachers and coaches say he’s very sweet and gets along well with other kids, and he does very well in school. He isn’t socially maladjusted and doesn’t record and harass random people like some commenters are saying. He isn’t manipulative. He’s attention-seeking toward my mom and I. He isn’t violent or radicalized or a future incel/abuser. You guys haven’t met him and are jumping to dramatic conclusions.

Edit: My brother doesn’t have a phone. He has an iPad. And everyone who wants to argue with me about my life and my brother’s life as if you random Reddit interlopers and wannable psychiatrists know more than me about my family can fuck right off :)",2544.0
311,t3_rvcoj8,AITA for giving my son a more expensive gift?,"A little bit of backstory: My nephew currently lives with us. This is because his parents (my sister and BIL) live in a rural area with not very good schools so he moved into our house in the suburbs (good school district) in 7th grade. My nephew (14) is now in 9th grade and my son (18) is in 12th grade. 

So for Christmas, both of them got new laptops. My nephew got a HP laptop that cost about $650. He is into coding and wants to become a software engineer in the future so I thought this laptop would be best for coding and computer science stuff. 

My son got a MacBook Pro that was like $1200 (So double the amount). He is about to go to college soon, planning on doing Pre-med, so I believe this laptop would be good for taking notes and stuff. My son is not going to be coding or doing software stuff on this laptop. 

When my sister visited for Christmas, she saw that both boys had new laptops. After noticing that my son had an apple laptop while her son had an HP one, she proceeded to call me cheap. She said that I preferred my son over my nephew and that since both boys are living under my roof, they should get the same presents. So, AITA?",145.0

I've (28f) been thinking about this and have reached out to reddit before about this situation. I decided after some thinking to invite my father to my wedding. We have really become estranged but I ultimately decided to extend the invite verbally to him for my wedding. In short, he likes to turn blame around, never apologises, comments on my weight...not a great guy to be honest but I invited him to be the better person and to not upset my grandmother. 

When I told him about our wedding plans over video chat, he was more interested in the coffee he was making and just said ""Well should I put it on my calendar then?"" I told him yes and left it at that...

Here's where I wanted to take it back. My grandmother (father's mom) came over from England to visit and it was so wonderful to see her. My dad didn't really give my brother or I much of a heads up....he texted me with minimal information about her coming to visit and he only emailed my brother the flight details. This is pretty consistent for him. I actually made sure to tell him about the wedding when I found out about her coming so I could freely discuss the wedding with my nan. Anyway, we wanted to get him in a quick meeting to get plans ironed out (ie when we can have her over etc) and he just dismissed it and said we would play it by ear. My brother went to go see her at the airport and a woman was with my dad...apparently it was his girlfriend which we didn't know about...

What drives me nuts is that my brother and I keep trying to have adult conversations with him and he keeps letting us get blindsided by information that could have been shared before hand. We ended up going over to his house a lot to see our nan but it was very awkward...I wish he would just treat us like adults. After this whole trip, I'm seriously considering uninviting him as it's clear he doesn't give a rats arse about our feelings....wibta if I took it back?",17.0
313,t3_rvcn3q,AITA for firing my brother's girlfriend over phone,"Throwaway

I (35F) am the owner of a coffee shop. Linda (23F) is one of my employees who joined six months ago. Four months ago, she met my older brother (37M) and they started dating. Ever since they started dating, Linda has been acting like she owns the place. She never comes on time, and treats my other employees rudely. Every time I scold Linda, I end up receiving a call from my brother telling me not to pester his girlfriend. Recently, I've had enough. She's been shirking her responsibilites lately. Even after the holiday period ended, she chose not to show up. I called her up today, and she told me that she didn't feel like coming in. I told her that I've had enough, and that I was finally going to fire her. I told her we only needed diligent employees here, and that she was clearly not one of them. Hours later, my brother stormed into my house, cursing and yelling at me for firing his girlfriend. My husband kicked him out of the house, and I was honestly so annoyed.

My parents think I'm the AH for firing my brother's girlfriend and for kicking my brother out of our house. AITA?

Update: I received a call from my brother, who is very pissed as Linda has dumped him. He says that had I not fired Linda, he wouldn't have gotten dumped. To a certain degree, that may be true. However, if I hadn't fired Linda, that would have only been disadvantageous for my coffee shop business. I think this makes things very clear now. LOL",9504.0

My fiance(27M) works for the state government as an auditor. My fiance and I are currently living in a small townhome. My fiance loves to cook and will buy most of the groceries. I help out with bills, rent, and cleaning the townhome. My fiance grew up not knowing how to do common household cleaning. His mother did all of the cleaning and household chores. I taught my fiance how to use a mop and washer and dryer. He does help sometimes with the laundry and cleaning. There are times when I had jobs late in the evening and would come home to dishes in the sink and a small mess in the kitchen. I have asked my fiance if he would be willing to clean up after himself and he says honey, you do such a great job at keeping the home clean. I don't want to mess up anything. 


My fiance had a few friends over to play some video games and I was in the kitchen cleaning. One of his friends comes out of the bathroom yelling that the toilet was overflowing and water was flowing over the bowl. My fiance quickly gets up and grabs the plunger, but causing more water to flow out. I run into the basement and turn the water off. I grab some towels and start cleaning the mess up as my fiance goes back to finish the movie. One of his friends stays behind to help with the cleaning when I hear my fiance call to him saying hey, come finish the game. She does not need any help. His friend gives me a look and goes back to playing the game.  


The food is delivered and everyone comes into the kitchen to grab a slice. The same friend asks my fiance if he ever helps with any of the cleaning around the house. He shakes his head and says no, OP enjoys doing it and I do the cooking and grocery shopping. It keeps everyone happy. I grab my food and say yes, I definitely enjoy cleaning a two floor townhouse all by myself. It's unfortunate that my fiance does not know how to clean up after himself. His friends start laughing and I could see my fiance's face turning bright red. When his friends left, my fiance starts yelling at me that I completely embarrassed him in front of his friends and being an unappreciative partner.

His mother heard what happened from him and she did let me know that it was a women's responsibility to do the cleaning and grocery shopping. She even suggested that I quit both of my jobs and stay at home.

I had been buying all sorts of things for her (jewerly,.... gifts in general) everytime I was coming from work.

317,t3_rvchrp,AITA for celebrating my birthday on the day a family member passed?,"So I (M22) was thrown a little get together on my birthday by my brother (M25). I wasnt planning on doing anything for my birthday because my cousin had actually passed a way a year ago and they did her funeral on my birthday. I wasn't very close to her or my family really. I did feel like it would be disrespectful to celebrate my birthday when my family was mourning the first anniversary of her death. My brother is my half brother from my dad side of my family. He has no relationship to them and he didn't know. Well he did know last year but forgot about it because once more again it wasn't his family.

Seeing as he took the time to plan something with me and couple of our friends I was actually excited and happy. We went to bars and threw axes. We then hung out at home and played some video games.

I live two states over from the my immediate family and a in a different country from the family member that my cousin passed from. My brother took pictures and posted on his Facebook and tagged me in them. I liked the post and commented how I had a great time. I then got several messages from my family saying how I was being rude and disrespectful for going out and having fun on the day my cousin funeral. I told them I didn't plan this that my half brother did. They then said I should of not gone out and had fun that I was selfish. That I was even more selfish for sharing how awesome my day went when I knew that my cousin had died a year ago. 

I told them my brother planned the day because it was still MY birthday. It will always be my birthday on this day. My late cousins daughter said that I shouldn't be celebrating my birthday on my actual birthday anymore and that i had all the others day to choose from. My mom later texted me asking what happened I explained to her. She said that I should of just waited a couple of days to celebrate my birthday this year as it was the first year anniversary. I told her my brother had thrown the surprise and booked the axe room for 6 people that it was a large chunk of money for him to cancel the day off. I also explained to her that yes I do feel bad but I was never close to them. I was gonna be all alone anyways because they live in another country. That my cousin died 2 weeks prior to my actual birthday but still decided to do the funeral on my birthday. That my aunt asked me for money last year for the funeral which I did give her some, but she didn't wish me a happy birthday not even after or before no one did. I was okay with that. I was okay with everyone forgetting my birthday because I understood it was funeral. But two days later on my uncle birthday everyone wished him a happy birthday and even threw a family party. 

She said I'm being childish and to ask my brother to take down the post. But I told her no, that was my brother profile. 

Aita the for celebrating my birthday and not asking my brother to take down a post?

*Edit* some of you guys are asking why are they more focused on the funeral than the actual day she died. Its because it's not made clear when she actually died. They live in mexico in one of smaller cities (pueblos) with very limited access to hospitals and doctors. She had covid. In mexico they dont allow any visitors and once you're in the hospital there is no leaving until you test negative multiple times. My family wasn't made aware that she passed till days later and they claim she passed sometime in the middle of night. So the funeral is a day that they actually all can agree on to mourn.",9.0
318,t3_rvcga4,WIBTA if I ended a 4-year friendship over a hurtful joke?,"I (24F) am currently working on an MA degree. There are two classmates in  this story, let’s call them Meghan (23F) and Rose (24F). We met in 2017. I am not fat by any means, but I lost a lot of muscle and have a bit of a muffin top. I am quite self-conscious about how it looks, so while I’m working to get back in shape, I dress in ways that hide it as much as possible. They know this.

One Monday, we had a panel discussion in a class. Me and Rose were panelists – we prepared a short speech and had to do more research. The rest of the class was an audience. Part of the prep was making up a character – name, job etc. My character’s name wasn’t English, but let’s say it was Taffy. Meghan put a lot of work into acting as the classic everything-denier, had basically no arguments, just attacked everyone and doubted everything.

Then we had a break, everyone dropped their roles, talking, the teacher left the room. Meghan speaks up: “Did anyone notice that if you just switch the consonants in Taffy, it says Fatty?” If she said it during the debate, it’d be fine, but the debate was clearly over, nobody was acting anymore. Rose, sitting right next to me, apparently texted Meghan something, because after the class, Meghan walked up to me and apologized. I was too anxious to react.

After school, she texted me a second apology. 2 hours later, she texted “idk if I already told you this, but my aunt has lymphoma”, and then a third apology immediately after. It felt like what she meant was “I already apologized, why won’t you taaalk to meee”. I still hadn’t processed what  happened, so I didn’t respond – but Rose laid over the information why I was upset and that I needed space.

The next Monday she texts again. Starts with saying she had a dream that I finally replied and apologizes again. I keep ignoring her, because I feel like she’s being pushy after that morning text, and I don’t want to regret something I might say.

That evening I get screenshots of her texts with Rose. Meghan apologizes to me, but to Rose she says “it’s not such a big deal” and “if she minds it  that much, she should probably seek help”.

Meghan had an eating disorder in her teens. Both she and Rose know I go to both a psychiatrist and a therapist for depression and anxiety. Rose tells Meghan I don’t have to respond to her just so that her conscience feels better.

I’m slowly realizing that I don’t like many things about Meghan, for example: She focuses a lot on what *she* needs, overshares and overthinks a lot via text. She’s misogynistic. She also publicly puts down and devalues our field, acting like it’s “lesser” because it isn’t law or medicine. A friend of mine calls people like her “energy vampires”. I now haven’t talked to her for a few weeks and I generally feel better and don’t miss her at all.

WIBTA if I ended the 4-year friendship over a joke? I might feel better, but it was just a badly timed joke and our field of work is rather small, so I’m worried about it impacting my career.",40.0
319,t3_rvca6o,AITA for expecting my fiance to take care of my dog while I work?,"My fiance is on sick leave since we met (depression, ptsd and some other stuff). He mostly plays videogames but recently wanted to get a dog. I thought it could be fun and bring us closer to have something to do together. And he thought it would make him feel better...

He really wanted a puppy and eventually I agreed and bought the dog. Since he is in  debt the government would take the dog if he owned him so I am legally the owner...

Turned out he lost interest in the puppy really soon and I have a hard time doing it all alone since I work a full time job. The puppy is a handful but I ""fell in love"" with him and he is well taken care of.

Only my fiance sometimes sleep all day and don't go out with the dog or never do anything with him at all, so he has A LOT of energy when I Come home from work. Since my fiance is the one Who wanted the dog in the first place and he has nothing else to do (sick leave) I think he could be taking care of the dog during the time I work at least. But he says since he is on sick leave I can not expect that from him and that it is my problem.

321,t3_rvc83f,AITA for refusing to get a new job?,"

I (21 Female) and My Boyfriend of 2 years (23 male) have been looking to move out. I started saving a year or more before he did for an apartment but it has been harder for me to save as I am a full-time student and work 1-2 days a week. 

My Boyfriend on the other hand brings home over 1,000$ a week as he is in the trades and has currently saved less then me. (Again I’m in school full time, and we have roughly the same amount of bills because we both live at home). We both evenly split things and he is never expected to pay and neither am I.

Less then a month ago when going to look at an apartment we were rear ended in my car a 2015 Mazda 3 sport. We were turning left on a one way and a truck wasn’t paying attention and hit us on the left rear drivers side causing the car to fly over the curb and off the road. My car is a complete write off since my airbag deployed and I have been struggling with neck, back, hip, and knee pain as well as side affects from a concussion. Another thing I have been struggling with is driving, I am scared of getting hit again and have been struggling with depression as the incident put severe stress on me as It happened during my final exam week. My boyfriend on the other hand was fortunate not to have been injured as he is bigger and I took most of the impact. I have been going to Physio and the Chiropractor 2 days a week and took a week off my part-time job. I have still not been paid out for my car and it has been hard finding something similar that I like. 

My Boyfriend and I talked about moving out and decided to wait until late February as he is finishing up his 10 week block of trade school. (His schooling is paid for and he has been collecting EI as well during this period so there is little loss of income). 

Today he started talking to me about how he’s worried I’m only working one day and how I should look into getting another job. The one day I work is a 10 hour shift at 15.50$ an hour which is more then what I would be paid elsewhere and I can’t work much as I am a full-time student. I have the funds saved up to comfortably pay for half of the rent and bills until I’m done school in April. (I am in my last semester). I tried explaining to him that it doesn’t make sense to get another job for 2 - 3 months before hopefully Going into my forever career end of April. Also I believe it would be disrespectful to work at a company for that time period. I argued I don’t have an actual vehicle yet and am still dealing with the trauma of the accident so driving an extra 30 minutes for a job that pays less doesn’t make any sense. He kept pressing and i told him he is being ignorant and not understanding the situation. I have already applied for a full time job in my field and if I do not get that job I’m waiting to apply to more come closer to my graduation. I feel bad for calling him ignorant but I have 2,700$ saved for our place plus I have most the furniture already as I had my an place before Covid hit and I moved back home. Stuff like bed, bed frame, tv, dresser, night side tables, selves, couch, etc. He has saved just under 1,500$ and isn’t bringing anything besides his desk, pc, and clothes.

I spend 2-3 days a week with her and we always go shopping/play cards/etc. though, I am aware, too, that she is very negative. She is often upset with others or critiquing others. I often interject and correct her softly. However, I’m hanging by a rope lately. 

Every time I’m in the room with her or visit, she argues with me. She’s been less empathetic towards my work schedule. This had led to a landslide in problems. Today, however, was the final straw. I work in maintenance and tried discussing some technical issues with her. (She wanted to put an excessively hot heating device on the carpet, which isn’t meant to be on carpet and I offered other solutions to where she should put it.) we fought about that. She told me I was too thin and keeps forcing food in front me. I said I wasn’t hungry and she got upset with me. (Added note: we already together today. She watched me eat. However, I know her memory is going. So, I reminded her and said I wasn’t hungry. She started throwing things around the kitchen and saying she wouldn’t offer anything ever again.) Later, my mom had mentioned to my grandmother that she should get a hearing aid. She had the TV blasting and she hasn’t been hearing us well when we talk, so we often have to say it a third, fourth, or fifth time. 

My grandmother started to protest. I decided to advocate for her getting help. This would just be a lot more helpful, and I said I’d she was worried about cost, I would be able to pay out of pocket for her. She told me I was an idiot kid with no concept of the real world. This hurt me. I’m AWARE of the cost of medical needs. I’m AWARE there are better insurance plans she can be on. I oversee benefit plans at work constantly and have meetings on this, even though my department is maintenance. 

After so many insults today and just arguing, I stood up and told her, “I love you, but I do not want to fight with you. That’s all we’ve done today. I’m going to go home. We can spend time together later this week.”

I left. 

Mind you, I am her ONLY grandkid that spends time with her and I never ask her for things, like the others do. Yet, my spoiled cousin who never sees her thinks I’m an absolute asshole for leaving today. 
Spending time with my grandmother is never a chore but sometimes I feel so anxious in these situations.

He can go anywhere in the US for 3-6 months, all living expenses taken care of. Between contracts, he needs a place to crash. Usually he stays with me for 3 weeks or so. He’s my best friend and I’m happy to see him and help him out. This visit started in November and I expected it to last for that month but now we’re in January and he’s still here.

He made a comment about holding out for a contract in a specific location where he likes a girl. I don’t know if that means he turned down other offers or just didn’t consider them. But that was kinda frustrating to hear.

I’m very sensitive about making someone upset or feeling bad, but after 2 months a lot of little things are starting to get to me, which means if I didn’t say something, there’d be an issue with resentment setting in. I don’t want that to happen. I honestly did not know how to approach it so I took the position of being concerned about him not knowing anyone here but me, not having anything to do, etc.

I can tell he’s lonely. So on one hand, suggesting he should go somewhere else feels shitty, but at least he has more connections there than just me. On the other hand, I feel like I’ve been more than generous. After getting advice from a couple friends, I felt it was the right thing to do, but then one of those friends made me feel bad because I was turning him out while he’s already feeling lonely. So now I feel like shit. His replies were understanding enough but I have no idea what’s going through his head, of course… if I’ve upset him or hurt his feelings. Ugh. I hate this.

In the beginning we used to spend a lot of time together, cooking, playing cards, going to places like the beach, the gym, hiking and so on. I work full time and while I was working he used to help around the house, building, painting and so on. 

He has always loved videogames and during our time together he just starts playing more and more... I am happy he has something he can enjoy, especially when I am working. But it goes to the point where he doesn't eat or sleep for days, he even had a seizure once and I had to call the ambulance.

We have talked about this a lot.. He sometimes admits that he has an addiction, sometimes he just gets defensive and say I am controlling. He promises to change but I don't think he really wants to...

I don't mind him playing when I am working, but I don't want him to play at night because he yells a lot and I am a light sleeper... And when I am home I want to do stuff together, maybe not everyday but a couple days a week, at least.

He says that he is on sick leave for a reason and that I can't expect anything more. He thinks I'm not being supportive (although I do a lot for him, paying the bills, drive him to places, love letters, a LOT of patience, moving to a different apartment and so on).

Yesterday my grandma was sick (she has a heart condition) and was rushed to the hospital. She is fine now, but I didn't know that then and was really worried. He would not leave his games and played all night, keeping me awake. I got mad and of course he got mad back and says that I am not there for him when he needs me.

327,t3_rvbl6w,AITA for screaming at my boyfriend when he broke something dear to me?,"Made an account for this cause I don't want to mix it with my main account.

Me (M23) and my boyfriend (M22) have been dating since six years ago (eight for him but whatever). 

Last year he decided to come out of the closet and moved in with me. So far I lived alone in an apartment and he lived with his mother. I was really excited about the idea and the first weeks were pretty good, but as the days passed I realized something I already knew but didn't thought about it before due to the hype I guess: he's dumb.

He has never been the smartest guy out there ever since I can remember, and we know each other since elementary school. He isn't lazy, he just can't follow instructions and has butter for hands. I never payed it much attention cause it never affected me.

Except it started affecting me when he moved in and we split chores. When he tries to wash dishes he either breaks one or they aren't cleaned enough. When he cleans the floor, there are always dirty spots. When an appliance breaks, he always tries to fix it and fails. And there are more specific examples like these. 

I decided to ignore it cause it's not his fault and he pays for everything he breaks + his part of the rent, but yesterday I just didn't had the patience. He accidentally broke a vase my best friend's mum (someone I adore as if she's my real mother) gifted to me when I moved here. I was already angry about this, but what made it worse was his classic ""Don't worry, I can fix it!"". He can't fix anything, he always says that whenever he messes up something and the one who has to actually fix stuff is me.

When he said that, I got mad and ended up yelling at him that he wasn't going to fix shit because he was too stupid to do it, and that he has always been this way ever since we were kids. He just stopped talking, then he told me he was sorry again and left. I know I should have stopped him but I was shocked by what I did at the moment.

Later I called him but he wouldn't answer me, so I called his mother and she confirmed that he had come crying to her house. I thought she would understand if I explained the situation to her as we've always gotten along, but she just told me that maybe it was too soon for him to move in with me and hung up on me. 

It's as if she and my boyfriend want to make me look like the bad guy when all this year I've been nothing but understanding. AITA for just not standing up for my boyfriend's messes anymore?

Edit: He just called me and told me he wants to talk with me tomorrow, and that he didn't knew I felt this way and apologizes for giving me more work even though he was trying to do the opposite.

I wanted to talk to him now but I followed someone's advice here and decided to give him time until tomorrow so he can rest.

So last night my sister and I got into an argument about having people over.

329,t3_rvbfet,AITA for leaving my nephew with my partners?,"Throwaway because my brother is definitely on reddit and i think he follows my real account

I am a man in a serious polyamorous relationship with two partners who live with me, I've been in a relationship with one ill call Sarah for 5 years, and another ill call Mia for 3 years. i have two brother but only one is important to this story who ill call Frank. Frank was pretty against me being in this relationship when Mia entered it, he called it weird and exploitative and immoral. he would make little jokes and quips about it to me until one day i got sick of it and sat him down and basically laid down the law about it. told him that Sarah and Mia are the loves of my life and we work so well together and I'm truly happy being with them and if he cant respect that and accept me AND my partners, I wouldn't be speaking to him anymore as his disrespect is actively hurting me and my family.

Frank was resistant at first in the conversation but as we went on he softened up and told me he was just worried about me, but he would do his best to accept me and change his behavior

Frank asks me to babysit my nephew Gumby (who is 4) every once in a while and I'm more than happy to because i love Gumby and so do my partners. Frank dropped off Gumby the other day and we were playing mario party with Sarah while Mia was upstairs doing some work. We finished the game and i had to go do some grocery shopping so i asked gumby if he wanted to come with me and he said ""No i wanna stay here with aunt Sarah!"" i asked Sarah if she was okay watching him on her own and she said ""yeah sure"". i had never left Gumby with just my partners before but i didn't really think anything of it so i popped upstairs, told Mia what's going on and went to get the groceries. came home and we played some more mario party until Frank came to get him. then a few hours later i get an angry phone call from Frank asking me why i abandoned my nephew with my ""fuck buddies"". i was pretty shocked and asked him what he meant, he said that he was asking Gumby what he did at my house over dinner and Gumby told him that i left to go get groceries and left him with Sarah. i said ""yeah. i did that. so what?"" and Frank went off on me about how he left Gumby to be babysat by ME. not anyone else. especially by ""some strange women i hang around with"" and i got really angry at that and started yelling at him, he was yelling at me. until he ended the call with ""you're never seeing Gumby again. you're lucky i dont call the fucking cops on you for leaving my son in a dangerous situation like this"" and he hung up.

so i don't know. i figured i would ask here. should i have been more careful? am i the asshole for this?

TL;DR: i left my nephew with my partners for an hour or so to go get groceries and my brother blew up at me for it because he doesn't accept my relationship as much as i thought he did

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  the rough timeline of Franks jokes/rudeness is that Sarah and i got together. we dated exclusively for about 3 months and she expressed interest in polyamory and i was open to it. so we started bringing other people into the relationship casually. then Sarah reconnected to her old classmate and crush Mia. Mia was casually invited into the relationship and things were so good we kept wanting to see her until we all had a talk and became an official couple and moved in together soon after. i started bringing both Sarah and Mia to family parties and get togethers and that's when Frank started ramping up the hostility and jokes. before that it was just playful jokes here and there that i didn't care about. but this was openly hostile. so after the second family party it happened at was when we had that talk and Frank seemed to genuinely apologize to me, Sarah, and Mia and made an effort to accept me and get to know them at least casually. so we thought he had changed and accepted us or at least began to make an effort to almost three years ago. maybe 2 and a half at the very least.

I (22F) have been employed with this company for 2 years. I’ve never taken time off and I have always been on time for my shifts. I make approximately $17/Hr and my commute to work is about 60KM one way. 

With these colder weather conditions (-36C) my vehicle wouldn’t start regardless of what I did. I phoned in to work and updated them on my situation and let them know I may be an hour or two late. They immediately told me an hour was the latest I could be late and any time after that was not acceptable and I’d face serious consequences. They demanded that I call AMA and have them get my car going. I did as told but it was a 48 hour wait due to the amount of cars being stalled. I updated work on my situation via phone call again and they begin raising their voice and trying to get me to take a taxi or transit. I live outside the city in a small town where transit isn’t a thing. I debated on Uber but it was going to be approximately $90 there and back. I was only going to work a 6 hour shift which would have only given me $100 overall.

They still insisted I pay full price for the Uber ride there as showing up for the job was more important than my cheque. I got irritated and told them they’re ridiculous if they think I’ll willingly lose money just to get to work. I didn’t show up for the shift.

331,t3_rvb3l0,AITA For Telling My Father That I Hated Him And That I Wish He Was Never Here,"On New Year's Eve I woke up to find that my dog of 11 years, Puffles, had sadly passed away next to me. I end up staying with him a bit and then head over to tell my grandma who soon after runs to tell my father the bad news. When he comes down from upstairs he walks in the room, uncaring and easy-going as ever while I'm literally holding the corpse of my best friend saying ""whew! He passed pretty well!"" I get what he was going for, my little buddy Puffles  *did* pass in the best place, in his warm blanket huddled with me in our bed right in his sleep, but I really think the comment was out of turn for the situation.

After a while they head into the living room and I decide to stay and pet Puffles to comfort myself some more before going out to join them. He says that we aren't able to bury him, or at least he isn't able to. In hindsight I get what he meant, the ground was frozen over and icy, but I naively say that I'll dig the grave myself. Which I would, I was really going to go out there and dig as hard as I could to bury him. Before he can respond to me my grandmother asks why he can't bury my dog now and he lashes out, as he usually does, to my grandma and anyone else he thinks isn't allowed to speak without his explicit permission. I got so angry and I yelled at him that I didn't want him to touch Puffles, and that I'll bury him. He starts yelling more.

I end up screaming that I hate him, and he snaps, getting all in my face pointing at me and calling me names all while my grandma is holding me trying to calm me down before it turned worse as my father usually escalates the situation.  I tell him that I ""wish he was never here"" there are a lot of things I meant by the comment but, mostly I meant if it was just me and my grandma I wouldn't have had the awful childhood with his scary outbursts, over-protective nature, and constant conflict instigation. He runs upstairs after telling me to ""Not go there"" and after a few minutes my grandma calms me down and takes me into the bathroom to sit and take a breather.

My father comes back down acting like nothing ever happened, like there was no fight, asking me to look for a cremation center and he will pay for Puffles' cremation. I end up finding a nice place I had settled on and we went, my grandma pointing out that my father put Puffles in the backseat of the car so I could sit with him and mourn, when he usually would have put animals in the trunk. Don't get me wrong I was grateful, but not any less angry.

He ends up finding a dollar in the bushes outside of the crematorium and looks me dead in the eye and says ""Thank you, Puffles!"" while gleefully pocketing the dollar. That was really my last straw, I felt he deserved what I said for everything all the way up until last night. That night he sent me a text saying how sorry he was about my best friend and that it will get better, and when he saw me patting my head affectionately. Now I feel extremely guilty.

Some examples of why she  stopped speaking to me: I told her to clean her mess she made in my kitchen, because I had to cancel plans with her kids due to health issues, I cancelled a trip with our grandson because Disneyland closed due to Covid. The list goes on and on. 
Now she isn’t speaking to me because she cut me out of her life over something petty and still expected me to babysit. I haven’t heard from her since late June.
We had a makeup trip planned with our grandson and M refused to let him go out of spite. If I dare cancel for any reason (like Disneyland being closed) I’m a promise breaker and can’t be trusted. 
We didn’t see our grandkids for the holidays even though they live two miles away. We haven’t met our grandson that was born six months ago. 
To top off the silence M will invite her sister D over and proceed to get her riled up and “hate mom”. D is on the spectrum and easily manipulated. This results in D coming home and screaming at me and her dad. This last time she dug her nails into my arm. All this because M needs drama. 
I have tried so many things over the years; talking, therapy, mom/daughter time. Other family members have tried talking to M but she is not budging. 
We have 4 daughters and M has tried to get the other two to agree with her and join the “hate mom”
Bandwagon. It doesn’t work. She even tried to get her dad to side with her and when he refused she called him spineless. 
M is only happy when I am buying  her things, doing her favors, watching the kids or cooking for her and her family. Her expectations of me are far beyond what anyone could live up to. 
M is 39 years old and I’m exhausted. She refuses to go to therapy, refuses to deal with her addict husband and blames me for everything she can think of. 
I am her mother but I’m also a human being, something M refuses to acknowledge. So I’m letting her live her life without me. I miss my grandchildren but I can’t take the unrealistic expectations and toxicity anymore.

My bf has dozens of hobbies and likes to spend his time and money on those. When it comes to expensive items, I'm the one who pays it all upfront and he'll pay me back generally two months later.

I told him, as long as you utilize your current ones and that you actually put in the effort to improve, then it's something I'll think about. He's been golfing almost every other week and practicing, watching videos, getting lessons, etc, so it's nice to see him so committed to something he loves. His scores have been getting better and I'm really proud about that. He's basically told all of his friends that the new golf set is what's encouraging him to do so well.

The issue I have is that, he limited me to $40 to pick whatever I wanted from Amazon because he had a gift card already loaded into our account (that his brother gave him for Xmas actually). The other issue that I'm starting to have is that, when I go grocery shopping for the week, he wouldn't contribute financially because I work from home and he doesn't, but he still somewhat eats the food I buy and make for dinner. I hate to start nitpicking about money but I'm afraid he's gotten too comfortable with relying on me financially just because I'm spending my money carefully. I feel like I'm investing for us and the relationship, whereas he's investing in himself sometimes.

He's said several times that he'll support me if/when I discover hobbies I want to get into (he's always encouraging me to get into the hobbies he's already into so that he can properly teach me and we can do more things together), but I feel like I have to be the one who has to be financially responsible and spending money on hobbies, especially on myself without knowing if I'll be good or not, would be a waste of money. My bf, on the other hand, is extremely good at everything he does, so all of the hobbies he gets into, he's honestly excellent at them.

I do plan on getting him the new golf clubs because I'm genuinely proud of him for bettering himself, but AITA for expecting him to show more monetary appreciation towards me as well?",72.0
336,t3_rvapji,WIBTA if I made a list of presents I want to get for my birthday?,"I (21F) am dating this guy, let's call him Pete (21M) for 2,5 years. We are having a long distance relationship since the beginning. We said that it's not necessary we buy a lot of presents, we should skip Valentine's Day and monthly anniversaries, and that we should get each other gifts on birthday's and maaaaaybeeeee Christmas, since we're both not the type to buy gifts all the time. 

Since we are on a long distance relationship, it's hard to give each other gifts on their birthday. Last year I bought his gift and sent it to him, so it arrived on his exact birthday. But last year he didn't give me any gift for my birthday. He also mentioned that it's hard to buy me a gift because he doesn't know what I would like. The year before that he also didn't give me any presents for my birthday, while I did buy him a gift and sent it to him, although it arrived some days after his birthday. 

I'm not asking for something big or expensive, it's the gesture that matters. But since he has mentioned that he has trouble buying me a gift, I'm thinking of making a list of things that I want and send it to him. 

Here's the AH part. I really don't like telling others what to do. And since I'm not throwing a party and we're not ""together"" together, he's not obligated to give me anything. But he's my boyfriend and I would like to have something from him. We haven't discussed my birthday yet, this year we might be ""together"" together, unlike last year and the year before that, and I want to send this list beforehand so he has time to look into it.. 

So WIBTA for making a list and send it to him even though he didn't ask, thus making me look like a gold digger or a beggar?",10.0
337,t3_rvapaa,AITA for calling my brothers fiancée an ungrateful bitch?,"My parents (65&amp;53) paid off everyone’s (my siblings and their partners) student loan debt as a Christmas gift this year.  I am very aware of how privileged I am to have parents that were able to do this for me.

My parents were able to help their three children (M30, M27, F27) through college so we collectively had little student loan debt compared to most.  I think between the three of us they paid around 80k (and two of us have higher level degrees).   My boyfriend is going through paramedic/rookie school and they’re paying for the half the city he works in isn’t paying.  He’s incredibly grateful and actually cried when he read the Christmas card.

However, my oldest brothers fiancée was actively rude and incredibly ungrateful about her gift.  Keep in mind her student loan debt/credit card debt so high it became a source of contention between my brother and her because once they get married he will take on her debt.  My parents have been aware and worried because right now my brother is in good financial standing.  So, they gave both my brother and his fiancée the gift of not only paying off her student loan debt (she has a Masters in education and 120k in student loan debt) but also her credit card debt as a Christmas/early Wedding gift.   In total probably about 250k!   Not to compare $$$ but my student loan debt was 25k and I was thrilled to not have to worry about that anymore.

My brothers fiancée couldn’t even pretend to be grateful.  She kind of gave a fake smile and then went off to the guest bedroom to literally CRY ABOUT IT!  Not happy tears, but “tears of disappointment”.  She made a massive scene and acted super sad and told my brother my parents were acting selfishly because they were worried about him and not what would make *her* happy (which apparently was a particular $3,000 handbag).  She claimed she wasn’t worried about her student loan debt because it will probably be forgiven anyways (I doubt that) and that my brother makes enough to pay off her credit card debt himself (he makes 80k btw, she makes like 65k…not enough to comfortable get rid of over $100,000 worth of credit card debt that is growing rapidly!)

My parents were upset but kept quiet but I had enough and loudly proclaimed while she was in the next room that she was an “ungrateful little bitch”.

Everyone got angry at me.  My brother and his fiancée left and my parents said I didn’t need to escalate the situation but I can’t handle anymore holidays with someone so entitled.

338,t3_rvam0z,AITA for wanting to live at my grandparents' house?,"I live with my dad and my stepmom (she's my real mom though) and siblings (half but Idc about labels). My stepmom had a rough life and couldn't get an education really and was a sex worker for a while.

She has shared stories about her life with us and has worked really hard and now owns her own business. She and my dad care a lot about our education so we do not struggle like she had to, and moved to an area where there are good school.

I don't care about my stepmom's past, but I know she is embarrassed by it and I'd prefer it if kids at school didn't know because high schoolers can be really freaking awful.

I told my best friend though and then we got into a fight because the boy she liked asked me out. I got really annoyed because I can't control his feelings and I rejected him because I don't like him/wouldn't think about liking him because of my friend/and obviously care about my friend's feelings. She still got mad at me though and decided to tell a bunch of people in my grade about my stepmom, and now people are saying a lot of disgusting things to me/calling me horrible names/just being mean in general.

I told my stepmom and dad about what was happening in school and asked to switch schools and live with my grandparents because the people in that area won't know and won't make fun of me

My stepmom has been crying a lot ever since I asked to move and Idk if I am being an asshole to her because she really loves me and is an awesome parent. If I am, I will change my mind about moving. No matter what, I will apologize for making her cry, because I never meant to hurt her feelings.

edit: I went to talk to my mom and said I was sorry and that I loved her and turns out the only reason she's upset is because people are being mean to me and she was blaming herself. I told her that it wasn't and that she is the best person I know. I decided that IDC what people say about me anymore because the people who are being mean are immature and don't have parents who raised them to treat others with respect. The girls that are being mean all have the type of mom that is stuck in high school (you know what I mean?) I texted the boy in question and apologized for the drama my friend caused (because she is causing more issues now with him) and he told me that none of it is my fault and that he respects me for sticking up for my stepmom at school",14.0
339,t3_rvak3k,AITA for convincing a boy to eat chalk?,"We (14F &amp; 14M) were in science class and the teacher was out today so we had a substitute.  Like normal, the sub just had us use the period as a study hall.  There really wasn't anything to do because school just started again so a couple of us in the back of the room were passing notes around instead of studying.  

The boy that sits next to me passed a note that said he had a stomach ache, so I passed one back that said that chalk and tums are the same thing, he should just eat a piece of chalk.  After that he got up and asked the teacher to go to the restroom and secretly stole a piece of new chalk from the front of the room.  All the people in the back of the room started laughing when he left.

He came back in a few minutes later and flipped me off and wrote a note that I was a jerk and never to talk to him again.  I replied and said I didn't think he would actually believe me and I said I was sorry.  Am I the asshole for not realizing that he would actually eat the chalk?

340,t3_rvahj1,AITA for hating my new “friend”?,"I (16F) have 3 best friends (all 16F) and we’ve had an incredibly strong friendship for around 2 years now. There are a lot of people in this story so to make it simpler I’ll call them Sara, Kate and Anna.

A little background, for about 5 years I was in an incredibly toxic and abusive friendship, and when I finally got out, it took 2 years to find the friends I have now. As you can probably imagine, I am still dealing with a ton of trauma from that old friendship, but my friends have been nothing but amazing and whenever I’m having trouble they always reassure me and make me feel a lot better.

Because I’ve had such a healthy environment, a lot of my anxiety around friends has decreased significantly, but I still struggle with major trust issues. That is why I was so scared when 2 new people were added to the mix. I’ll call them Jane and Morgan.

This new friendship happened so quickly, and there was no integration period. It just went from 4 of us to 6 of us in one day. This caused me some concern, because we didn’t have time to get used to each other. 

My fears were proven right when Jane told me we needed to talk (anyone who had gotten that text before knows how terrifying it is). Jane, Morgan, and Anna all wanted to talk to me because they said I had done a few things to upset them and they needed a “break”. That sounds fair here, but the actual situation was more like Jane trying to turn everyone else against me for something dumb. 

Essentially Jane was upset because I had mentioned my pants size and made a joke about liking a part of my body, and that had bothered her because of her own insecurities, and because of that she made Anna mad at me too. Those comments were things I would say normally with just my 4 friends, so the lack of integration period showed that it was causing issues. Also, I have a bad relationship with food/weight, and she had told me her exact weight and how much she weighed at her smallest. She knew of my issues and this comment was extremely triggering for me, but I never mentioned it because it was a one time thing and again there was no integration period. (The fact that she was triggered was absolutely valid, just pointing out the hypocrisy)

She texted me later that day, saying she didn’t trigger me as bad as I did her. She also accused me of choosing to make her sit with someone she didn’t like so I could sit next to my crush, but as I had explained I am nearsighted and just moved to a seat in the front, and I also talked with the teacher to make sure she wouldn’t sit with that person. She responded “k” and I left it at that.

I broke down crying but Kate calmed me down, promising that her and Sara were in my side. That stayed true, and we hung out just the three of us a few times until a week later Jane and Anna (also Morgan bc she just does whatever Jane does so she was mad at me too) decide that everything’s fine and dandy and text me to let me know. Sara, Kate and I are all still pretty pissed at Jane and Anna, and we continue to text in a group chat by ourselves as well as the main one.

Fast forward a week or two, Anna invites us to have a sleepover at her new house, which she is in the process of moving into. Jane can’t come until late, so it’s decided that Anna’s mom will pick us all up at 9:00 instead of 4:00. I thought this was stupid because her new house was a 45 minute drive away, and my mom agreed. My mom hates Jane because she was incredibly rude when she was at our house once, and she tells me that I can’t go if they’re going that late. I tell the gc this, and I text Anna saying it’s fine if I don’t go, but we hadn’t hung out in 2 weeks and missed each other. Jane however was not taking this well. She made some snarky comments about my mom and I, and my mom was furious when I showed her. Ultimately, Anna asked her mom what time was best, and she said 4:00, which meant I could go and Jane couldn’t.

During the car ride, Anna shows me her texts with Jane. Jane said things like “it’s simple OP doesn’t go.”, basically trying to convince Anna that she deserved to go more than I did. Later, Jane was angry with Anna, claiming she was “guilting” her and playing the victim card.

We all ended up having a discussion and agreed to keep our distance with Jane and consequently Morgan. We are still “friends” but when we hang out they aren’t included. (This is also because my mom won’t let Jane come to my house, a decision I fully agree with and encourage) I think the biggest reason we all have stayed “friends” is because a) we all really like Morgan, and they are a package deal, and b) Jane talks shit about everyone she knows, and we know she would make us out to be horrible people if we dropped her because she’s done it many times before.

Since all of this happened, I’ve been particularly cold to Jane. Avoiding her, no responding to texts, etc. Also, I’ve talked to Kate, Anna, and Sara a ton about her and how much I dislike her. She’s exactly like my old friends, and I don’t want to put myself through that again. 

A part of me wants to trust my intuition, but the other part thinks I’m being too harsh and that people deserve a second chance.

341,t3_rvah3c,AITA for assuming too much?,"For background, I \[30|M\] matched with this one guy on Tinder back in 2020, but we sort of fell out of touch for a while, but then reconnected again through Instagram around August this past year (2021) after he ended up moving up to my city. We've tried scheduling a few times to meet up, but unfortunately other things ended up getting in the way that neither of us could avoid. Also for context, I'm someone who values my time, as well as others', so if I end up making plans with someone, I tend to try and stick with them; this includes following through the day before and morning of, just to confirm.

So the current problem is that we had agreed last week to meet up today \[Monday, Jan. 3rd\]. However, the last I heard from him was on NYE when he told me what he was doing that night. When I messaged him ""happy new year"" on Saturday, I hadn't gotten a response from him, so I just assumed that he was probable busy, but I hadn't heard from him since. So yesterday in the evening, I had messaged him asking ""are we still on for tomorrow?"", but I had gotten no response. This morning I messaged him again asking the same thing, even giving him a call and leaving a voicemail. After waiting for a bit, I just sent him a message saying ""I guess that's a no..."". Five minutes later, he messages me saying ""I'm driving back home from out of town!"" and ""I'm talking with my mom!"". I tried to apologize, saying I was just trying to confirm if we were still on for meeting today, but he just responded with ""you assume too much!"". I tried apologizing again, saying that I didn't mean to, but it's just that I hadn't heard back from him. He hasn't responded back to that last message, so now I'm starting to feel a little guilty about making that assumption.

AITA?

UPDATE: So he just messaged me a little bit ago, saying ""You can't put your insecurities back on me!"", after I apologized a second time and tried to explain where I was coming from in just wanting to check in with him to see if we were still on for today, and not hearing anything back from him. To me, that response was just completely out of left field, and uncalled for. So I don't think he's worth my time to try and salvage anything at this point. Whether or not he decides to reach out in the future at all is totally up to him, but I'm done at this point. If he does, I'll probably post another update. ",11.0

To all the kind people who commented,
First of all, I love you all..
OH MY GOD! I screamed this!! You people have given me a ray of hope! I'd really thought what I was doing was not right. Those comments were really getting to me. Thank you so so much for making me understand that I deserve happiness too.. I slept well thinking that there are people out there whom I can trust and who love me still. After suffering through abuse for so long and spending my life virtually alone, it comforts me to know that today, after 26 years I'm not alone, finally! My dreams died down at a very young age, my hopes vanished a long while ago, but today, oh god, today I feel so good!! I love you all, From the bottom of my heart! I will remember all of you in my prayers, 5 times a day!! I will update if anything happens! Thank you so so much! I'm crying now, oh god! Thank you so much!!

I don't know what to say or do! As for the children, they are with me and will be with me! No question in that!! Because he was not there when I gave birth for the first time, I had to sell my gold to pay for the birth. He and his mother did not allow me to touch my own son for months. I was severely depressed. I was 18. I went through hell. Miscarried my second child when my elder one was 10 months old. I had a c section during my first. Fell pregnant again and this time he outright refused to do anything. I shifted back to my mother's house and gave birth all the while no one from my in-laws house kept any sort of contact with me. My mother made my life a living hell. I somehow gave birth the second time as well. After everything was said and done, my mother wanted me to go back, I did. Then started the tactical unraveling of me. My ex, he humiliated me in public, gathered people and trashed me. He said such bad things to me in his sister's wedding. He, his father and mother left no stone unturned to make me feel like shit. I was in hell. 4 years later, in the year 2020 I finally came to my mother's house, but as a surprise to no one, I'm still in hell, living under her roof. I'm trying so hard to get out. My brain keeps jumping between my desire to be happy and thinking that I'm being unfair to the children. The point here is, If I'm not happy, how will I keep them happy!! Right now they don't know what their father did and I'm not going to poison their young and fragile minds but I will have to tell them one day. Redditors, please show me a way, some light!!

I got my fiancé a sewing machine for Christmas. Over the last few days she's been getting it setup and having a hard time. 

Last night I asked if she wanted my help, she said no. (I have some experience with embroidery machines from a few years ago.) Some time later she comes into the kitchen and shows me some stitches she has done, I tell her they look good and to keep at it. ( some of them are wavy and loose, but these are her first ones in years on a machine). 

She keeps at it and I can hear her making progress, after 5-10 minute I go into where she's working and say ""were some of the stitches really loose"" (I remembered that had to do with thread tension). 

She asks if that's a question or statement, which confused me, so I restated that I was wondering if some of the stitches were loopy/loose.  She gets upset and tells me she doesn't need my help and I wouldn't know anything about sewing machines anyway.

346,t3_rv9zzz,AITA for telling my mom if she doesn't stop buying things for my sister I will uninvite her to my wedding?,"I am getting married and my 19 year old sister is being ridiculous. She is very jealous of the attention my fiancé is getting and trying to upstage her and compete.

This all started when I proposed. I saved for a while because my fiancée is a gorgeous girl and I wanted the ring to be really special. When we first saw my mom, she was showing it off and my sister got quiet, and then left the room for a while. She didn't compliment it or say congratulations. At the next gathering with extended family the ring got a lot of attention and my sister seemed sad. my mom ended up buying her a diamond bracelet with some sapphires. When I commented my mom said it just seemed fair because she has my stepdad to buy her jewelry, my fiancée has me, and my sister has no one.

Then my fiancée invited them both wedding dress shopping. She said my sister was sulky at the appointment and kept saying she didn't feel good and laying her head on my mom. My fiancée called my mom at some point to talk about colors and the family coordinating, and my mom said my sister already had a dress because she ""couldn't wait"" and showed us a very sparkly, very beaded lavender gown. My fiancée told me she is familiar with that designer and my mom dropped some serious cash.

At the bridal shower my sister was sulky again and refused to eat, so my mom took her and left to buy her frozen yogurt because she was ""dizzy"" The final straw was the bachelorette party. My sister and mom were invited to the dinner before the big party and my sister wanted a $200 lobster. my mom told her that was rude since my future MIL was paying, and then asked my MIL if it would be ok if she (my mom) paid for my sister's dinner and bought her the lobster. The bridesmaids were lightly teasing my sister about how she is going to have to be my fiancée's slave the day of, and my mom snapped at them very harshly that my sister doesn't have to do a thing. My sister ended up yelling that it is dumb that we are having so many parties (engagement, shower, bachelorette, and wedding, so pretty standard I think) She said we don't need all of those parties and it is just an excuse for attention.

347,t3_rv9zxz,WIBTA if I pushed my roommates to clear off the porch for my own personal use?,"For the past 4 months, I've (22m) been living in an apartment with 3 guys who i had never met before moving in. All of them had lived there for at least a few months before me.

They're all nice enough, but my God are they messy and sometimes just downright disgusting. I don't consider myself to be that crazy about cleanliness, but for perspective, the first time I opened our shared fridge when I moved in, a couple of flies flew out of it.

Anyway, one of them has been taking up a lot of real estate on our shared porch lately. For instance, he has a cooler out there that takes up at least a third of the area which no one has used once in the time I've lived here. For some reason, he also insists on leaving his personal trash bags out there for at least a day before taking them to the dumpster, even though it's just 50 feet away from our building. Then a couple of weeks ago, I see he's left a broken mini fridge on it. I was willing to let that go for a bit since you can't just throw a mini fridge into a dumpster due to chemicals and such.

I on the other hand, would very much like to clear that porch off entirely. I have a charcoal grill I wanted to put out there and am absolutely willing to bring my roommates in on it because I love cooking for people. Then there's just the fact that the way it looks now is just plain tacky and depressing.

I took the liberty of looking up garbage dumps that he could take the mini fridge to for proper disposal and it turns out there's one in the next town over. He has a pickup truck so the trip shouldn't be too challenging.

I think he was just oblivious, but he was repeatedly asking everyone loudly if they needed to get off at a stop no one was planning on. Everyone looked pretty uncomfortable to the point the driver had to tell him to stop asking and if they need to get off they would let her know themselves.

After that he mostly just talked to the bus driver about the bus, asking about it and most of the time she just said that she just drives and doesn't really know the answers to some of his questions. Nothing wrong with the conversation, but he was still speaking very loudly and it was grating on my nerves as well (I'm sensitive to loud noises and voices) as the other passengers but no one spoke up.

Eventually maybe like halfway to the university I spoke up and told him, ""Excuse me, but could you please talk a little quieter?"" Those were the exact words I said and I made sure to be as polite as possible when saying so. I did not tell him to shut up or stop talking, but after I said that he did. While the others seemed grateful, I couldn't help but feel like I stepped out of line and upset him. I'm hardly a confrontational person and some part of me feels like maybe I should have stayed quiet and just waited until I got off the bus.

TD;LR: Guy with a heavy lisp and possibly disabled was talking very loudly to the annoyance of the other passengers. I politely asked him to talk quieter, but felt like maybe I shouldn't have.",13.0
349,t3_rv9y6t,AITA for cancelling my Dad’s Costco card without telling him?,I currently have no relationship with my family. My dad is on my Costco card. I called him in Jan 2021 and told him that I was no longer interested in having a relationship w/ my mom after years of toxic bs but I still wanted a relationship with him. He told me that was my choice and I have to live with it. I told him he would need to make an effort to have a relationship since I can’t call the house. My mom puts me on speakerphone and I want nothing to do with her. I have been the one to maintain contact and visit the family for the past 14 years. They don’t call me or visit.  He has not contacted me except for Dec 24 to leave me a voicemail. He fulfilled his obligatory duty to call on a holiday. I did not answer. I canceled his card b/c I don’t feel I owe him anything. He called me today and blew up b/c he went to get gas and his credit card (affiliated w/ the Costco membership) didn’t work. He wanted to know if this was my doing. I told him that yes I took him off my account (this does not effect his credit he literally just needs to go sign up for his own Costco card). He’s not in my life. Hasn’t spoke to me since Jan 2021. I owe him nothing. He said I should have told him and that I’m mean to everyone in the family (I guess I’m mean for standing up to my Narc Mom). He told me I no longer have a family.

350,t3_rv9xl6,AITA for getting upset that my girlfriend is going on a trip I thought was meant for the two of us with her sister instead?," 

A few weeks ago my girlfriend (24F) and I (26M) were talking about concerts, how it’s been a long time since any of us has been to one, how it would be fun to go to one sometime. We have on multiple occasions in the past talked about how we both want to go see this particular band play sometime, and the same band naturally comes up during this conversation. She starts looking up ticket prices, hotels etc for this particular concert where they are playing. At this point I figure it’s just an idea (she historically has been very impulsive with ideas), and didn’t think more of it, assuming we would plan it out further later on if it were to become a reality (the concert is in september), due to there being a lot of stressors in both our lives at the moment. 

Flash forward to a couple of days later where she is visiting her family. Me visiting with my family in another town, I routinely ask her one evening what she’s up to. To my surprise, she replies she just bought tickets for the concert we talked about earlier with her sister  (22F) and is very excited. I become upset thinking she wanted to go to the concert with me, and reply with few words. She later calls me saying she’s sorry, she feels bad for me, but at the same time is very excited to go and so is her sister, that they are both die hard fans of the band etc. She also says she wanted me to come too but her sisters boyfriend is indifferent about the band so he didn't feel like spending the money, and that it hence would be weird if the three of us went without him. 

Another couple of days later when we are both back home she says she senses something is wrong, and asks if it’s about the concert. Now I don’t want to be upset, I do want to feel happy for her since she is really passionate about it, but I haven’t had the time to adapt yet I guess, so I say yes, it’s bothering me since she went behind my back where I thought it was more about a fun trip for the two of us together than the concert itself. She says she didn’t think I even wanted to go see the band play, that I didn’t match her energy whereas her sister did. She also says that she doesn’t want me to be upset because she wants to be able to express joy about the event but will feel bad for me if doing so if I'm going to be like this when she brings it up. Of course I don’t have a problem with her going on trips with others, and like I mentioned I want to feel happy for her, but I just thought this was ”our” thing, and it’s taking a bit of time for me to adapt.

Am I the asshole for still being upset she went ahead and planned the trip without me?",5.0

He sent me a text around 10 at night when it happened, but I wasnt paying attention. The next morning, when I got out to look, he left and went to run errands and go get food with his family.
I called the police to file an accident report and get some documentation going. My car was parked, and he backed into it.
My car isn't new, but it's still valuable to me, and I filed a claim with my insurance company. He's been upset with me since ""it's going to increase his rate"" and we should have sat down and talked it over like men since we're ""family"".

I spoke to my father, and he is on my side saying that the damage is probably more than just out of pocket expenses, and I'll probably need a rental while the car is getting the body work done.

We bought some steaks for dinner 2 days ago, and today he was throwing a fit about how he was hungry. Except when my sister asked him what he wanted for lunch he interrupted her and walked away to play a game. So me and her made ourselves some Ramen, and about 30 minutes later he came in and said he was hungry and why didn't we ask if he wanted anything. So he cooked the all the steak even though he was the only one who was going to eat. She even offered to cook something else for him but he wanted the steaks. So now he's having steaks for lunch. 

And a few days ago he wanted to go to the thrift store, so they go to the thrift store. But her and I wanted to go to Walmart for some snacks while I showed her how to crochet(she gave up) and he wouldn't let us leave.

353,t3_rv9s37,AITA for using the customer bathroom instead of the employee bathroom?,"My(18) boss gets mad whenever we use the bathroom in front of customers. 

I work in a restaurant and there’s only two bathrooms. One is for employees and the other is for customers. The employee bathroom smells so horrible and doesn’t always flush. I don’t know what it is about the little lever (looked it up, it’s called a trip handle), but it will just fall off at random and it won’t flush. So, naturally, I end up using the customer bathroom instead of the one that’s falling apart. The customer bathroom is really nice, smells nice, and always flushes. 
The problem with this is that the customer bathroom is at the front, so people can see whenever I’m going in. My boss is getting really upset with me because he says that using the bathroom in front of customers makes us look unsanitary and will make people lose their appetites. But honestly, I don’e want to use a bathroom that doesn’t work. It’s embarrassing to leave the bathroom with all of my waste still in there because it isn’t working. So I keep using the customer bathroom and sometimes I have to sneak it when the boss isn’t looking or even hold it the whole shift.

354,t3_rv9rh9,AITA for allowing my son to trade a Christmas present?,"My 9 year old son is autistic.

For Christmas, he received several presents from one of his grandmothers which were not to his preference (a building kit he wasn't interested in and a girl's cut t shirt featuring a show in which he had previously been interested but was no longer). The presents were well intentioned but just poorly chosen.

When he received them he was very gracious and thanked his grandmother. When we got home, he retreated to his room and eventually started crying because he was so disappointed.

For him to contain his disappointment and thank her graciously was huge. I was very proud of him. I allowed him to order a new shirt featuring a show in which he is currently interested. Also, we have what we call ""the shop"" in our house - it is a shelf with new toys on it my kids can earn by doing jobs and trading them in for tokens. Each item has a token value assigned.

I let my son trade the building kit for an item from the store.

My husband is furious. He says I should have used this as a teachable moment for my son, and I should have pushed him to try the building kit. He thinks my son doesn't try enough new things. He is also very angry with me as when I ordered the toy my son traded for, I told him it would be placed in the store. He said by giving it to my son without making him work for it I was spoiling him and that I lied to my husband when I said it would go into the store 

AITA? I wanted to reward my son for doing such a great job of trying to contain his disappointment. If he had thrown a fit I wouldn't have traded them, but I don't see the harm in what I did.

355,t3_rv9q9y,AITA for trying to force recycling on my roommate?,"A few months ago, I bought a recycling bin for our kitchen and it sits next to the trash can. I told my roommate that I bought it and that he can start putting recyclables in there and I would empty it into our curbside bin outside when it gets full (before, I was having to go put everything in the bin outside immediately everytime I had something to recycle so the indoor bin was for convenience), and he said ok. Throughout the past few months, I kept noticing him throwing away recyclables in the regular trash bin so I tried to remind him that those are recyclable and should go in the recycling bin. He acknowledged it every time but continued to do it. At first I didn't really think anything of it because I figured he just didn't know they were recyclable or just was in the habit of throwing everything away. 

Yesterday I saw another recyclable in the trash and reminded him to recycle, and he said something along the lines of ""You know I don't really care about environment stuff right?"" And I said something like ""It didn't seem like you did but it's super easy because the recycling bin is right next to the trash."" And we went back and forth on that for a while with him stressing that it's not a big deal to him and me stressing that it's just so easy to do it so why not. It wasn't really a fight, no yelling or getting mad but both definitely not able to understand the other. He did say I was annoying for pushing my beliefs on him though. For some background, I do actually care about the environment and climate change is important to me. 

I also understand that in the grand scheme of things, one person's recycling really has such a negligible impact on everything. My problem though is I just really can't understand why he refuses to do it when it's the same amount of effort. I also take the bin to the curb and bring it back in so he doesn't have to do that either. His point of view though is that he isn't obligated to care about the same things I do and if he doesn't want to recycle then he doesn't have to. I can't really argue with that but I can't help but feel like he's kind of an asshole for it. But then he thinks of me as kind of an asshole for trying to get him to care about my beliefs instead of leaving him alone.

So am I the asshole for pushing this issue on him? Either way I'll probably just leave him alone about it and continue to move stuff from the trash to recycling when I see it.",1.0

I'm a graduate student at a university, currently working on my teaching credential. I have lots of work to do for both my classes and for my students. I'm not always the best at managing my time due to my depression and ADHD but I manage. I'm super grateful to my mom for allowing me to stay here after high school rent-free and I try my best to do everything I can for her. Saying this, she can be very mean when I don't align with her expectations of me being her ""good girl""

I've run countless errands for her when she doesn't want to leave the house, I give her foot/back massages whenever she asks, I do my weekly chores (which I know is just expected) as well as any other tasks she asks of me. I've even stop and buy her things like wine and other things she likes on my way home from class at 8 pm when all I want to do is come home and relax/start work.

Anyway. I spent New Years Weekend with my boyfriend and his family. I always try and see him at least once a week since our schedules differ and are both pretty busy. I did some of the school work I needed to complete at his house but I mainly wanted to spend the holidays with him before I got home on Sunday and had to do the brunt of my work. I got home Sunday night, worked, then woke up on Monday ready to finish up before class. As I was working, my mom came in at 10:30 am to say that my sis and I were to wash all the windows outside my house today and I told her I will if I had the time. I was working on some things before my class from 4-7 pm. Thought nothing of it until I got a text in our group chat to ""forget about the windows"" in a very passive-aggressive tone. My sis came in our room (we share) to say that our mom was mad and why did I say that to her, I had the time since I was on my computer watching youtube videos. I hate when they do this since I usually listen to something while I work and my family only seems to notice the times where I'm taking breaks between each assignment? I tried to say that I had to turn everything in by 3 and my peers wanted to look our things over before then but she cut me off.

I went to apologize to my mom. I told her I was really sorry for sounding rude and I'll make time for her, I had a lapse in judgment. She yelled at me and told me to go away. When I tried to really plead my case she snapped that I was only doing this to make me feel better since I was pestering her after she made it clear she wants me out. She has a pattern of doing this, telling me to go the fuck away, getting upset when I cry, saying that my apologies are meaningless and that I'm always badgering her when shes mad.

358,t3_rv9mxv,AITA for making a fuss?,"My brother recently got married to a wonderful girl. He is such a great guy, and she makes him so happy, it is really wonderful. However, their wedding hit quite a few stumbling blocks and as they were planning the wedding remotely, when the hotel they had booked chose to cancel, they needed someone to step in to help. There have not been many chances for me to support my brother (he works and lives in another country), so I was100% up for doing all that I could to support them in getting the wedding on track. Other family members also did a huge amount, this was in no way a solo effort.

On the day of the wedding, my sisters got to chill at home with the bride, have their hair and make up done. I had to be down at the hall meeting vendors and helping set up. When I got back, I went to say Hi to the Bride, who immediately sent me off to get her a top-up drink, and when I got back she said she wanted me to film her getting into her dress. I said that I wasnt too familiar with their camera, but I was really looking forward to being involved with that, and I was going to have a quick bath and get ready. She said she would come find me when it was time.

I ran my bath, but by the time I had found a missing tie, located a hair straightener for the MoB, put the dogs out, got the dogs back in, the bath was luke warm.

I rushed through getting dressed as quickly as I could. When I returned to the room, it was empty. They had done it without me and I had been forgotten.

It really hurt, but what made it worse (from my perspective) was a senior female relative (SFR), whom I really look up to, told me it was ""all in my head"" and I ""always make everything about me"". I was barely holding on, but (and this may be asshole behaviour 1)  this pushed me over the edge and I told her to fuck off.

The Bride asked me what was wrong, so (potential asshole behaviour 2)  I told her I had really looked forward to seeing her put her dress on, and it hurt to be excluded and forgotten. She was mortified and apologetic, I accepted her apology, explained I got upset quickly but would be over it in 15 minutes and I apologised for making a fuss on the morning of her Big Day. Bride and Groom made a huge effort to include me and thank me, which made me feel super uncomfortable.

Morning after I was discussing arrangements to babysit my nephew when SFR made some comment about how I wouldnt ever be thanked enough and noone was doing this on purpose to hurt me, I told her I understood it wasnt done out of spite, but that being forgotten still hurt, that this wasnt a transactional thing, I would have been upset even if I hadnt just spent the last week of my life finding a replacement venue, sorting the decorations, redirecting the florist. It wasnt about being paid back for my efforts, just about feeling included and wanted.

I want to note that before my diagnosis my granny was constantly worrying about my lack of periods for YEARS, even at an age where it wasn't really an issue yet. Saying it wasn't natural, we needed to go to a gyno asap because I could have something seriously wrong with me, and even going far enough to romanticize periods as 'a part of womanhood'.

I was prescribed birth control about a year ago (birth control can also induce periods if you didn't know) and I've had periods since, but recently my granny has started being weird about them.

My granny is the only woman I live with, and is somehow the only person who has an issue with my periods. When I still used pads, she'd say I need to wrap them up with toilet paper (which i thought was a lot of pointless waste) and put them in the outside trash so our non-existent guests don't see it.

My dad who I share a bathroom with, has randomly walked in on her vigorously scrubbing our toilet, asked him ""Was my period this obvious?"" or made a comment about how gross it is.

I started using a menstrual cup, mostly because it's cheaper, but even now she's still going on about it, even though there's literally no way I could hide my period more. I keep telling her that I shouldn't have to hide this in my own house, especially since it's her fault that I have periods in the first place, because I never would've looked into the lack of periods otherwise, but she just keeps getting upset over it every month.

So AITA?

Edit: When I still used pads I would fold it up so the sticky part kept it all together and then wrap it with the wrapper from the new pad, all the blood was covered, she wanted me to then wrap it up again in toilet paper, and throw it outside in the garbage can. No, I don't leave blood on the toilet seat, that's disgusting, it's common sense that I'd clean that off.",157.0
361,t3_rv9fwc,WIBTA for telling my roommate he can't sleep on our couch anymore,"I \[M 23\] live with 3 other roommates in a duplex. The guy I share an apartment with and I are very good friends and have been since middle school. The other two share the other side of the duplex. We are good friends with one of them and he hangs out with use essentially every day lets call him Joe. The other roommates is nice enough just very different from us and we don't exactly hang out very often lets call him Andy.

Recently Joe and Andy have been having some issues rooming together.

Joe has some major financial issues and is often short on rent and bills. Joe refuses to get different job or spend his money differently. Because of this Andy has to pay for Joe's bills and part of rent. Andy doesn't seem to mind too much but it definitely bothers him.

Andy comes from a rich family. He likes to have parties and invite people over late. Additionally Andy is very loud and often wakes Joe up. Andy is a very nice guy but likes different things than our friend group so we don't exactly hang out.

Recently Andy has been having friends over late and partying a lot. Because of this Joe asked to sleep on our couch occasionally. My roommate and I said ok as it was normally on the weekend.

But recently he has started sleeping on our couch every night. Even nights when Andy isn't home at all. When asked he says that he is too lazy to go to his place and he is just going to sleep on our couch or some other illogical excuse.

Because of this he has been disrupting things in our apartment. He leaves the TV on every night until very late (volume low but still wasting electricity). He turns up the heat at night after I normally turn it down because he gets cold on the couch. I even suspect he eats our food once we go to bed.

My roommate and I haven't directly asked him not stop yet but when we do bring it up he says he has nowhere else to go and we should feel bad for him. I do feel bad that Andy disrespects his sleeping schedule but at this point he is disrespecting things around our apartment.

WIBTA for telling him he can't sleep on our couch anymore?

EDIT: Thanks for the comments so far guys. I will say that Joe 100% still lives with Andy. He just had a talk with the landlord about being late for this months rent and made sure to complain about it. So Joe can technically sleep in his apartment whenever he wants. ",68.0

I(34m) have 3 daughters(12, 9, and 4) with my ex wife(Jamie). We split custody of them, I have them every other week. This year I had them on Christmas. 

Jamie had some issues with her parents the past few years and it ended with them cutting off communication with her. I'm not entirely sure what went down but it's really none of my business.

Our kids had a great relationship with their maternal grandparents, though, and I personally have never had an issue. 

Jamie has expressed before the desire to not have our kids see them, and I always just said okay. However, this year they invited me and the kids to spend Christmas with them, and all of them seemed very excited so I said sure. 

The actual Christmas went great. They loved spoiling their grandkids and the kids loved it just as much. They did put a picture of all of us at Christmas dinner on their Facebook. 

A few days later Jamie messaged me. She asked if I had taken the kids to see her parents and I told her I had. She asked if I remembered that she had asked me not to, and I said I had remembered but I didn't see an issue with it. 

She got very upset and said I was trying to turn her kids against her by taking them to see her parents who hated her. She said I had no right to take them to see her family, especially family that hated her. 

When she picked them up she was obviously upset. She messaged me later saying that the youngest was talking about how amazing their grandparents were and that I shouldn't have taken them to see them. 

She's still very upset, and a couple a family members have agreed that I shouldn't have taken the kids to see their grandparents.

L: What you last wrote in the group chat was a little misplaced in directing it towards me. I really hope I’m misreading it, but as it stands - not only was it unnecessary, it was kind of shitty and not appreciated.

Me: I’m not following. I didn’t mean anything rude by it but I know E won’t allow us to post anything with crowdfunding/cash links. She is the final say. I’d love to post it &amp; I’m happy to share it on my personal page. We just can’t share it in BN &amp; have declined 15 posts that have cash links in them today. You’re absolutely misreading.

At this point I didn’t know exactly to what L was referring but knew I wasn’t unkind to her. 

L: I’m fine with following the rules. Your extra commentary to me in the form of a shitty verbal spanking and education in economic depression after the holidays.

I re-clarified I had no snark, that I was only echoing the difficulty of money being a high need &amp; also so scarce. I didn’t apologize &amp; said it was out of line to assume my tone &amp; that I would be hurtful to her, esp. re: this. I’ve been supportive to L &amp; never done anything to make her feel I’d be intentionally unkind, which she acknowledged.

L kept justifying, adding unsaid things she assumed I meant, called me pompous, &amp; when I asked her not to tone police me, she doubled down further with “I’m not policing your tone. I’m saying the phrasing you used without nuance hurt my feelings &amp; came off very badly.” (aka tone policing) I repeatedly reread what I said, reached out privately to T, who said I didn’t provoke this. I asked my husband to read it; he was also perplexed by her response.

She later half-apologized, blaming stress re: a legal matter (unrelated to me) for her attack. I told her to unpack her bags before she brings them to me &amp; didn’t respond further. 

I was raised by a narcissist who attacked when I set boundaries/said no, similar to this; I’m SO conscious of my words. My perception- as well as the others’- is this is a tantrum because I wouldn’t bend rules, but I will apologize if my response to her was out of line &amp; a personal attack in some way. AITA?",11.0
366,t3_rv9b7i,WIBTA if I stopped telling my mom updates about me moving out?,"So I (26m) am moving out soon (two months) and my mom (62f) does not seem happy about it. She started going through my mail because she convinced herself I’m in financial crisis and that every mail I get is a huge bill with no reason to think that and I told her all my bills are automatic and online. If I had a bill, trust me I’d know. She started nitpicking every action I do, for example one day I was in a hurry and did not clean out the sink every morning like I usually do and my mom got extremely angry with me saying how when I move out my friends are “not going to stand for this” and giving me a lecture over the sink for one off day I had. I tried telling her I already talked to my friends about matters such as rules, expectations of each other, rent, all of that. I’m not going in thinking “I can do whatever I want when I move out and it’ll be fine because I’m with friends!!” 

My mom constantly talks like she thinks I’m still an immature child. 

My dad (62m) however is extremely happy for me, but keeping my expectations real but every time I bring up my plans with my mom I just personally feel like she’s mad I’m the last kid leaving the nest and my dad has more or less confirmed that’s how she feels (my brother 32m moved out three years ago) 

I wanted to move out 2 years ago but some family problems (my grandma needing me close so I could help her around the house and some other personal reasons) 

When I told my mom I reached my savings goal she just said “oh you still have a savings?” But my dad was very happy for me as I struggled to save money in the past 

Also side note I know both me and my brother were a bit old for Americans to move out but my parents are both first gen Americans and moving out when you’re older is just expected and normal in our family and culture. I do pay my mom rent too and buy all my own things like food and such. 

My mom keeps asking me for updates but as I explained before she only has extreme criticism and doubt, even once saying I should stay until I get married like she did.

Also yes I know it’s technically illegal that my mom goes through my mail but when I asked her to stop she accused me of hiding something from her and said iI was an accident because our names are similar (we don’t but I digress)

367,t3_rv98wj,AITA for making my brother in law change his soap?,"TL:DR - I can't stand my brother in laws soap so I tossed it, and voluntarily bought a different one.

Some background: My brother in law has lived with my now husband and I for 2 years. He is in a wheelchair so we help take care of him when needed. He does not pay rent per se, however he contributes his EBT to the household and helps pay a couple smaller bills. I call that good. (He's on limited income). He has been suffering extreme short term memory loss over the past year, but only makes light of it with doctors so nothing is being done. He can forget stuff within the same hour sometimes. 

The issue: I had a very traumatic childhood. To this day (some 30+ years later), the smell of a certain brand of soap makes me gag. It's so bad if I even catch a whiff of it in the soap aisle, I start gagging and have to get away ASAP. Well, it happens to be the brand my brother in law uses. Even before his memory loss issues, I asked him to consider switching to something else several times. He only gets that brand because it's cheap, not due to any special needs. Obviously,  I know it's my issue and not his. I have offered many times to buy a different one, gladly out of my pocket.

Well, after many times of asking, I finally just threw away the offending brand and was happy to replace it with something similar but not that particular brand. I told him just let me know when it got low and I would go get more. Well, now he says I am picking on him and singling him out to be mean. Out of my husband and his brother who also lives with us, he's the only one with the nasty brand, but I would have had the same request to them as well. 

So I am wrestling a bit with myself. AITA?",38.0
368,t3_rv98we,WIBTA if I asked my parent to help pay for anything?,"Hey everyone! I (25f) wanted to get everyone’s thoughts on this. To start off, I come from an Asian household and my parents have always had this expectation that their kids will take care of them when they are older. I moved to CA, over the expectations that I would be able to help my grandparents, however, due to my field it is not plausible (I work 70-80 hours week). As such, my grandparents asked my mom to move back. She said yes to the caveat that I would buy her a house because she doesn’t wanna live with her parents. I stupidly said yes. It was a notion that my mom would help out but because CA is expensive and she’s only in her 50s, as such not in retirement age. But when she moved over she decided to fully retire and rely on me for all of her expenses. Now, I understand that as in an Asian household we will always help out no matter what. But I’m extremely frustrated at my mom. Every time I try to talk to her about finances she would cry and then I would shut up and stop talking about it. I pay for everything, the mortgage, the utilities, car, food, etc.  

I know my siblings provide her money and she does earn some money on the side. Will I be a bad daughter/ass if I asked her to help pay for anything?

It is a mental thing that I’m going through and I will get pass it?

369,t3_rv921j,AITA for not moving my bags on the bus?,"I was coming home from work after 7pm on a New York MTA bus and had just bought cleaning supplies. I had 2 big brown paper style bags packed up &amp; a bookbag. I had the bookbag on the bus floor and a big bag on my lap and couldn’t fit the other bag on my lap as well without having any space at all. A woman (adult middle aged) gets on and has bags of her own. She obviously wouldn’t be able to comfortably fit next to me and would make it impossible for me to grab what i had in the event i needed to get off. She looks at me and i tell her “I don’t know where you think there’s enough room, I’m sorry”. She then goes back &amp; forth with me telling me to take the other big bag and put it on my lap as well or put it on the floor (already had a bookbag on the floor). I tell her there’s unfortunately just no room. She says I’m a man and that I should be standing and that I’m not the only one coming home from work (these looked like shopping bags tbh and i just got off a 12 hour shift where i stand the majority of the day with no seating). She calls me a “f*cking idiot” so at this point she gets me angry and i tell her there’s other seats or she can use the 2 legs she has to stand and that it won’t kill her. She says I didn’t pay for two seats while i responded that there’s no bag limits on NYC buses and that payment doesn’t guarantee a seat, when she should be mad at the MTA corporation for forcing fare for something that should inherently be free (travel) and not mad at me for the small bus seat sizes plus the fact that I didn’t make her pay the 2.75$ fare to get on, the bus driver did. A girl behind me moved over and the woman ended up sitting down but kept ranting about me so i turned and said “you’re still talking about it!?”’and she asked if “i was ok” in demeaning fashion so i said i was fine and that she was the one cussing at me causing a scene.

371,t3_rv9295,AITA for calling my sister a bad influence on her daughter?,"I (30M) have a sister (34F) who has a (14F) daughter. My niece's father is not married to my sister but he's always taken care of them financially and emotionally. My sister recently divorced her husband and started soul-searching. We all supported this decision of hers, whatever makes her happy. But she left my niece for months at her father's while she traveled across the world (yes, during the pandemic too).

And she came back this November. I can't recognize my sister anymore. She started collecting the crystals, spending all of her money on them. She also started practicing yoga and braids her hair. One evening, when we were both sitting together, she opened up to me that she is in an open relationship with some random guy she met while traveling at the airport. Immediately, I became very uncomfortable around her. We're both adults here, but she's my sister. I don't wanna hear the details. She then took a bag out full of shrooms and offered them to her. According to her, a trip had changed her life, and now she knew what she wanted in her life. Of course, I didn't do it.

Two days ago, a niece's father texted me, begging me to call him ASAP. I called him back. Apparently, my niece is in the hospital. On New Year's Eve, my sister offered her weed brownies and she somehow had a bad trip from them. At this point, I am sick to stomach. We both met up and had an open conversation about his intentions. Can tell he's red pissed, but more at my sister. For a while, he's been debating whether or not to take full custody of his daughter and I told him I will support him.

I went to my family's house and told my sister what she did was unthinkable. She should not be feeding these things to my niece, who's only a child of a curious nature and can't make decisions for herself. As an adult she should have known better and taken better care of her. On top of that, she's also been planning her trips starting February again, abandoning her daughter once more. This is not the way she wants to bond with my niece.

Now whole family thinks that I am betraying my sister instead of giving her my unconditional support. And refuses to talk to me.",385.0
372,t3_rv91m0,WIBTA for asking fiancé to do more around the house?,"I (23f) have been with G (28m) for nearly 5 years and we have been living together for 2 of those years. After WFH ended for me, I go into the office/travel for work 8-9 hours per day on weekdays. He has always had a remote job and is WFH 5-6 days per week. Due to time differences with his job, his workday is 10a-11p (with a long midday break), while mine is 8a-4/5p. He is the breadwinner. 
The main issue I have is that on top of working out of the house, I am also doing all of the cooking and laundry, 90% of the cleaning (I am allergic to our pet, so he handles that), and all of the shopping. He also uses his one full day off per week to pursue a hobby away from home (gone from 8a-8p). If I leave on a weekend to go see my family, I come home to the house in the same or worse state than when I left. He says that it’s too hard for him to multitask (start the washing machine, fold laundry, sweep), and when I have brought up that he needs to do more, he says that he will do more when we are paying rent equally (he pays 2/3 of rent, I pay 1/3, based on wages). When I do leave him a list of things to do, he either doesn’t see it or starts any tasks on it around 3:30, so everything finishes when or after I get home (and, conveniently, can put it away/finish it). For example, I asked him to run the laundry so that we would have clean clothes for the gym that night. He started the wash at 4, and our gym activity starts at 6. It takes 40 minutes for the washing machine, 30 for the dryer, and the gym is 40 minutes away. 
I feel frustrated when I come home from work and the trash is full/overflowing, he and our pet want dinner, and nothing has been done. IMBTA though, as his job is more stressful and he pays more expenses than I do (his car, rent, utilities).",7.0
373,t3_rv8x4s,AITA for wanting independence to take my own Uber as a 21 year old?,"I am currently visiting family in a foreign country. I've spent the past 3 weeks with them and my cousin invited me to get coffee 3km away to where my family is staying. This is the first time this vacation I'd be spending time with somebody my own age. 

My cousin doesn't have contact with the rest of the family, for her own personal reasons I don't blame her for but won't get into as that's her business. I don't want to be involved in family drama and I want to respect her boundaries. I just want to hang out with my cousin for the first time in 7 years, and who knows when I'll have the chance to again. 

The original plan was for her to take an Uber and pick me up, then we'd both go to the Cafe. Even this makes her uncomfortable as she doesn't want to see the rest of the family. I feel like this is a relatively safe plan, but both my parents blew up over it, claiming their concern was ""my safety"". They are insisting another family member drive me there, but she does not want to see them and I don't want that either as I don't want conflict. 

This is extremely frustrating, as I've lived on my own for 2+ years and am typically very independent, and it feels like my parents are treating me like a dumb irresponsible teenager. I don't understand the need to babysit me, when it's a relatively good neighborhood, during the daytime. I have service here and everybody's number I can call if anything bad were to happen. It just feels like they are being very overprotective and suffocating me.

Mind you, a week after I get pack I have plans to fly halfway across the country alone to meet a friend of 6 years I met online, and that plan they are certainly fine with, so their logic just seems so backwards. 

I just want to be treated like an adult. Am I the asshole for asking for a shred of independence ?",5.0
374,t3_rv8wri,UPDATE: AITA for telling my daughter that her not wanting kids is why I wanted to have more children,"So I wasn't going to do an update but my husband told me I should since I was voted asshole.

I ended up having a talk with Kiara and I told her I never should have said what I did and I was wrong. Like many of you said I clarified what I meant and told her she is my everything. I told her that I did not want kids for grandkids but just for our family to grow but I would rather be there for her than focus on a baby myself. I told her I did not mean to put pressure on her because I have my own dislike for no generation gap because of my extended family in my home country. She gave me a smile and told me she forgived me and was sorry for what she said so I forgave her too.

She told me she was willing to see the psychologist now if I would go with her so I said I would and we booked sessions for after New Years. But I still asked why she was having the baby when she did not want any. This time she was willing to talk. She admitted that seeing all her friends get married and have babies and being so happy made her feel jealous and she had changed her mind. She got off birth control because of hormone issues and did not mean to get pregnant but when she did she decided to keep it. She said she was lying to me during pregnancy about not wanting to be pregnant because she felt like she was being a burden and felt she needed to push us all away. That did not make sense to me but I said we will talk to the psychologist about it because she will know best.

She admitted that she made up an argument and broke up with her fiancee because she felt like she was trapping him with a baby and he deserved better. She let me see their texts and it is just him checking on her and her ignoring him. She told me she did not tell him she miscarried and is scared she will lose him forever if she does. I went with her the day after to talk to him and helped her explain the situation. He forgave her and they agreed to start fresh as long as they also go to the counseling.

Since then everything has been going good at home again. Kiara seems happier and had fun at our small Christmas party with her fiancee. My husband and I also discussed maybe foster or adopting an older child since Kiara and her fiancee both announced at the party they will have kids.

This is important as I was distracted while doing this and my girlfriend who was over hanging out told me she was hungry and asked if she should call a delivery, I told her I had leftovers in my fridge and to help herself to a snack while I did this then we could get a delivery later. I figured she'd stick to the fridge and not go into the freezer.

A short while later I heard a scream and rushed to see wtf had happened thinking she'd hurt herself and instead found her staring shocked at my ziploc bags of frozen feeder mice and rats and she demanded to know why I had that, I am ashamed to admit I couldn't help myself and laughed at the situation though I was quick to reassure her no i'm not some weirdo who likes to keep frozen rodents in my freezer for no reason and they're for my snakes.

The thing is 1) I'm not going to be wearing a white bridal dress, I'll be wearing a traditional red dress that due to the design (lehenga), type of silk and embroidery is very distinctive so even if my MIL *does* wear a white wedding dress it's not like it'll be the same?? also, this may be dumb but I don't really get what the big deal is if my MIL wears white even if I was also going to? as long as the groom doesn't get confused and marry the wrong person, how does it matter?

We agreed that he would take care of her while I took in my sister (16) because he made a lot more than me. 

Well about 3 months in of him taking care of her he asked me to take her in for a month since he was going out of town to work. I agree. A couple weeks after he left, he blocked us all and made it clear that he was not coming back for my mom. He even told me that he didn’t need family, that for that point on he was on his own and he didn’t want to hear from us anymore. 

So he essentially left me to care for my mom, my sister, my 10 month old daughter and my boyfriend who is a SAHD all on 12/hr. Our landlord also raised our rent almost half of what we originally paid for increased tenants. 

On top of all that he was still getting the child tax credit for my sister and refused to give me even half of what he got for her.

So all in all, he was dead to me. So imagine my surprise when on New Year’s Day I found my mom talking to him at 1 in the morning as if they were bestfriends, as if he didn’t abandon her.

381,t3_rv7tns,WIBTA for taking my pet when I move?,"Ok, please bare with me on this one.. This is long because I need to provide some context. Throwaway account to avoid doxxing myself. 

My ex and I were together ten years and finally ended things in April 2021 (that’s a whole other story). About 5 years ago, we had broken up for a short amount of time. In that timeframe, he managed to get a ferret. Once we got back together, I honestly wasn’t too fond of him (we live in an area where they are illegal and wasn’t really familiar with them at all). As the weeks went on, he became my best friend.

Since then and even now, everything I do is for him. I spend all of my free time with him. I have researched SO much about ferrets and realized how high maintenance they really are. I would try to educate my ex about certain things but he would either ignore it or state he knew what he was doing. We only had one ferret, where ferrets usually need friends to keep a happy life. He was content on being independent only because of all the quality time I spent with him. Ferrets sleep 18-20 hours per day but it is CRUCIAL they have at least 4-5 hours of playtime per day. I buy him all of his toys, enrichments, high quality food and treats to make him as healthy as possible. My ex never cared about any of that saying it was a waste of time. 

After our break up, we agreed to a custody agreement (ridiculous, I know) where I would get him 4 days a week and him 3 days a week. He typically forgets when it’s his turn so I have him majority of the time.

He has gotten sick several times prior to this arrangement and during, and he doesn’t seem to notice. I’ll get an occasional text for an update and he doesn’t pay it any mind. He’s even said “I know you will take care of him.” I pay for all the vet bills, medicine, syringe feeding of medicine and food when he refuses to eat. Ferrets have a short GI tract and need to eat every 2-3 hours. Their health can quickly decline if you do not monitor food and water consumption as well as excrements. If you do not catch these signs, a ferret can die within 1-2 days without eating or drinking. 

My dilemma here is, I want to take our ferret with me when I move to school in 2 weeks. I know if I bring it up to my ex he will say that our ferret is not mine (rewind to when he got him during a short break up). He has thrown this in my face over the years that if I ever left him, he would never let me see our ferret again. 

Despite the history between me and my ex, I truly want what is best for our ferret. If I were to take him, he will be legalized there, I could take him to explore instead of keeping him in hiding, we have two new ferrets that have made him so happy, and I invest so much more time and care into his well-being.

382,t3_rv7g1j,AITA for customising my burger,"For my niece's (my sister's child) 10th birthday a few days ago we went to a restaurant. I am pretty picky about food so I thought it would be easier rather than complain about the burger place she wanted to go to I'd just take along some of my own stuff.

The actual meat is okay but they do horrible over sweet brioche and fancy named complex burgers and it makes the food basically inedible it's so disgusting. I ordered their most basic burger with just some lettuce and had brought my own bread, some cheese and some BBQ sauce.

Nobody said anything at the time, none of the staff cared and honestly I think the guys at the next table were pretty jealous but afterwards my sister told me I was being a total asshole and ruined the evening and drew all of the attention away from my niece on her birthday. My niece didn't seem unhappy, basically nobody commented beyond ""haha don't you want one of these fancy burgers"". I got to eat food that was actually edible and I don't think I was being an asshole but idk. Was my sister just being weird or does she have a point?",7009.0

I was pretty happy with this arrangement bc I still basically had my own bathroom and rent was cheap, but i just had a new roommate move in and she paid only half the rent. I like my new roommate and I’d like to continue having a positive relationship with her and I’m not sure how to bring this up diplomatically, especially since she already moved in apparently under the impression we would be paying half for rent.

So around this time a new girl came into our grade and this was before she started a lot of issues so we were still friends with her but she was VERY two-faced so her loyalty basically lied with no one and she was just there to ensue chaos. So while we were in science class it was time to leave and some people had gotten out of the door already but the teacher stopped me and asked me if I was going to finish this laborious project that she was on my ass about that I truly and honestly did not want to do (tbh my mental health was tanked from a situation that was happening and let's just say it was school-wide knowledge and it made me feel shitty about myself to the point where it literally caused me to have depression I'm seeing a therapist now thank God) so I just told her I'll get around to it and was trying to leave but then she said ""when? Bc you said that last time so are you going to do it or not?"" A lot of the class was still around and she was being loud enough for them to hear and the embarrassment started kicking in so I just loudly and sternly told her ""NO"" and packed my stuff and left. The next day at school I was just going about my business then the two-faced chick came up to me and told me her and my BFF were talking yesterday and said my BFF felt that I had my head up my ass for saying no to that project 😃. I swear to God if my blood could literally boil at this point it would, it only hurt me so much because we'd been friends since like fourth grade and middle school was challenging (stupid drama)but we got through it so for her to damn near start some crap again especially with how my mental state was I was not having it. So once I got home I screamed at her over text basically going off on her as to why she said that s*** in the first place and I was so mad I barely remember most of the things she said but I do remember I told her to go suck the devil's 🍆 and to lose my number and left it at that. Then the two-faced b*tch came up to me cuz my BFF told her everything and basically said I was the crazy asshole for saying all the hurtful shit that I told her and that I had no right no matter how mad I was like I said earlier that bitch just likes to cause chaos so I was not going to get into it with her but I stood my ground so was I the asshole?",11.0
385,t3_rv798e,AITA for not helping my friend and him getting kicked out from the program?,"So for reference I am 18m and my friend is also 18m. We are juniors in highschool. 

So this program is a CTE program the school has for becoming an EMT. I got into the program because after school it pretty much guarantees a job while my friend in his own words got into it just so we would have classes together. 

The way this program works is that for freshman and sophomore years it is class work that is done. Learning terminology and the by the book explanations and stuff like that. I will admit he kinda floated through the class work because we would study together. He would copy my answers in his own words. That type of thing. 

When Covid hit it completely screwed up school and we both ended up flunking the eleventh grade because there was just a problem after problem with the site and stuff. Even though this happened I still didn’t stop myself from keeping up to date with the procedures and watching videos. Basically doing what I could and my friend just goofed off. 

Anyways so the 11th and 12th grades in this program is where clinicals/in the field work happen. We basically get to leave school two hours early and head to whatever job site. The work is awesome and I’ve gotten top remarks from my instructors. I am even going to get my IV certification in a few months. 

My friend on the other hand has not been doing so well. A few months ago he came to me and begged me to essentially teach him all of the stuff we learned in the 9th and 10th grades. I told him no. That he should have paid more attention to what we were learning so he would be more prepared. Life goes on and when Christmas break came so did the news that he is getting kicked out of the program while I am in the top ten. 

He and a few mutual friends are calling me an asshole because I didn’t take the time to refresh him. I don’t think I am one though. 

So Reddit Am I the asshole for not helping my friend get up to date with his knowledge for the CTE program and him getting kicked out of it?",48.0

So, a bit of backstory, my mom is one of those people who had children because she wanted to have something (notice how I say some*thing)* to brag about.

I've been best friends with my cousin for several years and one thing to know about her is that she's good at nearly everything. Me on the other hand, I'm above average but in terms of vast skill sets I'm not even close.

My parents have been telling me for years that they wish they could swap me out for my cousin, and while I should be getting used to it, it still stings a bit.

On New Years Eve, I was with most of my family and we were talking about stuff our parents used to tell us and I said that my mom would often say she wished she could swap me out. No one really thought about it, and we continued our conversation.

I(25f) have been with my partner(28m) for almost 4yrs &amp; we’ve been living together for the past 2yrs. When he first moved in, things were great. He would keep tidy &amp; I would only have to clean once a week. Then a month later, he had finished moving in &amp; things changed. I would come home after work and the house wouldn’t be in the same condition that I left it.

&amp;#x200B;

There would be dirty dishes/food left on the kitchen bench, oil all over the stove &amp; dirty clothes/gym equipment left around the house. Instead of cleaning once a week, I was cleaning up every 2 days. Over the last 2yrs, I’ve constantly spoken to him about it &amp; asked him to clean up his mess but nothing changes. I use to think that it might of had something to do with his ABI(2011) because it still affects his short term memory. Usually our conversations end with him telling me that I don’t clean much around the house &amp; me listing the chores I do but never notice because it doesn’t stay clean for long.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I gave birth to our son &amp; the only sleep routine he has is at night. Sometimes he’ll have 2 day sleeps or sometimes 1. Due to this, I’m really struggling with keeping up with the house work because I don’t have the energy. I found that I’ve been visiting family more just to get out of the house. After not being able to clean for the past fortnight, I decided to sit my partner down &amp; tell him that I think it’s best for him to move back in with his parents for a few months so when I finally get time to clean the house, it’ll stay clean &amp; I can focus on getting our son to sleep in his bassinet during day naps instead of on me. That I don’t think it’s fair that I have to spend my free time when our son is sleeping on cleaning when I should be using it to decompress. He said that I’m overreacting &amp; that the house isn’t even that bad. That houses are meant to get messy because people live in them &amp; that’s a fact of life. It can’t always be spotless and perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him I don’t want the house to be perfect, I just want him to clean the kitchen when he uses it &amp; stop leaving his clothes around the house. I told him that staying with his parents for a few months might teach him how to clean up after himself because I’ve tried &amp; nothing has sunk in. He asked for another chance &amp; said that he’ll do better but I’ve already given him more than enough chances to change. I told him no, I’m sticking with my decision because I have to think of myself. I’m tired of looking after our son 24/7 plus being the house maid. He’s been begging me to let him stay but I feel like I want to stay firm on this. I feel shitty because if I do, he’ll have nowhere to go because his parents don’t like having him for the same reason &amp; he’s on a fixed income so he can’t afford to stay anywhere.

---

My (36F) dad (65) and mom (55) got divorced (~10 years) and they both moved out of the country. I moved to another city in the same province, my two sisters (35 &amp; 25)are still in our home city. 

Dad remarried about 4-5 years ago, my sisters and I had found out after the fact. Overtime, Dad would fly to Canada without his wife/step child and I would gladly go see him or invite him to my home. In 2021, my father was able to sponsor his family over and has now moved back home with his wife (35) and step daughter (15?) I had never met his family when they lived overseas..

Now that he is closer, he suggested coming to visit me in my city. Every time he mentions coming to visit me, I politely tell him to let me know and I would gladly book a hotel for him and his family. 

I don't think he took me seriously as a couple of months ago, he called asking when would be a good time to come down. I repeated my offer and my dad declined as he ""didn't want to waste money"". I offered not only to pay for a hotel room, but also time to take them around the city.

I admit, I lost my patience and told him that it was hard enough to maintain a relationship with him and I had no plans to forge new ones with his family. (Dad is not a great person...he later blamed my mother for his cheating ways in that same phone call..).  I said he could come visit me without his family or not at all if he did not want have a relationship with me. 

I was too honest in the phone conversation and told him I loved him as a father, but not as a person AND I am returning the same love that was given to me growing up...

My dad never responded and now I am being bombarded with messages from other family members to ""forgive"" and that my father ""loves you [me] so much""...

My father and I haven't talked since, other than a ""Merry Christmas"" text which I initiated and he politely replied.

390,t3_rv6yp2,AITA for interfering with dad's online dating?,"so my dad's approaching his 60s and has been widowed for a while now. recently, he's been getting into online dating, and since he's an old man, he doesn't know a damn thing about the internet and is too proud to admit he's clueless.

so one day i approach him for something while hes on his computer and my eye immediately catches the big busty woman hes talking to. i glance through a few texts, and without a doubt, its a nsfw bot.

i tell him this and he immediately hops off the site (cant remember the name of it but it was a bullshit site) i tell him to please let me know what sites hes interested in so i can look into them to see if theyre legit or not. no problem, right?

well, he didn't tell me, and recently there was a stack of papers on his desk. i asked what it was and he said it was a printed out set of questions a nice lady had sent him.

immediately suspicious by this and the gigantic large blocks of text on the paper, i ask to see what she wrote.

and he goes off. he says it isnt my business, that if he pulled the same shit with me id be rightfully pissed off too, etc. basically not letting me help with things he needs help with

eventually he gives in and i read the paper. the questions are textbook ""give me information i can use to fuck you over"" and the paragraphs are just chunks of get-to-know-me drivel filled with random words and grammatical errors. 

best part is he admitted to not even reading the paragraphs before starting to answer the questions.

i tell him it's a bot and he goes ""HOW DO YOU KNOW?? THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO TALK LIKE THAT! IM NOT STUPID"" and so on 

i google her name and find a phishing twitter account with the same (probably stolen) picture.

that aside, he finally agrees its a bot then goes on about how he has no privacy, how im not allowing him to meet people, how he cant trust anyone, and that im just going to end up calling real people bots to keep him alone

my goal isnt to read every message he ever sends and receives- ive made it clear that all i want to do is get a first look to make sure hes not on the pathway to being scammed or hacked. ill usually try and sneakily read from afar because asking him to see it would just result in another fight. either way the result would be the same, just with one less fight if i dont ask. (hes aware that i snoop anyways)

so yeah, what i want to do is to investigate the websites he finds and do a bare minimum look-through of new messages. i have taught him internet safety, but there are too many subtleties that you can only pick up on through years of internet experience.

 i dont want to let him be because even though he wont admit it hes clueless about the modern internet. but i also dont want to make him feel like im trying to isolate him and manipulate him by saying i know more than him about this - i dont want to hurt him or have him unable to trust me anymore. if i am the asshole and have been going about this all wrong, i dont know what to do and advice would be appreciated.

391,t3_rv6yol,AITA for not being friends with anyone lifetime friend dude to her drinking habits?,"My friend, let’s call her Lexi(23f), drinking has been increasingly getting worse over the past few years. And recently in the past year I decided that I(25f) am no longer drinking (because I was falling into bad habits). With that being said, I do not expect anyone around me to stop drinking just because I decided to stop. Recently though I have had a conversation with Lexi about if she is going to be drinking to the point of excess, I don’t want to be around it and that I’ll just hang out with her another time if she’s going to do that. 
Now I feel like she should respect that I don’t want to see her like that, and that it isn’t too much to ask for. (She usually gets super drunk and just cries)
Flash back to a few weeks ago, I go over to her house to have a girls night with her and her friend, and she is drinking but they said it was casual drinking. Not long after I’m there she is slurring her words, and stumbling around and asking if she is being annoying every 5 minutes (she was, but we said no). 
Not long after that she starts to become aggressive when we’re asking her if she wants help to her bed, changing her clothes, etc. and tells us to “f*ck off” and keep drinking.
So I left. 
I texted her later and told her that I felt pretty disrespected by her comments and the fact that I told her I didn’t want to be around her when she was like that. She told me that it was “her house and she can drink as much as she likes when she’s there.”
I worry about her and our friendship now because she is pretty upset with me for saying anything and she thinks I’m in the wrong. I’m worried about her, not only does she drink constantly during the week, but she has also had awful things happen to her as a result of her drinking (being taken advantage of by men, one of them being a cousin of hers which really messed her up).

The more I refuse the more upset my ex and his family are getting. They think I’m being selfish and that I should do this for the sake of my baby and not for them.

395,t3_rv6sio,AITA for admitting I wish my daughter was still a tomboy?,"Hello so I (43) have three kids. The oldest Luna (24) is getting married next year. Her younger sister Isabella (21) is still in university. I will admit that I have always been closer to Isabella because she is much more like me and much more of a girl, wearing dresses, makeup, princess costumes and you name it. 

Luna was always a tomboy from toddler to teen. For example in high school she had a pixie cut, most of her friends were boys, she hated the idea of pregnancy, she listened to rap music and would play sports against the boys and even beat them a lot of times. She only ever wore a dress for prom. Even though we weren't as close cause I couldn't relate I loved how true she was to herself and she always made me so proud I'd show everyone her trophies. She was always herself and never let anybody tell her otherwise. I was so proud when she told my mom she'd rather get video games than a hair straightener for her birthday cause she'd just cut her hair short.

When she went to university her style began to change a lot and now it's like she isn't who she was before. I know that people change and I accept that and I don't want her to change if she doesn't want to. She didn't like dresses before and loves them now. She has beautiful long hair now. She listens to Latin music like her sister and me now. She's talked about being excited to have kids and being a stepmom. I don't think she's played basketball or fenced in years. She's a lot more like Isabella now, they actually get along like sisters and most of her friends are also girls now. We even got a lot closer like now she'll even cuddle up to me when watching a movie. But with her getting married I guess I've been really nostalgiac.

Yesterday when she took us wedding dress shopping I remembered how when she was 14 she said shed get married in a tux cause wedding dresses were all plain and boring. I brought it up because its nice to remember but she got irritated so I didn't go further. When we got home she asked me alone why I brought it up. I just said I thought it was funny how different she was 10 years later. She got angry and asked why I'm focusing on it when it doesn't even matter now. She accused me of being way too obsessed with who she used to be. I got upset and admitted I wished she was still a tomboy or at least a little like she was. She got madder and said it was always just a phase and I was an asshole to think otherwise. I got really upset because she never used that language with me before.

My husband recommended I post it here because I don't think I'm wrong for wishing she was like she was cause it's no different than telling your kids you wish they were still kids.",26.0

The outside can was kind of full but I was able to shuffle it around and make the kitchen trash fit. The kitchen trash was full to the brim and smelled terrible, and I would have had to take it out of the bin and tie the bag up and just leave it in the kitchen, which is gross, so I took it outside anyway.

Side note, I’M the one who cleans the kitchen and takes out the trash, because she does absolutely zero chores around the house except vacuum the mess her birds make.

Last night when hanging with some friends they wanted to order Dominos, so I offered to use my account, that way I could redeem my free pizza for myself and just order everything for them. We ended up getting my pizza, some Parmesan bites, and an 8 piece boneless chicken wings. I clarified MULTIPLE TIMES that the pizza was for myself, and if they wanted pizza, they should order it themselves. We split the cost for the Parmesan and the chicken, deciding that we would split those to eat. 

After everything arrived, my friend looks over at the pizza and says “hand me a piece,” at which point I said no, and then we got into a fight about whether or not he could have the pizza.

398,t3_rv68ar,AITA for refusing to add my fiancé’s brother’s GF to a subscription I pay for for an extra $1?,"Background: My fiancé and I own a house together and are raising two young children. For the past 2 years his adult (27M) brother has lived with us completely expense free (no rent, no utility payments, nothing). At first it was reasonable; he was a recent grad looking for work during a pandemic. But he’s now been fully employed for a year, and given that he’s had to pay nothing towards living costs during that time, should have plenty saved up and should be well equipped to step out on his own. This has become a sore spot for me because despite countless conversations with my fiancé, he hasn’t put his foot down to encourage his brother to move on and out of our home.

Recently the brother started dating someone new. She seems very nice and I have zero issue with her. But it does get under my skin that he’s essentially extended the free ride he’s been getting from us to her as well. Staying here whenever, having us pick up the bill if we’re all out for dinner, etc. 

A couple weeks ago brother asked my fiancé if I could share a link to add his GF to a subscription service I pay for. I said no. Brother had shared my credentials with a previous GF without my permission once before and I ended up having to spend hours changing my password on actual sensitive accounts (ie bank accts) as a result. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I’d rather just keep what I own and manage separate. My fiancé says I’m being petty and ridiculous bc the cost to add her would only be $1, but it’s not about the cost to me. It’s about the continuous pushing of my boundaries and utilization of my resources without the ability for me to say no without intense fights and guilt tripping. So AITA for saying no to something as small as $1 because I’m tired of this assumption that I’ll continue to carry the load for other fully functioning adults?

Update on previous Edit: Hi all. Just got a warning that my previous edit was way over character limit (whoops) so I’m getting rid of it and just popping in to say thank you to everyone for your input. The responses to my previous edit actually surprised me - I’d assumed giving more facts would help paint the picture of why my fiancé might truly be reasonable in his position. It was enlightening to me to see the responses indicate just the opposite. Our family unit truly does have so many positives - this specific situation is of course a frustrating one, but since it’s impossible to paint a full picture of a family in a small summary, I’ll just say that there’s a lot worth fighting for here, but I agree that there is also a lot to be addressed.

WIBTA if I recorded her and sent proof to it HTL?

UPDATE:

So I reported her gently to our HTL via text. (I changed all the identifying info). I don’t know how much it will help but it’s now on record.

Me: SX’s dad called. He’s going to drop her off at 3-ish.

HTL: Okay can we try to scrap the sidewalk as best as we can 

Me: I’ll ask Anna* (spelling ?) if she could help me with that.
AF is lying against me and has me semi-pinned lol

Would you please ask her as well? I don’t think she heard me

She’s on a personal call and too distracted (again)

HTL: Sorry just saw these! I’m so sorry 

Me: It's ok. I'm not too worried. (HTL responded after Anna* had already left for the day. She does 9-2 shifts and I’m 9-3).

HTL: U all good tho 

Me: Yes. Whomever is here for 2 is here.

400,t3_rv61gi,AITA for comparing my roommates’ girlfriend’s period pain to my boyfriend’s back and joint pain?,"I (20f) have been dating my boyfriend (John-23m) for 3 years but we’ve known each other for over 15. John has a number of illnesses but the worst is his chronic back pain as it severely limits what he can do physically. His birthday was yesterday and we planned to cook his favourite meal together, however his back said no and he was in pain and unable to move or stand for long periods of time. Instead, I cooked whilst he helped as much as he could. His backpain causes him migraines and major discomfort.

Then my roommate and her girlfriend (both 23f) came home. Roommates’ girlfriend (Sarah) asks what we’re doing and I reply ‘we’re making dinner together.’ Sarah looks me up and down and says ‘no, you’re making dinner. John is just sat there like a fat sack of shit. I can’t believe you dumped your girlfriend to be with him.’ For some context, my ex-girlfriend was incredibly toxic. 

I could tell John found that insulting by his body language, and I jumped in to defend him. I said 'John has chronic back and joint pain, Sarah. Next time you're complaining about your period pain, I expect you to come make me a full 3-course meal. If you can do that, then you can complain about John being lazy.' This wasn't the first time Sarah has made a comment about John being lazy or being 'overdramatic'.

Sarah looked super offended and stormed off. I got a text from her girlfriend a few hours later saying that it was super wrong to compare her period pain to her boyfriend's backpain and that as someone who gets period pain, I should know that's not a fair comparison.

401,t3_rv60dn,AITA for not asking about my husbands injured hand,"Now even I would said I’m the a$$hole from that title but hear me out. I’ve been having a rough time of things since New Years and to top it off my daughter kept me up till 4am so yesterday I was dead in the water I just needed a break. Her aunt was supposed to take her but couldn’t so I had a cranky toddler no food cause we had no running water and no means to get food. My husband had a day off yesterday but he spent it fixing the car which has been down for several weeks. 

Now he told me he injured his hand. I can’t remember exactly at what point he said it but it was either when he told me the mechanic who kept flaking on us wanted to finish early so the car wouldn’t be done yesterday or when I was trying to get our daughter to sleep after not sleeping well myself and not eating. 
Just now he says he has to see a doctor about the hand. He’s working in an ER I tell him well go have one of doctors check it out. The conversation continues about other things he was talking about mind you I’ve just woken up. He then says this “The engine block fell on my hand maybe if you gave a fuck about my hand”. I said I just told you to go see the ER doctor I can’t do anything from here and my knowledge of
Orthopedics is limited. And it’s not like I said I don’t care about your hand. He also gave me shit about not asking about it this morning when he left the baby crying in the bed in a dirty diaper so I had to wake up while he was in the bathroom to change her and put her back to sleep. 
I told him I thought he was being unfair. He got pissed and said he had to go back to work

402,t3_rv5r5v,AITA for not spending weekends with my parents?,"I am a 22 male, recently I got engaged to my fiancé 22 female. We have been dating since High-school and last year I proposed. We do not live together, I live with my parents while I go to school. She lives on her own in an apartment. My parents are traditional Hispanics and don’t let me stay the night which has been a huge battle between us. Since I am a broke college student I go to class and then go to work after so I don’t get to see my fiancé until weekends. My parents also give me a curfew (another battle between us)unless it’s school related since I do volunteer at events and clubs. My parents do pay for half of my college studies so I don’t complain and they don’t charge me rent which has allowed me to save up a good amount of money, avoid debt, and even by myself a new vehicle. The issue is on weekends I get off of work and go to my fiancé and don’t come back home until 10 pm Saturday and 9 pm on Sunday. This has been a problem for my parents because they claim I do not spend time with them. We get into big fights about it often. I do it because I live with them and they see me all week and they see me in the morning weekends and I don’t see my fiancé enough. I plan on moving out as soon as we get married though I am considering leaving now. The issue is the guilt I feel about doing so also in the last year my fiancé and parents have been friendly but it is becoming clear that they do not get along mostly because they are competing for my attention. It’s Christmas we decided to do a split day like we do every year but my mom said if she could not have the evening time with me then she would rather I do not come and spend the day with my fiancé instead. We did just that but it caused a huge fight at home. It’s hard to be in between them because I live my family but fiancé is my future. Am I the asshole?",17.0
403,t3_rv5r00,AITA for blowing up at my husband when he didn’t wake me up,"My husband and I are dual military. We’re in different units on different ends of post. My husband does not have a license but he is working on it. I usually take him to and from work except when we work different hours and his friends get him/ drop him off. We had a 5 day weekend and today is our first day back.

I told him last night that I wasn’t taking him to work at 6 am and to ask a friend because I wasn’t going into work until 9:30. I leave at 9:15 everyday unless I take him and leave 10 min earlier. His work time got changed in the middle of the night to just before me. I also told him that I planned on waking up a bit early so I could make breakfast and defrost my car (it snowed). My alarm was set to 7:45.

His formation changed in the middle of the night to around the same time as mine. I usually sleep about 2-3 hours a night because of insomnia so I was awake until 4. This is normal for me.

He turned off my alarm before it woke me up because he figured “I should sleep more”. He then got a ride at 8:40 and still left me sleeping. He said his plan was to wake me up at 9 (15 minutes before I leave) but got busy at work. So he called me at the time I literally leave for work to wake me up.

I woke up panicking because there was no way I could make it to work on time. I was raising my voice as I scrambled out of bed. I didn’t even insult him I asked him what the hell he was thinking and told him if I got in trouble at work it would be his fault. I hung up and he text me to say he was sorry but it was super insincere. He said he was sorry he’s a fuck up and he ruined my life. He said I’m right to be angry but apparently the phone call was on speaker and I’m an asshole for making him feel stupid in front of his coworkers. 

TL;DR: My husband turned off my alarm and left without waking me up. He called to wake me up at the time I literally leave for work. He called me an asshole for yelling at him while his phone was apparently on speaker at work.

404,t3_rv5laz,AITA for combining my Boyfriends Birthday and Christmas gift?,"So i'm a 28 year old woman and my boyfriend is 29, we've been dating for about a year now and his birthday came around the issue was....his birthday is on Christmas, this is an awkward thing as money is tight already having to buy my friends, family and him a Christmas gift (I know I don't *have* to do this but I want to and I don't do it for extended family because I have a huge family) but I decided to spend a bit more than I intended on him to make up for this. In the end I got him a brand new Xbox Series X as I knew how much he wanted one.

Honestly I thought i'd done good, consoles aren't the easiest to find right now especially on the run up to Christmas, i'm still trying to find a ps5 for myself but can't get hold of one. We exchanged gifts and he seemed confused as to why he only had one gift but he opened it and was happy with it then asked me if the other one just hadn't arrived right now (reasonable assumption if he thought there would be two as deliveries have been terrible and i'm currently waiting on like 5 deliveries) I explained it was a birthday/Christmas gift combined and that I thought he'd like the money i'd have used for both combined into a console I knew he wanted. 

I figured everything was  fine and he seemed happy enough, we set up the xbox and played some games then I headed home, I didn't hear from him for two days, whatever he was probably just too busy playing the new console so I shot off a text saying I hoped he was good and checking if we were still on for the New Years party at my friends. He didn't reply, finally worried I called him and managed to get hold of him and asked him if something was up, he admitted that he was upset i'd combined his two gifts and that as a person born at Christmas he always felt his birthday was overlooked and then i'd done the same thing....I was surprised by this as he'd seemed fine enough at the time or so i'd thought and i'd made it clear it was money i'd have used on two gifts. I explained this to him and he said he still felt like shit over it and I apologised for this but the call ended without us resolving it, I ended up going to the New Years party alone.

I honestly feel like shit over this, am I the asshole for not buying him two gifts? should I just bite the bullet and buy him another gift to try and make up for it?",2909.0
405,t3_rv5hyl,AITA for telling my (21F) stepdad (50s M) I already knew something he was explaining to me?,"For simplification's sake I'll refer to my mom's fiancé (50s M) as my stepdad throughout the post.

I (21F) have always been told that I am very blunt. I never mean to be rude or outwardly disrespectful, but there have been times that my simple answers to people's questions come off as dismissive because I do not smile or use a certain ""positive sounding"" tone of voice all the time when responding. While this has never been a problem with my friends or family, it seems to be a problem with my stepdad. Although he is not my favorite person, my mom adores him so I never ever ignore him and try to engage in conversation whenever I can.

However, this seemed to be an issue yesterday, when my mom, stepdad, sister and I went to eat out for dinner. While we were waiting for our food, my stepdad began to explain to me the benefits of not paying off a new car all at once to build credit as an adult (context: I am financing my first car soon with the help of my mom as a co-signer). I didn't see it as mansplaining, because it seemed like he was just trying to be helpful, but my mom and I had already had this discussion a few days prior and collaboratively decided to not pay off the car in full for the same reasons he explained. Once he was done, I said ""Oh I know, Mom's explained it all to me.""

This apparently came off as curt because I didn't smile while saying it (because I was wearing a mask at the table), and he spent the remaining time at dinner stabbing his food with a fork so much that my mom pointed it out. He and my mom also talked in semi-hushed voices about how rude I was, even though we were all sitting at the table together, so I could hear everything. I was talking to my sister at the time of their conversation, so I suppose he thought I couldn't hear him. At one point he replied with ""And I explained it to your mom"", which does not surprise me because he seems to know more about cars than either my mom or I.

I asked my mom about it a bit later and she said while she knew I wasn't being rude, it seemed that way to him. In her opinion, next time this occurs I should say ""Ok, thank you"" and move on with the conversation, but that seems even more of a dismissive/""grey rocking"" kind of response to me.

406,t3_rv5h0j,AITA For Refusing to Let My In-Laws Stay at Our House When They Visit?,"So my husband and I are overweight, and we each have struggled with our weight our entire lives. We both haven’t always been overweight but we love each other no matter what and support each other through our struggles. And when I say we’re overweight, I don’t mean like 300+ pounds or anything like that, I mean like, we could probably both lose some pounds and be perfectly healthy. 

Well low and behold, a month after our most current band of “I’m trying to lose the weight” I find out I’m pregnant. I’m currently 5 months along and luckily haven’t really gained any additional weight, which is what I have always been concerned about if I do get pregnant. I actually lost 15 pounds in my first trimester because of morning sickness and I’ve maintained that weight since.

My husband's parents hate the fact that we’re overweight and try to drop little hints that they want us to lose weight every time they talk to my husband or see him. My husband hadn’t seen his parents for over 2 years and when they flew in for our wedding, the first thing my FIL said to him was “you’re so fat, it makes me want to get back on a plane and go home.” My husband is literally 6’2” and is just a built guy. Like imagine a fit bouncer at a nightclub type build. He is just a little soft around the tummy now, but still he looks pretty good as my biased self would say. I’ve polled my family members asking if they think he’s fat and they’re like “no, he looks like he could kick anyone’s ass” and give me a weird look.

Well anyway, like I said, I’m 5 months pregnant, and my husband was talking to my MIL last night and she mentioned that as soon as the baby is born, we should start “working out and eating healthy.” Like she meant immediately the day after I gave birth I should get on the treadmill. They assume that just because I am overweight that I don’t eat healthy and don’t workout. I do do those things, but I’m just not in a caloric deficit. I’ve plateaued for the past 2 years. And don’t get me wrong, my plan is to lose weight once I give birth, but I don’t need my in-laws to be in my business and make my weight a topic of discussion.

So anyway I got in an argument with my husband because they’re coming to stay with us 3 months after the baby is born for 2 weeks, and I don’t need them to make comments about my weight while they’re here. I’m expecting my birth to end in a c section so if that happens I will have some serious restrictions and probably won’t be able to workout at all for a while. Not to mention, I’ll have a newborn and probably have PP depression. I told my husband that if they comment on my weight (or his frankly), I’m going to tell them off and ask them to leave. In my opinion, you don’t go into someone’s home and discuss their weight. My weight is between me and my doctor, not me and my in-laws. 

Anyway, hubby got mad and said I was an AH because he hasn’t seen his parents since 2019 and it would be a very dramatic thing if I told them off while they were here.",425.0
407,t3_rv5acc,WIBTA if I blocked my aunt over email?,"my aunt never learned to ride a bike. My dad promised to teach her using my bike. we found that she was too short for it, so we decided to get a Citi bike for her and they have them in an area 30 mins away from home.

The plan was to drop someone off first and then take my aunt to use the citi bike. after the drop off, it was around 5:30 but by then it was dark! I told my dad it was too dark to go bike. He didn’t listen. I was tempted to get out of the car when we got closer to home and he wasn’t moving bc I’m not crazy or stupid enough to get out of a moving car. I was really hoping he would just go home but he still went.

i called my mom bc I thought she could convince him to come home and she fully agreed with me but couldn’t convince him. I think she overreacted bc she made it sound like he was hurting our family emotionally by not listening to me. there is a recurring theme of him not listening to me, but I felt she went out of bounds by saying he’s hurting this family--she literally said hes derogating me. I felt terrible bc I unleashed such a strong reaction from her and she made it so much worse even though I felt she was in the right place.

my aunt was pissed and blamed me. She kept telling me I started it and that she wanted to leave our apartment (she was staying with us on a visit). I had to hang up on my mom bc she was getting so bad over the phone. i texted her to continue the convo and told her my aunt blamed me. Unfortunately this made my mom even more upset and called my dad's cell this time. my aunt knew i was texting my mom, so when we got home, she immediately came to my seat in the car, opened the door, and started to confront me about me texting my mother.

My mom made us all sit down to talk about this. I left in the middle bc it got really uncomfortable. it seemed like the right call bc later I heard the convo take a much more serious turn and wasn't about the bike anymore.

my aunt left and went to visit other family. However, I was still miffed about how my aunt reacted so before new years I messaged her and told her while I was sorry for my moms overreaction, i couldnt get over how she blamed me, how riding a bike in the dark is unsafe especially when you don't even know how to ride one and how i was disappointed she didn't realize this.

her response was:

""Thank you . You are very kind an considerate, thank you for explaining. Happy new year . Lots of love""

based on that, she seemed like she just wanted to end the convo. so i did.

however, i see that my parents are in contact with her, cc me, and sign my name with theirs. i want to drop a hint that i want to stay away from her. i'd ask my dad to stop cc'ing me and stop signing my name, but ik he wouldn't agree to that. WIBTA if i just blocked her email?

I think i might be TA bc it would be extremely petty and overboard, but i also want to send a signal to her.

there are other things im happy to elaborate on if asked bc it's not just the bike that makes me want to stay away from her.",2.0

Every year, my parents host a big Christmas gathering. I’m never invited, but my sister and niece always go. A day or two after that, we do a smaller Christmas with just me, my sister, and my niece. 

At our smaller Christmas gathering, while my sister was in the other room, my niece asked why I never go to my parents’ Christmas. I replied with the excuse I’ve used for years: I had to work. My niece said that my excuse didn’t make sense because sometimes the big gathering  happened on Christmas, when I definitely have the day off. She was getting upset and asked “do you not like to be with us?”

If she hadn’t said that, I probably wouldn’t have told her. But I can’t stand the idea that she would think I chose not to go to the Christmas. So, in a calm voice, I said “well, you know how I date boys instead of girls? Grandma and Grandpa don’t like that, so they ask me not to go to Christmas.”

My niece was obviously upset by this. The next day, she called her grandparents and asked how dare they tell me not to come to Christmas. Apparently she was really harsh with them. Then, my parents called my sister and yelled at her for letting my niece around me.

Ok this sounds bad, but read first.
My gf(18y) recently took a night shift in McDonalds, I(20y) tried to convince her for afternoon shift so she won't destroy her sleep scedule but she just hated interaction with too much people so I understand where it comes from. 
Well she works 3-5 days a week and we live in relativley peacfull place, but the bus stop she takes to work is 20 min away from where we live and she works 30 min bus drive always, so she has to account the commute. Every time she takes a bus i go with her, make sure she gets there safe and even prepare her full meals so she has to eat something nutriional and none of the McDonald sandwitches. But tooday i kinda had to say no. 
You see i am very busy, i also work, remote in that matter yes but it's still 8h daily 5 days a week on survailed Computer provided by my work on a clean desk Policy(which they verify a lot), this is invation of my privacy yes but the job is super easy and i get paid very handsomely, while also getting ready for my collage that i start in a week(also remote) and spending a lot of time with my Gf, but in 2-3 days a week i play with my guild in one of the more poppular Mmo's and we have a blast, this is like one of those Me Times that i don't have to sacrifice my sleep for when i have Rough day. 
But since i am starting Collage soon, and more and more responsibilities pile Up i cannot Raid with the boys on regular anymore, so they wanna make toodays raid special as a Final goodbye, Especially that i have been an essential part of the team (one of the main tanks) and finish one of the instances we've been grinding for a long time. So i can say i finish it before inevitibly server resetes.
 But my gf has a problem with that stating that i choose video game over her and they can just move it (they can't due to other people having plans) or not making Goodbye raid at all. I told her that we live in very safe place we know everyone here, and bus stop is not that far, also that she didn't had trouble going alone when i was sick. But that didn't went through and she said that is just stupid to not go with her over a stupid video game. So i just went into my room now kinda venting my frustration and deciding what to do next.

412,t3_rv4kps,AITA for asking my housemates (a couple) to agree to end our tenancy agreement and move on?," Hi,

I had housemates move in, in September. I didn't know them at all but they seemed cool and I had a good feeling about it. I chose them over multiple options and moved into the box room so they could have the en suite.

When they moved in, everything wasn't clean enough due to me and last housemate not sorting it properly. On top of this, although he’s treated monthly, the dog got fleas that same week. I replaced the carpets, had the house treat for fleas and hired deep cleaners. 

An initial bigger fallout happened because they demanded the dog is never to be allowed to go on their sofa. This initially annoyed me, because rules like that weren’t brought up on viewing and I would have chose someone more suitable. My last housemate loved the dog! Again, I wanted to move on and it's my responsibility to take care of their belongings/solve flea issues so I bought a thick, huge throw for their sofa incase and I now don't let the dog on their sofa.

However, in that period of falling out about the sofa. I had doors slammed in my face and I was point blank ignored for almost a week. I have a bad history of conflict in my upbringing and this is a trigger - I was having panic attacks, feeling worthless and hated which had a knock on effect on my work and happiness.

In October, I talked to them about ending the fixed term contract early as our landlord advised it’s our only option to move out (current contract ends Sept 2022). We need to all agree a date and I said we are non compatible as housemates and it's best for all of us to part ways. They agreed and said they would think about a reasonable date to move out that suits their uni deadlines. 

I told them the hostility, specifically banging is a massive trigger for me because of my past and asked if they could avoid dealing with any issues like this.

In December, I gave them a polite nudge on the date to move out and the exact same passive aggressions came up. I was told I was putting them under stress and I ""should think about what I'm putting them through"". I had the worst panic attack I'd ever had, struggling to breathe for what felt like eternity. That same week, they called me an a\*\*\*hole through the wall whilst they fought and argued in their bedroom at midnight.

December was exhausting. Whilst I have my own demons and should be able to handle conflict better, I'm now at the point of struggling to even go through my own front door. A little worryingly (though at least I see it?), I've been drinking on my own to kill time before I have to go home... That's how bad it is.

They're delaying a decision on the contract still but I've asked them if we can talk again and I'm going to explain that this needs to be sorted there and then, as they've ignored my request to not make the house hostile and have been vocal in their hatred for me.

**So, AITA** for putting the pressure on this being sorted, as they're implying?",35.0

On NYE, 2 friends of mine from different cliques attended a party that I was not present for, Let’s call them Amy and Betty. After the party was over, Amy, a friend that I had known for quite some time but was not super close to, told me that Betty had been talking about me to her and other guests at the party and had given off the vibe that I was super weird and unpleasant to be around. This was alarming to me because Betty and I have been close friends for almost 4 years now and she has always been the nicest person and I’ve never heard her speak ill about people. 

Anyways Amy then asked me not to confront Betty about it because she had recently began spending time with the group on NYE and did not want to get outcasted from the group for exposing the things they said. Amy is also a kind person and though I haven’t interacted with her as much as Betty I have no reason to believe that she’d lie about something like this.

It was really eating away at me that Betty would say this so I figured that I should give Betty the opportunity to defend herself because I do believe her to be one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. Betty of course denied everything and gave me her version of the night and the conversations that took place, and as expected, The group is mad at Amy for telling me these things and so Amy is mad at me for confronting Betty.

I still don’t know whose lying and whose telling the truth and I honestly don’t care anymore, I just want to know, Am I the ass hole for confronting this? Or would it have show greater maturity to just let it be.

414,t3_rv4g37,AITA for saying I can't attend my cousin's wedding unless I can bring my son?,"I know there are a million ""should kids be allowed at weddings??"" posts and I am generally on the side of not having children at weddings, even when I have one of my own. The few I have attended since he was born 4 years ago, I get a babysitter. However, my cousin, who I am very close to, is having a small destination wedding in Punta Cana in a year and a half.

It's sort of being seen as a wedding/vacation for the family event. However, we ran into a snag when I called my cousin for a detail of the resort we would be staying at and mentioned still needing to get passports for my husband and son. She seemed surprised I planned on bringing my son because it was supposed to be a child free wedding ceremony. I told her ""Of course I will be bringing my son, we are there for your wedding but it's also a vacation for us."" (I only have 10 days of vacation time at my job and this trip would be taking up 8 of them). She told me that she imagined this trip as more of an ""adult romantic getaway"" for everyone and that the other member of our family going that has kids (9 and 13) is going to let them stay at their neighbors house for the week.

I told her that I wasn't comfortable leaving my (would be) almost 6 year old home with someone for an entire week and in addition to that, I would prefer my son being with us on what would probably be the only vacation I would get that year. We argued a little and she told me that she really wanted me there and suggested us getting a babysitter while we are down there for the ceremony. I wasn't trying to be difficult but I dismissed that idea right away, imagining the chances of finding someone trustworthy while at a resort in a different country to watch my son would be slim. She got even more upset and said that she 100% didn't want kids at her wedding. I told her I would try and think of a solution and we ended the call. I talked to my husband and we decided that we just shouldn't attend the wedding. I didn't like it but we didn't see another option. I informed my cousin and she got very upset, saying that she couldn't imagine the day without me there and it shouldn't be a big deal to be away from my son for a week.

I feel like a jerk because I understand her view but I am standing my ground here.

EDIT: I wasn't aware she intended it to be child free. When in conversations where it was discussed, it was referred to as a vacation for the family as well as her wedding. However, I now know she meant a vacation for the adults only. We don't have a lot of small kids in the family overall so it might have been implied, but it wasn't clear to me at the time. The phone call was when I finally understood. ",1160.0
415,t3_rv4cq3,AITA for sticking up for my fiancé to his mom,"There is literally so much backstory I’m not sure if i could remember/add all of it. 

I (20F) texted my FMIL (62f) saying to not worry about the $40 she borrowed us to supply groceries to my Fiancé’s (23M) brothers (13&amp;14M) while they stayed with my fiancé for 4 days. 

I stayed at my parents for the holidays between christmas and new years bc my dad has always thrown a family party for new years. my fiancé had to work during that week so instead of making two trips down, almost 3 hours round trip, i decided to stay while he went back home to work. 

there’s a messy family dynamic on my fiancés side, so i’m not going to explain it all. basically my fiancé was adopted by his grandma (she will be referred to as his mom) his 2 brothers were in the foster system but very luckily they were adopted by the first family they went to. They visit almost every other weekend and almost all school breaks. 

I didn’t think it was the best idea to bring his brothers to our small 1 bedroom apartment, considering i’m not working and in school full time and my fiancé works 4 10 hour shifts. We often live paycheck to paycheck but we aren’t struggling for food by any means. 

I went to the grocery store before I left for the week and my fiancés mom had given us $40 (she said she was going to give us more but didn’t) to get some extra things for them. I’m all okay for them helping themselves with an exception or two of something that i solely buy for myself. 

I got home yesterday to find that our house was completely emptied out. We don’t even have any milk to make 5 minute noodles. Our budget is extremely tight bc of christmas. I don’t think we have the money to grocery shop for the next 2 weeks. Basically they had plenty to eat and ate every bit of it. 

Over the weekend she got mad at my fiancé because he didn’t get them fast food or take out. They decided to use their own money to get themselves a pizza delivered one day and that really irked his mom that the boys used their own money. She assumed that we didn’t feed them at all and asked for the $40 dollars back. 

We currently have no extra money. We barely have any money to restock our kitchen to eat for the next two weeks. So i shot her a text this morning saying, “just so you know, that $40 was spent on the boys and more bc they ate everything in our kitchen lol” I genuinely wasn’t trying to be rude and i added the lol to lighten it up and try to make it not come off as rude. don’t get me wrong i’m a little mad that they ate literally everything we own and i feel that $100 i spent before i left was a waste. she responded to my text cussing and saying i had a “stick up my ass“. This threw me off bc she almost never swears and acted like i was being the biggest bitch in the world. So i just told her I was letting her know that they had plenty to eat bc she was yelling at my fiancé all weekend over it. His mom and I have had a couple of issues (that is too much to talk about) but we’re generally on good terms and have had no issues lately.",5.0
416,t3_rv485f,WIBTA if I tell my husband he should stay on the couch?,"My husband snores like a freight train, usually only when on his back. (No we're not going to see a sleep specialist or get a cpap machine). I can usually deal with it fine, giving him a nudge if it wakes me up or is keeping me awake to ask him to roll to a side or stomach. Sometimes he'll do it, sometimes it requires a few nudges. I can't wear earplugs as our son sometimes still wakes up at night, so I need to be able to hear the baby monitor, as my husband can sleep through just about anything and doesn't usually wake up unless he's wailing.

Being over 23 weeks pregnant, unable to find a comfortable sleep position, and pregnancy insomnia means I'm even more of a light sleeper than usual. Nighttime is usually when baby is deciding to do gymnastics, so it's extra hard to fall/stay asleep. I also have to sleep with a fan on, something he doesn't need. 

My husband has a habit of falling asleep on his chair/the couch watching TV or playing Xbox and then coming to bed in the middle of the night. It sometimes wakes me, but usually the snoring does, and then I have trouble going back to sleep. Lately he seems extra irritated if I try to nudge him to roll over.

He got mad last night and told me if his snoring annoyed me that much I should go sleep on the couch and let him stay in bed. I said that wasn't fair as I was asleep already, need a body pillow for belly support, the fan, and am the only one who wakes up to the monitor. So why should I unplug and bring everything to move out to the living room and squeeze onto a couch, when he could literally just stay there? He said since the snoring woke me up I was already awake so it was rude to wake him up and make him leave. I'm a SAHM and he's the income earner, and am able to rest sometimes during the day. We do have a guest bed downstairs where he is, he just doesn't like sleeping in it, and I won't because it's even farther to our sons room. We both think we're right, not mad at each other, and just annoyed at the situation. Yes he's always been a snorer, it just seems worse to me when I'm pregnant.

ETA: It's not me that doesn't want him to see a sleep specialist. He doesn't like going to the doctor for anything, let alone a problem he thinks is little like snoring. I've been saying for 6 years he should get it checked out, but he always shrugs it off. I didn't want this thread to get derailed by the argument of going to the doctor, which is happening anyways.",11.0
417,t3_rv45de,AITA for telling my parents that I am glad that I didn't invite them to my birthday dinner?,"My birthday is in October, My wife hosted a small dinner for my birthday. It was a small thing and she invited my best friend and her parents. She said she didn't want to invite them and I understand. My parents are very loud and intense people. They are extroverts and they love to be the life of the party. I am a quiet person and they would have made me uncomfortable. 

I have at least 5 memories of my parents throwing me surprise birthday parties with all their friends when all I wanted was quiet dinner with my parents. I have social anxiety and they tried to cure me by making me take part in the parties they used to throw when I was a teenager. I remember the time when my dad's boss hit on me and they laughed it off. 

If I had been hosting the party I would have invited them but because my wife was hosting it I decided that it was up to her if she wanted to invite them. I like her parents and I have gotten closer to them over the years so I was glad they were invited. We had a great time and I posted about it on my Instagram. 

My parents were upset and they made a huge deal about it. They accused my wife of controlling me and It was a difficult situation. They didn't invite me to their anniversary which was in late November.  They called me after the party to make up with me and I told them that I was still glad that I didn't invite them and I was happy I missed their party. They think I am being controlled by my wife and I told them that I didn't care if she is controlling me and I told them to stay away from me. 

I feel bad because my sister said our parents are heartbroken and they are very upset that I haven't apologized. I have been harsh with them and I know that I should try to sort out and communicate but I just don't have it in me to try anymore and I should try, they are my parents.",454.0

419,t3_rv41w8,AITA for saying that if MIL makes one more comment about the engagement or ring she will not be invited to the wedding?,"I got engaged two months ago and i was thrilled. Our relationship is super strong, and I'd say our only real problem is that his mom is a nightmare, but he is in agreement about putting me first and enforcing boundaries.

The first time I saw her after the engagement she took my hand and held my ring up against hers and just smiled at me (hers is considerably bigger) She told me it was cute for a starter ring and said she was sorry she threw her first engagement ring into the ocean or she could have passed it down to me. I replied that I am superstitious and wouldn't wear a ring from a failed marriage and MIL said well anything would be bigger than that.

A week later at her anniversary her husband gave her some jewelry and she held it up against my ring, moved it to make it sparkle and giggled. My fiancé had a talk with her and let her know to knock it off. She then asked if i was disappointed with my proposal because we were just on the couch. to be honest I was and it was embarrassing because I felt she could sense it. I said the proposal doesn't matter and she said she feels like that is just something society wants women to believe so they have low standards.

The last straw was when she told my proposal story to her stepdaughter who made a face, and than MIL said maybe I don't mind boring because I am an accountant. I snapped at her that if she made one more comment she would not be invited to the wedding. MIL said that is fine and she thinks she might be out of the country anyway if we go with the date we thought we would (umm why didn't she tell us that originally?)

MILs husband (enabler from hell) said she is just acting like this because she is mad that I got engaged the day before her birthday and showed up to her huge (think luxury wedding size) party wearing my ring. I didn't even think of it but that makes sense because MIL's best friend ""accidently"" ruined my outfit and I had to leave. MIL's husband said I should apologize to her. My first thought was hell no, but other family members said she was just getting even and I should drop it.",2377.0
420,t3_rv400r,AITA: Assuming staggered registers at Target are independent queues?,"Background: Target checkout lines (at least at my local store) have staggered registers where there is one in front of the other one, making the whole checkout area kind of like a 2 x 5 grid (i.e. 10 total registers). There is ample spacing between the ""front"" and ""back"" registers to freely walk between, push carts, etc.

My wife and I were checking out last week and chose one of the ""front"" registers as it had the least amount of people at it (just one customer ahead of us). While we were placing all of our items onto the belt, a man walked up to us and said, ""oh you're just going to jump the line like that?"". My wife and I were not even sure at first what he was saying, but he carried on accusing us of skipping ahead of him since he was in line at the ""back"" register behind us.

What made this scene worse, is that he was there with his two kids causing a scene. My wife and I did our best to deescalate the situation by offering him to go ahead of us. He said ""well it's too late for that now, isn't it?"". He was super irritated and we both just told him Happy New Year (again, being polite and nonconfrontational as possible). He went back to his place in line and was helped by the cashier at the ""back"" register. The whole time his two kids look horrified and embarrassed at the whole situation.

Our cashier softly said to us, ""you should see what I have to deal with every day. You guys are good, don't worry about it, you did nothing wrong."" I really sympathize with retail workers and what they have to deal with. That being said...

421,t3_rv3ydj,AITA for publicly shaming the family who abandoned their cat?,"I live in an apartment that doesn't allow pets. Most of my neighbors own their homes. The house next door had this really friendly cat. 

Last week, the cat came up to me, he had patchy fur and looked like skin and bones

I thought maybe he'd been lost and was just finding his way back home and I went to the house and rang the bell but nobody answered. I brought him into my own apartment and planned to take him to the vet. 

I found both parents on Facebook from the name on the microchip. I DMed them both saying I'd found their lost cat but nobody replied, I assumed they just don't check Facebook a lot. 

I rang their bell every day until one day a different lady answered saying the last owners sold the house. I was worried, maybe they moved and couldn't find their cat anywhere? If i had to move and my pet went missing before the move, I'd be devistated. 

I thought another neighbor might have their phone number or new address, so I asked on the community Facebook page, attaching their profile screenshots and cats photo. 

Someone said the family moved just a mile away.

Someone else put their names with the @ so they were notified on the post. 

And I got a weird message from the man saying ""i didn't give you permission to post me on a public page, remove this by the law"" 

I sent several messages like ""is that your cat"" and got a reply telling me to fuck off.

I screenshot the message and posted it on the public post being like ""is this a prank, is this actually the guy who used to live here?""

I was so sure it was some joke, the wrong guy, since I couldn't imagine someone finding their lost pet and reacting like that. 

A few other neighbors replied confirming that was the guy. 

I replied to say ""Shameful... Kitty got fleas and was hungry, I'm treating the fleas but I really can't keep him. Anyone able to take him in? He was a mostly indoor cat and I'm worried he won't make it through the winter outside"" 

One of the other neighbors said they could take him in, if the flea problem was dealt with, so I agreed to treat his fleas. 

I was then getting kinda mad at the guy who abandoned the cat and asked on the public page ""@FatherName @MotherName Your cat got fleas and is way too skinny cause y'all put him out. I'm out a lot of money. Y'all really almost killed him abandoning him in the cold. Least you could do is cover the cost to bring him back to health.""

I got another unhinged private message from the dad, mad at me for being a renter coming into a long standing community and starting shit among community members who'd been around longer then I'd been alive and would be around after I was moved out in a year. 

This might be real petty but I posted it in the comments of the public post too saying ""shameful reaction... Yikes"" 

I feel like I might have been an asshole for publicly shaming the family but I also think I started by trying to genuinely help and was just met with crazy shit.

422,t3_rv3p03,AITA for telling my family they always give me terrible Christmas gifts?,"This happened New Year's Eve and I expected it to blow over by now but people are still upset so here goes nothing. 

For the past five years my entire immediate family has only given me gag (joke) gifts for Christmas. I am the only one who receives joke gifts like this.

It all started 5 years ago (2017) when my family had a running joke that I looked like the monkey from Planet of the Apes. It was honestly funny and I didn't mind the teasing. That Christmas, literally everyone in my immediate family (mom, step dad, bro, 2 sisters, and step bro) got me a monkey themed gift. I was a little disappointed to get same-y gifts but didn't think twice about it. 

The next year (2018), my family teased me for being chubby and eating Twinkies (just part of the joke). That year, everyone gave me Twinkie gear, and I got a repeat monkey gift. The following year (2019), I got a mix of Twinkie and monkey gifts. After 2019, I commented to my mom I was a little tired of gag gifts and she said I'm just hard to shop for, so the next two years I politely sent my family a diverse list of gift ideas for me (including a range of prices and links to some specific items).

Last year (2020), there was a running joke about me being the only single child. That year, everyone (now including spouses) gave me gifts like a book on how to date, a Tinder premium subscription (I don't use Tinder), and an empty greeting card about being a bachelor. 

Finally, this year (2021), there was a joke about me being a closeted sex maniac (long story but not relevant, sorry). This year, I got multiple pairs of women's lingerie (I am a man and still single), multiple dildos, and a few other sex-related items I have no use for. And another monkey gift.

New Year's Eve, I was with my family talking about Christmas gifts. I made a passive-aggressive comment and my family got annoyed, which led to me yelling about how I'm sick of getting stupid joke gifts for Christmas and that I'm the only one no one bothers to be considerate of. Things got heated and I ended up leaving the party early.

For comparison, the rest of my family gave each other things like gift cards, video games, nice clothes, and so on. This is also true for the previous years (as far as I recall).

To be clear, I'm not complaining about the teasing. My family always teases each other in good humor and it's normal for us. I'm not the only one being teased, I just feel singled out every Christmas. I know it was wrong to lose my temper but my family says I just can't take a joke and the gifts are coming out of their kindness so I have no right to be mad. They also say I'm childish and entitled for being mad I didn't get exactly what I asked for. I agree I didn't handle things very maturely, but I think my frustration was valid, especially since it has been building for 5 years now. So, AITA?

TL;DR I'm the only one in my family to receive joke gifts for five years in a row and I yelled at my family for giving me terrible gifts.

Edit: Wow, this got way bigger than I thought. I've been doing school stuff all afternoon so I'm way behind but I'll try to address a couple things. First, shoutout to u/princesshashbrown for breaking down my role as the family funny guy. They put it better than I ever could so look for that below if you can, it really adds a new dimension to this.
Second, I spoke with my mom today and she feels really bad. According to her, the family talked after I left. My sisters and step bro feel bad but my step dad and brother still think I'm TAH but I'll talk to them about it when I can. As some guessed in the comments, my mom and sisters thought I didn't mind the gifts because I didn't directly say anything sooner, which is on me. They think I was wrong to yell and I agree. They promise to do better next year. However, thanks to many excellent suggestions, I'm hatching a good-natured revenge plot for next year. Now that you know my family was (mostly) just oblivious feel free to reevaluate your verdict or not as you see fit.
Finally, I said it a million times in the comments but thanks for your support. I would have been fine with an AH vote, but was worried about being harassed. Every interaction I've had so far has been great.

I have tried to help her find an apartment, have borrowed her money nonstop, and occasionally will let her stay the night by us. She refuses to get a job and will not live in a apartment. 
I have to keep the lights off in my apartment because she is constantly showing up without asking if anyone is home and invites herself in for hours or days in hand without asking if she can stay. When she is here she leaves all the lights on, leaves the tv running, eats anything I have in my fridge, turns my cats water fountain off (so she is unable to drink water) all while I’m sleeping. I wake up to my apartment a mess. 
She has a place to stay out of town but will come back to town without a plan and just assumes that she can stay with me, without asking. 
At this point I’m tired of having to be my moms mom. I just want some respect from her but she can’t even do that for me. When she stays over I literally am banished to my room. She takes over the entire living room. She sits here an acts like she is sick, I cannot afford to be out of work right now and neither can my fiancé, she doesn’t.

424,t3_rv3fyw,AITA for telling my friend to stop saying offensive words.,"Me and a group of friends are in a fantasy football league together and we have a group text chat for us all to talk about the league or just to keep in touch. All of us are at least pretty familiar with each other since this league has been going on for the past 4 years but we have a couple of players every year who choose not to play again so new people can be added.

This year a long-time friend of mine introduced us to his friend who wanted to join our league and we had a slot to fill so we let him join. We have gotten to know him better in the past year and as we've gone along this person has started to use more language that has gotten more socially unacceptable in the past years especially words like r\*\*ard and f\*\*\*\*t. This new league member has really amped up some of the guys in our league including my long-time friend to talk like it's a 2010 video game lobby, and it's become bothersome to several league members (and myself) who are uncomfortable with how pervasive it been.

It got to the point that one of our league members felt the need to speak up and ask the others to please stop, and this group of guys specifically targeted her and said these words more and more towards her and she's really upset with them to the point she removed them from the group chat for about half of the day.

Now the group of guys is really pissed about having been removed and they're saying they shouldn't feel like they should be told what to say or do, and dont want to have to censor themselves around friends because they ""don't really mean what they say, they're just shit-talking"". I don’t really think my best friend means these things but it still does bother me that their response to someone speaking up was to double down. 

My friend has asked me if I could back him up, but to me, it's a very clear-cut situation where he is in the wrong. Whatever the word may or may not be, the issue to me is that someone was bothered enough to speak up about being uncomfortable with something and the response was basically bullying that league member because they asked them not to say the word r\*\*ard. Our league isn't censored on 99% of things, we curse, we talk about sex, drugs, and politics. We're fairly unbiased when it comes to topics, really if you want to talk about something in the chat there's nothing we won't talk about, but we generally do so in a respectful way.

My friend thinks I'm being an asshole for making them feel like they have to tiptoe around what they can or can't say, and that by asking them to stop it’s like the Streisand affect it’s only going to be brought up more. they say their viewpoint is being attacked but I just think it's respectful to not make another league member feel unwelcomed for the sake of easily avoidable language.

425,t3_rv39sh,AITA for arguing with my ill father for not putting the heating on in the house?,"So my dad has a numerous amount of health issues and for that he is on a lot of medication. One of the tablets he has affects his temperature and ability to feel warmth. Because of this, he is nearly always wrapped up in a blanket and sometimes even wears a coat in the house. 

I live here and I keep myself in my room where I also have my own heater to keep warm. He comes in my room sometimes for the warmth and it helps him feel comfortable. 

My issue is he has always been cautious about cost and expense and therefore has always been conservative when it comes to warmth in the house. 

Today I saw him shivering in a blanket and I snapped a little. He wouldn’t reply when I asked him why he won’t put the heating higher. He just simply said it’s “sufficient”. 

But it clearly isn’t. 

I care about him and his health so much but I hate the fact he won’t put the heating up to help him feel a little more comfortable. 

I snapped at him this morning explaining why I care and the argument got a little heated after I compared him to my mother who also doesn’t listen to reason. 

I asked him to come to a compromise with me in that he should put the heating on higher in a morning so he will benefit from the warmth. 

He refused to compromise and said I was being too controlling and he refuses to listen. 

I got passionate admittedly but I made it clear and explained that I care about his health and want him to be as comfortable as possible.

426,t3_rv39h5,AITA for going alone?,"So I (29FtM) got offered a ticket to a football game with an old friend. The stadium is 5 hours away from home and I plan to spend the night at my friends house then go to the game from there. My friend was the one that bought the tickets. Now due to our custody agreement I had to inform my ex (29M) that I would not be in town for 2 days in case of emergency. He of course asked where I’m going and why. I told him that I was going to the game and that I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity when I had gotten the time off work approved and this trip falls on the days that he is supposed to have his parenting time, court order states he gets them at 5 pm the night before I leave. As soon as I told him he got a serious attitude and starts asking why I didn’t invite him and leave his new girlfriend to watch the kids. We were together 7 years and during that time he was never really into football. He would occasionally watch if the Patriots were playing because he is a huge Tom Brady fan but he doesn’t necessarily like a specific team or even watch any of the games outside of the Super Bowl. Now he’ll watch if the Bucs are playing to cheer for Brady but that’s about it. The game I’m going to is Buffalo vs Jets. Also he hates being in the car and would spend the entire trip being mad because of the long drive and not having his Xbox with him to game with his friends. He says I’m a selfish asshole for not inviting him because he would’ve tagged along just for the experience and he feels like I’m avoiding spending time with him because I don’t invite him to do anything with me unless it involves the kids. Even then I only invite him if the kids want me to. I really don’t want to pay for a ticket for him so he can be miserable the whole time during a game that is a big deal for me to see live and he doesn’t actually care about. I also don’t want to spend 5 hours arguing with him because the moment we get in the car he’s going to find something to be mad about. He also tried to guilt trip me with the fact that when we were together (we split almost 3 years ago) he said every year that when the Bills had a winning season he would take me to see a game live so now I owe him the chance to go because we split before he got the chance to take me and it’s not fair that I’m just dumping the kids and leaving town for a game I could watch on TV. My friend managed to score us tickets right on the 50 yard line 13 rows up behind the bills benches. This is like a dream come true for me to have seats that good at the game that Buffalo is playing to win the AFC East. He on the other hand just says it would be cool to experience being in the crowd and I should pay for a ticket and let him ride with me because he has never been to a professional sporting event.

427,t3_rv30r0,AITA for still wanting my boyfriend to drive me home,"My boyfriend lives 21 miles from me and it’s a 45 minute drive each way. He drives, I’ve not passed yet. I was at his house for his big extended family get together when he suggested to his step- brother, someone I’ve only met twice in passing, that he only lives 20 minutes away from mine, and asked him to take me home with him the day after the gathering. 

I understand the logic behind him asking, however I explained I didn’t feel comfortable to a) make small talk with his brother that I haven’t ever had more than a 2 minute conversation with for a 45 minute car journey alone, and b) explained I didn’t want his step brother to feel pressured to go out of his way to mine on his way home, as I get the feeling he had to say yes out of politeness either way. I suggested if my boyfriend didn’t feel like the drive, I would arrange for one of my family members to pick me up. He said if I was going to make a family member pick me up, he’d have to just take me because he doesn’t want to look like the bad guy not dropping me back off. 

In the end, my boyfriend and I had a silent drive dropping me off. In his point of view I’m just being difficult and unreasonable and he felt forced to drive me home when there was “a lift waiting”, but in my point of view I accepted that he didn’t want to drive me home and planned to make alternative arrangements for myself- it was him who didn’t want me to ask my family member.

428,t3_rv2y86,AITA for coming out to my Nan through a letter?,"I don't think I'm TA here, but pretty much my whole family seems to think I am. Apologies for the wall of text.

I'm transgender, and my entire family except for my Nan knew up until Christmas and were all extremely supportive. My Nan however, is very opinionated. Not ""kick you out of the house call a priest"" level transphobe, but the kind to never leave you alone and be all ""tHoSe DaMn tRaNsGeNdErS cHaNgiNg oUr LaNgUaGe iTs uNfAiR tO uS oLd PeOpLe"". 

However, I wanted my family to all know so no one would get confused, so I put a letter in my Nan's present. I found her something I knew she'd really like and would really appreciate and wrote something along the lines of ""Merry Christmas blah blah blah I want you to know something you may have already picked up on: I'm a boy \*insert when I started feeling like this and how this is what makes me happy and blah blah blah I don't really want to hear your opinions as the last time you told me them they actually were quite hurtful, I don't expect you to know everything or get everything right love you\*"" (I don't have a copy of the note and that's what I remember). 

I chose the note format so that I could take as long as I wanted to to think about what I wanted to say and to be able to reread it and make sure I didn't miss anything. My Nan hasn't actually spoken to me since she read it and has since given me a note that says: ""Dear Deadname, Since you chose this format of communication: I'm replying the same way. I don't think anything I ever said was ""hurtful."" I have made it very clear that I love you no matter what. I wonder if you know how hurtful it is that you never visit us anymore. As for ""I don't expect you to know everything but I expect you to try your best and to be respectful"" do you even realise how offensive that is.""

I don't think I've done anything wrong, and I tried my best to make it clear that I know she's old and it's hard for things to change and I don't expect her to be perfect because that's her main argument when it comes to trans people. My Dad, Grandpa, and my Aunt all think I should apologise for ""upsetting your Nan"" when she's the one who's spent the last 12 months making me miserable.

429,t3_rv2wgj,AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for taking a job?,"My boyfriend and I work at the same place. We met there and have been dating for more than a year. During the first few months of the relationship, I told him I was going to switch to nightshift. I was being bullied by a 60 year old woman and harassed by a 40 year old man. I couldn’t take it anymore. 

He said okay, but asked that I wait until he finds a new job. I was fine with that. I waited about 4 months. During this time, my boyfriend referred his friend to night shift. His friend got hired and my boyfriend decided we was going to go to night shift as well. I was pissed. His friend started and then my boyfriend started nights a week after. 

I was nice enough to wait for him to try and find a new job and then he just ditched me like that and took the last position available. 

Everyone in the warehouse knew we were dating, even the managers. Even if another position was available, they wouldn’t have let me follow him to nightshift. So I was stuck working there for another 6 months. I endured even more bullying and harassment, but had to deal with it alone. 

This all happened more than 6 months ago, but it was brought up again. My boyfriend and his friend claim I overreacted. Apparently I should’ve been happy that he took my job. 

So AITA for getting mad?

Also, I would like to add that the night shift manager was willing to hire me before my boyfriend. He just said that it would be unprofessional for my boyfriend to join me.

Now one of the people I invited their birthday is before mine of course I’m excited but I’m not currently around to gift her or celebrate with her as I traveled for Christmas but i didn’t tell them neither did I hide it. 
I posted pictures and wished them happy birthday privately and told them I missed them as we’ve not had to time to hangout, later today I see pictures and videos of their party at their home with guests and I don’t know I’m just hurt. I mean even if they were aware I wasn’t around to celebrate they should have still invited me as this was clearly planned weeks ahead. Now I’m just looking at the situation and feeling weird about it because even when I invited them they just kind of treated it like it was a mere visit and not a celebration. I don’t feel comfortable letting them come anymore as I don’t want to feel a fool for putting this person on a pedestal they clearly don’t deserve.

So would I be the asshole to just tell them I don’t want them to come? I also want to just lie and say the party is canceled.

I responded with 'ok'. On Christmas day, we went to my in-laws house and they had giant bags of gifts for their other granchildren - boys (6 y and 8). My older daughter got (3) gifts - 1 wrapped and 2 unwrapped. My little one had nothing. So I am furious at her. Obviously she had time. At first i thought maybe because my little one is under 1, they didnt know what to get, but then the other grandchild who is under 1  got gifts. At this point it's not even about the gifts...Its very confusing why would anyone do that? Was my little one not worth their time or they didn't care enough about her.... I really hate it when they treat differently. I think my older daughter gets a pass for being the 1st girl in the family and younger daughter gets very a little attention.

432,t3_rv21dn,AITA for getting my job back to get out of taking care of my husband's autistic niece?,"My husband (30M) became the legal guardian to his sister's daughter (17F) two months ago. She lost her single mom last year. My in-laws took her in but they were too old. That was when my husband became her legal guardian despite my concerns. He told me that he would take care of her completely. 

We got married a year ago after 15 years of dating. I had a very successful career in a very physically and mentally demanding field. I had to travel a lot. We wanted to start a family and I agreed to be a stay at home mom. I quit my job few months into the marriage when I got pregnant. Sadly, I had a miscarriage. Then his sister died and everything is on hold. In the mean time, I took a part time job in a related field which allows remote work so that I am not bored out of my mind. 

My SIL was a nurse. She quit her job to take care of her daughter full time. Her daughter has a variety of issues including non-verbal autism, a series of development disorder like dyslexia and severe sensory issues. 

My husband says that he does most of the work. But he doesn't. Since I am working from home part time most of the caretaking falls to me. She gets angry and has meltdowns all the time. She doesn't like the food I make and most of the time she ends up throwing to food at the floor or at me. I am at my wits end and it is just so emotionally exhausting. 

Around Dec 15, my husband was working late and asked me take care of dinner. She is very picky about food. The slightest change in texture or taste from what she is used to can cause a meltdown. She threw the plate at my feet and I ended up bleeding. At that point, I called my husband and asked him to be home asap. He said he wouldn't be able to. I went up to my room and told him I am not dealing with this anymore. He came hours later and she was still crying. He was absolutely furious at me. He called he heartless and irresponsible. I told his I have had enough of both of their ungrateful behaviour and told him that I am going to my mom's and I wouldn't be back until New Year's. 

He panicked and tried to apologise but I left. He called me everyday asking me to come back. I finally came back and he told me that my stunt had forced him to all available leaves to stay home with her. He told me that he was glad I was back. I told him that I contacted my former company and got my old job back and it starts next Monday. It is in-office and requires lot of travel. He asked me who was supposed to stay at home as she cannot be left alone, he has no more leaves and full-time caretakers are too expensive. I told him he promised to take care of everything when he became her guardian and that it was his problem.

As you can guess, my family supports me and his family thinks I am being extremely selfish. So I am asking judgement from impartial strangers.

433,t3_rv1y2b,AITA for wanting a family memento back off my ex?,"Around a year and a half ago I (21f) split from my ex-boyfriend (22m), who I dated for 4 years. I wasn't happy in the relationship and we didn't have anything in common.

About 2 years into our relationship my family suffered an incredibly traumatic event, I had my teenage cousin who I was incredibly close to pass unexpectedly. My ex-boyfriend knew my cousin from parties and from going to events, they didn't know each other very personally but always said hi to each other, maybe had some quick conversations but nothing like they were close friends (didn't hang out on their own or anything like that).

2 days before my cousin passed he was at an event I was at with my ex-boyfriend. My cousin brought an expensive cigar to show off to us (me being a teenager thought it was very cool, especially since I looked up to him like an older brother) and showed us how to smoke a cigar on the balcony of the venue. After he went through the cigar, my cousin gave the cigar case to me but seeing as it didn't fit in my bag and having conservative parents, I let my ex-boyfriend take it home.

Flash forward to now, the twin siblings of my deceased cousin are turning 21 which is around the same time that marks 5 years since the passing of my cousin. After going out to dinner with my cousins for their birthday, the conversation inevitably went on to their sibling so I decided I would hit up my ex-boyfriend to get it back.

Anyway so I messaged him (as a disclaimer, the last message I sent him was a thank you message for his family for sending my family flowers when my grandfather passed a few months ago, he left me on read) and explained the sentimental meaning of the cigar case, that I wanted it back home, wished him and his family all the best and said that if he wasn't comfortable, our mutual friends (who he sees semi-frequently) could come collect it or meet up with him on my behalf. He responded by saying he was tempted not to respond due to my previous messages to him, said he ""appreciated"" that it was important to me and said he'd like to keep it (didn't provide a reason). I responded explaining how it was a significant piece to my family and how I wanted to return it home (to the siblings and to the family) and that despite the past, the right thing to do is to give it back.

I've since chatted to the siblings of my cousin about the situation and since I was so close to their brother, they're very much on my side. They didn't know my ex-boyfriend and their brother knew each other outside of me.

My mutual friends with my ex are supporting me, suggesting to threaten legal action for return of property or to message him again  (he left me on read instantly).

I don't know whether my ex owning it for so long make it his or if maybe I'm asking too much from him if this meant a lot to him too. In asking for it back, AITA?

**EDIT:** thank you all so much for the responses, I'm going to get the siblings to get in contact with him directly since he's admitted to having it and I was doing this on their behalf in the first place

**SECOND EDIT:** I have to be clear I'm NOT threatening legal action whatsoever, it was a suggestion from mutual friends which I think is definitely not the right thing to do and wouldn't hold up in the slightest lol",10.0
434,t3_rv1xhe,AITA for my dad losing a document in a mess I helped make?,"16F

Sorry I’m on mobile, and I’m in the UK if that matters.

When I was 13, my house flooded. There was a leak in one of the pipes when I was on holiday and water went through the ceiling into my bathroom and my bedroom. Everything was wet and I couldn’t get in my room.  You could barely open my door and water was dripping through the ceiling. The carpet and some floorboards were pulled up because of the damage and you had to jump to get across my room.

We made temporary sleeping arrangements. I slept in my parents room, my mum slept on the sofa and my dad slept on the floor next to her. My mum as well as my sister and I were saying about how we should claim on the insurance. My dad said that he would fix it and my dad is very argumentative, so after months we gave up. 

These sleeping arrangements have become less temporary. Three years later my room has floorboards up- my dad did put some floorboards down, but only enough so that you didn’t have to jump so far. My dad is sleeping down the road at my grandmas house. 

I did get my room back for bit before my dad started to redecorate my room, so I can’t get anything. He’s been in the process of decorating my room for months. All of the furniture is in the centre of my room and because some of the floorboards are still up, I’m not allowed in there. I can’t get in my room to get any of my clothes and pretty much everything I own is there. I have a few clothes and I have some of my stuff.

Here’s the problem. The layout of my parents room means there’s little space to walk. I can’t keep my clothes or stuff in the cupboards because that’s where my parents’ clothes are. I can’t put my things anywhere because there’s no space. My dad is a messy person and where there space for me to put my things, it was taken by his mess and I didn’t want to move it because it wouldn’t end well. I originally had my stuff in a couple of bags, but I got shouted at because there was no space to move.

I resorted to leaving my stuff in the floor because I had nowhere else to put it. My dad lost a document in his room. Due to the amount of mess that both he and I had created, he couldn’t find it. I got shouted at for leaving everything on the floor and making a mess. I admit that I had some stuff that he told me to throw away but forgot to, but it wasn’t much. 

My reasoning is that I have nowhere I can put my things because I can’t get into my bedroom and I can’t put my clothes away. I do realise that a lot of the mess there I made, but I don’t see that it’s completely my fault. His logic is that it was his and my mum’s room and I should have been more responsible and kept it tidy.",3.0
435,t3_rv1wq2,AITA for telling my wife’s friends that periods were non-mandatory?,"When I first met my (now) wife, she was not on the pill and she suffered from heavy periods and crippling cramps. When she went to the doctor to start taking oral contraceptives, the one she was prescribed was the one without a withdrawal period and thus no periods and no period pains. This was a life changer for her. I remember her saying that even if we broke up and she returned to a single life for a few years, she would continue taking the pill as the benefits are so great.

Fast forward some 15 years, her and a few of her friends, all in their 30s, are talking about VAT on sanitary products. For the people out of the loop, in the UK, there is a 20% sales tax, but it does not apply to some essential things, like most food products (chocolate is taxed, bread is not). Sanitary products are taxed and the conversation was around the fact it is sexist as it is an essential item. I walked in half way through the conversation and blurted out ""Why don’t you just get the pill that stops you from having periods, and then you can have it 100% off, rather than fighting for 20%"". This did not go down well at all. I was the only guy in the group. Immediately I was pounced on with ""What if the woman is trying for a baby?"" to which I became very defensive saying that most women aren’t and it would save them so much hassle. In general there was a very angry reaction and I likely made it worse by defending my point. It culminated with my wife kicking me and telling me to shut up because I didn’t know what I was talking about and proceeded to send me away. I genuinely thought that if people knew that this pill existed it would make their lives better, but instead I came off like a complete asshole. This was months ago and still I have no idea. Can anyone explain what I did so I can avoid doing it again?

EDIT: To clarify, all the women in the group were on the pill already.

EDIT2: When my partner started taking the pill, she was given a set of options. There was a lot of reading involved and I was there when she made her decision and understood all them options as well as she did. I was given the list of symptoms to look out for and it came with a thick pentathlete of how it works, what to look out for etc. It said to assume it did not work as a contraceptive for a few months. If this pill had adverse effects there was a list of 4 others the doctor was going to try. We were given all the options and she picked them in order of her preference. The first one caused her to bleed continuously and after 2 months she moved to a second one which worked much better. This second one was very new to the market and doctors were only prescribing it in severe period pain cases. It took a couple months for the symptoms to settle, but it worked very well.


EDIT3: Very well. Unanimous. I accept I am the asshole.

The VAT has, since the conversation, gone and I fully supported it being withdrawn (at the time and now): https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tampon-tax-abolished-from-today

Feel free to talk to your doctor about whether continuous use pill is right for you, but it was dumb of me to assume you have not and I will never ever again bring the topic up.

I will now:

* Bring up this incident with my wife to see if I can ask for forgiveness and request any penance.
* In future, keep my mouth shut about periods (or anything to do with the uterus).

436,t3_rv1rvp,AITA for telling my wife she has a daily budget because she is bad with money?,"So here’s the scrub; my wife (36f) is a stay at home mom while (35m) work. This was her choice, I didn’t expect her to work when we had kids, but I made sure it was her decision. It’s been 12 years since she had a full time job. Being the stay at home parent is hard. We homeschool - she works hard. 

As a single income family we do pretty well. I get paid my commission the first week of the month and then a small paycheck every week. The commission check pays all the bills, gives us the opportunity to put money aside, the weekly checks are suppose to be for food, day to day BS needed.

My wife has never really been good with money, but neither I have I. We both said we would notify each other, if we spent more than 50 bucks on anything other than groceries and fuel. 

I use to make a budget every month, at her insistence, but it’s useless because she doesn’t follow it. I have tried the envelope system (she has lost the cash and she is always misplacing her wallet) so I don’t do that anymore).

But she gets mad at me that I stopped making a budget, or when the account gets over drafted. I tell her, honey I don’t use the debit card except to the pay the bills. It isn’t my fault the account gets over drafted.  

I didn’t flat out say to her face that she is the reason it over drafts but she got very upset. I don’t know what the hell she spends the money on, and honestly I don’t care, she is the one that’s at home all the time so I trust that she knows what our house needs for the most part. 

Her big thing is seeing something on sale - probably something we wouldn’t use or buy if it wasn’t on sale, getting it and saying o0o I saved $20 dollars on these snow pants. They were still 65$. We get snow about once every 2 years. It doesn’t stick. 

But I recently I told her that in all seriousness, including groceries, you can spend on average about $65 dollars a day. As long as you don’t go over that, you can be assured that we won’t over draft the account. We wouldn’t need to use a budget, I wouldn’t be frustrated that the account overdrew again. Life would be easier. But she flipped out on me and walked out saying I didn’t trust her and calling me an AH.

We didn't spend Christmas together as he went to go visit his family and I had to work half that day, but I got him a few gifts and left them under the tree.          One gift was a cold-weather jacket that seemed very appropriate for the season and I hoped he'd like it.        He hadn't gotten me anything, but I really didn't care, that wasn't the point.

Come the days after Christmas and I notice that his presents are still under the tree, unopened.        When I ask him to open them as the holiday has come and gone; he says he's not going to until maybe Easter \[!?\].

Without revealing what they are, I reply that these gifts are seasonal and he would enjoy them more in the winter months so, it's best to just open them now.        He still refused.

Seven+ days have gone by now, with my requesting that he open the gifts and if he doesn't like them, then I'll be glad to just return them.       No judgement.          ...but if we wait until Easter/Springtime, then I won't be able to get a refund.

Now, the roommate says that I'm being pushy and so much of an AH that it pisses him off.        He insists that he *wants* the gifts, but just not until Easter (when he won't need cold-weather gear)

I understand I can't control what he does with my presents to him, as they are technically  now *his* property and not mine, but I don't understand why he won't even look at them until after their usefulness is over.

438,t3_rv1mvh,AITA for suggesting I get a gift for an old neighbor in front of my mom?,"I was sitting at the dinner table last night enjoying family dinner. While we were eating and talking, I remembered an idea I had while at work, but was hesitant about bringing it up, or even going through with it. We recently moved, luckily not too far away from where we were, and I was thinking of an old neighbor of mine. He’s one of the nicest people I’ve ever met and a one of the few people outside of my family who I’d consider a father figure. He loves working on project cars, so I figured if I got him something, why not get him some very high quality tools?

Another piece of context, I’ll soon be leaving or a church mission, so I the idea was that I’d give it to him before I left in April. Well, when I brought it up, I was a bit hesitant because of just how expensive the brand was (Snap-On). I was expecting my mom to say something like, “that’s a great idea, but that’s a lot of money.” But instead, she started saying “what about the person who…” I forget how she ending each sentence, but she started what felt like a dozen with that phrase. At first I thought that she was talking about the neighbor, but something didn’t line up. Then it clicked that she was talking about herself. 

At first I thought, “well, I guess she’s right, I didn’t think of her.” Then, something clicked. I pointed right at her, “hey, you’re trying to guilt trip me!” She came back at me with, “well what about me, the person who raised you?” I just shutup because I knew I couldn’t win it. No point in making your landlord mad. Family dinner soon adjured, and I didn’t know whether I should or now. On one hand, this neighbor means a lot to me, and I know that he would greatly appreciate the tools. On the other, my mom seems highly disapproved of the idea, and I’m thinking of just getting nothing for anyone.

440,t3_rv1bg0,AITA for telling my mom she can't wear white to my wedding,"I (23f) am back in the states with my fiance (24m) for the holidays. While here, my best friends planned a surprise engagement party for me and my fiance where all of my close friends and family were invited to celebrate our engagement. This party included my immediate family and family friends which consists of mostly my mom's best friends and their families. 

The party is in full swing and since I and my fiance have been in Scotland for the past few months we're very busy catching up with family friends. Midway through the party, my best friend pulls me to the side and asks me if I had seen the dress my mom is telling everyone that she's wearing to the wedding. Confused, I make my way across the room to talk to my mother and I ask her about the whole situation. Unfazed, she very excitedly shows me this white sparkly gown with what looked like a two feet sweep train in the back. The dress looked like a wedding dress.

I was shocked. I had barely even begun wedding planning and somehow my mother had already managed to begin to derail my wedding. I asked her if she was serious and she simply nodded her head and tell me about how she went shopping the moment she heard I was engaged and thought it was perfect.

I didn't want to cause a scene at the party so I waited until we all went home to address my mother after everyone went to sleep. I basically asked her if it was possible for her to find another dress as my wedding wouldn't be for at least two years and I very plainly wasn't comfortable with her wearing a white dress that had a train and basically looked like a wedding dress.

My mom then got very huffy and basically said that ""if she looked good in it then why shouldn't she wear it?"" and began to double down and tell me that if I was worried about her overshadowing me at my wedding then that would be my problem and I shouldn't let others make me feel inferior or ruin my day.

She then went on a rant about how she didn't understand why I was making such a big deal about the wedding since all I needed was a church and all the family there and nothing else should matter if I'm with my husband and we're getting married in a church (she's a very devout catholic). Then proceeded to point out that if I was really focusing on what dress she was wearing and other small details like flowers, venues, music, and other things then I was being really shallow and maybe shouldn't get married at all.

I reiterated my point about while that may be - it's my wedding and I would not feel comfortable if anyone else showed up in an overly expensive white dress comparable to my white dress and I didn't care how that made me look.

She then told me I'm shallow and should go to church to rethink my actions because obviously, I'm not ready for marriage if that's all I'm focused on.

441,t3_rv1atx,WIBTA if I tell my girlfriend to stop buying me watches?,"I like to collect watches, it’s something that fascinates me, and I enjoy putting the time, effort and research to find one that's right for me. I’m not talking about thousand-dollar watches, just clean nice ones that aren’t too expensive. Whenever I buy a watch, I make sure to show it to my GF because I like sharing my hobby to anyone that will listen. I’m a hard person to shop for and because of my interest GF has started to buy me watches for birthdays and Christmases. I love that she considers buying me these things, but often they just aren’t the style or type of watch I’m interested in. This wouldn’t normally be a problem as I would just wear it less, but she gets upset that I don’t wear the watches she buys me. 

This Christmas she bought me a Fitbit smart watch, it seems like a good idea on paper as I exercise a lot and don’t own a smart watch. The problem is I don’t like smart watches, and honestly don’t see myself wearing one. I now feel guilty for not liking it and when I do wear it, I don’t enjoy it. Ultimately, I think that my watch taste is too personal and don’t see a scenario where she will get me a watch I like. I don’t want her to feel bad about her gifts or make her spend money on an item I won’t use. WIBTA if I tell her to stop gifting me watches because of these reasons?",18.0
442,t3_rv14py,WIBTA asking partner to pay rent,"Hi 
So basically I bought an apartment two years now. During the purchase I already was dating for two years but note that I was looking for the right opportunity before we were together, still, we were already serious at the time and I decided to include her in all the process apart from including her on the contract (we were together for two years then). She gave her opinion on everything including made herself clear on her requirements, must be last floor and must be big so I went for a duplex apartment 

At the time I mentioned that it would be fair that she pays a rent (we work the same job and get the same money) and bills but never went forth with the rent part

Two years now, we earn each ~1300 month for a ~560 rent which I’m paying myself 

She currently gives me 100 for bills which covers it perfectly but she yesterday said something like “I honestly don’t know how you don’t have money all the time “

Am I the asshole if I start asking for a split on the rent ? I don’t think half is fair because apartments is mine at the end of the day but damn it hurt to hear those words after me having ~560 month expense myself

Edit
It’s called mortgage not rent
Apologies 
I pay mortgage to the bank as I have a credit for the apartment 
The premise still the same I think
Sorry",20.0
443,t3_rv11ws,AITA for calling the Police on my fiancé?,"
My fiance (28M) and I (30F) have been together for 3 years, I used to live close to work and used public transportation but after I moved in to his house which is hours away from work I bought myself a car since I'm a nurse and also since there isn't any hospitals close to where we live that I could transfer to.


My fiance's car hasn't been working for close to 2 months now, It requires so much money to get it fixed and he refused my fiancial help when I offered it.

Instead, he would ask to use my car every now and then and I agreed as long as it's when I'm not working and also, since he only uses it for trips to the supermarket etc.


On new years eve, he told me he wanted to use my car to go hang out with his friends and celebrate but I declined because I had to cover a night shift and needed my car to travel to work. He insisted and even suggested I take the night off or swap shifts with another nurse but I couldn't do that last minute.


I thought he dropped it then but when I went into the shower and got out I couldn't find him nor my car,  I freaked out and started calling for half an hour but he didn't answer me, I tried again til one of his friends picked up, I demanded he give the phone to my fiance but he said they were out and confirmed that he took my car and told me that my fiance said that it's better that I skip my shift and he'll be back with my car later. I couldn't take it I felt so enraged I had my fiance on the phone telling him I did not consent for him to take my car to go hang out with friends and said I'd call the police to get it back if he refused to come back with it, but he didn't take me seriously so I ended up calling the police and he and his friends were picked up at the bar where they were hanging out, then were taken to the police department.

I got my car from there and still went to my shift, my fiance was let go hours after I left and he blew up my phone with missed calls and texts about how I was out of my mind to call the police on him and put him in this situation. I did not respond but when I got off work the next day we got into an argument and he said he couldn't believe I'd do this to him but I told him he made me do this to which he responded that I was petty and callous because not only did I ruin his new years celebration, but all his friends aren't speaking to him after I put them in this situation as well and he then kept giving me silence about it.

I did consider this a form of theft especially since he went behind my back after getting a ""NO"" from me, but he was shocked that I'd even imply that he was a thief and said what's yours is mine and vice versa so I shouldn't be using the terms ""theft and stealing"".",25126.0
444,t3_rv0tax,AITA For refusing to pay for babysitters due to having a childfree wedding.,"My partner and I want a childfree wedding and it has caused a lot of drama.

My partner and I have been to multiple friends weddings where kids have run wild. Screamed, cried and threw tantrums throughout the wedding ceremony which echoed and was the main thing you could hear.

During some of the receptions kids were running around, and let lose almost tripping servers carrying hot food or drinks as kids aren't watching where they are going and their parents weren't watching them.

Throughout my life I've always been sensitive to high pitch noises.
I often get massive headaches and can get nauseous after long exposure to them.
At last weddings I've had to take strong painkillers to be able to go through the day.
Which meant I wasn't able to have any drinks and had to stick with water.

For our wedding the same people will be attending.
From our past experience we know that the same kids will cause the same problems as they did in previous weddings.

Which is not the kids fault.

Weddings aren't the place to kids, they get bored easily and they have to sit still and be quiet for an extended period of time which can be difficult when your young.

We want a childfree wedding so we can enjoy our wedding, I can have celebration drinks on my wedding and don't have to spend the day Medicated. 

Family is on board with this.

Some friends aren't on board and say that if I won't invite their kids then i have to pay for babysitters for them or they aren't coming.

We are having a small wedding and can't afford to pay for babysitters for their kids.

I just want to enjoy my wedding.

Yesterday, I was joking with my little brother when I told him “you stink”, my mother misinterpreted it as me laughing at him and she jumped in to shout at me for lowering his self esteem. I need to specify that my mother has covid but she acted like she had nothing. I immediately told her to go away from me and go back to her room, I didn’t mean to hurt her but apparently she took it as me disrespecting her, which I can understand because I said it harshly, she closed the distance and continued to shout at me when she was only 2 cm from my face. I escaped her grasp covering my face with my hand as if I was trying to escape the petrifying look of Medusa, and I proceeded to say some mild obscenities like stop breaking my balls (it means stop annoying me in french, I’m not a native English speaker). She began banshee screaming even more, and even when I tried to calm her by speaking softly and asking her to stop she started saying that I was trying to make it seem like I as superior. She asked me to pack my bags and go to my father’s house the next morning, it made my brothers cry and she to told them that everything was my fault for disrespecting her in her own house and then she accused me of being a manipulator for turning my brothers against her when I hugged them (why????). Her main argument was that as she raised me and fed me she deserves my respect and I can’t shout at her no matter the subject, I said she had covid so she had to lock herself in her room until she was covid free and that I was an adult just like her and I deserved respect too, she didn’t like it at all, because I don’t pay rent to earn said respect. I apologised to her and went to sleep. Fast forward three days now everybody in the house has covid (Thanks mom !). This morning she wanted me to go out for something important and said it that it was okay if I wore a mask, I asked to speak to our doctor and she went mad again shouting for 5 minutes straight. Turns out, she was right ! But was it necessary to scream at me like that ? first I was completely sure that I was right about everything and that I deserved respect too. But she called my dad to complain to him about me, so he called me and explained that no, since they do everything to please me and my brothers everyday, I do not have the right to reply when she shouts at me and I need to just accept it and that she deserves way more respect than me as I didn’t accomplish anything. And I can see it, she works hard, maybe she was just blowing of some steam and I overreacted by shouting back and starting an argument.

A few hours later, she calls me and says she’s feeling really sick and that she was really hungry. I was already annoyed at my elder daughter so I snapped and told her that there is food that she can eat but chooses not to. And that there is a line of stupidity and that she has crossed it.

I got deathly sick and in a moment of self less ness she quickly moved into my house to help take care of me and do cooking and cleaning. We have no kids so she took our only spare bedroom. Now since I was young my mom was one of those moms who always voiced her opinion. Growing up I realized it wasn’t a good trait. She would say she’s helping but in the end she was just criticizing. Now I’m older and I realized how toxic she is but i can’t change her( I tried) I let her stay because it was such a huge help. But now it’s been a year and I’m tired of the snide comments. I’m basically healed. About to start a career that will take me away from my husband for months at a time and I just don’t think my husband is as comfortable as he says he is having her live with us full time. The other issue is I’ve been basically financially taking care of her in the past year. She got a job (I’ll be it kind of begrudgingly) but she has always had money issues. She’s one of those who if she won the lottery it would be gone in a month. She doesn’t make good financial decisions. This Christmas season alone put me back $1,500 that she “borrowed”. Again my husband has not said anything negative about this and when I bring it up he says he’s ok with it. I feel maybe he just doesn’t want to tell me that it bothers him. I for one feel like I’m stepping on egg shells sometimes in my own house. I want to take care of her like a good daughter would, but I feel drained having to be living in my own house. Am I the asshole for asking my mom to move out knowing she can’t hardly take care of herself financially?

Edit I guess my question is more. Morally is she my responsibility because she can’t take care of herself because I enabled her shitty spending habits? Is it wrong for me to look out solely for myself or in this case my husband and I? And not as her child whom she had hoped would take care of her in her golden years. Do I owe it to her to at least try and take care of her? I know she’s going to take it bad. She loves pulling the “oh everything’s MY fault I see!” And gas lighting and shit.

449,t3_rv0kus,AITA FOR TELLING MY ROOMMATE THAT I DON’T WANT HIS GIRLFRIEND SLEEPING OVER?,"So in January last year 2021 I (21m) I found this hostel close to my university advertising 2-in-1 rooms. It was a beautiful place but a bit expensive. My parents paid for it though and I moved in when school resumed.
          My roommate (m21), “Dan”,was a cool dude. We had different interests so we didn’t relate much. But it was a peaceful existence. We alternate on who does chores in the room.
             Dan has a girlfriend (f21), “May”, who comes over from time to time. In the middle of the semester she started to sleep over. She slept over like once or twice a week (usually on weekends). Dan asked me if I was cool with it. I was a bit uncomfortable with it but told him otherwise because I felt it might sour our “relationship”. So when he asked, I told him it was fine and that it doesn’t happen often so it’s okay. 
        Nothing else changed much until we returned from break for a new semester. May came over everyday and slept over everyday for  three weeks into the semester. I was way too uncomfortable with that.
           I could do once or twice a week but not everyday for three weeks. I couldn’t particularly tell you what made me uncomfortable but what I can say is I’m a bit more reserved and very private when she’s around like that. So it’s not necessarily her actions that make me uncomfortable. And I’m tired of being that way in a room I’m supposed to feel comfortable in. Our parents paid a lot for it after all.
            So I told him that I wasn’t comfortable with how often his girlfriend was staying over. 
I told him once in a while is okay, but everyday is too much for me. At first he said okay. Then he left and didn’t sleep in the room that night . The next day he returned and asked me what about his girlfriend I didn’t like. I was confused then I told him it’s not that I didn’t like his girlfriend but that I wasn’t comfortable with her staying over everyday. So he asked why I told him differently when he asked the first time. I explained that it wasn’t very often so I just went with it. Then he said, “so it’s her presence you don’t like.” I kept trying to explain that that wasn’t the issue but he was having none of that and shut me down.
            My parents told me to avoid quarrels and to learn to live with others because many people have several different habits that may make me uncomfortable or that I may not agree with. And I can’t go around forcing them to do what I want. 
          Dan barely slept in  the room after that. He spent most of his day time away too. And we hardly spoke.
          I feel very bad that he’s not sleeping in the room that he also paid for. His girlfriend actually seems like a nice person and I don’t dislike her in the least. I feel bad for making her feel unwelcome to our room. I feel bad for “forcing” my roommate to spend time elsewhere instead of in the comfort of his room. I don’t know maybe i shouldn’t have told him that because now it feels like I’m the a—-hole. AITA??",4.0

My sis &amp; bro (31) are extremely close, something ive struggled with in some ways as my sister bullied him as bad if not worse than me.

When her &amp; her husband lived in prague they invited my bro &amp; his partner to visit &amp; go skiing, my ex &amp; i werent invited.

His face drops further, and he asks me as to how I intend to rectify this situation, perhaps by card?

453,t3_rv071o,AITA Someone is in my friend group and most of us are trying to out him using unorthodox tactics.,"I've had this dude who's been in most, if not all of my classes since primary school. I always found him to be irritating which sprouted from him following me constantly asking who was my crush or always made cookie cutter ""roasts"" which didn't apply in the context such as: ""In your dreams!"". The roasts were also followed by an ""Ohh!"" with his hand waving at me which I always found stupid, snobby, and pretentious. He continued this into the next grade where I was friends with the new kid and he tagged along.

Fast forward a few years later, he was still tagging along, I was still friends with the now not so new kid and we got into a friend group/clique of people and it was fun. My friend found him to be irritating and when we joined the friend group, I got the impression that most of the friend group didn't either. The way he irritated me and now my friends changed, he began to make jokes that we had made a week ago and try to do something like ""friendly ribbing"" except when he did it, it came off badly. He started to copy all of the things we did to entertain each other (mostly with humor), kind of marking the death of all our inside jokes I feel. Fast forward months later and he's still tagging along. We got into Tetris; he joined us far too late trying to act good, eventually accepting it. I introduced the sort of ""lead"" of the group to PVP Tetris and we had even more fun than before, learning different tactics, and history repeated itself. He acted slightly less pretentious this time by always found a way to ruin our fun by making bad jokes or mimicking our jokes in a twisted way.

If you're wondering how we tried to make him go away, we practically have a catalogue of tactics. We tried confrontation, the silent treatment, just ignoring anything that ignored us, a bit of teasing which we hoped would make him discouraged enough to leave us be, no effect. HELL! We even tried using WikiHow of all sites and to no affect. We decided to confront him as a whole group, he tried to argue stating that only a few of us found him annoying but we rebutted with a vote of who found him irritating. It was a unanimous in the decision that he was irritating yet he still tried to reason. All of his arguments made were repetition, mostly ""Oh, only you two find me annoying!"" and ""You only find me annoying because of X!"". He even owed us small sums of money which he never returned which he completely denied despite us vouching for each other.

We've tried to cut him out to an extent of insulting and making jokes about him in front of him to lower his spirits to no effect. We tried to just shout every single profane word in the dictionary and he didn't flinch. One of our friends had a moral epiphany where he found our tactics to be like bullying to an extent (He's changing schools in a few months and doesn't want any enemies). Since then, there were quite a few fights and arguments between the epiphany friend and the ""lead"". Am I the asshole? Are we the assholes?

When I got engaged she had a lot to say. But at some point I just told her I don’t care and I’m done listening her talk about our relationship. So we reached an agreement: I wouldn’t tell her anything about my relationship because she thinks it’s toxic and she doesn’t want to hear it. And she wouldn’t give me unsolicited advice. 

I got married in a big wedding in his home country and I didn’t invite her. Because I knew she wouldn’t be happy for me. Now she is mad at me.


Edit: I directly asked her if she would have come to the wedding if I invited and she said no. I asked her if she would have tried to talk me out of it if I invited her and she said probably. She still believes my marriage is a bad idea and sees me as the victim and that she has to be there for me once things go wrong. Honestly at this point I don’t even know what to answer her. We just left the conversation at that.
So idk I guess I was right by not inviting her. But I don’t even know.",119.0

I told him if he had wanted to go he could have just gone and I would have met up with him later and that it wasn’t a big deal. I later apologized for invalidating his feelings. He seemed heated again, so I go outside and talk to my friend for a couple hours. I come back, he tells me if I loved him I would have gone to get the sweater, that I lack empathy, etc.

458,t3_ruzyod,AITA for walking away after my mom said that my problem was absurd?,"Before talking about the situation I have to give some background info. My mom was diagnosed with cancer in April 2021. Her and my dad were divorced but he came back after we found about the cancer. Mom started having chemo. Me and my father did our best to be there for her, especially my father. He stopped going to work for a few months as long as he could to take care of her and when summer came he had to start working again so I took care of my mom during summer. It's been a really tough year for us but she's had surgery in October and we beat cancer. She just finished her radiotherapy. But there is still some pain and discomfort even though it's not as intense as it used to be. The reason I'm telling this is that she's uncomfortable because of the aches and naturally it makes her angry

I feel like this is going to be a silly post but here,

I'm 20 and I like the way I look, haven't had any problem with girls or anything but like everyone else I have some features that I dislike. And unrelated to my looks, I've been kinda depressed since last year, I recently started seeing a therapist and my second appointment is this week.

Sometimes I feel like shit and when I'm in a low mood I start thinking that I also look like shit. A while ago I wrote down what I like and dislike on my face, and from the ones I dislike, I wrote down which ones bother me. Wrote down 2-3 things and then I wrote down which ones I can change easily (non surgical, risk free) They're actually really small things and the one I find easiest to change is my nose tip going down a bit while laughing. Normally I have a pointy nose but when I laugh too much and I mostly do, it goes down and I don't like the way it looks. Yeah I know it seems like a stupid thing to worry about but if this comes to my mind everytime I laugh and I try to keep my nose from looking like that with my hand and it's easy to fix it why wouldn't I just fix it?

Anyways, here's the story. I don't like bringing such topics up to anyone because it makes me feel insecure and weak. So I've brought this up to my mom cause she's always been supportive. When I told her about this she said that it's absurd and I said ok mom, thanks. You're right this is absurd, I will totally forget about this and never talk to you about this. I walked away and then she said are you really doing this? I said what mom, am I really doing what? Then she put on a pissed face and left the room. Now she's giving me the silence treatment.

About a few minutes later I went back to living room and told her that I'm sorry, we both misunderstood each other and there's no need to be mad at each other and ruin the day for ourselves but she said that she didn't misunderstood me, she understood very well and told me to leave because I was pissing her off.

To make one thing certain, I don't think my mom is being an asshole she's just being insensitive which is totally understandable in her situation. Just asking if I'm being the asshole.",33.0

Me and my date came home drunk one night over the weekend and wanted to carry on drinking (it was late all the shops were closed) so I offered him the beers we had in the fridge. In my head I knew my house mate was coming home at 12:30pm on Monday so I knew I had time to replace them. She came home at 10am on Monday morning and checked the fridge and instantly started slagging him off saying he’s a “y**” (person of low class) and various other classist slurs (she comes from a rich family and is engaged to someone with a similar background. I am from the same background as the guy I’m dating so calling him a y** kinda is offensive to both of us).

 I explained that I offered him the beers so it wasn’t his fault and I would replace them, she continued to speak badly of him and I told her it wasn’t cool and left. We were meant to go for brunch today to celebrate the engagement but now I feel really upset that she would speak about him like that. It wasn’t even his fault. Am I the ass hole.

460,t3_ruziqz,AITA for still expecting my wife to cook dinner even though it's her birthday?,"


Alright, Let's get right to it.

So, My wife (f30) and I (M32) agreed to split cooking 'duties' between us. I cook on Friday and Tuesday while my wife cooks on Sunday and Thursday.

Her birthday was (yesterday) on a sunday. We had a celebration at our house and had guests but they all left after the party was over because there was no 'birthday dinner' included.

So when the party was over, I reminded my wife that it's her turn to cook and asked her to do it. She was busy posting about the party on insta she looked at me and was confused, I asked what and she asked if I really expected her to cook on her birthday, I said why not it's her turn and besides the party was over but she argued that I can not be expecting her to cook when it's still her birthday and that I should just go into the kitchen and cook and she'll cook the next day but I refused and told her she was being sneaky by trying to weasle out of cooking this sunday since it's her part of the deal and she should stick to it. She offered takeout but we need to save money and she lost her shit on me about what an inconsiderate asshole I was to be 'forcing' her to cook on her birthday but I responded that she was just trying the old 'smoke and mirror method"" because if this was me she wouldn't let me get out of cooking dinner nomatter what the excuse is. She got more pissed saying I just ruined her 30th birthday for her with my awful attitude and selfushness.


She isn't speaking to me at the moment making me feel guilty for expecting her to do this. aita?


EDIT: the reason I didn't want to settle for takeout is because takeout is only allowed on days where neither of us is cooking. And also I'm the breadwinner and money is tight right now so we can not offord any unnecessary expenses.


Also, The reason I said if that was my birthday and I tried to get out of cooking when it's my turn, my wife wouldn't let me, since she still had me come home to cook after my dad was admitted to the hospital and I went to see him.",365.0
461,t3_ruzglm,AITA for calling my mother an idiot?,"I know the title doesn't sound great, but hopefully I can explain.

I (30s AFAB) am a non-binary person. I've been ""socially"" out for more than five years now (i.e. friends know I'm non-binary, I have my pronouns in my work email signature, etc) but have only recently started seeking medical transition care. As I am not planning to transition ""all the way"" to the opposite binary gender, it will likely never be possible for me to ""go stealth"" (a term for transitioning so completely that nobody knows you're trans). I will most likely have to entertain uncomfortable gender conversations for the rest of my life, whether or not I want to.

I'm currently quite feminine-looking, though I prefer men's or unisex clothes, haircuts, etc. Most (but not all) strangers gender me as a woman and treat me as such. I expect this to change once I start medical treatment.

The choice to begin medical transition was quite a weighty one, and I discussed it with my loved ones for maybe a year before taking the plunge and booking specialist appointments and the like. One of the people I talked to was my mother (50sF), who is quite religiously conservative, as are most of my family. She was, well, not thrilled with the idea. I think she assumed that because I've been out for years and never pursued medical transition, that she was ""safe"" from having to worry that it would ever come to pass.

Her reaction to my doctor's appointments and treatment plans has been...lukewarm. She won't use they/them pronouns for me, still refers to me as her daughter rather than her child/kid/whatever despite repeated discussions, and has told me multiple times that she wouldn't be able to handle it if I were to change my name (which I haven't done and am not sure I want to do). Despite all of this, I can tell that she's trying her best to be supportive. She has told me she still loves me and that she'll never cut me off or harm me intentionally because of this, even if she disagrees with my choices.

I've been keeping my family updated about my progress at the request of my more supportive siblings, and recently I was talking to my mum and one of my sisters about my physical goals (deeper voice, maybe some facial hair, etc). My mum expressed (once again!) that I would always be her daughter, and I said something to the effect of, ""Look, at some point, if you keep introducing me as your daughter when I have a beard, you're the one who's going to look like an idiot, not me.""

My mum did not appreciate being called an idiot. My siblings are varying levels of supportive but mostly think I need to accept that my mum will never change. My partner is on my side, but he's my partner, so he's generally on my side! I know my mum is trying, in her way, to support me through something she finds bewildering and upsetting, and I don't want to alienate her - but every time she *insists* on calling me her daughter, I feel sick to my stomach.

462,t3_ruz57h,WIBTA for not bringing my dog?,"Hello, my first post here. English is not my native language so sorry for spelling mistakes. 

A little background info:
Me (25F) and my husband (29M) have a Dobermann Kiara (3F). Kiara cant handle pork. We found this out when she was about a half year old. She gets bad poop and if she eats to much of it she vomits. Because of this we obviously never gave her any pork anymore. 

Okay here to the story. 

On the first day of Christmas we where at my husband's parents for dinner. (Me, my husband, BIL, SIL, MIL, FIL and grandfather) My mother in law cooked food and it was delicious but all the meat was pork. At the end of the main course my mother in law called Kiara (she was asleep on the couch as always when we eat dinner) and she gave her a peace of meat that was left over. I told her don't do it because she will get sick. She brushed it off and gave Kiara the piece anyway. 

As desert whe had Vienetta ice cream (contains chocolate), banana split ice cream (contains chocolate) and whipped cream ice cream (safe for Kiara). When everyone was finished with the desert Kiara makes her round around the table and everyone who had whipped cream ice cream holds their plate down so that Kiara can eat the little leftover that remains on the plate. Our grandfather hold his plate down for Kiara but he had the vienetta ice cream and there where obvious chocolate remains on the plate. So I told him don't give it to her but he raised his voice that it won't hurt her an put the plate on the floor. 

My husband talked to his mother after the dinner and told her not to give Kiara any more pork but she said; Every time Kiara is here when we are having dinner she always puts a piece of meat aside for her. No matter what the meat is. 

I've talked to my husband after we left and I told him I don't want Kiara there anymore when we're having dinner because they don't respect my wishes.

463,t3_ruz1jl,AITA for kicking my husbands ex out of the party?,"Happy New Year folks, sorry in advance about the mobile, and obligatory throwaway mention.

So I own a small hobby shop/cafe. For the last year and a bit we’ve had the cafe side closed but occasionally rent it out for private events. My husband and I decided we wanted to do a small NYE gathering and we opted to host it in the cafe space after the hobby portion of the shop had closed for the night. 

We invited 3 close friends and their SO’s and one was bringing an SO we have met a handful of times. About an hour before the get together he called us and asked if he could bring one more person as his GF’s friend was hanging out and had no where else to go. We weren’t thrilled just because we did want to keep it quite small but we talked it out and decided it was fine. 

We are all hanging out and having a good time when friend arrives with his GF, and my husbands ex. Now usually this wouldn’t be a big deal, hell my ex is one of our good friends but my husband hates his ex.

For good reason IMO, she stole from him, cheated on him and left him with two ill cats of hers with no contact to return them. He ended up putting over 5k of their medical care on his credit card before they were well enough to find a new family. He gave her over a year to get them back she ignored all contact attempts.

As soon as she walked in my husband froze up and then excused himself to the back room. So I pulled our friend aside (he’s a newer friend so had no idea his GF’s friend was my husbands ex) and let him know unfortunately she couldn’t stay.

He went to relay the message and then she stormed over to me and told me she didn’t care what issue I had with her but unless I wanted to lose my job (I’ll note here I had been making drinks for folks and put on an apron we keep in the cafe side with the shop logo on it) she would be staying. I asked what on earth she was talking about and she said she knew the owner and would have me fired for being rude. 

I laughed in her face and told her I knew the owner too and knew for a fact the owner thought she was a raging bitch and to get out of my shop. By then my husband had come back out and headed straight to the door and held it open gesturing for her to leave.

She ended up having to wait out front for quite awhile for an Uber in the cold and her friend was pretty pissed with us and her BF (He refused to leave, said they could get an Uber and do whatever but he was staying.) She ended up staying as well and husbands Ex was the only one to leave, but her friend thinks we were immature assholes and our friend said they had a huge fight about it when they got home and we could have at least let her wait for the Uber inside.

I probably would have told her she was welcome to wait inside if not for her attitude with the “get you fired” thing but after that I wasn’t inclined to be accommodating and it was cold but not freezing out so I think it kind of is what it is, AITA?",3789.0

We go out together and I include her in almost all of my plans. We don't have parents, she doesn't exactly have friends and I have a few wonderful ones - so we all hang out together.

We've spent the last 3 NYEs together. This year, however, I wanted to be alone with my boyfriend and just ring it quietly in our home. So I did.

My friends had decided to meet and catch the sunrise and I was hoping to sleep through that idea (lol). But they called my boyfriend at 6 am, who woke me up and because it was the start of a new year and I didn't want to start by saying ""no"", I went.

I had a great time with them. We wanted to hang out more so we decided to do a sleepover at my place later. They came, we watched a movie, had a good time. Since it was a Sunday and no one had anywhere to go, we woke up late, had a late breakfast and then spent the remaining afternoon just chilling and painting (We had some art supplies).

When my sister called later, I told her about my day and everything was fine. Then I called her today for our daily call and she sounded upset. Upon pressing, she said that she felt hurt that I didn't invite her to my plan and she started crying. That I said I wanted to spend my NYE with my boyfriend and ended up making plans with my friends and didn't even call her.

Frankly, I did spend my NYE with my boyfriend. We watched a movie. Sis &amp; I did the midnight call video with my third sister (35F) too. At that time, I was home and doing nothing and didn't intend to have plans.

The sunrise plan and the ones after that just happened.

I’ve noticed that while looking at make up artists, my SO has been gravitating towards the lower tier ones (i.e. cheaper). I’m generally okay with savings costs where possible but the issue is that while browsing the portfolios of the artists she’s suggested, I realised that none of them are good. In fact, I find that all their past work is at an unacceptable standard. 

I’ve proposed numerous other make up artists that do better work (my SO agrees that they’re better) and I’ve even offered to make up the difference in cost. But my SO is insisting on going with a cheaper artist. It’s also important to note that we’re pretty comfortable financially and can easily afford a better artist. 

I’m worried that on our wedding day, she’ll ask me how she looks and I’ll have to tell a white lie.

Occasionally we get ourselves locked out. It happens, right? Someone forgets their keys and asks if anyone else will let them in. No big deal. Unfortunately one of my housemates has got himself locked out seven times in the past nine months. On six of those occasions, he has gone out to get drunk and either forgotten his keys or given them away to prove he wasn’t going to go home early. He then bangs on the door and hollers our names until we wake up and let him in, usually at 3-4am. On one occasion, he climbed over our garden wall (about 2m tall) so he could bang on the back door and throw stones at my window.

Last night he came home almost exactly at midnight. I was still awake, so I went down to let him in. He spent half an hour stomping around the house and drunkenly singing. When I went to tell him to shut up, I realised that he’d gone back out again, leaving all the lights on and leaving the door open.

Next time he is banging on the door, I am going to put my headphones on and ignore him. He can text his friends to see if any of them will let him in, or find a hotel, or just find a cafe to sit in until 7am.

468,t3_ruyk2e,AITA for turning my BF against his mother?,"Sorry for possibly terrible grammar - English is not even my second language

I met my BF about 2.5 years ago (we are both 27 now). I have never met his parents in person since they live in another country. We thought about a guest visit tho but now there are very strict covid restrictions and we would have to spend 14 days in quarantine which we simply cannot afford yet. Also I never spoke to them over the phone - my BF never suggested it and I am terribly awkward at such things so I am pretty okay with it. So basically I don't know his parents and only know what he says about them. 
From what he said I know that his father is a pretty soft and polite person but his mother is much more authoritarian and she does not tolerate anything she considers ""wrong"".
We moved in together in 4 months since we started dating. Sometimes my BF looked upset after his parents called. When I asked what's the matter, it was always his mother. Seems like she wasn't very happy with her son and his life and career choices and always criticised him. Such calls repeated once or twice a week and soon I began to grow dislike for her.
A couple months later BF started talking about us moving to the country his parents live in. I felt something was off - of course it was his mom's idea. I really really didn't want to move away from my beautiful city and I also didn't want us to be closer to his mom because I felt she was emotionally dangerous. I thought that he would change his mind if his relationship with mother would get worse. I'm not a great manipulator but I did my best. There was already a lot of tension between them, and I tried very hard to turn this spark into a fire. I was very supportive and I never said anything plain rude about his mom but I gave a LOT of subtle hints that she's a b-tch. I encouraged him to talk about everything that bothered him so every time he was reliving and rethinking her words once again.
I don't know if I have really played a role or it was supposed to happen anyway but they had a MASSIVE fight several months later and are not talking since then. Of course I was supportive about that too but inside I was insanely relieved.
BF stopped talking about moving anywhere. He still talks to his father and with that I am okay. 
Sometimes I see that BF is unhappy about what happened and he would love to have stereotypical family meetings and holidays and stuff. I know my opinion matters a lot to him so if I suggested he would try to make it up he would have agreed. But I seriously don't want to bring it up and I don't believe this gonna bring anything good so I just make the most sympathetic face every time he says that mom was b*tching again in the background.

When my dad said congratulations, he made my achievement all about my mom and said that I got the degree thanks to her support and genes (I've had no support from her throughout the course). I found this a bit annoying.

My mother ended up being the only person I know who didn't say congratulations. It's silly for me to be upset about it, but it did hurt a little.

I was at home for a couple of months after graduating, and a couple of weeks ago succeded in finding a good job and was really happy that I'm starting tomorrow. This day was supposed to be my last day of being by myself and I wanted to finish some tasks and also chill.

But this morning, I woke up from the loud noise and the door buzzer (something that triggers me since my traumatic experience started with me waking up from screams and ended up with me almost dying). I, shaking, came to door to find out that my mom asked our neighbor to come down and wake ME up, so I could wake up my brother who has trouble waking up since he played games all night long - it turned out this morning is his school exam. She didn't even remember that it was the last day of me being at home, since my job will require for me to be outside for at least 12 hours. When I called her crying and asked what happened, she screamed at me that I should just go and wake him up, and I refused to do so. I told her I won't enable her pressure on me and everyone around, and if she wants to wake him up so badly she should've done it herself without pressuring anyone, not me, not the neighbor - she even called my sick grandma to come here and wake him up. 

She tries to wake up my brother everyday while he doesn't want to, and every time it resorts to her screaming and cursing at him, and him throwing stuff at her. I found military-grade earplugs to cover up my ears the first month of me being back home, since everyday for a weeks I woke up scared and had flashbacks. It helped, but probably wasn't so helpful against the door buzzer and thuds. Same with his homework, she screames at him for not doing it. She also hates that he goes out, she won't sleep at night because she says she scared for him and she calls him every hour and curses at him for being out for so long and that he doesn't respect her.

I was so exited to today to see Ash  it has been a month since I’ve seen her and she bring or friend Abby who I don’t even know  or something I spent the whole being ingnored I tried to start a conversation but even when I did Ash acted like only Abby was there talking to her about what I asked and talking about making plans with my cousin who wasn’t even there I didn’t even get a hello or goodbye. It’s the same with Kylie and Meg. They can see their friends and boyfriends whenever they want they go to school with them/ live with them. Would I be in the wrong if I asked for my parents to stop them or to let me know. Though in some cases my parents didn’t know the friends were coming either.

They come over bring people with them and rarely talk to me if not ignore me. I am just sick of it. I’ve put up for it for years and said nothing do I just keep my mouth shut?

So reddit WIBTA?

Edit: I think I should add that we invite them to our house for tea sometime  party  they usually always bring people sometimes without asking. I get that they want to hang out with their friends and boyfriends but does it really have to be at my house when I rarely see them and they see there friends and boyfriends all the time?

They bring people to my birthday parties without asking sometimes they are people I haven’t even met

Edit 2: I just want to add when it’s just us I get to talk them and we play pool and that but when there are their usually uninvited friends there I get ignored and left out",6.0
473,t3_ruy6p3,WIBTA for interfering with my best friend and recently widowed friend's flirting?,"ETA: please read the ETA at the bottom of the post. 

Some background. A very close friend of mine, let's call her Anne (31F), passed away suddenly in a car accident late last year. She was with her husband, Joe (35M) for nearly 15 years and both Joe and Anne were part of the bridal party at me (32F) and my husband's (31M)  wedding. Her passing was devastating and Joe still seems to be in denial (accidentally talks about Anne in the present tense etc). He's already taken off his wedding rings though and seems to be acting in the opposite direction of sad (e.g. making joking comments about all pretty single ladies and buying a new car).

Enter my best friend, Sue (32F), friends for nearly 20 years. She was my maid of honour and her and Anne got very close during wedding prep. She was understandably also very upset at Anne's passing. She's been single for a long time and isn't happy about it and currently goes on lots of dates and craves men's attention as the rest of her friends are married with kids, which is what she wants. She's understandably been very affectionate and kind to Joe whenever we hang out together. The problem arose on NYE when drunk Sue and drunk Joe started flirting big time. There has been no previous indication of attraction and I realise they probably both just craved attention but it made me, my husband, and another mutual friend upset. Anne hasn't even been gone three months yet and Sue is flirting with her friend's widowed husband. My husband is of the opinion that she started flirting with Joe at the funeral already. 

So, here is my conundrum. Do I let two adults make their own (in my opinion, very poor) choices knowing that they'll probably regret it, or do I get involved and tell Sue to cut it out (and my husband to tell Joe the same)? Would I be the asshole for interfering?

Editing to add, after reading the responses and reflecting, I think my being upset was out of some sort of defensiveness for Anne, which I know logically doesn't make sense. Clearly I also need to deal with my grief better 🙈",39.0
474,t3_ruy28v,AITA for expecting my almost 10yr old son to make himself breakfast?,"When I was 19, I had a fling and the result of that was my son, M. His mother and I did try a relationship but that didn’t work so M lives between both our homes these days. He’s 9 and turning 10 next month.

I tend to have him on school holidays as his mother moved them pretty far away when he was 5. He’s a kid so it’s not like I expect lots from him around the house but my wife and I do try to encourage him to be less helpless but it’s like every time he goes back to his Mother he regresses.

Since he was 8, we’ve expected him to make his own bed and clear his plate from the table. Nothing major but it never stuck. Since last year, we taught him how to prepare his own breakfast of either cereal or toast so my wife and I can get an extra 30 minutes in bed on weekends. We leave everything out for him the night before and I’m a chef so I’ve a always stressed kitchen safety with him. However, like everything else, it never stuck. When asked what he does at home for mummy, he claims he isn’t old enough to help her.

I asked her about this last pick up and she blew up on me, saying I’m lazy not feeding him and how it’s really unsafe, how she has to stop him from doing it at home. She thinks children shouldn’t do chores at all and implied if I made him do more (which I will as he ages) it would basically be child abuse.

My son seems comfortable, safe and happy doing the chores we set him but my ex seemed to think we are traumatising him. She is the main caregiver and we don’t have an official custody arrangement (common in 
my country) so I don’t wanna rock the boat or be damaging my son. AITA here?",794.0
475,t3_ruy17p,AITA for ruining New Year’s day,"Background: Hi, so I bought a 4 bedroom house last year, so my family and I can have a house. It’s supposed to be my parents, my little sister (21 YO), and me. I told them my rules are for my house to be clean, no smoking (my dad is the only one that smokes), &amp; pretty much respect the house. I became so strict because when I used to live with my dad and 2 sisters, they didn’t clean much and I was left to clean most of the time. Since I’m a travel nurse, I only stay in this house for 2-3 months more or less. Before I moved in, my sister is the only one that was living with me. While I was away, my parents moved in. A month later, my older sister &amp; my nephew moved into my house also, which wasn’t part of the plan. I didn’t mind since I felt bad for them at the time. Now that I’m back for a break, I feel so unhappy that they’re here! Here’s the reason:
1. Most of them do not clean, except for my mom. She pretty much cleans everything when I’m not around. All their rooms(except for my mom) are messy! My dad smokes in his room as well. 
2. My little sister doesn’t clean the cat litter, so my mom and I have to do it. Her excuse is work, but we all work! 
3. my mom sleeps in the closet that is connected to my room, so I don’t even get my privacy. My dad and my mom don’t sleep together btw. My mom usually sleeps in my room, which is the master, but she doesn’t have any room right now. I told her I can talk to my older sister about it, but my mom claims that she doesn’t mind and likes sleeping there because it’s so dark and she works the night shift, so that’s very important to her. I don’t believe that though, which pisses me off since she’s the one that cleans the most! It’s also inconvenient for me because my clothes are in that closet and I have to be quiet since she sleeps during the day. I also want my privacy as well, but I don’t even have that since my mom can easily go into my room.

So on New Year’s Day, my family was cooking and getting ready to celebrate this holiday, but unfortunately, I was having an anxiety attack, so I just stayed in my room and wasn’t talking to anyone at all. I wanted the time to myself, however, people just kept opening the door, especially my mom since we’re sort of sharing a room. At the same time, both my sisters were coming in to get some clothes from the closet/mom’s room since they also put their clothes there since they had so much. I was just so furious and yelled I WANT MY F***** privacy and also said, one of you (siblings not mom) needs to move out after my next assignment. Now, it’s a weird dynamic in my house. I’m still furious that I bought a house where I don’t even get my privacy. I could’ve dealt with this after New Year’s, but I think I just reached my limit. 

I’m about to leave in a couple of days for work and will be gone for 4 months. Sadly, I feel unhappy coming back to my own house. I pay the mortgages, HOA’s, &amp; their phone bills.",115.0
476,t3_ruxg52,AITA for not giving my condolences to my co-worker after 5 months?,"Hi, I am just wondering if I am the AITA. I have been thinking about this for a while. And I just remembered that 5 months prior, my coworker was on leave due to his grandmother getting COVID.

However, I soon found out from my other coworker that he is on leave because his grandmother died of COVID. But the thing is that, he did not announce it or there was no message about it in our own WhatsApp group with my superior in it.

The problem is, I was too happy about something else that I forgotten all about his grandmother's death.

However, one week later I remembered his grandmother's death and I also remembered that I forgotten to give my condolences to him one week prior. 

I was too scared to give my condolences to him because I was afraid he may get offended by it for being one week late.

So I did not. And 1 week turned to 1 month and 1 month turned to 3 months and 3 months turned to 5 months. 

Now that I think about it, should I give my condolences? Or should I forget about it since it has already been 5 months and most likely he will be pissed off if I give my condolences now. And AITA for not giving my condolences to my coworker after 5 months?

Update: I have decided to message my condolences to my coworker through WhatsApp, he still have not replied yet

Update #2: I guess he turned off his last seen and read receipts since he hasn't replied to my message after 3 to 4 hours. So it seems he has read it but did not reply, oh well.",7.0
477,t3_rux964,AITAH for having a dry wedding and reception?,"TLDR: we are getting married in a church and my future in laws are upset that alcohol will not be permitted. 

I (f22) and my fiancé (m24) are getting married in October. We are not overly religious but I was raised in the church we teach Sunday school each week together and help or host different events at the church. We are getting married at the church I have attended since I was 3 and that we attend together. 

We do not drink very often at all and when we do it is one or two seltzers or wine coolers, most of the time without even finishing half of the second one. The majority of my family does not drink, or do not drink in public. My fiancés family cannot go three minutes without opening another beer or taking several shots. It has led to a lot of conflict at the beginning of our relationship but not so much now. 

He is completely fine having it be a dry event but has told me to expect them to sneak drinks in and bring coolers full of different drinks for the reception. I expect nothing less from them anyway. It really irks me because we are getting married in a church, and we have told them from the beginning that alcohol wouldn’t be permitted. 

His mom got really upset and his dad made several comments about it being boring and what’s the point of throwing a party without allowing drinks? 

Should I try to be more openly accepting of alcohol? If we were not having the reception in the church building it wouldn’t be a big deal to me.

479,t3_ruwzzc,AITA For refusing to voice chat with my overseas friend before his tooth surgery?,"So I just finished moving into a new home. It took me two days. I've been tired, stressed and even anxious that the landlord may be dodgy. So far so good, but I still feel uneasy.

Cue my overseas friend. He's about to have his wisdom teeth removed and we scheduled a VC earlier in the day for a time in the evening. He mentioned his surgery coming up and I figured he's taking it like a champ. 

However, half way through packing, I realise how tired I've become and that I need to rest for at least a couple days before taking on anything extra. So I messaged him telling him how I felt and that I was sorry I couldn't VC with him.

Then he starts guilt tripping me with this message; ""Oh so you're not going to vc with me before the day of my surgery? Very supportive of you"".

I felt very guilty and just told him I basically need to take care of myself before helping anyone else. Not to mention, it can be a little draining talking to him sometimes with his changing moods, so I have to be in a specific mood to talk to him.

Anyway, who do you think's in the wrong here? I tend to have a hard time telling if I'm asserting myself or just being selfish, so I'd like some clarity please. I'm willing to accept it maybe 50/50.

480,t3_ruwwqi,AITA for yelling at my mom to stop calling me her “son” in front of family?,"My mother (48F) HATES the idea of women in the military, you know, because it’s a “man’s job”. Well, I (18F) plan on going into the U.S. Army for Infantry or Field Artillery. Due to my career choice, she began calling me her “son” - and it is driving me insane.

It all began when I sat her down to discuss what I wanted to do in life. I told her that I didn’t like the idea of going to college, and would rather be in a physically demanding field. At first, she thought I had wanted to be a yoga instructor. Of course, I shot that down and told her that I wanted to join the military. She was visibly upset and left for a while. I didn’t blame her. She probably felt bad because I’m her only child and she wanted me to go into some sort of “feminine” career.

She came back 20 or 25 minutes later and told me she was upset to have raised a “boy”. I was confused. I asked her if she was calling me a boy, and she said yes. I was livid. I kept my cool though and asked her not to call me a boy. All she did was shake her head no and walk away.

We are at a NYE party with my immediate family. My mom is the hostess this year. We get to the point where it is time to make a toast. My mom gets up, taps the knife to her champagne glass, and says “I have an announcement to make”. Of course, everyone is listening. She says, and I quote “my son plans on joining the U.S. military. It is a big accomplishment for him”. I immediately get up and yell at her to stop calling me her son. Afterwards, I go upstairs for the remainder of the party. It’s nothing but dead silence from downstairs. 

Everyone is gone and my mother tells me to open my door. I open the door and I kid you not, she put her finger in my face and began yelling at me because I embarrassed her at dinner. I apologized to her (I don’t mean it). After half anhour of being yelled at, she goes to her room and we don’t talk for 3 days.

481,t3_ruwwj4,AITA For Taking What was Supposed to be a Joke too far?," My best friend (21M) and I (18M) have known each other for years and are super close. We hang out almost every weekend and are up for hours at night streaming video games. There is a running joke between our friend group that we are secretly dating with how close we are. We’ve always embraced the joke because it’s harmless and everyone knows we’re not actually a thing, especially now since he’s dating my older sister (20F). She often hangs out with us as well and she is also very familiar with the joke as well. We often tease each other about him, I tease her about being in love and how cheesy she is about it while she’ll tease me back for “stealing her boyfriend.” It’s a fun joke and none of us have had a problem with it, until recently. 

My sister and I both still live with my mom as I’m about to graduate high school and she is trying to save to get an apartment closer to college. Because we live together, my best friend comes over a lot and my mom has heard us joking with each other. She would give us questioning looks about it but never said anything so we didn’t think anything of it. The other night we were having a game night and my friend was coming over so, of course, I was teasing my sister, saying stupid things like “Oh is MY boyfriend here yet?” She laughed it off and we continued bantering until he arrived and again I repeated the ""my boyfriend"" joke. Apparently, my mom overheard and didn’t understand the joke because she walked into the living room and confronted all three of us. She said overhearing everything made her uncomfortable and she felt it bordered on harassment before turning and asking me if I actually had feelings for my friend. What she said honestly pissed me off so instead of just saying no I sarcastically replied, “Yeah and I’m totally trying to break them up so I can have him.” I figured it would be obvious from my tone that I was joking but apparently not as my mom looked appalled by my response. 

Things got tense as I had to properly explain that it was just a joke and I wasn’t actually interested in my friend, though I still don’t think she believes me. The game night was canceled and my friend ended up leaving and now things are awkward when they talk to me. Both of them said they knew it was a joke but I took it too far by joking with my mom and it made everything uncomfortable. I should have just explained or let them explain since now she definitely had the wrong idea. I don’t think I did anything wrong since we all knew it was a joke and my mom could have come to me quietly instead of making a scene about it. AITA?",24.0
482,t3_ruwpmq,AITA for saying I’d pick my cat over my boyfriend?,"For context, I f18 have a cat. I’m not a social person, I’m fairly introverted and prefer to limit how much time I spend around others because it can get very overwhelming. My boyfriend m21, is more of a socialite than me. We don’t live together and I got my cat before we got back together after we took a break. This ties in I swear! 

So here’s where I’m not sure if I am or not. We were at a party, he was intoxicated and asked if I loved him (I answered yes), and then he asked if I loved him more than my cat (I said no). He asked who’d I’d pick between the two of them, if I had too. I answered honestly, I said I’d pick her and that she’s like my child I don’t see her as a pet she’s my kid. He asked why, at this point he was hurt and I could tell I tried to soften my words a bit while I explained. My cat is as much as she’s my kid she’s also the only other living thing besides my plants I can stand 24/7 without feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and just the general feels I get when around other people for periods of time. 

I didn’t want to lie, I understand why he’s upset. I don’t think I did anything wrong though, it wasn’t the answer he wanted and if I even wanted to sugar coat it and tell him I’d pick him over my cat we were at a party and I didn’t have the energy to essentially lie. I’m only asking because he’s still upset with me.

483,t3_ruwp69,AITA for using my mother’s money?,"The title sounds super bad to the point of being a troll— but I assure you there’s more to this story.  

My (19F) mother (60F) has always been a bit controlling. She is your typical Asian Tiger Mom who watches your every move. What’s worse, she also controls all of my finances and paperworks. 

So lo and behold, at the age of 19 I still don’t have a bank account and I still live with her (very common in our country). With the university classes being done online, I also haven’t got any allowance and is fully dependent financially on her.

This is where things start to get interesting. I receive around 100 $ worth of money every 2 months from the local government scholarships. Aside from tuition scholarships, they give students with high grades extra money for incentive. Moreover, my Godmother recently gave me 200$ for pocket money.

My mother proceeded to collect both and refuse to let me spend them on my own. I asked her in advance to let me buy an item from a game I play— but nope, she refused.

This always happens. Every time a relative gives me money for birthday, she pockets it. She buys me clothes and takes me out for spa days, when all really I want are video games or ingame items.

So one day, I sneakily used her Filipino version of Paypal (Gcash) to buy myself in-game items worth 50$. 

I admitted to it to her soon immediately after I made my purchase. I told her to just deduct it to my scholarship money since it should be more than enough to compensate.

My mom went livid and my sister agrees with her saying that I stole money. I don’t understand, the 100 $ I received should be more than enough to repay the stuff I got?

AITA?

EDIT: 
I know people are going to say: You’re 19 now! Move out, get a job, you’re an adult and she does not get to control you! Call the cops and tell her she’s holding your paperworks hostages in the cupboard!

Hahahah no.

First of, she refuses to let me move out and get a job. Not that I can get any, it’s very difficult to get a job at our country. Even university graduates struggle to get jobs.

No, moving out is not an option. It’s a cultural and country thing. It is very difficult to the point of being impossible, unless I want to go homeless.

Next, police and laws here work very different in the west. If I complained about my paperworks, authorities would just laugh at me. Besides that, my mother is influential and is highly connected to the local authorities and lawyers. She’s cousins with the chief of police and my aunt is the head of the DSWD in our town.

484,t3_ruwjg4,AITA for letting a conversation about my love life go too far?,"For context, I have a group of about a dozen friends; we share a discord together, we hang out (safely) often, we're a very tightly knit group.

Recently, someone in the group dmed me asking if I am into another friend in the group. Now I asked this friend out on a date a few weeks before the question was asked, and she turned me down as she was already in a relationship, but we've kept our affectionate friendship and I've since lost romantic interest in her. Sidenote: We host a horror movie watch club together now!

Here's how the conversation went:

Friend 1: So you into \*Friend 2\*?

Me: At a point, yes. Why do you ask?

F1: Wondered if I could tell. At a point meaning not anymore?

M: Yes, we're affectionate friends.

F1: Oh, did she know then?

M: I'm shutting this down. Please don't ask me about my romantic life in the future unless I've made it obvious I'm ok with you knowing about it.

F1: Alright, feel free to tell me that at the beginning

Starting the first question with ""So"" made it feel like he had been speculating this topic, and the ""Wondered if I could tell"" confirmed my suspicions. Now I'm not going to say that speculating about the romantic lives of people you know is wrong, but I was raised in a culture where asking about that kind of stuff in such a direct way is seen as impolite and almost indecent, and that remark made me really uncomfortable.

Admittedly, I could've phrased my request better as I was going along with the conversation up until that point and I didn't expect it to get to that point, but I wanted to know why he was asking me such a personal question, and it still felt like a rude response to someone trying to establish boundaries.

485,t3_ruwg3j,AITA for telling my best friend of 12 years that we cant be roommates anymore?,"My wife and I are entering our 4th year of living with my best friend of 12 years (for financial reasons). He has a very bad habit of not closing or locking doors that lead outside. Saying its a habit is a bit of an exaggeration, but its happened at least a dozen times since we've been living together.

It happened again today after moving into our new house and to me it feels like the straw that broke the camels back. This is my safe place. The place that guards my family (wife and pets), and my possessions. I feel like I can't live with someone who doesn't respect that enough to perform simple tasks like closing and locking doors that lead outside. 

I know that just because a door is open doesnt mean someone's going to come on in to incite violence or robbery, but after having been broken into before, id rather just not leave the possibility there.

The door situation isnt the only thing he does either. His cat destroys our property and fights with our cats. He hoards dirty dishes in his room for weeks on end. And his room smells so bad that if his door. Is opened for even a couple of minutes it takes several hours to get the smell out of the hallway.

He blames anxiety and depression as the reason he continuously does things like this, which I can understand because i also suffer from both, but he refuses to do anything to help overcome them. I've tried helping him because I know its not easy, but he doesn't accept the help. 

I sent him a long message (he shuts down very easily when you try to have a serious conversation with him face to face) outlining how I feel about the situation and how after so many times I cant just let it slide anymore. I said that after this year lease is up we'd have to stop being roommates. I also made it very clear that being a bad roommate DOES NOT equate to being a bad friend...

I'm sorry that this is also very long, I'm trying to space it out so it's easy to understand.

So I'm female and 20 years old. My mother is 41. 

So guinea pigs are one those pets that everyone thinks is easy because they're small, that they don't deserve as much care as cats or dogs. My mother has currently 4 guinea pigs. All in horrible health. She used to 15 in horrible health (they all slowly died of old age or illness). I didn't realize how badly she treats them until about 6 years ago. Ever since I've been trying to get her to be better to them.

Examples of what I mean by ""horrible health"": they're nails are painfully overgrown, they're in the dinkiest tiniest cages ever they can't even run or play! She only actually holds and pets one of them, the others just love in their sad tint cages. They have a very unhealthy diet of purely hay and pellets plus the occasional carrot. They're cages are just ten gallon plastic clear storage crates. 

I hate seeing innocent creatures taken care of like this. I've tried convincing her to get them better things in stop holding them in ways that could hurt them. I can't take care of them myself as I'm severely allergic, I break out in rashes and wheeze. I wish I could buy the things myself but I don't have a job due to health reasons from the past five years. 

Awhile back I met this wonderful lady at PetSmart, who owns a beautiful big guinea pig rescue! Where she nurses them health and takes them to vets! Oh how I'd love them to have a happy life before they eventually pass. 

I'm considering talking to my mother and grandmother (we all love together) about giving them to that lady. But the problem is my mother has awful mental health to where's she's a total narcissist from it, she uses the guinea pig(there more she only holds the one tho like I said before) as ESA/emotionally support animals. I understand my mother is unwell, but I don't think it should mean these tiny animals need to suffer.

487,t3_ruw957,AITA for parking in front of my driveway?,"Alright I'll be honest, and I know what I did was super petty but I really don't think I'm an asshole for it.

I(28F) live in a quiet, suburban cul-de-sac with my wife (37F) and 2 kids(2.5F, 2.5M). The way the street works is essentially, each house has a driveway, and there's normal curb-side parking in front. My wife and I each have a car, and we renovated part of our front yard so that we would have enough room to park both cars off the street. We don't use our garage as it's basically a storage space.

A mum and her teen daughters moved into the house opposite us about a year ago. We've had no issues with them. Enter: The Boyfriend. Each of them has a car so 4 total. Mum and teen 1 both used the driveway, and teen 2 parks in front of our driveway. She's not good at parallel parking and is always 1-2ft off the curb. The Boyfriend decided the best place to park is always front of our house. 

There's no laws being violated, it's just annoying. The Boyfriend is one of these 18-20 year old guys who's entire identity is his car. His car has an Instagram page, it's his pride and joy, he's sat outside our house and blasted music, he sits and revs his engine for 5-20 minutes before leaving, does burnouts in the street and more. He thinks between 11pm-4am is the best time to make all of this noise. It wakes my kids every night. When we went to talk to him, he made some crude hand gestures and some very anti-lesbian comments. After that,  his girlfriend would park in front of our house, then he would park so that his front wheels are in line with our driveway, blocking part of it. If both our cars are home, we can't get out of our drive, and after work I can't safely get in as there's not enough room to move. 

Legally there was nothing we could do, so I figured if I couldn't use my own driveway, I'd just park in front of it myself. The Boyfriend is there when I get home from work, so I have to park in front of him. I would park kind of close to him, as in, I was parking with my rear bumper literally an inch away from him. He didn't like it, and smashed my mirrors with a bat. We pressed charges and he had to pay to replace them, but nothing could be done about parking like a dick because there's sadly no law against being a dick.

Last night he came home and had a street screaming match with his girlfriend at 11pm. We had friends over, and I mentioned this story. Some of them now think I was being a petty asshole for purposely parking so close to his car when we knew it was his pride and joy and deserved to have my car smashed. I know I was being petty, but it worked? He hasn't parked near us for two months so we can actually leave our own house without it being mission impossible.

488,t3_ruw949,AITA for refusing to wear a bra,"So long time lurker first time poster. I 38(f) suffer from chronic pain due to a military injury. Basically, my shoulder has severe arthritis (bone on bone) and I need a shoulder replacement but due to my age and the inability for me to rehab (I’ve also torn up the bicep and stuffed all the tendons) I cannot get the replacement. 

In order to deal with the pain I have had a pain stimulation device put into my spine which disrupts the pain messages from getting to the brain. Between this, pain therapy, medications physio and nerve blocks I can function, but only just. So now it’s just me an my companion pup and every day I take him for a walk locally. We live a block from the beach, which is relatively popular but not over the top, unless it’s a hot day on the weekend.

Up until now, I have struggled into a front clasping bra for the walk and then remove it when I get home again. It’s not comfortable on me in any way, the pressure of the strap on the shoulder plus the getting in and out of it’s a royal pain. But I’ve done it.

Recently, I got COVID and because my immune was down the pain flared, and all medical are on leave so it’s just me at the moment. I decided the pain outweighed the hassle of wearing a bra. Now I’m the first to admit I generally do need one, but to be honest I’m past the point of caring. Getting out for the walk is hard enough but I force myself both for my pup and for me.

So I tend to stick local to my house, around the block at sometimes we go down to the beach. My dog is extremely well trained to not be on a lead (as this is another disaster) which is not allowed where I live so we don’t go too far. So the last week I have been you know what I just can’t do it, but I’m getting flack from strangers and neighbours when I pass them. A few behind my back but still close enough I can hear them, and a few direct to my face with comments such as ‘have you considered wearing a bra’ or ‘the girls hanging free today’ or ‘you really should consider what you wear in public’.

To say emotionally I’m not my strongest right now is an understatement and I hate conflict at the best of times. All I want is to go out for half an hour a day to walk my dog. That’s it, the rest of the time I’m home. So AITA for not wearing a bra while I walk my dog? 

One thing I forgot to note is that he is a VERY slow walker so it’s not like I’m running along Baywatch style.

Edit: thank you so so much for the support, I can’t keep up with all the responses but I’ve read every one and they helped me get the courage to go for a walk today so thank you!! I also really appreciate the options provided and am going to look into them, especially for when I do go places that I have no choice but to wear a bra I may be more comfortable.

489,t3_ruw6lc,WIBTA if I removed my roommates things?,"I(24) live in a apartment where they match you with roommates which I got Mia(19). She was cool at first but the more I got to know her the less often I would come home. Examples- never doing her dishes, breaking several of my dishes, leaving clothes in the washer for days. Normal roommate stuff. Then the not so normal stuff started to happen. She would bang on my door and demanded I do her chores, usually late at night 2/3am. I barely used common spaces at this point and kept all my dishes and cook ware in my room and wash it every time to put it back since she had a habit of breaking my things. She would eat my food and throw away things she didn’t like. Mia took my packages from the mailbox and has only given me back 1 package… after she opened it. Has admitted to taking my packages more than once and “losing them.” I came home one day after work as it was snowing, she had the air turned on to 50, when I asked her not to turn the AC on in the winter she cussed at me and turned it to 90. She’s come into my room thinking I wasn’t home or while I was sleeping. I am missing so many clothes and valuables. She would hit on my partner when they would come over and always be in our space even after we would close my door. My partner eventually felt so uncomfortable they stopped coming over.

After several arguments, I told her I was going to request a apartment change in which she flipped out on me and for 2 weeks. When she came back she told me she had met a boy on tinder and she was moving in with him. Great. She told me she had a subleaser and she would be out by mid December. Fantastic. Mid December I start to deep clean the place, there’s so much damage and trash she left. I documented it all to send to the management. I open her bedroom door &amp; it’s filled to the brim with her things and trash. I sent her a text telling her I was trying to clean for when someone else moves in,ask when she’d come get her things. No surprise, she sent a nasty text back that said she’d come get it the 30/31 of December. I asked that when she comes back to leave the mail key and the key card to our apartment, her response was “f**ck you” and blocked me. I don’t trust her to only get her things so I canceled my plans And stayed home in my room to make sure my things stayed in my room. Lo and behold she came into my room and saw me home “oh sorry didn’t know you were here” and then left with very few things. 

It’s now the 2nd and I go on vacation tomorrow for over a week. I do not feel comfortable with her coming while I’m on vacation for a week. She has left a ton of things in her room and as far as I’m concerned is she had till the end of the year to get her things. She didn’t. So this is where I might be the AH. I want to bag up her things and trash and put it out by the front door for her.",22.0

492,t3_ruw0js,AITA for telling my friend he’s too spoiled?,"Obligatory this is a throwaway

**This took place in school not long before winter break.**

My friend, let’s call him ND is very privileged. Actually we’re both privileged, although his parents probably have more money than mine do, but that’s not the point. **I’m not jealous of him in any way.**

You see, ND comes from generational wealth, so neither his parents nor he really understand the value of money. Recently, we were talking and the topic of vacations came up. He complained that he “hasn’t gone on a flying vacation in 1 whole year,” and, without going into detail, let me tell you he just wouldn’t stop going on about “how crazy that is,” and how it’s “so sad.” He went on for probably 10 minutes or so about it. 

When he talks about flying vacations, he’s talking about nice vacations. I mean very expensive $20k+ vacations that involve flying to somewhere very expensive.

Anyway, around the 10 minute mark or so I realized he wasn’t going to stop, and I will admit I was a little off put by how he was talking. 

Until the 10 minute mark I was basically just kind of going along with what he was saying hoping it would end.

**So I decided to end the conversation by just saying “well let’s not be too spoiled (I said this very playfully). Most people probably can’t even go on such vacations anyway.”**

For whatever reason, my friend immediately was pissed. He started angrily ranting to me that I’m “just jealous” and then stormed off (this was during lunch).

#I am not jealous in any way.

I suppose this could go both ways of whether I’m an asshole or not, so I’m here to ask you guys. Either way I’m probably going to apologize or something but I want t know your opinion (this will effect how I apologize). On one hand, I feel like I didn’t really do anything wrong but I can understand why one would say I’m an asshole so I’m really not sure if I was the asshole or not.

493,t3_ruvxkr,AITA for watching and doing nothing to help my husband when he was extremely ill?,"My (27f) husband ""Tim"" (36m) has a serious dairy allergy. I'm talking about an actual immune system reaction, not intolerance. His allergy is serious enough to cause acute Enterocolitis, but he hasn't needed an epi-pen since he was a kid.

I work full time and also have some seasonal work this holiday season because Tim has been without work, and money has been very tight. As a result, I barely get to rest. The holiday are especially hard, and I found myself getting just one day off every 2 weeks for almost 2 months straight. As you can imagine, that day off means the universe to me. 

Now, Tim LOVES dairy, and will sometimes intentionally eat things which trigger his allergy. Lately, it's gotten out of hand, with him going from one risky meal every 4-6 months, to every 2 or so weeks. In fact, it always seemed to coincidentally line up with my time off, and I found myself spending my one day taking care of him. Last week, I finally asked him if he was intentionally timing it to line up with my day off. I fully expected him to say no, but he admitted that he was doing it to make sure that he'd have a nurse, and so he'd have someone close by in case he had an especially adverse reaction and needed a hospital. I was livid, and told him that he was selfish, robbing me of my rest. I said that if he made himself sick again, I wouldn't take care of him. I'm exhausted and I need to decompress. He didn't say much, so I thought he'd heard me.

Fast forward to Friday night. I get home from work, and a few minutes in, Tim gets a pizza delivered. I ask him why, when I'm making dinner and he shrugs. I ask if a large garlic Alfredo pizza is worth the pain, and remind him that I won't be giving up my rest day again. He smirks and eats an entire slice while grinning at me. I left it at that and went back to my dinner.

Predictably, he got sick, profusely vomiting, retching and groaning from the intense cramping and diarrhea. I slept in the guest room to get away from the sound and smell. He called for me several times and I repeatedly told him no. Hours later, he was still sick and woke me up at the crack of dawn to go get him pedialyte and meds because he was very dehydrated and still in pain. I told him to order it in and asked him to get out and let me sleep. 

He was still whimpering when I eventually got up to shower and eat. Again, I did nothing to help or comfort him. By evening, he was sulking, and by morning when I had to work, he was enraged. He yelled, and by the end of the day he'd told our friends and family that he nearly died and I neglected him. His family accused me of passively trying to kill him. His mom called, shouting that he could've had a life threatening reaction due to my petty actions, and that I'm a shit wife for not minding his health.
I'm starting to feel guilty because she's right and he could've been seriously hurt.

He didn't want to go to emergency for it either (I can't quite remember why.) I had some T3 pills left over from a wisdom tooth removal, and I offered a few to him to tide him over pain wise until Monday. He said no, he could handle it, and I thought that was going to be the end of it.

About a month later, he sent me a text asking if I still had the pills. I told him I did, and asked why. So he sent me a message about a friend's mom that was struggling with pain, and he had offered her the pills without having asked me first. I did not know who this person was, and I didn't feel comfortable providing painkillers to a total stranger, even if my friend vouched for them. I told him this, and it ended up being a big back and forth exchange of him trying to guilt me into giving up the pills, but I refused in the end.

495,t3_ruvvb4,WIBTA for going against my(21F) boyfriend's(22M) mother's(55F) wishes by starting the process of finding a place to live together?,"My BF and I have been together for 6 years now and for the most part of our relationship have lived apart respectively in our family's homes in a somewhat LDR. Just before the pandemic I had moved into my first apartment and began discussions about potentially living together, when COVID hit we had to put a pause on that conversation and have only recently been coming back to this topic. He is interested in moving in together but his main push back against doing so is taking care of his father. His dad (57) had been afflicted with a severe neurological disorder over a decade ago and requires supervision and a caregiver on a daily basis. While they have PSWs to help out now, they've had awful experiences so a lot of the care has been handled by my BF, his siblings (30M and 27F) alongside their mother.

The subject of moving in has been coming up a lot recently as we only saw each other a handful of times in person the last 2 years. Alongside that my BF has been tense with his family lately as his mother has been taking out her frustrations out on him as he's the only child living at home with them. There's more nuance to the relationship between them that I don't feel comfortable sharing very personal details over online, but his current stance is: he loves his mom and will always be her kid but GODDAMN he cannot stand to live with her longer than he needs to.

We talked to his mom about this recently, where we expressed that we're serious about a committed relationship in the long run, which includes us living together. I wasn't asking her for her blessing for marriage but I know down the line I would like to, and learning how to live together compatibly is crucial to making that decision. She's supportive of our relationship but is uncomfortable with him leaving while he's in school and that she still needs a lot of help taking care of his father. She then said that the best options are either me and my BF continuing to live separately or me moving into her house to live with them. 

I'm working full time at a job that requires me to show up in person. I don't mind working while my BF is in school as my own parents help me with rent payments and that the original pre-pandemic move in plan included my BF working part time to help out. If I moved into her house, I would need to find a new stay at home job given I'd need to move cities, and I feel I'd end up getting dragged into running interference in arguments between her and my BF.

I know that there will be more conversations as a next immediate follow-up on this position between us three. It's just more relevant now as I am debating whether or not to renew my lease in the next couple of months, as my roommate will also be moving out then and I would need to downsize to a one bed or studio if I don't find a new one and want to look with him.",4.0
496,t3_ruvv1b,AITA For Being Short With My Fiancé?,"Writing this @2am so I apologize if it gets bit into rambling.

My fiancé (m21), let’s call him A and, I (Nb21) have a 4month old son. Recently we have all 3 gotten sick. I’ve been sick, with what started as a cold, since Christmas. Up until he got sick on the 30th, he helped tremendously with Son. But on NYE A’s shakes turned into a stomach bug. He only spilled his guts once but, has been physically sore and shakey since.

In fear of Son getting it as well, he and I have been camping out in his room. This is Sons first time sleeping nights in his crib, before he slept in a pack n play, next to our bed. In this time, I have gotten sicker. I have been up until between 1:30 - 2:30, the past 3 nights with him, alone. Son is teething, going through a growth spurt and, now he also has a cold. He screams if he’s held in a cradle position. He screams if he’s put down. It’s a struggle and tonight I finally broke down.

Sobbing, I took Son into our room and asked A if he could just hold him for a bit. I told him, “I hurt, I’m sick and, I’m tired. I just can’t do it anymore”. I handed him the baby and walked out. After maybe 3 minutes, I hear son screaming. A hadn’t even sat up, he was just laying there, holding son in the air. I took Son and A said, “You didn’t even bring his binky”.

After 5-10 minutes of my crying in the babies room, bouncing Son, A comes in and again asks what’s wrong. I repeat what I said earlier but, when I look up he’s, not even paying attention to me. A is instead staring at the tv. I get kinda pissed and ask him what he’s even doing in the room. He told me he came to see why I was sobbing. I said, “I told you already”. And he left.

At some point, not sure how long it was after he left. I go back into our room, wake A up again and beg him to take the baby. He again doesn’t sit up and lays Son down, which immediately makes him scream. I explain why A can’t do that, he does nothing so, again I take son back. I beg A to sit up so he can take the baby.

After a bit, he sets the baby in his bed, he screams, I pick him up and bounce him. Then he finally crashes. I go into to our bedroom and apologize to A, knowing I was a bit short with him. To which he tells me I was an AH.

Now, was I most likely short with him? I can almost guarantee it. But I was literally sobbing, in need of help and, was barely receiving it. I don’t think I was being an AH, in the slightest.",16.0

I asked my husband if he could stop smoking around me for the health of the baby when I found out I was pregnant. I already hated the smell of cigarette smoke to begin with. It was just something I dealt with. However, everytime I am pregnant, I always ask him to stop smoking around me just because of all the dangers I have read about secondhand smoke to the unborn baby.

And now I am losing weight due to not being able to hold down food for myself and the baby because of his nasty habit (it is the only thing that causes me to throw up.)

498,t3_ruvl1h,AITA for telling my Mom and Dad that me not coming out to my Grandparents isn't about them?,"So, this happened a year ago. It kind of damaged my relationship with my family a little. I never thought to post the events here because at the time it was a lot. But I decided that I want to reflect and see what I did right, what I did wrong, and learn so that next time things don't escalate.

Basically - I was at a family reunion with my parents. They know that I am gay. The rest of my family did not. I chose not to come out to them because my Grandparents are very religious, and are at such an old age I don't believe it'd be worth the drama to try and win them over. Because of that, to spare my family from drama, only my parents know.

My mom made a comment near the end of dinner before we were going back to the hotel about she was wondering where I'm going to ""adopt my kids from"". I kind of panicked a little because had someone pressed me on the subject of why I want to adopt, it'd put me in an uncomfortable position of either 1. having to figure out how to lie on the spot or 2. coming out unexpectedly. It wasn't that big a deal. In the car, I told my mom how I felt, and she apologized.

My Dad then said ""I don't want you coming out to my Parents anyway, because it'll put stress on them."" to which I replied ""To be frank dad, me not coming out to them isn't really about them...it's about me and my safety."" To which the whole thing escalated as my Dad didn't understand why my Mom's comment was a big deal in the first place, and that I was being unreasonable. We ended up in a shouting match in the street outside our hotel, which is embarrassing, and then I drove to stay at another hotel for the night, making my parents cry.

I eventually just let it go so that we could move on but...I don't think that was the right way to move forward. We eventually apologized, though I still don't think my parents understand my position. I want to know if I really was the asshole, if so what can I do better; if not, how do i handle situations like this better so they don't blow up.

499,t3_ruvkwh,AITA for kicking a bridesmaid out of our wedding after she tried to come between my husband and I?,"Background: My husband has a friend (33, M). They met at an old job and the friend ""Mike"" even had my husband as his best man when he got married to ""Abby"" (30, F). After Mike and Abby had a baby, things went down hill and they got divorced.  Things are still tense between Mike and Abby but my husband has remained neutral and tried to be there for the baby at the very least.

Abby and I hit it off pretty quickly when we met. The daughter became a niece to me as well. Abby even housesat for us on occasion.

Knowing the history and relationship with my husband and Mike, she knew Mike would be invited to our wedding. She wasn't fond of it but she seemed to respect our decision.  After we got engaged, I asked her to be a bridesmaid and the daughter to be our flower girl. Both were very excited about it. Knowing that weddings were still a sensitive subject with Abby, I let her know that if she felt like she had to back out, I understood and we would still be friends.

A few months later though,  Abby started getting more upset that he would be invited to the wedding. Knowing that Mike probably wouldn't be able to make it due to his work schedule, we assured her that he wouldn't be coming but he was still due an invite.

One day, we mentioned the daughter being our flower girl to Mike and he was surprised.  We had assumed that he already knew. I texted Abby right away to let her know that he now knew but I thought it was weird that it hadn't been brought up yet. She responded with ""Is he invited to the wedding?"". She knew he was. That had never changed. I answered ""Yes, you knew that already though."" She didnt respond that night. The next morning we received a group text from her to my husband and I telling us that she wouldn't be attend our wedding because he was invited. Also, that she couldn't believe we would do this to her and she could no longer be friends with us because ""true friends would not put her in such a horrible situation.""

I told her that I respected her decision not to come to the wedding but tried to encourage her that we could still be friends. At first, I thought she was just projecting her hurt from the divorce and that she would come around. The next day she privately texted my husband that I had told her that I didnt love him anymore, apologized to him for having to back out, for not being able to be there for him, and that he deserved so much better than me.  He told her that she needed to apologize to me.

At that point, I had had enough. I told her she had crossed too many lines and to send back our house key because she was no longer welcome in our house or around us. She did send the key back, addressed only to my husband and our past Christmas cards, everything in the bridesmaid proposal box and a paper revealing a surprise for my upcoming bridal shower.

However I only have 7 credits to go before I get a diploma. 
I feel an incredible amount of pressure from my dad specifically. When he was my age he dropped out with only 2 credits left and it's one of his biggest regrets. 
Schools in my town are also super strict about attendance and the one I go to is the second you get 3 absences you're kicked out. You can't take your phone out at all, even to check the time, or you have to put it in a phone locker for the rest of the day.
School also cuts into time I could be at work, I work at a place I'll call Green Wall. I love my job and the people there make me feel welcomed and loved. My anxiety hardly ever rises above a mild take a second to breathe and keep going.
I want to drop out because at school my anxiety can get so bad that I'll hide in the bathroom for up to 20 minutes just to calm myself down. I know I don't have a lot to go, but I can't afford therapy on my own and I'm scared to ask my parents because 'they don't believe in shrinks'. I'd have to pay bills, which I honestly don't mind.

My other roommate is completely indifferent to getting another cat so the decision will have to be made between me and my gf. There’s several reasons why I have issues with getting a second cat, one being we don’t know if our current cat gets along with other pets since we got her at a shelter, and we might have to get rid of the new kitten after getting attached to it if it doesn’t work out. Our cat is very playful and hyper with us but it’s hard to say whether or not she’ll like the other one. Another reason being she’s planning on getting a kitten which I know are super hyperactive and a lot of work, not to mention the fact it’d be double the amount of hair in our small apartment. I should also mention she’s getting a kitten because our current cat is also young and has had kittens of her own, and they would most likely get along better. The current cat we have (as much as I love her) is annoying enough as it is, waking me up when I’m sleeping, knocking shit over, and screwing with my fish tank. My gf’s argument is that she will be completely responsible for taking care of both cats (this includes paying for everything and cleaning up after them), and she’s also thinking of fostering a cat instead of adopting it in case it doesn’t work out, but that doesn’t mean that the new kitten will still not be disruptive to me, and I believe I have a say when it comes to this decision because it will still have an impact on my day to day. Am I the asshole?",3.0
503,t3_ruv6sx,AITA for lashing out at my “friend” after she spread rumors about me?,"I am a 13 year old male and my “friend”’s fake name is Christina, and my real friend’s name is Kylie.

Me and Christina had a lot of conflict in our friendship so we stopped for a bit and became friends again.

This year I got a new friend, Kylie who was a lot nicer to me. Well… guess what happened. Christina started rumors that me and her were dating, it didn’t bother me at first I even joked along until… the entire school was spreading the rumors.

There were even rumors that me and Kylie banged in the school restroom and that I was suspended for making out with her in gym (we don’t even have the same gym class and I was sick when I stayed home).

Eventually Christina tried bringing it up before English class started and I honestly snapped and yelled at her. Kylie cried after the class and I reported everything to the teacher.

I then found out Christina lied saying I raised my fist to her and that I “did it to her with four people”. I will admit that I did indeed ship her with other people in the group as a joke and then stopped after a few weeks.

She did this for months however and spread it everywhere around the school, and she made fun of me for reporting her.

My best friend from that group even stopped talking to me and I’m 99% sure she lied about me to him.

However I feel kind of bad for it and I’m starting to think I was in the wrong… so Reddit, AITA?",3.0
504,t3_ruv23y,AITA for falling asleep early on new years,"I m25 have been dating my f24 gf for 3 years. We both live together and live pretty exciting lifestyles. Lots of partying but we know how to keep it in check.

I recently started a new job and got a sizable pay bump.  The job has extremely sporadic hours. Sometimes I’ll get off 2 hours early and other times I end up working a 12 hour shift.  Me and my gf were fine with this since there was stability with this job and the pay was just too good to pass up.

Well the night before New Year’s Eve there was an emergency and I was scheduled to be the on call guy to go in to help. I ended up working from 4am to 11am. I was tired the rest of the day and tried sleeping but couldn’t get much because I was still stressed from work. 

Me and my gf went to my friends house for a small New Year’s Eve gathering. I asked my gf if we could leave early since I’m tired. She asked me if I could just tough it out this once since it’s New Years. That pissed me off especially since I was cranky so I ended up falling asleep in my friend’s guest bedroom. My gf woke me up pissed that I missed the countdown. She said that she was all alone for the countdown and she felt super lonely for most of the night. My gf then told me that I was behaving like an asshole for sleeping at a party and leaving her alone. I told her she has no fucking right to tell me to stay awake considering I’m the one who had to wake up in the middle of the night to work a 7 hour shift. She was pissed and I ended up getting the silent treatment when we got back home. We talked about it and I explained how stressful my night was and she was a bit more understanding but still believes that I shouldn’t have went to sleep at the party. I still disagree with her and we just agreed to disagree. We’re both over it but I still think I’m right.",24.0
505,t3_ruuxtx,AITA for telling my cousin not to have children?,"I’d like to start by saying that I’m not a fan of “everyone raises their children as they see fit”. I believe that you should be prepared and informed as much as you can. In my country there’s a LOT pf old wives tales, and despite the many scientific and reliable information out there, people still choose to keep on believing and enforcing these tales, which can be really dangerous to the child sometimes. Now to the story.

I (35f) have a two year old daughter and a 3 months old son. I breastfeed him exclusively. We had a family reunion yesterday, and there were a lot of alcohol involved. One of my uncles offered me a beer, and I politely declined because I’m breastfeeding. Cue the rambles of many family members saying that one beer it’s not gonna hurt me, and that beer can help me with my milk production. I told them that that wasn’t actually true, it’s a myth, and it can be harmful for the baby. 

One of my cousins then says: “Two different opinions huh? Well, when I have children I’m choosing to believe that beer helps me with my milk production.” I said that it wasn’t an opinion, it’s a fact, a scientific fact and that she could look it up. She rolled her eyes and replied with: “everyone raises their children as they see fit”, so I told her: “that way of thinking is naive and irresponsible, so please don’t have children”. She got pissed and said that I was being ridiculous since she isn’t even pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, but I pointed out that it didn’t matter because if she really thinks that following a harmful myth just so she doesn’t have to quit beer is correct, then she really shouldn’t be a parent.  She got up from the table saying that I should mind my own damn business. I don’t know, maybe I should, but I really believe that if you choose to bring a child into this world, you should exercise your parenthood responsibly and stop following old wives tales when we live in an era that no longer requires us to do so, I mean, it has never been easier to find reliable information. But then again, I guess it really isn’t my business. 

So, give it to me straight Reddit community, am I the asshole?

Edit: Guys, several of you are telling me that I’m outdated or that I haven’t done my research, but I assure you that I have; the CDC and the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) say that the safest way to go is no alcohol, but they confirm that one drink per day may not be harmful for the baby as long as you wait two hours before breastfeeding. The AAP also confirms that drinking beer does not help with milk production. 

I should also specify that the tale in my country is that you should drink two cans of beer a day so you can boost milk production, and that’s why I said it wasn’t true, no amount of beer will help with milk production and the fact that they are suggesting drinking several cans a day is indeed harmful to the baby.

506,t3_ruuxs1,AITA for changing my Netflix password,"Backstory: me (27M) has a friend who we were roommates (43M) for 2 years. We were smoking w**d and watch Netflix together.
I was living with my (now ex) partner and we agreed to let him stay with us. My Netflix was already full with accounts from me, my sister, my mom, my brother and a colleague of mine kids. So I gave my roommate my password and my profile PIN so he can watch when I'm not at home. 1 year later when his son turned 18 (he became legal in our country) his son decided to move out of his mom and move in with his dad so they can smoke every day and chill.
A few months ago I decided to move from country and go live in Europe after he moved with his son 1 month before me. So we were still close, but not that close. 
My sister decided to open an Netflix account for her and told my mom to use her account. So now I have 2 open profiles. I immediately changed those 2 profiles to my colleague adult profile and the other profile I changed for my friend and his son. I told them both on the same day. My colleague was happy, because now she can also watch Netflix and not only Pepa Pig and the other kids movies. 
My friend on the other hand completely ignored my update to use the new profile. Now the reason why I wanted to remove them from my profile is because the son only watches movies in Spanish and doesn't go back to English when his done. Now because we were on lockdown again but I need to work, I didn't have time to watch Netflix for a whole 2 months (I kept paying because of my colleague) last week I finally got a few days off, I wanted to watch Netflix. When I opened my Netflix account, it was completely in Spanish. I got mad and immediately changed my PIN and went to sleep. (I was so mad I completely forgot that I wanted to watch Netflix). 30 minutes later my phone was ringing. I woke up and saw that my friend's son was calling me. I didn't answer, because I already know why he was calling me. He called me 3 times, then stopped because it was 1 AM and I think his father told him to not call me this time. 
In the morning at 7 AM I got a call from my friend. I answered the phone still sleepy, as soon I answered I heard : I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WAS H*GH LAST NIGHT OR DR*NK, BUT YOU CHANGED MY NETFLIX ACCOUNT AND NOW I CAN'T WATCH MY SERIES! WHAT'S THE PIN SO I CAN WATCH MY SERIES?
I simply waited him calm down, and told him that there's an open profile for more than 6 months with your name on it that you can use. He said no, he is watching something on my profile and he wants to finish it before going to another profile.
Now they are both mad at me, because I don't want to give them my Netflix PIN.

507,t3_ruuud6,WIBTA is I stop my mom moving my dads ashes?,"This is my first time posting and English is not my first language so I appologise in advance for any mistakes and for the long post.

Background: My dad died soon before my 16th birthday (2008). I can not give details because of the rules on what is allowed to write about here. The loss was sudden and devastating. My family (at that time mother (54), brothers (29, 28, 17), SIL (28) and I) all went to therapy both as a family and individually.

I now live with my husband about an hour away from where I grew up. In the years since we lost my dad I went to the cemetery to have a place to feel close to him. I still visit his gravesite regularly, but not as often as I used to. My brothers live further away with their now wifes and children. My mom now lives close to my youngest older brother and his family.

My mom has bipolar disorder and had a big setback in treatment, when my dad died. In the years that have passed she is back on medication, but does not think further therapy will help. My mom is unstable and her relationship is rocky with all of us and our partners. She is a caring grandmother, which is amazing, though she is not dependable in their relationships with her either.  

Where I wonder if I WBTA is if I do not agree to move my dads ashes. 
My mom has mentioned that she wants to move his ashes and bury them in a cemetery close to where she now lives. In our country you are not allowed to move a gravesite before 15 years has gone by (which will be in 2023) and all next of kin (spouse and adult children) have to agree.

My mom mentioned this the first time about two years ago when she moved. At the time I tried to explain to her that it did not feel right for me to move his remains. Both because I instinctively feel as if the last resting place is not to be desturbed and because I have always used the gravesite as a place for comfort which would be harder for me to do if it is moved 3 hours away.
My mom said that we could wait to talk further when the deadline was closer and I honestly hoped she would change her mind, which she often does. She has not though and I do try to see it from her point of view. She does not use the gravesite as comfort and can go years without visiting it, but she does like to feel close to him. Her feeling keeps being that his ashes should be near her. I can stop the move happening because of the rules in our country but I wonder if I WBTA if I do. My brothers do not wish to move the ashes but they do not wish to upset my mother either and they think they will agree to it. My 3 SILs and my husband think that we should say no because we do not feel comfortable with it.

I know we should not say yes just to please our mom because she can become frighteningly mentally unstable, but I wonder if - all else aside - the right thing to do is to say yes, if she still feels that it is the right thing and it would mean much to her. Am I being selfish if I stop the move?

508,t3_ruuqr6,AITA For “Playing Around” When my friend got $90 worth of in game credits taken,"My friend and I play a game on xbox called “Rocket League” which has an in game trading system and an official club for people who want to trade. Trading isn’t the whole game but its still VERY actively participated in.

Well theres things called credits that you can buy ($10=1000 credits) and my friend saw a link for free credits in the xbox official club and clicked on it even though I told him it was a really dumb idea.

Then he’s surprised when all his items are gone and theres someone else on his account. Then, he checks his inventory and 9,000 credits are the only thing sitting in his inventory but it was bought with his card. I told him to change his password and he does but It didn’t work

Luckily, he can request a refund but xbox nor his bank has gotten back to him yet. Before you can trade the credits theres a 7 day lock on them and he told me to take the credits from him once the timer is up because the people on his account were planning on taking the credits after it

I agree and Im about to trade but It doesn’t work because I need to give something of mine to accept the credits. I said I’d give him whatever item he wanted because he’s got his stuff taken and is poor and then he leaves the party. I see he’s in the party with a random guy so I join and It is the person that took his account talking to some other random. Long stort short he takes the credits and sells them for real money and buy a bunch of stuff with his dads card.

He finally gets his account back by changing his email and is heated. I forgot to mention he’s 15 and that was half of his Christmas money plus the money spent on his dads card. He said it was my fault for playing around when we were trading for the credits and Is currently getting yelled at as I write this.

509,t3_ruujhg,AITA for missing NYE with my family,"I (22f) originally posted in r/offmychest but now I’m really confused and wondering if I’m in the wrong. It’s a long post so i can’t repost the original one. 

The main situation is that my parents never approved of my now ex boyfriend. We were together for 6 years and have broken up recently because he’s moving to another country. We’ve stayed friends because we still care about each other and none of this was supposed to be an ugly breakup. We hang out often. My parents don’t agree with the “situation”

Background on my parents. I’m an only child and have always been close with them. But they’ve been controlling before and have cut people out of my life (an emotionally abusive high school bf). They moved away a few months ago for work and I stayed in our family home. I contribute a little to rent and pay for my food and utilities. 

They came back to visit for Christmas and I made sure to spend a lot of time with them. I asked permission to see my friends for NYE, which they said yes to. They even dropped me off. I didn’t give them all the details and subsequently plans changed. We went to where my ex was house sitting instead and I didn’t tell my parents till morning. They blew up and have essentially accused me of lying and being manipulative to see my ex. They also said I haven’t put this family or myself first. But I’ve told them very recently I’ve decided to move back in with them to take the financial burden of renting two places off of them. They also said that I must cut my ex off or be risk ruining my relationship with them. They also threatened to kick me out.  I told my ex and now he’s not talking to me on the basis that this whole situation is childish. Idk what to do or what to think.",2.0
510,t3_ruui29,AITA for wanting time rather then money?,"I (20f) and my fiancé (23m) are expecting our first child later this month. He has a government job and makes enough that I do not have to work unless I want to. I am currently on maternity leave, and not sure if I’m going back or not. I’m a preschool teacher, and kinda wanna take a few years off to spend time with baby. (Anyways not the issue just some background) 

My fiancé is only supposed to work 8 hour shifts 4 to 5 days a week however I knew going into this that he is required to work a lot of overtime in the first few years since he is currently in an apprentice role and will be for the next year. He works about 16 hours 5-6 days a week and when he finally gets home he just sleeps, and on his one day off he sleeps all day. 

He wants to give me everything I never got growing up. Don’t get me wrong I love that he wants to give me the world, it’s just that he’s never home, and with our son coming into the world very soon, I’ll be all alone to take care of little man. I’m really scared and Ive been feeling so alone lately. Neither of us have any family near us as we have moved to follow his career. I knew what I signed up for so I feel like I have no place feeling this way, but I can’t help what I feel. I wish he could be at home more so he can spend time with baby and I.  

Anytime I bring up maybe calling out or asking for a week or two off after baby’s born he shuts me down saying he has no right to ask for this time off especially since he’s already going to have to ask for time off for our wedding in June. I understand he doesn’t wanna ask for more time off then he needs to, but I mean this is just as important as getting married and he barely wants to take time off for our wedding. 

It’s making me feel like he doesn’t care about our wedding or about the birth of our son. I know in my heart he’s excited about our son and our wedding, but sometimes it really feels as if he doesn’t give a shit. Bottom line is I’d rather have all the time in the world together rather then have a whole bunch of money and all the fancy stuff he wants to get for us, but he’d rather have the money.

511,t3_ruuhra,AITA for making a 16 yr old girl cry on her first day of work?,"So this was at my previous job which was fast casual restaurant. I’m 20(f) and she was 16. She applied to the job when she was 15 but couldn’t start until she was 16 so she ended up waiting for two months before she actually started. I came in to work and was she was introduced to my coworker and I. She was shadowing my coworker and I was basically manager (but not really, not important). The shift was only 5 hours long and it was extremely busy and we were understaffed. She was standing with her back faced to the customers and people were getting upset because she was “ignoring” them. They didn’t realize she was training and didn’t know how to use the system so I asked her to stand away from the register. Apparently that made her very upset and uncomfortable. At another point during the shift I was just trying to make conversation and I was like “what a night to start, right? It’s crazy busy!” Idk was just trying to say anything to have her talk to us because she didn’t say a word throughout the shift. After about 3 hours her and my coworker toook a break and she never came back. At the end of the shift my boss came up to me and my coworker and asked about our experience with the new person. My coworker said it was good and I said “we didn’t talk much but it seemed fine”. Apparently she didn’t think so. She emailed my boss saying she left work crying. She said I made her upset and uncomfortable. She said I said things like she wasn’t welcome here, “I didn’t know why she was there”, she needed to stand away from us, and just that I generally just made her feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I definitely didn’t tell her to get away from us and I didn’t say why are you here. So was it just a misunderstanding or did I do something wrong?

512,t3_ruuhas,AITA for defending a coworker against another coworker?,"I work with a large team of a dozen staff for a couple of months now. Today I found out that a coworker (Jasmine - not real name) I’m fairly close to has been auditing/checking other people’s work and comparing productivity-measure to another coworker (Hugh). The topic of their conversation was James (whom I’m fairly close to as well). Now as a disclaimer I am on very good terms with everyone on my team and I always bring good vibes every time we are on. 

Today I found out that Jasmine had been gossiping with Hugh about James’ work and how much/little he’s been working day in and out. I don’t really believe in team members looking over others work needlessly (especially when there was no issue to resolve with this person and he had never been flagged for slacking). I stood up for James to Hugh saying that this needs to stop as James informed me that he was stressed and upset by the fact that other team members are looking at our work. 

I agree whole-heartedly with James that this move will create an unhealthy toxic environment and urged Hugh to not conspire with Jasmine any further. Hugh was apologetic but Jasmine is probably unaware that this conversation was happening today. I wanted to confront Jasmine to tell her to stop but I think I lack the authority and brevity to do so. Jasmine has been known to do this regularly (looking at other peoples work and complaining about other staff’s “laziness”). I consider Jasmine a close coworker of mine but I don’t agree with everything that she does/says. I don’t think her judgment is impartial/objective enough. Am I the asshole for standing up for another coworker against her? 

I now fear that she will conspire against me as I went behind her back to advocate for James.

513,t3_ruugmk,AITA for confiscating all the spoons after my mother used some to apply cream to my grandmother's hemorrhoids?,"My grandmother has dementia and needs to be monitored 24/7, but, as a family, none of us want to put her in a home. So my grandfather, my mother, my father, my wife, and myself have moved into one big house with her to share duties, as our work schedules don't allow any of us to be at home with her 24/7 as needed.

My grandmother has hemorrhoids and needs cream applied daily. My mother has been exclusively responsible for this since my grandmother is uncomfortable with anyone else helping with her intimate areas. For ease of application, my mother has been using the backs of spoons to apply the cream each time. However, rather than using one spoon and keeping it apart from the rest, I found out a couple of days ago she's been using different spoons, washing them thoroughly, and then putting them back in the drawer with all the other spoons we use to eat.

I was grossed out by this revelation, and when I told my wife and grandfather, they were equally disturbed. So I collected all the spoons, put them in a bag, and put them away to never be used for eating again (knowing my mother, more than a few will have antique or sentimental value, so I didn't throw them away). 

Where we live I couldn't go to the shop to buy replacement spoons for 2 days, but we had a big pack of wooden spoons in the cupboard I had purchased and which I thought would suffice for 2 days before I bought replacements.

When my mother got home that evening and saw there were no spoons in the drawer, she sternly asked me where they were. I explained in an equally stern tone that because of the hemorrhoid situation, I'd taken them out and put them in a bag, and that there are plenty of wooden spoons to use for the next 2 days, and that I'd buy brand new spoons of all kinds as soon as I could the day after next. My mother protested that we use the confiscated spoons at least until I could get new ones, but I explained I wasn't willing to do that since neither I nor my wife nor my grandfather wanted any of those spoons to touch any plates or cups we might use, or to end up being used to serve out portions of leftovers or ice cream, thus making contact with the portions left in the containers that we might want later. My mother somewhat begrudgingly agreed and that was the end of the issue until today.

Today, my mother and my grandfather told me how angry my father is about what I did, and he's been ranting about how entitled and indulged I am.

Now, as of this moment, I have more than fully replaced all the spoons. In fact, we now have more spoons of every type than we had before this incident, plus they're all brand new, and they all match perfectly as well. As a result, we're actually in a better position with regards to spoons now than we were before this all happened. However, my father is still acting moody and complaining about how entitled I am.",401.0
514,t3_ruufwl,AITA Am I the asshole for snitching on my younger brother?,"Hi, so I (23f) live by myself in london and my family all live in a different city over two hours away. So just to give some context I moved away from home for work and have refused to return home due to a toxic family situation and abusive family members. This situation is still ongoing and my mother refuses to address it or fix it so I have refused to return. I come from a very strict conservative family with a lot of double standards between males and females. All the stuff I got in trouble for growing up e.g. having make friends, being in relationship, going out with friends, speaking to my friends after 9/10pm, dressing a certain way etc. This was all ignored when it comes to my elder brother (28) and my younger brother (21). Now in the past 2 months I decreased the amount of contact and visits I had with my family so instead pf going home every weekend I go home maybe once a month now. My family all say they miss me and that they want me to return home, especially my younger brother who is always asking when I’m coming back to see them. Now to the present day, I haven’t been well for over a week now, It was just a flu and I was stuck at home for over a week now, and just when I got better 2 days ago, my time of the month came around. My younger brother (21) called me 2 days ago saying he was staying half an hour away from me for work and would really like to see me and stay with me for a day before returning back home. I refused at first as I was in pain but thought it would be unfair to him as he’s always saying he wants to come see my house and stay so I agreed. So yesterday I called him at 3pm and asked where he wanted to be picked up from, he gave me a random petrol station in the town 20 minutes away from me. He said he was with some friends and wanted to chill with them for a bit and not to mention it to mum so I agreed. I go to collect him at about 7pm, buy us both some food and come home - he says nothing the whole ride home, he’s glued to his phone. I put a movie on for us to watch as we eat and again he’s glued to his phone. We finish eating and continue watching the movie and 15 minutes later I look over and he’s fallen asleep, so I put a duvet and blanket on him and leave him to sleep on the sofa while I go to bed. Not even 15 minutes later I hear him laughing and shouting at the top of his lungs on the phone to some friends, who from the sounds of it didn’t seem like great influences, I could hear at least 2 girls and guys - this is something i would have had my phone confiscated for at his age by my overly protective elder siblings and my parents. I had been beaten in the past for speaking to a guy and my siblings had stopped speaking to me for months at a time for this too. Anyway back to the story, I thought I’m not going to be overbearing like my older siblings were and I’d leave him to it as he’s a grown man and completely within his rights to speak to whoever he wishes. All I asked was that he keeps the volume down. Not this started around 9pm, multiple times throughout the night I went down and asked him to keep it down as I could hear him from upstairs with all the ruckus he was making. I couldn’t sleep the whole night because of the noise and the sounds of his friends shouting and swearing on the phone all night. Eventually he falls asleep around quarter to 8 in the morning. And I know if I sleep now my day will be wasted, so I get up, clean up the house, make breakfast, take a shower. Around 10:30 I wake him up and ask if he wants to eat breakfast and go out together. He tells me he’s not hungry, he wants to sleep for a bit longer and that he doesn’t want to go out, his friends are going to come get him. I let him know that I don’t want his no good friends coming to my house or knowing my address and left him to it. So I start getting ready as I had a few errands to run. I call my mum and tell her I hadn’t slept all night because he’d been creating a ruckus all night on the phone. She replies with “oh I know he does the same thing at home and doesn’t listen when I tell him off.” She also said that the people on the phone were his work colleagues LOL, if I was ever caught speaking to even my female best friend at 4am my mum would have confiscated my phone, and beaten my ass as a punishment. So this was all just a bit hypocritical to me. So anyway I get ready and go out but I have to come back soon for a parcel delivery. When I return at around 1pm he’s awake, I make some breakfast for him and again I ask if he wants to do anything, he just grunts along and says yeah whatever while being glued to his phone again. So he gets ready and we go out shopping. We only shop for about an hour before we’re at the tills in a store and he faints on me, after telling me he’s really hot. So after a lot of panic in the store I pick him up and take him home. I send him up to bed and tell him to rest a while, I lay on the sofa to sleep myself as I hadn’t slept the whole night. Now he was supposed to go home today but I didn’t want him falling ill on the way home on the train so I said he can stay an extra day and go the following morning. I’ve called my mum and informed her about what had happened and she as usual overreacted and I had to assure her he was perfectly fine, just probably dehydrated and sleep deprived. He goes up to rest and alas I hear the laughing, shrieking, shouting and swearing again, he’s on the phone again with these so called friends. I listen to them talk rubbish to each other for before falling asleep on the sofa myself as I hadn’t slept all night. I wake up a few hours later at around 8pm and ask him what he’d like to eat, while I’m on the phone downstairs ordering food for him I hear him on the phone AGAIN, same volume. I collect the food and we eat together and continue the movie from the night before that he fell asleep during, now he’s glued to his phone for this movie too, the movie finishes and I start a different one and I see he’s falling asleep. It’s about 12pm now and I tell him to go to sleep in my bed upstairs and I’d sleep downstairs. He goes to bed and again the same noise the same ruckus has started, again I tell him to keep it down, my neighbor even bangs on the wall twice in frustration. I go upstairs again and tell him to keep it down, I’ve said it about 5-6 times now. Eventually I just resort to putting a tv show on and hoping the noise will drown him out. I wanted him to feel comfortable and free in my house and not feel like I was watching over his shoulder or being overbearing like I had experienced, I wanted him to be able to escape the drama and violence of my mums house and feel safe and relaxed in my house. So I didn’t want to say too much as it was the first time he was staying with me and I wanted him to have fun, but it was quickly becoming apparent that he hadn’t come to spend time with me at all, he had come to have freedom from my mums house and do as he pleased knowing I wouldn’t say anything to him, but it was all getting a bit too much, especially considering the fact my mum had defended his behaviour, the same behaviour I would be shunned, punished and abused for. So 3:30am rolls around and I resort to turning off the internet on just his device. It shuts him up for 5 minutes before he turns on his mobile data and starts again. 4am and I call my mum, I explain to her very angrily that he’s been on the phone to these random people saying all sorts of vile things all night, I hadn’t slept and I had planned to take the day off work to watch him the next day in case he fell ill again and I wasn’t going to do that anymore. Im not a babysitter. I told her these so called work friends he was speaking to were actually random girls and guys and she needs to stop defending him because of it was me she would have a completely different outlook. I told her to call him and tell him to turn the call off and that I would be waking him up nice and early at 9am and ready to be dropped at the train station to go home as I was not wasting a whole work day on him. His behaviour was selfish, rude and downright inconsiderate. He had not come to spend time with me he had come for some freedom from my mums home. So she assured me when he returned she’d investigate exactly who these people were that he was talking to at 6am claiming to be his work colleagues and who these girls were that he was speaking to all day and night, which I highly doubt is going to happen anyway. So she called him and instructed him to leave his phone downstairs with me. So he comes down and asks what happened And I lose my temper and tell him exactly how I felt, i told him I didn’t want to baby him but if he wanted to behave like a child then he would be treated like one.  He asked me why I didn’t just come and take his phone and I reiterated that I was neither his mum or his babysitter, he was a grown man that should know how to behave without punishment. I told him i wanted him awake in the morning and I was going to drop him off at the train station to go home before I went to work. He protested saying I could go to work and he would leave later in the day himself and I refused, I told him I wasn’t stupid and I knew he wanted me out of the house so he could go joyriding with his no good low life friends all day under the pretence of being at my house so my mum wouldn’t question it. I said if he was ever going to come to mine again, it would only be with my mum as I was not going to tolerate his shitty behaviour and babysit him again. I told him I had made my point clear and I wasn’t going to argue any further. He them left his phone downstairs like a 12 year old child and went upstairs to bed. And now I have sat here and typed all this out in my rage and frustration as he has ruined my sleeping schedule and I can’t go back to sleep now. So tell me, am I the asshole?",0.0
515,t3_ruud2o,AITA for taking apart my daughter's calculator without telling her?,"I (51M) have a very close relationship with my daughter (19F). Due to the pandemic we are currently living together and she is doing her university work term at home. 

Just tonight we got into a disagreement. While she was showering I was doing some house cleanup and found her broken pink calculator from 8th grade. It had stopped showing any numbers so we bought her a new one, the same brand that she still uses even today. I had been intending to fix it but never got around to it until now. However it seems the screen problem was beyond fixing and so I was going to throw it out.

I thought it was fine since she knew it was broken and has two new calculators that she uses now. However, her mother (my wife, 48F) told my daughter after she was done showering that I was going to throw out her calculator after taking it apart and she was furious. My wife appears to have not specified it was the broken pink calculator from middle school that I took apart and was planning on throwing out and it was not the pink calculator that still works and she is using. My daughter was furious though. She thought I accidentally broke her new calculator and then snapped that she felt like I betrayed her trust by deciding to take apart her calculator and then throw it out without talking to her about it first.

I thought she already knew about the broken calculator, when I did explain it to her she said she knew about her broken calculator but she was still angry about it. She said that she wasn't told about it being the old calculator and because she forgot about it at the moment and remembered the new one being downstairs, she thought it was the new one I dismantled. She says that I betrayed her trust by going through her belongings without her knowledge or consulting.

TL:DR: I took apart an old broken calculator my daughter had while she was showering. She thought I broke her new calculator and feels like I betrayed her trust by dismantling her calculator and planned to throw it out without talking to her first.",3.0

She depends on our mother to watch her daughter. Occasionally my mother will be in over her head or busy and push me to watch my niece. Barely giving me a chance to say no or invalidating whatever plans I have. I do not work but my partner does and pays for my portion of the bills while we live here due to a situation out of my hands. I feel bad because I know she took us in when we needed that help.

517,t3_ruuafn,WIBTA telling someone I have yet to meet that they should postpone other plans,"I want to see someone I met online. Just meeting up, getting to know each other and seeing how it goes. No talks so far about anything serieus. We've been talking online for a while, but that person has very little time and lives in a different city that is about half an hour away. When I see or straight up date someone, I make sure I have plenty of time that day. In december, I didn't mind the lack of time due to the holidays. The person also told me that there were other issues and was stressed. So stressed that the cancellation almost seemed permenent, but we are in contact again.

Now we can finally meet up, and settled for a day and time, but this person cannot travel and I don't have a car. This is not a big deal, because I can take public transport, but the reason they cannot come is because they have plans with friends on the same evening and traveling takes up too much time. For context: out meetup is in the evening as well. This means the idea is to just meet up very quickly and public transport is expensive.

Now I have the feeling that this isn't okay and that someone should make more time. Especially after a month. However, it's just to get to casually get to know each other. WIBTA for saying that they should postpone other plans that evening?",4.0
518,t3_ruu9o5,WIBTA for Borrwing/Stealing/Giving away someone's Carhartt beanie?,"During this past years thanks giving My roomates and I hosted a Friendsgiving. One of our friends left a beanie on the coffee table and sent a message to the Friendsgiving group chat something like ""oh i left my hat lol gives me a reason to come back to hang with you guys."" Days pass, the hat sits there in its beige glory. A week passes, untouched, unmoved  and he never came back for his hat.

I figured ""well we are all friends here and because I know this person who left that hat why not just borrow it for a bit? It goes well with this outfit I have on and of course the first moment I see him or I know he's gonna be around i'll leave it out for him."" 

I go having possession of this hat for the month of December and I kept it in my room. 

So this new years we had a get together at my house again. The guy who originally had the hat came by, and he never mentioned the hat and I totally forgot to give him the hat because the last thing on our minds is the hat. Because it's  such a small insignificant thing and the things on everyone's mind in this point in time is our friendship and togetherness and anticipation of the new year and Alcohol. 

The next day my girlfriend and I go to breakfast together and it was cold out so I offered her a hat to wear and yeah its this guys hat. And she kept wearing it thinking it was mine and when it was time for her to drive back home I gave her one of my hoodies and let her keep wearing the hat because it was cold and the roads were a bit icy and she didn't bring her big coat so I wanted her to be well equipped just in case on the off chance her car broke down or she got stuck or something she wouldn't freeze to death. 

It was only after an hour she left and I remembered oh shit this was my friends hat. But I didn't really worry because I know she will return this hat. So to me it's comical because I know that in due time this man will get his hat back to him. I tell my roomates the story and they start getting on my ass half serious half joking that i'm a little thief and how now they have to start worrying about leaving their stuff around the house all willy nilly. 

I tried explaining to them that if this hat was so important to this man that he would find time in his busy schedule which consists of a full time job, working on truck engines in his free time, spending time with his girlfriend and other adult shit that literally everyone else has, he would be able to come and get his hat. But my room mates didn't really care about my point of view and they got me heated enough to make this post. 

So now because they pissed me off I'm gonna get this fucking hat back and go out of my way to personally return it to him. But in the meantime what do you guys think? Am I a thieving asshole who purposely takes other peoples possessions and gives them away to others with no remorse?",0.0
519,t3_ruu896,AITA for not wanting to parent a child I can't love?,"So I (41M) am a bit of a robot. Don’t want to get too into it but there was abandonment and other issues growing up and I kind of went emotionally numb as a child and I don’t really love. I can care about something and there are people who matter to me but love isn’t something I feel. I know intellectually that I am happier with friends and my dog but I enjoy them not love them. Even my girlfriend who I feel lucky to have and who’s company I enjoy so much, I feel admiration, respect, attraction, I think the world of her but don’t love this objectively amazing woman (she’s explained her side to me but I still don’t get why she’s wit me).  So I was recently contacted by a son (8) I didn’t know I had. His mother rightly assumed I would make a poor parent and didn’t tell me and always gave him vague answers so he wasn’t sure if I knew and didn’t want to be there or if I “was so awful” that she hadn’t told me. He wanted to meet and while apprehensive I agreed; he seemed sweet and thoughtful, a little sad, his mom is doing well and his uncle has been his male influence. He was hoping to have a relationship,it’s obvious that he wants me to be a father to him, and while I feel obligated to help (I told his mom I want to send money, offered to pay for his extracurriculars, and suggested therapy which I’ll pay for) that is all I can offer him. Kids deserve love and won’t understand I’m broken and it’s not his fault, and I worry if I was around him he’d realize I don’t love him and no kid should feel unloved by a parent. I figure absent is better than present but unloving. Ex seemingly agreed I wasn’t a good presence around him but just before New Year she called and said he wanted to come over either 31st or 1st for the new year. I reminded her she said I wouldn’t be any good for him and she said she still thought that but he really wanted it, but I told her she was right it was a bad idea for us to give him the false hope that I could be the father he wants, since no child wants someone there for logistics only with no love. I told her if he really still wants we can have a sort of a pen pal/occasional talk on the phone relationship, though I don’t get why he’d want that. She asked don’t I care about him, I said I do in the sense that he’s a child and I want all children to be cared for, and I feel obligation to him because he is my child, but I don’t and can’t love him. My ex said I’m an AH for not wanting more of a relationship with him, and my girlfriend thinks if I get to know him I’ll magically love him but I think that’s movie thinking and I think it would be crueler if after all this time wanting a father he gets one but still doesn’t get love. Isn’t it bad to raise a child if you know you can never show them love? AITA for maintaining an arm's length relationship with my son and not inviting him to New years?

&amp;#x200B;

520,t3_ruu518,AITA in this argument with my dad,"So I (17m) just finished an hour of study and was getting ready to make myself some lunch. I grabbed some crackers but was interrupted by my dad because he said that it was junk food and not lunch worthy food (mind you my dad is fat asf and doesn’t know a thing about nutrition) I agreed with him and said that I was going to have a sandwich with the crackers on the side. My dad decided to have a go at me because he believed I shouldn’t have the crackers at all in my lunch. I asked him why and he said it was because crackers are a snack food and essentially, what he says goes. This repeated for 5 minutes. I told him numerous times that the sandwich was my lunch and that the crackers were on the side, but he wouldn’t listen and keep exclaiming his point. It got to the point were I ignored what he was saying and regrettably mumbled “loser” under my breath. I wasn’t expecting him to hear it but he did and he went crazy. He yelled and fake-threw things at me and my mum. I tried to stay calm and tell him that I am allowed to have whatever I want for lunch, but he disagreed, exclaiming that crackers isn’t proper food. I called him out for being tyrannical , which only made him angrier. After the argument ended my mum told me that I needed to learn to pick my battles better.

521,t3_ruu3pd,AITA for sending my sil tiktoks to family group chat causing her an anxiety attack,"When I(28f) first met my sister in law Anne (30) I heard about her having a tiktok account based around her looking after her old/disabled cats but don’t use tiktok so I never checked it out 


That was until my husbands niece asked to meet for coffee to talk. At first she asked me how I was doing mentally and what I had against my brothers girlfriend Anne 

I was beyond clueless because  I thought we (me&amp;anne) were ok relationship wise, now don’t get me wrong I haven’t spoke to her much because I’m extremely busy but other than that I couldn’t think of anything 

She pulled out her phone and showed me multiple tiktoks of anne telling her followers about my just no family I’ll just list a few things 

- my mother being so bad of a just no mil they had to get a restraining order against her.

- I demanded my kids play with her cats and had a tantrum when she said no. I’m a nurse so you know I’ve seen what happens when kids mistreated animals 

-I’m dependent on my brother and demand he gives me all his time/money.

-me and my mother call everything she does in life shameful because she’s not modest or religious like us. 

The last and worse is that I’m anti everything thing which as a nurse could have cost me my job 


I ended up making an account downloaded all the videos and sent them to the family group chat you can imagine what happened next but instead of giving an answer both my bother and sil blocked everyone . Anyone in my family who had the app followed her “cat” account but were blocked on her main, my cousin ended up making a tiktok debunking her videos but her account was already gone

My brother ended calling me screaming down the phone about his girlfriend having an anxiety attack and I should have came to them first 
Apparently he said she makes up those stories for views so she can become a creator and it also helps with her anxiety.he said if anything ever got out of hand they would go on the record about it being made up

Update - Thank you for all your Adivce especially other nurses and Heath care workers. I didn’t reply because I was got too busy than fell asleep the minute I came home but I’ve talked to the Chief Nursing Officer and showed her the tiktoks,she basically laughed at the obvious lies and like many people here told me take some kind of legal action so if someone tries to “cancel” me I’d have a paper trail proving the lies that my coworker/medical info couldn’t. I’ve told my brother this and I also said I want sister in law to make a tiktok saying everything was false. 

My sister refused to do anything even tried to get my cousins tiktok account banned for bullying and said we are causing her emotional distress.Her relationship with my family is over because when the aunties turn against you in my culture that’s it there’s no coming back.

523,t3_rutyxo,WIBTA if I said something to my landlord about my upstairs neighbors?,"Quick background: Me (22f) and my boyfriend (23m) recently moved to a new city where I work and he goes to grad school. Because we didn’t know the city well before moving, we picked a neighborhood right near his grad school, which is naturally filled with a ton of college students. I figure that’s fine because we’ve both recently graduated and don’t mind being around a younger group of people. Okay now for the problem: we have the downstairs unit of a brownstone, and three college guys have the upstairs unit. Our landlord owns both units and rents them out. Soon after moving in, we realized our neighbors are LOUD and like, weirdly destructive. They throw their trash all around our walkway. I’ve found uncleaned vomit in our shared entry way. Earlier this year, they damaged our shared doorway and my SO and I had to repair it. But the worst part is the noise. And they’re not normal loud (trust me, I’ve been a downstairs neighbor before and I know we all complain about out upstairs neighbors a bit) but insanely loud. They’ll blast music until 4am most nights out of the week and speak at volumes I didn’t know were humanly possible until I moved in here. The worst part is I often hear them yelling homophobic slurs and calling each other the N word, hard R (they’re all white). Obviously I can’t report them for being dicks, but I’m wondering if I would be the asshole if I said something to our landlord. It’s to the point where it’s completely ruined my sleep schedule (and I work a 9 to 5, so I’m always exhausted). I’ve also tried to ask them to be quieter after 1am which I think is reasonable, but they basically brushed me off. Same thing when I talked to them about the trash, vomit, and broken door. Would I be the asshole if I said something to the landlord? I don’t want to be a Karen or risk them getting evicted, but I also think that they’re beyond disrespectful.

524,t3_rutxgz,AITA for asking my brother to not invite friends over when I am doing school from home.,"Because of COVID I am doing school from home, online and had the past two weeks off for break. My brother goes to in-person school and has an extra week off because of the new COVID rulings. 

He has recently been inviting his new girlfriend over, which is fine; however, I aksed that he doesn't invite anyone over this week's as I'll he doing school, when he is off. 

I thought this was a reasonable request. He can still visit his friends house, and have them over in the afternoon/evenings. My parents, on the other hand, flipped out and said I was being disrespectful and immature. I know that my brother and his friends are quite and wouldn't distribe me, however I like treating online school like real school, and having extra people in my house always making me feel on-edge and like I can't fully complete school.

For some projects I need to take videos, pictures, and to on zoom, and I would feel uncomfortable having my brothers friends listening or seeing my work on school. 

I also know that my brother will stay with his friends all day, and ignore all responsibilities, like walking the dogs and doing chores, which would annoyed me who doesn't have the extra week off and has to juggle school, dog responsibilities and household chores.

Reddit, am I the asshole?

EDIT: I just wanted to say my brother was totally find with my request. He understands that I would do the same for him (and often do - when he has his friends over I keep put of their way, and ensure our parents don't get annoyed). My parents on the other hand, who aren't even part of the discussion, feel the need to butt in and speak for my brother (they have no idea what he wants) and create conflict where there isn't any. 

To my parents I was the ass, but to my brother the request was fair, as he anyways Peter's going to his friends house, and knows I would return the favour. 

The real problem is my parents and their weird need to create problems between my brother and I. I swear they just don't want us to get along.",5.0
525,t3_rutxam,"AITA for not being appreciative of something my boyfriend did, that I didn’t ask for and don’t want?","Hi! On mobile etc 

Some background - I (30f) moved into his (27) place recently. I was initially a bit uncomfortable about it because it felt like I was moving into his space (not in a literal sense, more so a space that he had made his own) as opposed to us moving into a space together. Important info that he is a lawyer, so very good at arguing. 

Move in process has been slow due to Xmas and family visits (different city), so I’ve finally got all my stuff in after about 2.5 weeks. 

So last night/today we’ve ended up in an argument because he’s decided I’m having trouble fitting all my stuff into my wardrobe (I do have a lot of clothes). I really want to make everything work in my space, without taking over his wardrobe given what I said about moving into his space I feel it would be unfair to take more space than is mine. 

Without speaking to me about it, he went to a hardware store, bought some organisers for his own wardrobe and said to me “I made space for you, if you don’t use it I’ll be annoyed”. 

I told him it wasn’t necessary and I wished he’d said something. His reply was that he did it for me and I should be thankful. 

My attitude is that I don’t want that, and didn’t ask him to do it so why should I be thankful? I’ve set myself a boundary to only use ‘my’ space. 

On the same token, he also bought a bunch of those stackable clear shoe boxes (which I also said not to do) as he keeps talking to my parents about storage and they keep ‘warning’ him about how many shoes I have. I have told all of them repeatedly that I will be getting rid of most of my shoes as they were from when I was 18-22 and I’ll never wear them again. 

When he told me to ‘come look’ at what he did and there was all the boxes, I pointed out that I asked him not to buy them and as I’ve said repeatedly I will be getting rid of most of my shoes, he told me to ‘just fuck off’. Then called out to me 2 mins later to come back and discuss it. 

TL;DR - bf wants me to be thankful for things I don’t want and didn’t ask for, he’s very good with words and now I’m confused.

Edit - apparently this wasn’t clear. The shoes are not in this house and never will be.",8.0
526,t3_rutw44,AITA for telling my friends that he's wrong for sending perverted texts to my other friend,"So this happened a year ago or so, their are two main people in this story, let's call one sam and the other garry.
So sam and garry used to be best friends, they would always play video games together and always hang out with each other, Garry also really liked this girl lets call becka( it will be important later on in the story ),but suddenly everything changed.
One day Garry and Sam were avoiding each other for some reason, I asked Garry what happened but he just ignored me.
Later I text Sam what happened and why were they ignoring each other, and after that Sam sends me screenshots of Him and garrys texts.
The texts were disgusting, Garry insulted Sam and Garry send Sam a bunch of texts saying some nasty stuff, one screenshot was one of these ""me and becka: 🍆🍑😀"". 
I guess Sam got tired of Garry so screenshoted it and sent it to a bunch of people, one of them is Becka  .
Garry found out that Sam did that and got really mad at him, so here is where i may the the Asshole,the next day of school I confronted Garry and told him to apologize to Sam but Garry got really mad and yelled at me,
 Sam told me to post it on Reddit but I know  if Garry finds out i posted it on AITA he would be furious.Now in one of our periods Sam sits right next to Becka and I told Sam not to talk about Garry when he sits with Becka but that just escalated the  situation even more so maybe I shouldn't have even said that.
So AITA

527,t3_rutnzx,AITA for refusing to let my sister use my exfoliating lotion?,"My older sister (24Y) and I (21F) got in an argument. I bought this exfoliating body lotion a week ago and it cost me about $30 bucks. For some that may not cost alot but as a college student that isn't working, that's alot. And recently we had a pest crisis in our home and had to get exterminators and rearrange and throw out so many things. My father couldn't pay for the pest services so I had to foot the bill which amounted together buying new shit to almost 5k (which I was able to pay for with savings from my college refunds). But this wiped out almost all of it. Throughout the whole process I was the one doing everything. My father works so he couldn't really help as much but he did what he could. One of my sister (23Y) went out of the city to stay with a friend for a bit and the other one (21F) was dorming in college so it just left my 24Y sister and I.

Let's call her Penny. When I decided to do all this I told her firsthand, yet when it came down to get everything in order she told me she wasn't gonna be here to help cuz her friend was having a birthday party. Ofc I was furious. Ontop of footing the bill I had to do it alone. She said to reschedule but i didnt want to cuz we literally couldnt even sleep for weeks cuz of these damn pests. She was the first person I told about the plan so SHE KNEW about it and agreed too.

Throughout this whole process I've realized that Penny isn't a reliable person. All she cares about is money, her body, buying clothes, and finding a bf. Growing up she was the mean sibling no one liked. She says she's grown out of it and has apologized to us about the bullying but I can see that there are some aspects of her that hasn't changed. But I chose to believe her and support her despite my other siblings who resented her a bit.

After graduating it wasn't easy for her to find a job but I tried my best to encourage her. For her birthday I gave her spending money. It was my gift to her and I know she was struggling so it didn't really hurt me to do it. Yet for the past few years for my birthday all I wanted from her was a speaker that costs about $40. This past Christmas I overheard her talking to her friend about what she should get her boyfriend. She was going to gift him $100 worth of stuff when she couldn't even get me the one thing I've been asking for!? This person she just started dating the latter half of 2021 trumps her own sister.

So when I bought my exfoliating lotion and forgot to put it away, I saw she had used it, so I hid it. When she was going out in the evening, she asked me if she could use it cause her own exfoliating lotions ran out. If it was any of my other sisters I probably would've said yes. But because it came from her and the fact that I know if I had asked to use her own pricey exfoliating lotions, she would've said no. She's been giving me the silent treatment ever since.

So all of this to say, am I the asshole for not letting my sister use my lotion? I feel like I am.",0.0
528,t3_rutmot,WIBTA if I sold my ex-husband’s motorcycle?,"TL;DR My ex-husband has not been financially supporting his children, so I’m taking him to court and cutting off all ties, which includes obtaining his motorcycle through abandoned vehicle laws and I know he won’t get any of the notices. 

My ex-husband has always been the “if you give them an inch, they’ll take a mile” type and has hugely taken advantage of me and the fact that he’s the father of our kids. 

He recently was unemployed for a month, which I understand. He got a new job, and I told him I expect our child support to resume come the following month (I figured a month to establish your job and get your bills straight was fair). The child support is not court-ordered, just an agreed upon amount of $400/month that was signed and notarized by both of us. We have two young children that are not in school yet. 

It took him a year and threatening to take him to court to even start paying and he also never took his agreed upon days of shared custody. 

During his unemployment he moved home to another state and took our children for a month, which is longer than all of his combined visits for the last year or two. 

He’s now refusing to pay, and I told him I’m taking him to court because his poor financial planning (which is a much longer story) excuse is not going to cut it anymore. 

Now this is where the bike comes in. 

I’ve had his motorcycle stored in my garage for the last 6 months and he’s giving me the run-around about when he can get it out of there. 

I’m fed up with his antics, so I looked up the laws of abandoned vehicles. Part of it is he will get a notice and has 15 days to remove the vehicle. However, the address of the registration is our old marital home, which he no longer has access to.

529,t3_rutmij,AITA for hiding something from my best friend,"Backstory: I (M23) am best friends with Peyton (F22). We have a mutual friend Megan (F22) who was engaged to another (former) mutual friend, Nathan (M23). Megan broke up with him a few months ago. None of us are friends with Nathan anymore for a number of reasons (largely unrelated to the breakup).

Throughout their relationship, Megan and I became very close. It was always strictly platonic, but about three weeks ago (after she was no longer engaged), Megan and I got drunk at a party and ended up sleeping together. We decided to not tell anybody at all as is our right to keep our sex/dating life private. Her and I have continued hooking up and even gone on a few dates.

A couple days ago, our friend Peyton found out about us sleeping together; she’s extremely angry that we hid this from her and is threatening to end her friendships with us over it.

530,t3_ruthpb,AITA (my fiancée and I) for having our wedding in the city we live in and opting to pay for it ourselves?,"Alright folks, I’m stuck. I’m going to try to present the entire timeline of my wedding fiasco, so buckle up.

Me (25M) and my fiancée (27F) started planning the wedding with the future in laws. We were planning to have the wedding near her parents beach house in the Northeast. This is where her sister had her wedding, so why not. So we drove up to New Jersey to stay for a few weeks and check out venues. Before I get the ball rolling, her parents did offer to pay for the wedding.

The problems started arising before we got a chance to look at the first venue. Future mother in law presented a list of 98 people that we HAD to invite to the wedding and gave us a 150 limit. My fiancée were able to get the list to around 190 including the 98 people from MAL's list. Long story short, this was a problem with the future mother in law.

Fast forward a few days, we look at venues, give them our estimated headcount, all is good. Get home and mother in law let’s us know that our budget is 50k (same as sisters). We figure we can make some cuts and get the guest list we want within budget. Venues get back to us with estimates, and they (including the venue future sister in law had her wedding at), were going to be right at about 50k for just the space. Let her parents know, and they told us ""oh actually we paid 85k for sister's wedding"" 

A little frustrated, we left and on the ride back down south decided it may be easier to have the wedding in our city so we could plan it and it would be more convenient for us. Not to mention it would be cheaper. Floated the idea by father in law and his reply was “if you have your wedding in Dallas, my contribution will be much less robust”. Okay weird threat.

We then decided to look at venues in Dallas and found one that we both really loved. Called father in law to ask about booking it.. “I’m absolutely not hosting a wedding in Dallas” “Me and your mother graciously offered to host your wedding, so it will be where we want it to” , etc. Told him we will pay for it. He proceeded to tell my fiancée that she doesn’t give a shit about her family, is incredibly selfish, and that the family isn’t going to travel to Dallas for her wedding. Had another call with him a few weeks later and let him know that we booked the venue. Didn't go over well

Since then, whole family has ex communicated her. Whenever they reach out it’s to spew more venom and make her feel bad about herself. Last text she got from her dad was “you need to get your head out of your ass and focus on the people who love you, even though that may not be popular with your future husband. You’ve ruined your relationship with your family and it’s going to take a lot to fix it. Ball is in your court”

It seems her family is looking for an apology and we are genuinely confused what we could apologize for. So, AWTA?",29.0
531,t3_ruth4l,AITA for not wanting my sister’s friend sleeping in my bed,"My sister (19) and I (15) argue a lot. We have fights about the pettiest things and get upset over nothing. Usually we forget about it or find some way to live with it. However, there are some things I have to draw the line at. For New Year’s Eve, I went over to my best friends house leaving my sister alone to throw a party. This is pretty standard so I left giving her a hug goodbye. I spent two days at my friends, giving my sister plenty of time to clean up the house and get all her friends home. When I came home everything seemed to be in order. My mom came home just fifteen minutes later so I didn’t have much time to see my room but, when I finally did, I noticed something off. Now I’m not the neatest person, but I am observant and noticed that my bed wasn’t in the same condition I left it in. The throw was at the bottom and my pillows looked slept on even though I had made my bed before I left. I realized that my sister must have let her friend crash on my bed. I was obviously upset. I asked her about it later and she said that it was (for the sake of confidentiality) lily, a close friend of her’s. I had met lily before but we weren’t really close. I expressed that wasn’t ok and I’m not comfortable with her offering my room as a solution for her sleeping arrangements.

My sister asks what I was talking about and I explained to her that T was calling himself an alpha male which is unusual of him since I knew him as a chill, quiet dude. 
My sister says something about T’s fiancée and asks if she could have my phone to text him. I oblige and she does. No response from T. 
After some more cards and another smoke break I text T saying that the previous texts weren’t me and ask him not to block me. He said he wouldn’t block me over it, and a few seconds later my sister again asks me to use my phone. This time I said no. 
I had a few reasons as to why I did it. For one, I tend to not trust people with my phone, just a privacy thing I guess. Also, I know my sister can get a bit heated in conversation (flashback to the amount of times her and my mother have devolved into yelling over stupid things) and despite T’s reassurance I was still worried he would block me over it
My sister ofc got a little pissed over it and stepped outside for a bit and I felt really bad, not just because I made my sister mad over potentially nothing, but my friend saw it all.

533,t3_rutdl3,AITA for not wanting to celebrate my birthday?,"My birthday falls right after the holidays (Jan 2nd). I have never been keen on celebrating. It's never been about me, it's always about what everyone else wants to eat, go or do. I could have said, ""I would like to do a brunch"" and the response was ""well your aunt and uncle won't like it."" Like, screw them! And I always have this depressed feeling on my birthday, like I just want to be alone and act like it's a normal day. It's also very hard to celebrate with people as it's right after the holidays, no one has money and are all tired out from partying anyway. I also really hate attention on myself and would rather just skip the whole thing together.

Today is my 23rd bday and having been misdiagnosed as terminal (misdiagnosed, thank God) I thought about celebrating *simply*. Just a few friends going out for pizza at the end of the month.

But after today, I just didn't give damn anymore. My parents love to celebrate, so I figured I could give them something to work with, but not extravagant or with extended family. I told my parents that I wanted donuts instead of cake this year.... guess what my dad brought home. A pink cake with ribbons and sprinkles on it. When I asked about donuts the response was, ""Well, we really wanted cake and that's how we like to celebrate you."" When asked about dinner, I said I wanted chicken with the alfredo pasta recipe my grandpa used to make. My mom said that she felt like pizza and had ordered it already, with the excuse being ""I thought that's what you would have wanted, it's from your favorite place.""

Here is where I might be the AH.

I told everyone to do what they wanted. I said I relinquish my birthday rights (yeah, my bf uses big words and I'm starting to catch on) and they can celebrate without me. My mom went ballistic with ""do you know how bad I wanted you? it's my birthday too."" I said ""celebrate your f'ing self then"" and left for work.

I called my sister. My sister said I am an AH and I should just be grateful they did anything at all since some people celebrate alone. She said that they really wanted me and I should just let them do their thing since they obviously didn't abort me.

I might be the AH for acting the way I did and for not being grateful. My dad did bring a cake and my mom did order from my favorite pizza place. I might be the AH for not being accepting of the fact that they did want me and just wanted to celebrate the fact that they did have me.

534,t3_ruta7o,WIBTA for telling my friend to pay me back for what he stole?,"I (21m) have a friend named ""Scott"" (21m) who lived in my apartment. A little bit of backstory but me and Scott went to highschool together and moved our sophomore year of college thinking it would be fun to live together. During the past couple months he had had some life events come up including a messy divorce between his parents, and his girlfriend dumping him. This as well as who knows what else has made him very depressed.

We occasionally would smoke or drink, but neither one of us was really into that lifestyle. However, my friend Scott would increase both of these habits when he was depressed, as he once had during high school and has been doing for the past couple months. Well, because he's been depressed, he has missed work enough times to be fired. Then with obviously no money he couldn't buy these drugs or alcohol and instead started using mine without me knowing. I found out several months ago and told him it was unacceptable and he needed to communicate with me when that he was going to take my stuff. I thought that this would be the end of it. Unfortunately just this last week I found out that he had still been consuming my drugs and alcohol. (It was never hard drugs on a side note) 

I ended up confronting him and he admitted to stealing but said it was only because he was depressed and needed an escape. We had been telling him for a while to go to therapy or get some sort of help but he wouldn't and so I told him I was going to get his parents involved to help him get his life together. He told me he was grateful for doing that and since then has set up therapy in the future.

However, because he now needs to move out to be in a better environment. (Which I fully support as long as that does help him). I am debating on sending him a venmo/paypal request for what he stole from me because I'm also a broke college student (about $80 which is fairly generous and on the low side) My other roomate in the apartment says I would be a jerk and that I should just forgive him so it doesn't ruin our friendship. He also says I WBTA because it's only ""drugs"" and I can just do without them.

535,t3_rut7ij,WIBTA if I asked my mom if I can paint over a mural she made for me?,"Context: A few years ago, maybe 2 or so, my sister and I got new rooms when our parents renovated our house. We were allowed to choose a wall color for them. My sister, 13 at the time, chose lilac purple, and I, 11, chose mint green blue. 

After the rooms were painted, my mother had the idea to add a wall with a mural to add flavor to the room. She got to work on my sister’s immediately after showing it to her. It was a Van Gogh mashup of Starry Night and Sunflowers, and it came out beautifully.

Forward a few months, my mom still hasn’t painted my wall like she promised, or consulted me with any possible designs. The extent of the discussion is that I wanted a floral design and it’s placement. 

I come home from school one day to see that my mother has fully finished the mural. This is especially surprising considering she took a full week to do my sister’s. I had expected another artistic rendition of flowers similar to what she did for my sister, but it was instead a cheesy style that I would associate with an Easter party invitation. I honestly might have been fine with that, except it was done with a large paint brush which created completely undefined lines and messy strokes. She also allowed my baby brother to “help” and a small section was ruined by him.

I did my best to contain my displeasure, but I have a feeling she picked up on it. I have never complained about it to her, as she is quite sensitive to criticism and takes everything very personally. She gets upset and angry when the quality of her work is questioned, and I never wanted to deal with her anger.

I have lived with seething hatred towards this mural for the past two years. It goes against my aesthetic and personality completely, and has caused me to hate my room. I want to fully repaint my room a more neutral and controlled gray, but I fear my mother, having possibly picked up on my displeasure towards it, would take it as a personal jab towards her.

Would I be the asshole for asking if I can paint over it?

Edit: The seething hatred thing seems a bit off-putting to people. The thing about it is that my mom has pushed cheesy girly stuff onto me my whole life. She bought me unicorn decorations around the same time she painted the mural. I really expected something more sophisticated when I chose a light minty blue as my wall color. I don’t mean to tell her I hate it, I just wanted to be clear in how I felt in this post.",17.0
536,t3_rut6dh,AITA for not allowing my dead husbands family spend time alone with my son?,"My (F34) husband and I were married for ten years before he passed away last year. We have a four year old son. 

My husband was from a religious family that honestly always seemed to be kind of cult-like to me. His father had passed away when he was young and he has a mother and sister, both of whom had cut him out of the family when he decided not to practice their religion anymore. They were invited to our wedding but refused to attend because it was not going to be in their church (it could not be because we were both not practicing that religion or living by their “words of wisdom”). They had only ever been cruel to me and my husband and only ever spoke to us to try to convert us. They said horrible things to us throughout our marriage and about our child. When my husband passed, they did not come to his funeral and did not reach out to me. 

Recently, his mom and sister have reached out asking to see my son. I have told them that they are welcome to see him but that I do not want him growing up with any religious bias so they cannot talk to him about their religion or try to convert him. They promised me and I allowed it. After spending a day with the sister, he came home and although he had a good time he told me she offered to take him to church and he wanted to go. I called her and we argued. She said the church is a big part of her life and she can’t just not bring it up and if he’s interested it’s his right to learn about it. The thing is my husband had horror stories about growing up in that church and wouldn’t have wanted it for our child. I told them if they want to see him again it will only be under my supervision. They were very upset and claim I’m a bad mom for not letting my son decide for himself what he wants and a bigot for not allowing him to learn about their religion. AITA?",3490.0

So my (F18) best friend ( M18) who is also my ex boyfriend (we’re together for 1.5 years and broke up about a month ago) and I were playing a video game where there is a random selection of characters we can pick. I get a character that I am unfamiliar with and I am also unfamiliar with the other options. I pick this character and I play very badly. I keep saying I shouldn’t have picked this champion and I made a mistake. My best friend here is very mad the whole game because the whole team (especially I) at playing very badly and we lose. He blows up at me at the end and then leaves the call. I message him I’m sorry and and he said now you say your sorry. (I never said Im sorry the whole conversation until now). Later on he also said it was common curtesy to tell someone your playing a new character. Both which I agree I should have apologized and said I’m playing a new champion. Some background I always try to play champions that are easy and supportive (the ones I have the least fun with) when I’m playing with him so there is the least chance of him getting mad at my performance. His exact words after this were that “I still troll his games”. He said either I delete the game or be blocks me. I deleted the game. Then he kept spam calling me even though I said I didn’t want to talk. And then finally I answered and he asked why I was mad and I said because you are getting mad over something stupid. I mad a mistake in a game i won’t play this champion again, can’t we just move on? He blocked me also after this. Idk I agree I mad mistakes both in the game and in the interaction but am I wrong for getting mad that he blew up at me?

538,t3_rusznp,WIBTA if I were to preemptively disnivite half of my family from my wedding?,"Throwaway for anonymity. I'm going to add race to the people tags because they're very relevant to this situation.

My (23M, Mixed-race) dad (51M, South Asian) recently told me that he and my mom (47F, White) 's wedding, my mom's side of the family (white people) were exceptionally racist. Some of them said mean, racist, or segregationist things to my dad, mom, or my dad's side of the family. A few even boycotted the wedding entirely. My parents are both adamant that they've changed since then.

Here's my dilemma: my fiancée (23F, East Asian) and her family (my soon-to-be in-laws) aren't white either. With this wedding we're risking a repeat of the same situation.

Unfortunately, I was only told about this after sending out the invites (not too happy about that, but it's irrelevant here). My parents can't recall exactly who was opposed to their wedding on racial grounds, which I'm also not too happy about.

I want to avoid any racist abuse by my mom's family, and I think it's best to uninvite all of them. I don't want to even take the chance of offending my future in-laws.

My fiancée and parents have all said this would be an overreaction. My (South Asian) grandparents think it's the right move. I'm worried it would be a horrible thing to do to uninvite the people who won't do anything wrong, but I don't know who those people are.

Would I be in the wrong if I uninvited my mom's whole side?

We got closer because he came out to me and needed help with his internalized homophobia. I spent days and nights helping him accept himself.
I found a him guy at a friends party. He was awfully rude saying he was too fat,also really ""feminine"" and so on. Then he just turned to me all drunk telling me he loves me and hes glad im his friend. I got really pissed off.

I have studies so i tried to balance that and spending time with my girlfriend so i had to sacrifice some free time to spend it with him.

He often spoke about feeling left out and he would text me the minute he woke up and tried to talk all day.

Once he blew up because i played with another friend and didnt tell him an hour prior when we could play. I simply said i couldnt do that and i cant orient myself around him and his needs.

I realized that i have been neglecting myself in physical and psychical terms. I stopped working out,started eating shitty,slept little.. People around me noticed it too.

Is started avoiding him for a few days and i noticed that. I didnt want to be rude so i texted him this:
""Hey, I know i've been avoiding you and im sorry. I really need some space from you. Its starting to bug me and i need time for myself. Im still here if you need anything tho.""

He exploded saying that i find him annoying and that im not a real friend if i can only text a little and not be there in real life. He said that he either wants a full on friend or no friend at all. 

I explained how we dont really talk about much except for video games and how i always have to find something to do or talk about and that Im tired of it.

I said that i simply need to care about myself more and need some time to work on my mental health.

Also I said that my gf is my main priority and not him. That I was with her and not with him since thats how i started feeling after all this. I felt drained.

He said that im his main priority,but that he understands that she is mine. He started saying that he never said anything about that,how he was super nice and understanding about it,and how that wasnt the point and that i was simply leaving him because he is annoying.
He said that we hit a bump like we always do and that we would find something to talk about.

I said that the point was me needing space and thats where id like the conversation to end.

Again,he made it seem like It was the end of the world,asking me how i could do this ""after everything we've been through"" called me a fake friend and person again and played all of is victim cards.

I said that he obviously hasnt gotten the point and left the conversation on that.

It has been two weeks,I havent talked to him and I have gotten my shit together. I sleep more,work out,read and spend time with my girlfriend.

I am no place to date anyone or be a good partner and I can't bring myself to date anyone straight because I am scared that I will break their heart if I do decide to transition. It is a scary place to be in and I feel incredibly lonely. 

I do miss being in a relationship and I want to solve this issue. I have been feeling and I am going through therapy and I am closer to solving this but my family thinks that all my worries are just because I am not dating anyone. 

My parents, my sister, and her husband were celebrating the new year together, and during dinner, my mom asked me if I was going to date anyone this year.  I tried to brush the question off and my sister laughed and started to poke fun at me. She said I would be single till I died and my mom should give up hope for me getting married. 

I asked her to stop and I didn't want to rehash this on the first day of the year but she didn't and doubled down and started talking about how my ex got married recently and I was just being a sore loser. 

I knew she wouldn't stop until my evening was entirely ruined. She was laughing and my parents were joining in, I lost my cool and I asked her when they both were planning to buy a house and if they had given up hope for buying one?

544,t3_rus5n6,AITA for dumping a girl when she demanded I pick her up?,"I met a hinge girl that just happens to live a quick 3 minute drive up the street from me. I asked her if she wanted to get dinner one night and she says yes. She recommends a Mexican place and we have a great time. I paid for the meal, and she suggested we go for a drink at a place she likes nearby. We have two drinks and I ended up paying for that as well. Date two is nice. I make reservations to a place she said she had never been and we go get a couple drinks afterward per her suggestion. I paid for this date as well. Date three, she asks me to go to dinner at another place she loves. Good time, and  yes, I also paid for this date. 

Date four is where AITA comes into play. We made plans to watch a football game and decided a few hours beforehand that we’d watch at my house instead of going out. I told her to just come over whenever she wanted and she said ok. 

About an hour or so before the game she texts me and asks if I would “come fetch [her]”. I asked if she were drunk or something. She said she wasn’t drunk, so I asked why I needed to come get her and she said :

“ I don’t feel like driving, if you want to hang come swoop me. If not, no big deal :) “

I was absolutely furious. After making plans she gave me the ultimatum that I must come get her in order to see her, and if I don’t, then our plans are shot. I didn’t respond to her and the next day she asked what is wrong. I told her that I thought it was incredibly rude to demand I come get her for no reason other than she didn’t feel like driving. Her response :

“ I didn’t forsee you not driving the three minutes to be honest and so it got weird and then you didn’t respond so ... “

This made it sound like I was the lazy one for not making the 3 minute commute. Since we were on the topic of “things I felt were rude”, I decided to bring up the concept of paying for dates. I told her I’d never dated someone who made me pay for everything and didn’t even offer to split. 

(I was mostly surprised because she definitely was not a traditional girl by any means. In fact, her former partner was a girl that she was married to so it felt like our opinions on traditional gender roles wouldn’t be some thing we disagreed on.)

She responded with :

“ I appreciate you bringing that up. I’ll say that I’ve never dated anyone who would even let me pay for a date even if or when I offered, so this is new to me. If a man invites me out, then he’s inviting me out. I wouldn’t be there if you hadn’t asked me, you know? “

Now I’m done. Of all the things we’ve done on all of our dates at least half of them were her idea and she never offered or even insinuated that it was an option for her to pay or to split.

545,t3_rus3un,AITA for making my brother leave bachelor party for smoking weed,"Throw away cause my brother knows my main 

Also first time posting and on mobile so I apologize for formatting. 

I (28m) recently had my bachelors party. I and most of the bachelors work in a full time government job that commonly drug tests it workers. My younger brother (26m) works in the same job but part time. A mentor of mine offered me his small cabin for the weekend with the conditions that we:

1) Treat the cabin with respect and clean any mess and do a deep clean before we leave. 

2) Don’t smoke of any kind in his cabin

Me and the rest of the guys were 100% with this as we don’t smoke anyways and cleaning a small cabin wasn’t hard. However I did make these standards very clear to all the bachelors and my younger brother. I know my brother smokes weed and I told him privately that he can not do it in the cabin at all and I would appreciate it if he didn’t during the weekend at all as we live in a state that has not legalized marijuana, and neither has our respective job. He is also known to act like a punk when he is high so I figured we could just avoid any issues without smoking. 

The first night went well with drinking, laughing, playing music and games and having a fire. The next morning we had a hike planned for 10am and after 9am those of us who were awake started doing rounds getting everyone else awake and starting breakfast. Went I went into my brothers room it immediately smelled horribly of weed and I knew he must have smoked in his room that morning and or last night. 

I was livid as we had clear conditions and standards about staying in the cabin and he broke them within one night. I just told him he had to leave because if he was going to disrespect me or my mentors cabin I didn’t want him there for the rest of the weekend. (For background, my brother has his own car and the drive home was only an hour) The rest of the guys there agreed with my decision. After about 30 minutes of arguing he finally cussed me out and left. I was unhappy about the situation but we made the best of it and still had a great weekend. 

However after the weekend was over some of my family and our mutual friends called/texted me saying I’m an AH for kicking him out and likely destroyed our relationship. 

I might be the AH because I know a lot of people smoke weed and to many it’s not a big deal.",34.0
546,t3_rus2u4,AITA for venmo requesting $ from a tindr date after he crapped in my car?,"a couple weeks ago I(19f) went on a tindr date with a guy who I knew from hs. We were mutual acquaintances before this, and when we matched on tindr we agreed to meet up.

I picked him up at 7 &amp; we went and got some food, after that we drove to some secluded place so we could talk with extra privacy(leave it up to the imagination). Anyway, around 10:30 he starts to complain about his stomach hurting. I ask him if he wants to leave and he says no and kind of blows it off for a little bit. Around 11 he says he really needs to use the bathroom. I wasn't sure what to do because we were in a very secluded area, and I wasn't familiar with. He tells me that there is a gas station about 15 minutes away from us and asks me to ""step on it"" .

I leave and drive as fast as I can, but it's very dark &amp; I don't know my way around, and he is becoming more frantic(visibly sweating, breathing heavy.) At one point I ask if I should pull over because going in the woods is better than nothing, but he swears he can make it. Unfortunately, he misses telling me to take a turn somewhere and we get lost and I have to turn around and it's still probably like 10 more minutes according to him. Then he gets very pale and yells at me to pull over, and I stop as fast as I can, but when I do he doesn't get out of the car. He just sits, very resigned. At that point I understood it was too late.

We both sat there in silence for a little bit. I really wasn't sure what to say to make him feel better, and I was also feeling a little sick from the whole thing(the smell). Eventually I just offered to take him home and tried to act nonchalant. He agreed so I drove us home. He also tells me that he will reimburse me for getting my car cleaned. I felt bad, because of course it wasn't his fault, accidents happen so I offered to split the cost 50/50 and we never talk about again. I also told him, if he wants, I'd like to try a second date since this one turned out so...yeah. He thanked me and we parted ways.

I got my car detailed and sent him a text letting him know everything went well but I didn't get a response. I waited for another week and tried texting him again like ""hey, did you see my text?"" and again he didn't respond. I went on tindr to try and message him there, but I saw he had unmatched me. So it was pretty clear after that he had ghosted me. 

I was pretty pissed ngl, cuz I thought I was chill about the whole situation. It's cool if he didn't want to see me again, but he could have still kept up his end of the deal. I went looking for his instagram to try and message him there and when I find I see he had his venmo in his bio. I decide to venmo request. In the description I put the poop emoji, the pointer finger, and my car. Surprisingly, I get a quick response. He sends the money, but he also texts me pissed because he said his friend would be able to see what I put and would probably put 2 and 2 together. 

I told him I wouldn't have done it if he wouldn't have ghosted me. AITA?",1850.0

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with other people posting on social media, and him being more active on social media doesn’t bug me, but because of my privacy, I have asked him in the past to check with me before he posts anything that involves me. 

I explained to him that the reason I want him to talk to me first, is because the photos he will want to post are sometimes private or photos that we have saved for just us. In other words, they’re nice photos of the two of us, but they’re not ones that I want to share with the internet. I explained that it makes me feel uneasy when photos of me are posted without my consent because at the end of the day, it feels private and it feels like someone is invading my privacy by posting something with me in it without just checking with me. He asked how is it different when I go out with friends and they post stories, and again I explained that all of my friends will ask if someone minds if something gets posted or I will avoid being in the photo/story if I don’t want to be posted somewhere.

Well, I'm in a relationship and I love my bf dearly and we're going to try long distance since we can divide like 5 visits to each other between the two of us, plus, he is studying to get his second degree, while working and developing a new company.

So, I told this to my family in a NYE dinner since they asked, and my cousin (33f), started trashing my decision, telling me that I must not love my bf since I'm choosing college abroad over him, and a bunch of other stuff. At some point I just didn't even acknowledge what she was saying, and this got her angry and she said how much I would regret it in the future, that my longterm relationship should be my priority and I will regret ruining it.

I just looked at her and said ""like you regret sacrificing having children bc your husband didn't want them and now you go around weeping when a family member has a baby?""

Well, that was pretty self explanatory of her situation. She always wanted children and she gave that up to be with her husband and now she suffers deeply everytime someone in the family has a baby (she doesn't trest them badly, but it is equally annoying how she asks to meet the child, just to start crying anytime she picks him/her up, ends upt making it about her and her ""great sacrifice for love""). 

Anyhow, she got pretty mad, said that I had no idea what true love is and that you reach compromises when you do meet someone you truly love. I just answered that you shouldn't give up your longterm dreams and hopes for the future for someone, and that she was naive bc she got in a relationship with her now husband even after knowing he wanted no kids, she thought she could convince him. I told her that ""true love"" doesn't stick around so you change your personal goals or beliefs.

Long story short, the family is divided since I just defended myself, but I knew that was a sore spot for her, but I was just done with her talking shit about me for choosing my education as my priority.

He specifically told me that he already had ABC, and would shop for XYZ.

Friday evening, I arrive at his place, and while he made dinner, I started to prep the casserole. I pulled out the handful of things I needed that I found in the fridge and got started, but when I got to the steps where I needed XYZ and asked where they were, his response was ""I didn't know you needed that."" I pulled out my phone, and read back the text messages.

He said he had no memory of this exchange. I asked if he would run to the store (5 minutes away). He didn't want to because it was a holiday (new year's eve) and he feels bad that people have to work on holidays. So he refuses to go shopping on holidays. (Apparently they were more important than me in that moment.)

I reiterated again, that I need those things, and he said, it'll be fine without it. This is a family recipe that he has never made nor tasted, so I didn't appreciate him telling me what my recipe needs or does not need.

At this point, I could have continued with the meal prep. It wasn't entirely unsalvageable, it just... Wouldn't have been all that great. And I A. Didn't want to make it if I couldn't make it right, and B. Just didn't want it, now that he kind of ruined it and the whole mood of the holiday.

My mother (44F) lives over the hill, 5 minute bus ride away and works down the street from them. 

My grandparents didn’t want her around too much because once she is there, she doesn’t know when to leave because she drinks and talks loudly and drinks yet more. It’s hard to get her to leave especially when gramps needs his rest. 

Some backstory, my mother ran away with me at 5yo spreading horrible rumours about my grandad that could have ruined his life. They lost a daughter and a granddaughter. As a close, caring family it hurt them. Cut to 6 years later I move in, I lived with them for over a decade and became another daughter to them and they are like parents to me. So, when grandad got sick I came back to stay in December to help my nan with the care. We were all there the day he died which is what he wanted. 

Later when he was collected to go to the chapel of rest. My nans request was only me and her are present when he’s loaded into the car, family can come to say goodbye once that bit was done. My mom tried to barge her way through shouting about how it’s her right it’s her dad etc. I had to shut her down, I apologised and explained it wasn’t personal and that this was nans request and I’m here to make sure it’s honoured. To her credit, she listened and honestly handled it very maturely, I’m proud of her for that. 

Here is where I feel I might be TA. Later on after she had quite a few more drinks I heard her talking to another family member about how she didn’t come to visit her dad because i was blocking her and being horrible to her and I have no right to keep her away from her father. I understand her position and why she felt this way. I never blocked her, I did all that I could to make sure everyone got time with him (again a very close family.). Then she said I’m taking over her role and it should have been her and called me a few nasty words. This is where I possibly overstepped. 

I told her that her absence in their life and my life for the past decade removed that right. It was a choice she made and conducted in a nasty way and the consequences of her actions doesn’t give her the right to mourn him now because she doesn’t even know who is was anymore. The pain on her face when I said that hit me at once. It’s her father and just because I don’t justify her behaviour and actions doesn’t mean I have a say in how she’s feeling either.

561,t3_ruqv3k,AITA for not paying for my transgender daughter’s surname change?,"My daughter (17) came out as transgender a few years ago, and for her birthday this year we legally changed her first name to a feminine name of her choosing. My wife and I have always supported her and her transition, but my daughter seemed disappointed that her surname wasn’t also changed.

I am Icelandic-American, if if you don’t know, surnames are quite different than in other countries. One’s surname is their father’s first name + a suffix related to their gender. The son of Jökull would be Jökullson, and the daughter of Jökull would be Jökulldottir. When my American wife and I married, she took my last name, per American customs, and gave that same masculine surname to our daughter when she was born. All of us have the same masculine last name. 

My daughter wishes to change her surname to “Jökull”dottir in order to align with her gender expression, as well as Icelandic naming customs. I hadn’t considered this for her, as we live in the United States and used the local customs. My wife and I are on the fence about changing her legal name again, as processes like this are very expensive and time-consuming in our state.  I told her that her mother and I would be more than happy to help with the paperwork if she paid for the processing. Our daughter doesn’t accept our reasoning and claims we are only contributing to her existing dysphoria by not going through the process again.

She is very proud of her Icelandic heritage, and picked an Icelandic first name for her initial name change. While I understand her desire for the name change, I think that she is too focused on how her name would come across in Iceland, where we rarely visit, and should consider how it comes across in the United States if she goes through with this change.

I told my ex I’d pay for her phone bill if she keeps her usage and data and blah -as well letting her use my Netflix -she argued our son uses it and wanted to use it as well. At the time, I reluctantly agreed with her understanding that I pay for it -I should get secondary after our son. 

Well she’s across the world and it’s three in the morning, while it’s evening here and I want to enjoy a movie before work (I work midnights so my son is at their place). 

However I can’t due to too many devices using it. I messaged my ex saying I’m planning on changing information after I had kindly asking to use it but had received no reply. 

She eventually did and it was long and angry. She called her parents -who was using it- to get off. They texted me apologizing and I’m feeling absolutely horrible. They’re doing so much and I truly don’t mind them using it.

563,t3_ruqkl3,AITA for ignoring my cousin to prove a point?,"I (14 NB) go to a very strict private school, I like to take the few 2-3 week holidays as a time to relax and have time by myself since I barely have time to focus on my needs and mental health.

My cousin (15 F) doesn't get out much and barely has social interaction, she lives in a community where theres no places to walk or hangout with a high chance of danger (she isn't very street smart).

&amp;#x200B;

C = cousin

S = sister

Okay so basically we have her at my families house for majority of the holidays to get her out and about in which I have no problem with... The part that gets me is the fact that both of my parents *heavily* encourage me to bring her every where with me.

I get that she needs to get out but when she comes over the reason I'm made to hangout with her is purely based on one thing; we're close in age.  Its chill but when C is over we have to do everything together, I cant even be alone in my own room.

I feel put on the spot because my parents leave me to plan everything we'll do which leaves me completely stumped because she doesn't want to hangout with me and my friends  or if I plan anything with just us she doesn't want to do it.

I have decided Im not taking this anymore, everything I offer she rejects. I have recently decided to just put 0 interaction with each-other when we all went to see a movie. there was no interaction except at dinner with occasional small talk and normal convo.

I know this is a pretty asshole move but I don't like how my parents force this relationship, we don't even have much in common and I feel like I'm being used and being forced to put my holidays aside for her. I ignored her to show my parents that they don't need me to give her a good time going out.

Later on I had a talk with my older sister who is way older than me and said it'd be the same for her if C was S' age.

My parents are now frustrated and trying to guilt trip me talking about her disabled siblings and how she didn't grow up like me, I feel like a total ass.

564,t3_ruqca3,AITA for yelling at spouse to do the dishes?,"Context: I (36, enby) and spouse (36M) have a 15 year relationship, very much in love, very few conflicts but this is a repeated one. every time it comes up, it makes me angrier and angrier. I’m open to the fact that this makes me TA.

I’m the primary cook in the house. We have an agreement that whoever cooks, the other cleans up. There’s some flexibility and we’ve both let dishes sit overnight. If I’m having a hard time I ask him if he can help. he often does.

Thing is, if it goes beyond a day for him, he’ll never ask for help. So I’ll ask him if he can do the dishes, and his response is ALWAYS defensive. “But I put this dish and this dish in the dishwasher” and then when I remind him that I cooked, he cuts me off and repeats his list of dishes he washed that day.

Ok, so now the conflict: We had a small NYE party and I made a badass spread. We were both exhausted after, so no one did dishes that night. Fine. Yesterday he did a few in the morning and ran the dishwasher, which I’d helped load. We have a small dishwasher so not everything fits. So there’s still a sizable pile of dishes, and we left them for this AM. I woke up early, washed the majority of the dishes. Came back to bed and he asked me to make pancakes. Said I was too tired. Also mentioned there’s still more dishes to do. So after lunch he empties the dishwasher and puts in a few dirty glasses. The pile is still there.

Fast forward to this evening. I want to cook dinner so I ask him to do the rest of the dishes. “But I emptied the dishwasher and loaded it!” So I’m about to lose it bc it’s this fucking line again, but I try and calmly say “I washed the dishes this morning even tho I cooked all that food for the party”—he cuts me off about 4 words in and starts listing the exact dishes he loaded, all of which were water glasses and had nothing to do with the party.

It’s been a long couple of days so now I do lose it, and I SHOUT at him that I’m sick of him saying this every time and why can’t he just do the dishes when I’m the one who cooked and is trying to cook again in a clean kitchen?

I shut myself in another room bc I realized Im too angry to be around him right now; yelling really triggers him. I heard him washing dishes while I’m in here and I feel like a huge dick. So yeah, AITA?

TLDR; spouse &amp; I agreed whoever cooks, the other cleans. I cooked a lot for NYE, and washed the majority of the dishes bc he was taking a minute to do them. When I asked him to wash the rest, he got defensive and listed the ones he did wash. I lost my temper and yelled, which I know is something that triggers him. AITA?",1.0

567,t3_ruq3sq,AITA for making my boyfriend a sandwich?,"My (30F) boyfriend (36M) and I have been sick for a few days. We live together for over a year now, so we’re pretty used to each other. I’ll get spurts of energy and want to get a lot accomplished when I’m feeling healthy. This morning I offered to go get coffees (curbside pickup). I came back, we had breakfast and watched a few shows together. I went upstairs to finish up some laundry, clean a bit, and get a bath. This took about an hour, and felt worn down after. I had gotten a lot done and boyfriend was really surprised and commented the house looked tidy. 

After a bit of time I asked if he wanted lunch. He said he’ll eat when I eat and I started making lunch. He said “Are you sure? I don’t want to eat if you’re not hungry. And if you don’t feel like making stuff I can just run to Taco Bell”. I said no I was up for it, as I planned to make sandwiches/melts with leftovers. As I was making the sandwiches, food got a little less appetizing, so I decided to make soup for myself (which I LOVE, I always have to have soup in the house). Still this didn’t take long, maybe 10 minutes. 

I brought everything out at the same time and we started to eat. He said the sandwich was delicious, then said “you aren’t having a sandwich?” I said “no, I started to make them and they just didn’t sit well with me, I got a little dizzy too.” so he shook his head and seemed visibly angry. I asked him what was wrong again. He said “yeah I’m just annoyed. You don’t have to patronize me. If you didn’t want to eat the sandwich you should’ve said something. I’m a perfectly capable adult I don’t need to have you do things for me”… 

I apologized as it wasn’t my intention. He said I made him feel guilty for eating a sandwich while I sat there “looking all sick eating soup”. He said I “couldn’t just relax and sit down, I had to do all this extra cleaning and not ask for any help”. He said he’s upset because I “couldn’t just listen to him and wasted food” and I “constantly complained” that I was sick. He said I disrespected him in that I couldn’t tell him I didn’t want to make food. I could’ve listened to him, but I wanted to put effort into making food and just didn’t want the same food as I was making it. After a few minutes of silence he then proceeded to explain the sandwich was cold and not made the best, and explained a better way I could’ve made it. He said I made him feel guilty for eating the sandwich, and that I should’ve just sat with him on the couch for the day. I’ve been trying to explain it wasn’t my intention to patronize him, but I also don’t feel like this should’ve been made a big deal and that he was being too critical. 

I understand him feeling upset if he thinks I’m not listening to him, but If it was reversed, I would’ve just ate. AITA for not being considerate of his feelings and making him a sandwich?",4.0
568,t3_rupz5f,AITA for getting mad at my aunt over how she acts despite her having ms,"Mum: mum aunt: aunt, boyfriend: bf, 

So shes not very well but shes super bad for speaking over everyone. I've not spoke to anyone while shes been awake over festive season without her speaking over them. I really cant focus like that. 

Earlier mum was saying. ""Maybe printing it out just 5 times instead of 25 would be good, can allways give them away for presents if they dont sell and you dont have tons to store.""

Aunt, shouting almost, over mum, like a sentence behind: ""just print 5 of them, it would be a better idea, people can get them for presents you dont have to sell them all""

I cant process words very well when two people talk but my bf has helped me write out that bit so I could explain better. So I've basically not been able to speak much or hear most stories as shes worse if someones trying to tell an interesting story. 

She also supposedly ""cant cope with music in the background"" she likes Johnny cash, that's fine to play in the background round her usually. but she has flat out refused to let anyone play anything other than 70s music (shes like 20 years older than anyone else here, we all dont like it). So we've had to listen to no christmas music or anything anyone else likes. Even Johnny cash unless she asks for it, then it's been fine.

Mum put on party rock anthem by lmfao and irene said ""oh I dont like this"" and when mum ignored that she said ""I cant cope with music playing"" like half way through and mum just sighed and stopped it. 

Idk what the real cause of this is tbh. But she did the same copying someone elses sentences over them as she did to mum to my bf and I just said ""so what my boyfriend just said?"" And she looked so mad. As well as just answering her stupid, said over everyone else, patronising questions wrong. 

""Is it that over there?"" *pointing at a hardback story book when I ask about my tablet*

""Yea, yes it is!"" And then pick it up, she looks mad so shes gotta know shes just being annoying right?

570,t3_rupthw,AITA for telling my sister she is welcome to join us for Christmas?,"This year marked the first Christmas since my father died after a brief battle with cancer. He passed away in October. 

Our family’s tradition has been to spend Christmas Eve with my parents. We all knew this would be a hard year for all of us, but especially my mom. My younger sisters (37 and 39) and I discussed how important it was for us all to be there and agreed on time and the food we would bring. 

My middle sister, however, began seeing a guy right around the time my dad died. After we made our plans, He invited her to his family’s for Christmas Eve and she decided to do that instead of spending the evening with us as planned. She went so far as to tell us she didn’t want us to do any of the things we traditionally did because she didn’t want to miss them. My youngest sister, my mom, my husband and I were all very upset but we couldn’t talk her into changing her mind. At one point she said she didn’t want to miss spending her first Christmas Eve with him. 

On the morning of Christmas Eve, she posted on FB that she was sad to be spending the first Christmas Eve since my dad died away from her family. By the time I saw her post, more than a dozen people had commented offering sympathy and concern. She had replied to all of them basically making it seem like it was not her choice. This is where I might be the AH. I commented, “We are all here at Mom’s. You could come here instead of going to your new boyfriend’s house.” (I admit, my wording was intentional and perhaps petty. 

EDIT: I went and looked at my exact wording. I said “We are all here at Mom’s. You can still change your mind and come here.”

Ten minutes later my sister called my mom sobbing, complaining that I was being mean to her and making her look bad. After my mom got off the phone, she knew I had heard through the speaker (we were both in the backseat while my husband was driving).  Before I could say anything, my mom said, “You should have just let it go.”

I was really angry but have been through enough therapy to have learned when to keep my mouth shut, but my other sister jumped in and railed that my middle sister was a real piece of work and had chosen a new boyfriend over her family when we need each other the most. 

The whole rest of the evening was awkward because we couldn’t do any of our traditions and my youngest sister couldn’t control her rage at my middle sister and frequently muttered about her under her breath. Later, my mom said I should have just let it go so that no one was upset that night.

This family celebrates the Three Kings Day (So the gifts are given that night and not at Christmas, I don't know how many people know what this day is), so her mother will give the girl gifts on January 7th. 

The problem is that my boyfriend is short of money, and he has told me that he will not pay for our anniversary outing (January 5) so that he can afford his daughter's gifts, but that perhaps I could invite him this time. 

I told him that I did not understand what he was planning to buy for his daughter so that he would become financially unbalanced by his daughter's gifts, and he said that she needed sheets of drawing paper, colored pencils, headphones and a new cell phone (Since, in a difficult moment, his daughter had to give him the cell phone during 2020 to accommodate job interviews by zoom and stuff. He will give her a better one now instead of giving it back, because he has recovered financially and his parents will buy the paper and the box of pencils). 
I told her to just give her the phone and forget about the headphones or ask his parents for them. 
He said that he would not ask for more money than he had already asked for, and that the headphones were an additional gift because the phone ""I owed it to her for having had to take the other one from her.""

574,t3_rupmj1,AITA for not wanting to go to my father's birthday dinner?,"I feel like such an asshole just writing the title. 

My father doesn't act like a father. He doesn't do any parenting. I'm resentful of both parents for the trauma, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect I have experienced, but a lot of that resentment is focused on my father because I don't have any childhood memories with him. He didn't go to my sport games, he didn't know any of my friends, could never tell you what grade I was in, and sometimes he forgot my age or when my birthday was. He has never gotten me birthday or Christmas gifts, that was always my mother. All the things he knows about me were from when I was seven years old. 

This is a lead-up to why I don't want to go to dinner with him. My mother made reservations at a super expensive restaurant for my father's birthday. We've been before and I hated it. It's normal to have long waits in busy restaurants, especially for the amount and quality of food they are serving, but I dread waiting for over an hour at a table with my father. 

I'm scared of him. I resent him. We have nothing to talk about. He's extremely homophobic and transphobic, and a bit misogynistic, and because I am a part of all three groups I feel super uncomfortable at a table with him (though I'm not ""out"" yet, so I can avoid his hate). 

I couldn't bear if he started to go on a transphobic rant (like he has before) and I was unable to remove myself from the situation like I can at home. I might actually cry. My hands are shaking just writing this out. 

My mother also made reservations for a night where I was supposed to have my therapy appointment. I have therapy every single Wednesday, and she knows that. But she still went ahead and planned the night for us. She's lucky this Wednesday I don't have my appointment because my therapist is still on holidays. This isn't the first time my mother has forgotten that I have therapy. 

My mother knows I feel uncomfortable and unsafe with my father. She still wants me to go to dinner ""as a family"" for his birthday. She gets super mad when I express not wanting to go at all (I don't like my father, I don't like social situations because of anxiety, and I have an eating disorder which will make dinner in a public place difficult).

576,t3_rupd41,WIBTA if I didn't cook for my brother anymore?,"I(14F) have an older brother (17M), ""Lucas"". For context, I live in a household with seven people, my grandparents, parents, and two siblings (13F, my other sibling, isn't involved). Because there's seven of us, we each cook a meal one day a week and have family dinners most days. My day is Wednesday, Lucas' is Friday. Lucas schedules (he has a job at a restraunt) to work on Fridays most nights. He claims he doesn't have any control over it, but I doubt it.

Lucas has a massive sweet tooth. Anything chocolate will be eaten in two to three days in our house, even if no one else eats any of it. This has been going on for years. My grandma stopped buying sweets for several months because they wouldn't last a week, and my mom only buys them if someone specifically asks. I, on the other hand, don't eat very many sweets. Generally I prefer to eat stuff like apples or carrots for a snack instead of ice cream or cookies. This is to show the contrast. I'm just not a huge sugar fan, and him being one isn't the conflict.

I like to cook things sometimes beyond that. Generally sweets or muffins. I decided the other day to try a recipe in a cookbook, for chocolate chip cookie-bars. It's chocolate chip cookies in a pan, and it's delicious according to my whole family. I love doing stuff like this, since there's not a lot of sweets in our house and I like to treat my family.

There's a bit of buildup to this, but I'll try to keep it brief.

I absolutely love gummy bears, so sometimes I'll get some if we're at a store. I'll put the snack in my room and eat it a little at a time.

When I got home from school, my snack wasn't in my room. This has happened before so I went in the living room and it was on the couch by Lucas. I asked him to replace it since it was almost completely full when I left it the day before. He said he would.

It took three months for it to be replaced, and his girlfriend had to do it since he wouldn't. Lucas had charged me interest on money I borrowed from him so I thought he'd be quick. I was upset, but I let it go.

I'll offer Lucas some of my lunch when I make it (because he won't cook for himself). Usually he won't even watch the pot for a minute or two so it doesn't boil over when I go to the bathroom. I also generally get very little of what I make.

Then, I made the cookie-bars. I decided to make some muffins for us to eat for breakfast when school starts again. I was doing dishes when Lucas came in to get a cookie-bar. I asked him to only get one. He yelled that I wasn't in charge of him and was being all high and mighty about making it. Then he left.

Just now I checked how many were left. I cut it into twenty-four pieces so I was expecting a fair few to be left over. There's three left. I'd asked everyone to just have one at a time, but I had no hope for Lucas listening.

So, I'm obviously annoyed at this point. I'm thinking about not cooking when he asks. I'm sick of this. Would I be the a-hole if I didn't cook for him anymore?

Edit: Thanks everybody for the replies! I am definitely going to stop cooking for him anymore; he's seventeen and can do it himself. 

As for the idea of putting laxitives is something, there aren't any in my house and there's no way my parents would let me get them at the store, since I can't drive myself anywhere yet.

I didn't pry but I said ok ill come after we eat here just to support her. 
Let me say here that I was an awful mother especially to the youngest. I had been working hard to make sure they knew I was sorry and be here now So not bc of that but bc I want to ive been cooking and cleaning for the family I live with the last 8 years  bc they can use the help especially after adopting two boys a couple years ago.. and Im retired so I am able to

But the last couple years have been really  hard. Since the two boys 12 and 13 were adopted i can't stop clashing with my daughter here..  Mainly because she won't lift a finger or spend a penny for them. Ive never seen her like this but I've never seen her with 3 kids. 
What happened was at dinner on Thanksgiving she said that  I asked only the youngest who is 8 ( my blood ) to join me at his aunt's for Thanksgiving withoutinvitingthe other two boys at the table. I didn't.  That is the one way for an instant 10 out of ten mad just treat her sons different.  Come on. Im not that dumb or mean.  So she says hey John and Jesus are coming too. She totally invited the three of them. 
Wait. Did your sister invite them?  ( They made it clear bf the adoption they were not on board with it and are 100 percent not on board now. They will have nothing to do with them and don't even know their names ) I felt like it was a bad idea to bring them without asking and the one here is shooing and shussing me out the door. So we get there and her son is in route and a veggie tray is out and my oldest daughter says nothing needs cooked. Huh?( She asked me to come to help cook.) She ignored the boys and called her son and put him on speaker phone."" Hey the boys are here.""   
Grandson "" you mean ALL of them????? 
Daughter ""yes all of them""  Let's eat late. 
Him. "" yes the later the better"" 
She hangs up and gets me and herself drink
 Offers nothing to the boys and telling me she only has 5 servings of food. Ad nauseum. About an hour later since they were ignored anyway the two boys went home ( the oldest is 16 now) I should have left with them. Those boys were in foster care for years bf my daughter adopted them. They have sisters they got separated from. One is a twin. They are such good boys. The oldest grandson came and went right to his room as always.  We ate and there was a fucking ton of food. Not 5 servings.  
I was so pissed i went home and told the other daughter thanks for that.  That was awful and of course once again "" you are crazy!!!@ i just talked to Rachel and she said it went really well!!!! Tje boys said if was fine. Something is wrong with you.  I'm calling her right now and telling you are ruminating. I don't ruminate. 
And proceeds to call her.

578,t3_rup6vp,AITA for posting on a FB page that a local business is closed?,"There is a local business near where I live called Maezees Nutrition and they have a Facebook page. Usually they always post if they are closing early or aren’t going to be open. Well I stopped by at their normal hours and they weren’t there. So I made a post on their Facebook saying, “Although there are no post they are not open.” Doing this so that others can see that they are closed.

A few minutes later my SIL messaged me and sent this, “Can you please not post on there page ugly comments. If you wanted a drink i could've called and ask them to meet you down there to make one and they would have. They need family time too.”

This was my response, “I took it down but I didn’t think it was ugly just wanted others to know they were closed.”

She continued with, “Ok..but they thought it was ugly...they said it could hurt there business...most of the regulars knew they would be closed.”

My final response was, “Okay it wasn’t meant to be ugly. I think the miscommunication came across where they assumed I was trying to say they should be open and that’s not what I was trying to do. I was trying to let others know they weren’t open, regardless of if they were a regular or not because they normally make a post when they close. I just hate they thought I was being ugly but miscommunications do happen.”

In my opinion it is ridiculous that they threw a fit like this over a post saying there closed. When it is bad business to not let others know you’re closing or not opening outside of regular operating hours. Also, they could have contacted me and spoke to me directly instead of going through my SIL. 

TLDR: I posted on local business Facebook page saying they were closed today.

579,t3_rup3ti,AITA for not giving my brother baked goods?,"Ok, backstory: A lot of stuff has happened during the pandemic (duh), including moving across the country (I live in the US so that's a big thing). I (M18) started my first job at a bakery/coffee shop and I absolutely adore it, I love my coworkers, I love the customers, and I definitely love the checks that come in every Friday. I'm also super into witchcraft so I've been buying some supplies for it because I can afford it now! I tend to talk about my job and witchcraft a lot because those are the two biggest things in my life right now. My brother thinks it's annoying that I talk about it so much (despite the fact that he takes advantage of it as much as he can, aka getting coffee discounts, eating the free baked goods I bring home, etc) so I told him he can't take advantage of my job while at the same time bashing me for talking about it.

Fast forward to today.

My dad picked me up from work, and I usually bring him out a cookie or a brownie or something like that because I appreciate him picking me up, and when I got in the car he said that we should use it as a prize for our game night. I said sure because whoever won it would deserve it, and if it happened to be my brother then whatever. Well, we played (and my brother is very competitive by the way, to the point where it is unenjoyable to play with him), and my dad wiped the floor with us (as usual), I got second place, and my brother got last. My dad said that we could split it, and since I have baked goods most days I said I would pass, and my brother bragged that he would get the whole piece. I told him absolutely not, he didn't win so why should he get it? He screamed at me for being selfish and petty and then went to his room and slammed the door. My dad told me I was being a dick but it was my prerogative.

The thing is, I don't feel like what I did was terrible. Yeah it was petty, but he didn't win, and as recently as yesterday he was complaining about me talking about work too much (I was excited about my Christmas check because I got double time for working on Christmas). Just because the person that won didn't want it, doesn't necessarily mean I should have just let him have it, right? Am I the asshole?

TLDR: My brother says I brag too much about work so I banned him from taking advantage of my job, and even though a baked good from work was the prize of our competition and the winner didn't want it, I didn't let him have it even though I didn't want it either. AITA?",5.0

581,t3_ruouwk,AITA for taking my husbands side over our ex?,"I (22O) and my husband (would prefer to stay completely anon), added a third to our marriage Dec 4th 2020, they (25GNC) promised not to be like anyone else me or my husband have been with.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days before we picked them up (drove from OH to NY), I informed their ex that we would be picking them up at X time and would like cooperation since we had been told their ex was super abusive and mean. Their ex, another married couple, one M, one F of unknown ages, told me that they would be lazy and that all they do is smoke weed and complain about doing chores. I defended them, only knowing what I'd been told by them.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 4 month were great, it was like it was meant to be. We all clicked, I had a smoking partner, my husband had someone to game with him ass early in the morning, it worked out great. But then things started to go downhill rather rapidly. Now, we told them that we would spoil them when we could. That's how we are with people we truly care about, we get them what they need and want, assuming we can. Me and my husband get SSI (I am mentally disabled and he is both mentally and physically disabled), so we only had so much to work with after bills and getting things we need, paying for gas to go food shopping, restocking toiletries, getting food for the animals and litter, etc. After all of that we only had, maybe, $200 between the two of us, max. $100 went for flower, since I use medicinally and they claimed to as well, so that leaves $100 to use for whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

They would pitch a fit if we couldn't get whatever it is that they wanted, if we financially weren't able to. The reason I say they claimed is because they absolutely \*were not\*. Whenever they weren't high, they were mean for literally 0 reason, if we ran out they would be mean for no reason, we would run out \*because of them\*, they had to be high to function. So when we couldn't restock mid month, when the $100 was supposed to last all month, they would throw a tantrum and ""vaguely suggest"" for us to sell our stuff for flower money and would threaten to (use your imagination), and when we didn't want to because we barely had them for a month, they would post it to marketplace without our knowledge or permission and wouldn't tell us anything about it until the buyer was already half way to our house.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband has mental illnesses, and they would say mean/abusive things that would trigger my husband into anger or depression and then would get mad at him for having those emotions, and would add fire to the flame continuously until there was a argument and then turn it around and play victim. There are other horrid things they would do but I can't mention them, as per the rules. And when they broke it off with us, they told people that my husband was abusive and did other specific things that are physically impossible for him to do, as he is semi paralyzed from the waist down.

582,t3_ruou7z,AITA/ Coparenting Issues,"
Coparenting between myself (25F) and my ex (28M) is rough to say the least. Every interaction seems to be a toxic one. During our marriage, I found that he was manipulative, would gaslight me, and was just a bully in general. Our recent disagreement has me wondering if I am overreacting or reacting appropriately and am just getting manipulated again. 

My ex had our son (age 5) over the weekend and I met up with his girlfriend to pick up my son today and she explained they forgot to wash clothes and would return the outfit I sent my son to his dad’s in at a later date. When my son saw me, he wanted me to pick him up and hold him anyway but I didn’t realize until I put him in the car that he didn’t have shoes on. I asked him why, and he said his dad and dad’s girlfriend said they didn’t want his shoes to end up at my house. Keep in mind, they have an outfit of his and a pair of shoes that came from my house but are worried about their pair of shoes. It was 30 degrees and flurrying outside when this was happening. I brought it up to my son’s dad that that didn’t sit well with me and asked that it not happen again. He explained to me that our son was in the cold all of 5 minutes between cars and that I had no plans today so it didn’t matter. He also told me “it doesn’t seem to be a big deal when you send him in clothes that are too small” but that isn’t the case and he didn’t know what kind of plans I had today. My ex is also the type that has never paid child support willingly and for the past 5 years I’ve been working with the state to get child support from him and still to this day have no luck with that. I told him if he had a problem with what I dress our son in he could actually pay some child support and I would buy him all the clothes in the world. I also told him he had no idea what my plans were with my son but whatever makes him feel like less of a piece of shit. He laugh reacted at my text and that was that.

583,t3_ruoqa5,AITA for refusing to stop cooking with onions?,"Not a major conflict, but I’m curious on where the majority fall here. 

My fiancé and I have been together for nearly 3 years and I have always done the majority of the cooking. He’s always been clear that he doesn’t like the texture of raw onions, but says he likes the taste. On to the current issue, I’ve noticed recently he complains about onions being in the food whenever he’s in the kitchen watching the prep work. For example, if he doesn’t see me add onions to chili, he doesn’t say a word about onions. Yet, if he comes in and sees that I sautéed onions for the base of a soup, all I hear is that the onions are “crunchy,” and they ruined the soup. Spoiler alert: they weren’t. I know he does actually like the taste because he’ll use onion powder in his marinades for meat, and even quarters onions for some meals and removes them after cooking.

584,t3_ruoplv,AITA for kicking my husband out of the delivery room?,"I (23F) and my husband (24M) just had our first baby. My husband was so excited and was super supportive and caring throughout the pregnancy. The only this is that he became slightly obsessed with watching YouTube and TikTok videos of husbands pulling pranks on their wives while in labor. I didn’t mind at first but then he started casually joking about doing things he saw in the videos saying it would be funny. I clearly stated my distaste for them and asked him not to do anything like what he saw. He agreed and continued to joke about it time to time but I brushed it off since I trusted him and thought nothing would come of it.
The day of the delivery came and I had been in labor for 8 hrs (12 hr total labor). I had just finished another round of contractions when my husband let out the loudest fart, turned to me and said, “what the hell have you been eating OP? It smells disgusting” I immediately recognized that as one of the pranks in the videos. Outraged at him not honoring what I asked him not to do I demanded that he leave the room. He started yo arguing saying it was just a joke but I insisted and luckily the nurse helped get him out. I went through the last 4 hrs of labor by myself since my family lives out of state and I’m not close to my MIL. After the delivery I told the nurse he could come back into the room and he was fuming. He started demanding that I tell him why I kicked him out. I calmly told him the reason but he was pissed. He hasn’t talked to me in a week. His mom is taking his side saying that I was a complete bitch for kicking him out. Normally he will defend me from her but this time he completely agreed. 
I might be the asshole because I know how much he was looking forward to being there for the birth of our first kid and especially when he got to cut the cord, but I still kicked him out and refused to let him back in. The nursed asked a few times if I wanted him back but each time I said no. AITA for kicking out my husband after a stupid prank he agreed not to do?

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for all the support and reassurance on here and wanted to answer some questions and give an update
QUESTIONS: he has been bonding with the baby but not quite helping. When he felt like holding her he would just take her from my arms or if MIL was around he would ask her to get the baby. And I know I posted this answer previously but I wanted to put it here in case anyone missed it. If he had been apologetic in anyway I would have let him come back into the delivery room. And the nurse check on him but he was sulking and complaining that I did that. 
UPDATE: It’s been a rough first week but thankfully my mother arrived this morning to help out. I talked to my husband (as best I could since he is still upset and ignoring me) and told him how I was feeling (I have been feeling depressed and anxious since we brought the baby home) and that I understood why he was upset but asked him to please see my side. He told me that I had no right to kick him out and that our daughter would come to hate me one day for having him miss her birth. I started crying and begged him to please talk things through instead of saying things out of anger. He refused and said I was under his roof so he had the final say and called me a c*** for kicking him out of the delivery room. I didn’t say anything else to him I just started packing myself and the baby’s things and planned on leaving. He yelled telling me that I couldn’t take anything he paid for (I haven’t worked since the start of the pandemic) I just took the baby and told my mom we were leaving.

I’ve been suspicious of his conversations and I was even tempted to record one and pay someone to translate it but I ultimately decided against it because I thought I was being paranoid.

However, his cousin was visiting us a few days ago while he was in one of these meetings. She caught me listening at the door and told me she thought he was speaking about me. I asked her if she could tell me what he was saying and she did. 

Later, I confronted my husband about what he was saying since he was clearly not planning to make divorce easy for either of us based on the conversation. During the argument it came out that his cousin translated the conversation for me and he was livid. After our argument, he called his aunt and told her what had happened and she has been sending me angry messages about using her daughter in that way. I think she grounded her too.

Now my MIL is ungrateful to me whenever I make her meals, she accuses me of stealing from her or trying to harm her, and makes life miserable for me at home. She has always lived with us so she does not have anywhere else to go. Even my husband despises her now, but he can somehow handle her better than I can. Nevertheless, we usually have shouting matches at our home.

The other day, my MIL accused me of “poisoning her food,” so I finally had it and shouted at her that if she hates my cooking so much that she can go to a home and we won’t have to care for her anymore. MIL retorts and says “that’s fine, no one cares about me anyways,” so then I broke down and balled. My daughter who still lives with us (19F) runs down the stairs and starts shouting at both of us to stop and claims that we’re “driving her to her breaking point.” I then yell at her that if she cares about her grandmother so much that she may as well send me to a home and asked her if she even cares about me anymore?

I came out to this group just over two weeks ago, before Christmas Break, which is where the transphobic comments started to roll in, things I am not comfortable saying on this subreddit due to the nature of such comments.

Now here is where I think I am the AH. On Christmas Day, “Barry” said something that was just over the edge, which is where I had had enough.

I had pretty bad depression at the time and some other mental health issues like anxiety (but no delusions, psychosis, or anything like that), as well as Tourette syndrome, and she thought that camel milk would help. I don't so much have a problem with that (even though it's pretty weird) as I do with the fact that she put it in my food and coffee without telling me. She says she doesn't owe me an explanation of every ingredient in my food, but I feel like it's different when she's deliberately hiding something that she's trying to use to treat me. As more justification for why she didn't tell me, she said she thought I would say no if she asked me if I was okay with camel milk.

I told her that I felt she shouldn't have hid it from me, and she said that while she can see my point of view, she still feels she did the right thing. She apologized that I was upset, but she also made a lot of excuses and justifications for herself during the apology. I don't regard that as a real apology, and I told her so and didn't accept it. I stayed as civil as I could and tried to end the conversation as soon as possible because I didn't think either of us was going to change our minds, and I didn't want to get too frustrated and end up saying something I would regret.

Now she's very upset, and my dad is on her side. He feels I was dismissive toward her explanation of the context, and that I wasn't owed an apology in the first place because I was a child and because I was ""too sick"" to have made a rational decision regarding whether or not to consume the camel milk.

When I saw the rugs afterwards, there was still noticeable dog fur on them. I debated telling him vs just vaccuming them again but figured I should tell him. I did start out by thanking him for vaccuming but said fyi there's still a bunch of dog fur. He laughed and basically called me ungrateful and demanded pictures of the dog hair on the rugs (he was watching TV &amp; eating and didn't want to get up.) I was annoyed but sent him the pictures and he reluctantly said he'd vaccum again but he still thinks I'm an ungrateful bitch.

For reference, he's done this before with stuff like dishes. He'll wash pots etc but put them away with obvious food residue still on them and I stopped saying anything because he just tells me I'm ungrateful and to just wash dishes myself if I don't like the way he does it.

590,t3_ruobtj,AITA for prioritizing my dog over my boyfriend?,"So I (22F) and Bryce (23M) have been dating for about 8 months. We both go to school and work and we each have our own apartments. But because mine is closer to campus (we attend the same school) he tends to stay with me the nights before he has early classes (which as of last semester was 3 days but will change next semester) 

My dog, Cas, is my baby. He’s a chihuahua who was very very underweight when I got him 4 years ago. He’s better now ut he needs special digestive food otherwise he has really bad diarrhea. A 20 lb bag costs around $60 (this will be relevant later) 

I’m going to be honest and admit that my job pays well. I never bring that up with Bryce though. When we go on dates or have night outs I’m more than happy to pay and I’ve never made him pay for staying with me since it’s not really full time. 

Well today I decided to buy myself a heavy coat that was about $175. It’s expensive for a coat, but I’ve been wanting it for a while and decided to spoil myself. I stopped at a pet store and bought Cas a few things (one of which was a coat that was literally $25) and went home. 

So I get home and Bryce is there. He sees my stuff and out of nowhere loses his shit. He starts yelling at me saying “You spend way too much money on that dog. He’s got shirts, way too many toys, expensive ass dog food, and I get jack shit. And now you got him a coat? Give me a fucking break.” 

I explained to him that I bought the coat because I need to take him on walks everyday since the vet said he’s a bit on the heavier side now. His dog food is a necessity so he doesn’t crap everywhere and then he cut me off to say “You couldn’t deal with some dog shit for a few months to buy me something with that money?” 

And I was so thrown off because I literally got him an expensive watch for Christmas (and other things but that was the big present). 

He said that it’s a dog and that he doesn’t need all the shit I buy and that the money I spent on the dog stuff could’ve went towards him getting a new coat too since he needed one. 

I told him that he has his own job that pays him and to get himself a coat. Cas and I were not responsible in any way for him needing a new coat and it wasn’t my obligation to get him a new one. I was livid. I grabbed Cas, the emergency bag I have packed for both of us,  and left (drove to my sisters house) and stayed there for the night and all of today. 

Bryce called me and told me to come home so we could fix this but I told him he was being an arrogant asshole for assuming I owe him ANYTHING. He then went off about how much of an AH I am and restated all his arguments from last night. 

I truly don’t feel like or think I’m the AH and believe I just stood up for myself (and my lovely dog) but I do admit Cas is very spoiled and has lots of stuff that a lot of people would roll their eyes at. And also I feel slightly guilty that when I was shopping I didn’t even think of getting Bryce anything. 

AITA?

Edit: I definitely should’ve kicked him out but I was so upset and wanted to be away from him and he was only in his underwear so he would’ve taken a long time to leave. I’m going back tomorrow morning with my sister.

Update: So I’ve talked with my sister and her husband and they told me that the best thing to do right now is stay with them until I get the locks changed. After Bryce blowing up like that when he’s NEVER spoken to me about this, the way he insulted my dog when he knows Cas is my everything, combined with the fact that in the 8 months we’ve been together he has had minor anger/temper issues (they were just never directed at me), I’ve decided I’m going to end things. Especially after seeing your comments about him possibly hurting Cas, that’s not a chance I’m willing to take. It’s 2:30 AM right now so I’ll be arranging my locks to get changed when the store opens and I’ll be calling Bryce to inform him. Thank you guys so much for you opinions.

592,t3_ruo7he,AITA for wanting care when i’m sick?,"i was diagnosed with covid 19 a few days ago. i’m fully vaccinated, but my symptoms have been pretty bad. it’s been a few days with a high fever, sore throat, aching, etc. it’s been hard for me to care for myself. my partner has been home with me, and even though i’ve asked for help around the house, i have been mostly caring for myself. each time i ask for help, my partner doesn’t really respond to my request. i ended up having to cook my own meals and generally care for myself, even when feeling my worst. they help out a little on the first day, but the rest of the care was on me. today, i asked if they could make me some food. i got a vague response and they didn’t get up to make me anything. about 30 mins later, i got up to make it myself. when i did that, they asked if they could have some of my food. this frustrated me. like a lot. i told them that i needed more help than i was receiving, and that it wasn’t fair for me to do the cooking. they didn’t like that, and we argued about it for at least 30 minutes. they told me i need to be more “direct” with my requests, while i feel like they need to take initiative and make the assumption that when i’m this sick, i can’t care for myself. aita? i feel like im going insane.",20.0
593,t3_ruo72h,WIBTA for not playing a video game with someone?,"Some context: I (22F) like to play video games with my younger brother, Brett (19M), and our older brother, Sam (25M). We don’t live together anymore but we always make time to play games together. It’s a time that’s really special to me and is always the highlight of my week. Sam will be having a baby soon so I know that we won’t be able to play once the baby is here. I am mentally disabled so sometimes I really struggle with change and emotional regulation. 

The problem: Sam’s brother-in-law (22M) wants to play with us. He just bought an XBOX specifically to join our gaming sessions and is currently waiting for it to arrive. This was not something that he discussed with us first. I do not want him to play with us at all. I don’t want him to join our voice chat, especially because I don’t feel like I can be myself when he’s around. He makes me feel like I have to be someone I’m not. I feel like playing with him will ruin all the fun of playing with my brothers. He’s been rude to me in the past so I have no interest in spending even more time with him. 

That being said, I lead our in-game group and I control who gets an invite to our group.  I only have a few months left to play with my brothers and I really want to keep that special time to ourselves. WIBTA for not sending him an invite to our in-game group? He’s more than welcome to play on his own (or even with one of my brothers), but he won’t be playing with me and I don’t want him encroaching on our sibling time.",2.0
594,t3_ruo674,AITA For not wanting to lie about being Bi?,"We arrived at partners parents house for a BBQ.

Partner asked me in the car as we pulled up to their parents house that wanted me to lie about being Bi to friends and family as he says they won't accept it.

The thing is we've been together for over 3 months and I've had chats with his friends about it already in a general chat about how life has changed and that more people are more accepting with the LGBTA+ community.

The Parents have always been the nicest people to me.

Weird thing is he has a Bi sister and their parents are accepting and treat the sisters girlfriend the same as me. 

When I refused to lie as their parents and friends are accepting of his sister so why would they have  problem with me?

They snapped saying there's no need to get defensive it was only a simply request and stormed out the car and went inside.

The BBQ went well and sexualities weren't brought up but my partner was grumpy all night.

595,t3_ruo4b8,AITA For calling out my co-worker," 

So I've been working with this co-worker for two years now and we were cool with each other (I guess?), she has done some things in the past that made me question if I should trust her or not, but anyway I decided to go back to college in September so I haven't worked with her since the Summer since I only work once a week and she doesn't work the days I work.

Over a month ago I was told by a team member that she said that I hated everyone I worked with which is not true, I called her up and was really polite and asked her if she said it and I told her people like to start drama so I wanted to ask you first just because I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't say it.

She denied it and quickly said she needed to go (which I thought was interesting) and she blocked me off Facebook right after.

I never called her out of her name or anything, I just wanted to know if she said it or not to clear the air.

Anyway, fast forward to today I got my year review and it was mostly positive other than I apparently brought drama from home to work and I was really confused since I literally work once a week and didn't know what I did until I remembered that I called her and I put two pieces together and figured she complained to my boss that I called her out.

596,t3_runzif,AITA for telling my daughter she doesn't need to attend my son's wedding,"I (46F) am married to my husband (47M) and we share two children, a daughter ""Olivia"" (22F) and a son ""Liam"" (20M). My husband also has a son ""James"" (28M) from a previous relationship. James' mother is not in his life, and I have raised him ever since he was a baby. I love him dearly, and consider him as my eldest child. James has been engaged to his fiancee ""Emma"" (28F) for the past three years, and they are planning to get married in the next two weeks. Emma is a nice and wonderful girl, and I know she'd be a great addition to the family. Olivia doesn't like Emma, as she has always wanted her best friend to marry James. Olivia works as a clothing designer and owns a small boutique. She told Emma that she would only allow the wedding, if she could design her wedding gown. Emma, however, politely declined and said that she wanted to wear her late mother's wedding gown instead. Frustrated, Olivia came up to me and complained that she would not attend the wedding if Emma did not wear a gown designed by Olivia. I calmly explained to Olivia that it was not her wedding, but Emma's, and that only Emma had the right to choose her wedding gown. Olivia broke down in tears saying that she was not going to the wedding, to which I said was completely up to her.

It seems that she has complained to Liam about it, as he called me later asking me why I was siding with another woman's son's fiancee rather than my own daughter. I was shocked hearing this, because I don't know where Liam got that impression because I always consider James as my own son. I'm not sure if I'm the AH, because Liam says that Olivia's feelings are hurt and that I've forgot to prioritize my own daughter's feelings. AITA?

Edit: I spoke to Liam about his behavior, and he has apologized to me for his words. He said that Olivia ran to him crying, telling him to say ""why are you siding with another woman's son's fiancee rather than your own daughter"". Liam said he wasn't exactly comfortable saying it, but he said he wanted to stick up for his older sister. I'm not sure if Liam is telling the truth just yet, but it seems plausible enough.

Edit: I finally got a chance to sit down and talk with Olivia and asked her why she feels upset about James' wedding and why she made Liam say such things to me. She admitted to me that she made Liam say that to make me feel guilty. She said that after she realized her best friend could not marry her brother, she at least wanted the opportunity to design the bride's dress to promote her store. I told her that since it's Emma's wedding day, only she can choose her bridal gown, however, I told Olivia that she could possibly talk with Emma about wearing a dress she makes for their wedding reception or perhaps another event. I told her what she said about James was out of line, to which she apologized. After I promised Olivia to have a ""spa weekend"" following James' wedding, she agreed to attend the wedding. ",2436.0
597,t3_runy5j,WIBTA if I ask my neighbor to be more mindful of how loud her kids are," 

Like many college students, I will be doing part, if not all, of my winter quarter online. My main problem with this setup is that my neighbors have extremely loud kids (3M&amp;1F between 8-13 yo) that love to yell every time they are outside. The first lockdown was an absolute nightmare because it happened every day. It is impossible to move to a different room because I'm already in the furthest room possible, and I can still hear them when I'm wearing earphones. It makes it hard for me to listen and pay attention to my lectures.

During the summer months, the children were playing outside almost every day with the screams that seem to accompany them where ever they go. They also have gotten into the habit of tossing balls and other toys over the fence, running over to bang on my front door to get the toys that they tossed over. And then they mad when we can't find the stuff they threw over.

They also like to play baseball in their yard, and we have found multiple baseballs in our yard, and now my mom is a little hesitant to go outside because she is worried she might be injured by one of these balls when she is outside.

WIBTA if I asked my neighbor to be more mindful that people are either going to school or working from home and it's hard to do that successfully if we can hear the constant loud shrieks of children in the background. I'm also not sure how to approach them, I'm a nonconfrontational person, so I was planning on sending the mom a text, but I'm unsure how that would be perceived.

I'm not telling the neighbor to shut her kids up and not let them play outside, only to be more mindful of how loud they are.

I completely understand that kids need to run around and have fun, and they are on their property, so they are allowed to do whatever they want. However, it is important to remember that there are people in their houses that don't appreciate loud noises daily.

I feel like I might be the asshole because I'm asking strangers to moderate their children's behavior and sending a text might be too hands off.",6.0
598,t3_runxio,AITA for copying a new set of keys for my friend?,"My (28F) best friend is getting married next week in our hometown, where I also live. My other best friend Julie (30F) is coming in from out of town to attend, but is not in the wedding. My husband (28M) and I are in the wedding party. We live fairly close to the venue, but will be staying with the bridal/groom wedding party the night before and then at the hotel for a night away. So our house will be completely empty - since her family is no longer in the area, I offered Julie to stay at our place. My husband was fine with this too as she has been a good houseguest in the past. I let Julie know that I was copying her a set of keys from Home Depot this week and would plan to leave them hidden outside our house so she could grab them anytime since we’ll be busy the whole weekend with wedding duties. She asked why I was doing this - “you don’t need to do all that! I can just borrow one of your sets.” Thing is… Julie loses everything. She is notorious for losing all kinds of things - credit cards, her entire wallet, her car keys. When we lived together in college, she lost her student ID (which contained her bus pass), then lost two more replacements in a span of a week, then lost MY pass that I loaned her for three days. 

So I don’t fully trust her with my keys. I told her it was because my husband and I won’t be together the whole time and could potentially need to stop at home. She didn’t seem to buy that and said she could always let me in since she’ll be home when not at the wedding. She kept pressing and I needed to say something. I said “I wanted you to have your own set in case something happens to them!” She got very upset, calling me an AH but also saying I wasn’t fully wrong. I told a couple friends about the situation and they are split. Everyone agrees she loses stuff a lot but some think I shouldn’t have told her that and should’ve just given her the keys instead of spending money on it.",22.0
599,t3_runubg,AITA Family is awful to me but great to my sister,"Background: I had cancer several years ago and my family was pretty awful to me. Parents moved in to “help” but ruined my relationship with my SO, went through my texts while I was in radiation, complained about how I wasn’t “social enough” when I tried to rest, and said I needed to get my friends to buy T-shirt’s to help pay my bills. Grandma showed up and had me making coffee for her boyfriend, cleaning microwave, doing chores. Sister did little to nothing to help. Over the years I’ve taken her on vacations, her hubby made 150k but she nickel and dimed me every time. 

Now my sister’s gotten divorced (they cheated on each other - on one of the trips I took my sister on to cheer her up bc her husband was so awful, she ignored me half the time because she was texting her bf..that’s when I found out she had a bf) and my parents and grandma have rolled out the red carpet to help her. Bought her a new sportscar, pay her bills, now they bought her a house. There was a problem with the downpayment so my sister, dad and grandma asked me if I’d be willing to loan her a downpayment if Grandma couldn’t come up with one. Thankfully she did, so I was off the hook. 

But now I’m annoyed that this situation has all played out like this. My family is calling me “bitter” and telling me I should be happy for my sister. Yes I am upset and I admit I didn’t congratulate her on her new home. But I tried to help her 2 years ago, told her she’d have to be on a budget and would need to downgrade her car. She said “I’m not going to drive a Toyota so I’ll just stay with my husband no matter what he does”. He ended up leaving. 

Now she makes tons of social media posts about how she was a victim and how awful he was. She has 2 kids so I know she has a lot to deal with, but I worked 14 hour days to pay for my college, was miserable during my cancer treatment and just don’t understand how my family doesn’t get that I would feel a little slighted.",6.0
600,t3_runs3z,AITA for wanting to remove my sister as matron of honour for our wedding?,"Posting on behalf of my partner as shes not sure if shes in the wrong.   When we got engaged she asked her sister to be matron of honour for our wedding. 

Partner has a group chat where she has the bridal party with the bridesmaids and matron of honour so they can discuss arrangements such as dresses, hen party and meeting up if needed to discuss things in person.   

Things were running smoothly up until today with Matron of Honour. One of partners bridesmaids posted in the group chat about meeting my partner and the other bridesmaids as she lives far away and was coming up to stay with her family and wanted to meet them all whilst she was up. Sister texted partner and said “can your friends arrange their social lives not on the bridal chat? My phone keeps going off and i dont want to mute because i dont want to miss any important dates or info” Partner replied telling her to message the bridesmaid if she wasnt happy and that she wasnt getting involved. Sister then said she was leaving the group and to make sure to message all arrangements separately and don’t forget or let phone mess up. Partner replied do what you want 🤷🏼‍♀️  Sister then sent another message saying “do you even want me as a bridesmaid because I’ve been getting negative vibes from you and I’d rather you just say tbh”  Partner was very confused by this as she felt she hadn’t done anything to come across this way and didn’t understand why her sister was saying this.   

Sister then sent a voice message to partner saying “ my phones pinging and my husband isn’t very well. Your friends are arranging something which doesn’t even include me it’s rude to write something that doesn’t include them as this is rude. If i get on there and start cussing out your friends how is that going to affect your wedding day? What happens when i walk in the room and start cussing them? You don’t want me to start I’m not in the mood today. Just thought it would be better if you put ohh this chat is for bridal stuff only please put it in another chat. I don’t see what your on about telling me to think about what I’m saying. I’m saying what i think and what I’m saying is I don’t want my phone pinging all night for something that doesn’t include me and being in a chat where people are rude. If your friends are socially ret***ed and don’t get the social etiquette thats for you to deal with. This is not my problem. I don’t need to think about what I say, I agree with what I’m saying husband agrees with what I’m saying. My daughter has gone to bed and my phone is pinging and it could wake her up I’m just trying to enjoy a nice evening and don’t put s*** on the chat that doesn’t involve one of the members. Ohh now my daughters awake!”   

Partner was really upset by this message as the word ret***  really offends her as she has a disability and some of her bridesmaids have disabilities. She left it and didn’t reply and called her mum to get some advice as she was unsure what to do next.   

Few hours pass and sister texts again  If you’ve got something to say grow a pair and say it to me not mum. Leave her out of it. She’s on holiday so stop being so selfish and leave her to rest and enjoy herself. I’m happy to be involved in your wedding or not. Let me know whether to send back daughters dress or not. Ohh and any messages to my friend that you have for her and I’ll give her your number so you can discuss it with her. Good luck with that 😂😂😂  I replied on partners behalf  Except that’s not what was said and anyway we are watching a film 👌  

Partner is very unhappy and upset about what’s gone on and she is thinking she doesn’t want her sister to be matron of honour anymore due to the way shes behaved. Also with the ret*** remark she really doesn’t want her sister to be in the bridal party anymore due to her lack of understanding of disabilities even though her daughter has ADHD so she should understand and understand how offensive the ret*** remark is.",7.0
601,t3_runnem,AITA for saying I won't help my older brother after his surgery?,"I (15F), have always kinda tooken care of my family. I have two brothers, Markus (17M) and Xander (11M). And to say we don't get along would be an understatement. They always gang up on me and they have their clever ways of getting me to do their chores. I should also mention, my has a lot of health issues so it is hard for her to get up in the morning, but she still has a job. Also for those of you asking, our Dad doesn't live with us, we see him every other weekend. Do to these health issues, sometimes she can't get up and get food. If she asks my siblings, they refuse and run away. I couldn't believe it. So I started feeding her well my siblings got to play on their games. Soon enough though it turned into a cycle where I'd have to feed them to. They all also expected for me to do the dishes, laundry, pet care, and etc. It's gets so exhausting. 

So this brings us to the problem: my brother had to get an extreme surgery on his dominant right wrist. I already had a lot on my plate because I have all the chores to do. One day, Markus, called me to his room. So went upstairs and asked him what. And he basically started on this whole tangent that I needed to help him and that he needed food. I told him no and that I have a list of chores to do and I'm couldn't help him. 

""Why can't you take care of your poor older brother?"" He asked

And I told him back: ""No, I didn't sign up for this. I already made up my mind, I have too many things to do already and I'm not going to help you. You can do it yourself."" And I walked away.

Later, my mom came home from work, she was not pleased that I didn't help my ""poor sick brother "". I told her that he isn't a baby anymore and in one year he could move out on his own since he is 17. She said still should of helped and have been lazy. She sent me to my room for the rest of the day. Now the more I think about it, I feel like an asshole. So please tell me, am I the asshole?

Edit: I have talked to my mom and siblings and they promised to change and help me. It's been about 1 hour at this point and I see improvement. They also told me that if I need help, to ask them. Hopefully it will stay like this",218.0

Me 20f
Bf 21M
Little sister 11f

On Christmas my bf and I went to his family’s celebration. All is well, while opening gifts bfs cousin makes a comment about seeing a bug in bfs little sisters hair. Bug disappears, everyone forgets. Later on, bfs little sister is standing in front of me in line for food and I see a few bugs in her hair, I immediately know exactly what it is bc i had lice when i was in middle school. I tell bf discreetly, he tells his dad. Dad immediately denies and gets upset despite bf and I both seeing the bugs. Anyways bfs parents are both still in denial which means lice is just getting worse and spreading. After Christmas bf and I went home and immediately did preventative treatments and I told bf that we will not be seeing his family until the issue is handled. Their denial means it’ll be a while. Suddenly family wants to visit or hang out all the time after Christmas (which i personally think is intentional but idk). I know head lice isn’t the worst thing ever, but I am mixed and have very long curly thick hair and have to go to the doctor for these things because I can’t get a lice comb through my hair. Not a big deal but in general it is pricey as a college student and finding time to go to a dr is inconvenient. Im also a medical professional and work in close contact with patients so the last thing i want to is to catch it and spread it to my patients.

AITA for avoiding bfs family until they get treated? they haven’t really ever liked me and seem to be taking this personally or as an insult—its not that i think they’re gross or anything i just don’t need another thing to stress about. I already went to the doctor for treatment just in case but id like to avoid reinfection. We have been saying no to all plans bc of this.

edit: i forgot to mention that i wouldnt have an issue if we could stay distanced but bfs family are big huggers. little sister loves cuddling and treats us like jungle gyms which is why im so hesitant. lice is highly infectious.",60.0

Then, I got an RPG and AR and just started exploding and spamming him with bullets. He started raging and I thought it was funny. I do this for a few more rounds and he gets very, very pissed off, until he just started screaming at me, calling me a shit ton of names and offensive slurs until he started tearing up and left.

A little rundown on the situation, despite 12 years of marriage we never had any children and we found out the fertility issue was on my end, I suggested we try adoption or a surrogate but he was against both options, adoption because the kid wouldn't be his biologically and surrogate as he didn't like the idea of a stranger carrying his child so it left us at a stalemate and I was willing to accept we'd never have children, he however was not and he began to have an affair which led to the breakdown of our marriage.

I’m very close with both of my full blooded siblings and none of us are close to Lisa. We found out about her existence about 8 years ago - our dad and her mom dated and broke up, then our dad met our mom a few weeks later. Her mom didn’t tell our dad about her and none of us knew until Lisa turned 18 and found dad on Facebook. 

Our mom never stopped our dad from having a relationship with her, and dad and Lisa get along pretty well, but has said she doesn’t want to know her at all. Our parents also fought about whether or not we should be allowed to get to know her, but stopped because we told them we weren’t interested. Before the pandemic, we would see her every few months at various family events with dad’s family and we just never clicked. She’s so different from us - part of it is her mom is from a very loud culture and our mom is from a very quiet culture - but she’s not someone I’ve ever felt like I could be friends with, let alone treat like a sibling. It just feels like she’s someone we have to tolerate. 

So, this situation came about because we spent New Year’s Eve with some of dad’s family and Lisa was there. She overheard Talia use my nickname and then followed us around for awhile using the nickname. Talia came up with my nickname when we were little - it’s a combination of my first and middle names and in our mom’s native language, Talia made up a funny rhyme to go along with it, kind of like a little poem or tongue twister. It’s special to me, only Talia and Micah use it. Lisa doesn’t speak the language and I just got so annoyed with her that I told her she sounded like a stupid parrot and that only my real siblings got to call me it. This upset her and she cried loudly about it. I didn’t mean to make her cry, but she’s so presumptuous and annoying, I hate having to pretend to like her and I don’t understand why she keeps trying to get close to us when we’ve been clear that we don’t want to be close. 

Talia and Micah are on my side and say that she has never taken any of our hints or respected our boundaries over the past 8 years so I’m justified in what I said to get her to back off, but dad thinks it was too far. 

AITA for what I said?

Edit: to be clear, we have spent time with her. We’ve told her in the past we’re not interested in having a relationship with her. Getting to know her at family functions has not changed any of our minds.

Edit2: from the few of you who actually answered the question, I accept that it was a harsh reaction and I should have said something before I got so upset that I called her a parrot. As for all of the extraneous advice and judgment, much of it does not apply to my situation. 
- I don’t need to get to know her, I’ve been doing that for 8 years. 
- We’re not her only half-siblings - her mother married and has 2 children with her husband. 
- My mother isn’t jealous (?) of my half-sister. She’s my father’s daughter, not hers. She has even defended my father’s decision to get to know Lisa to her own family (my maternal side) and does not let them call her names like byblow or bastard. She wasn’t pleased my dad had a child out of wedlock and not with her, but she has been civil to Lisa.

Now here's the thing, the rest of her family all live atleast a couple thousand miles away, and won't be able to travel here on time to be with her when she is going to give birth. So my aunt (her mom) recently called me, and asked me if I would be ok with being in the delivery room with my cousin, so that has someone she knows there with her. I was honestly kinda shocked that my aunt  would even asked me this, and told her that I'm absolutely not up for it. In my opinion, giving birth is such an intense and intimate experience, and I feel like it would be inappropriate for me to be there, when we are not even that close. Now everyone in my family is pissed at me, and my dad told me to ""man up"" and asked me if I was gonna behave like this with my future wife, but I feel like that's a completely different situation.

I asked my cousin what she thinks about all of this, and she said that she would like me to be there, but she also understands if I don't want to. My family won't stop giving me shit about it and I'm really starting to feel bad about it now, but I also feel like they're not in their right minds for not seeing how wrong and kinda creepy all of this is. I feel like I'm going insane rn, so please tell me, AITA??",88.0
608,t3_rumzt7,AITA for telling my ex that he and his wife need to stop fostering?,"My ex-husband is remarried to a very nice woman, Vanessa. They've been together for 8 years. While my ex-husband and I have 3 kids together (12M, 14F and 17M), Vanessa isn't able to have any biologically. She's been an amazing step-mom to my kids and I feel safe with them going there every other week.

However, over the past 5 years that they've been married, Vanessa and my ex have fostered children, in hopes to adopt. They fostered a baby girl for 3 years (from the time she came home to the hospital) and she ended up reunited with family. It was extremely hard on the kids, as well as my ex and Vanessa. Immediately after, they began fostering another child (5 years old) and were supposed to adopt them. Right before Christmas, he was reunited with his biological father that they originally had no information on.

This has been incredibly hard for the kids. They are devastated and started going to therapy after their first foster sister was removed from the home. Recently, my older two came to me and said they cannot take another loss. They keep getting very attached to these foster siblings, only to have them ripped away. It's not the fault of their dad or step-mom, and it's also amazing that these kids get to stay with their biological family (the goal of foster care), but it doesn't change how hard it is on them. They told me that their dad and step-mom have been talking about taking on a new placement in the New Year and have said they won't live with their father if they do so. They had tried talking to him but all they had gotten was ""It's the reality of foster care"".

I went to my ex and Vanessa to talk about the kids. They kept saying that this is the reality of foster care, that it hurts them too, but they feel they're at least offering a loving and safe home to these kids. I asked what about the kids that they already have? My ex-husband's argument is that they'll be off to college soon. I asked why they can't at least wait for the older two to leave the home and they asked what if Vanessa got pregnant? Would they get to control that? I argued that'd be different. That's not a sibling they'd risk losing. I ultimately said what the kids did: if they continued to foster, our elder kids would choose to not come around as much and I'd support them in court. If our youngest wanted to keep up the custody agreement, that's fine, but I'd keep them in therapy.

My ex called me and said Vanessa has been sobbing all weekend after my ""threat"". He says it's not fair to ask this of them and make them decide. I told him it's up to him to decide what he could live with. AITA?

EDIT: I thought it was clear but my ex and his wife have them every other week. We alternate holidays and such.

EDIT 2: Many people keep asking if my kids understand what fostering means. They do. They understand the logistics of fostering. That doesn’t mean they can help their emotions. Their therapist has said they are traumatized by these events.

EDIT 3: Potentially the final update. I did reach out to my ex and his wife. I apologized for telling them that they shouldn't foster again, as that part is none of my business. I did share that I feel it might be beneficial to for the two of them and the kids to see a family therapist or mediator so all sides can be heard. They actually agreed that's a good idea and are going to find a different therapist just so there is no bias, which I support. What happens from this point is beyond my control and business. I am hopeful that my children can continue to have a strong and healthy relationship with their father and step-mother.

To those that said my kids should naturally be stronger or doubted their trauma, I sincerely hope you do more research and learn that needing therapy doesn't make you weak or spoiled. It helps with coping strategies and gives a safe place to talk about their feelings. 

To those that accused me of being jealous or bitter, no. I am remarried with another child. I am happy for them and wish them nothing but happiness and peace in the future.",5761.0

610,t3_rumpcw,AITA for pretending to be an Asshole?,"Throwaway account. When I (early 40's M) was in high school, I had this best friend named Mark. The two of us had been good friends since 6th grade. Over the years, we became inseparable doing the things that teenage boys liked to do. We worked at the same job, hung out almost every weekend, and stayed up into the wee hours of the morning playing Goldeneye. The two of us discussed everything from women to dreams of the future—all of which I say to emphasize that we were brothers in all but name.

The problem came senior year when I got a girlfriend. I don't want to get until the nuts and bolts of that situation with the girl, except to say that it was my first girlfriend, it was short-lived, and I fucked it up royally. Mark, who had always been a little immature, did not take my sudden division of attention very well. But I did NOT hold that against him and remember trying to soothe his ego. If the shoe had been on the other foot, I might have been the one that was jealous.

My friends tried to help put the pieces of me back together. One night, Mark's mother was out of town and a group of us got together at his place and got stupid drunk. Me, being the depressed angsty teen that I was, drank way too much and ended up passing out. They got scared when I went unconscious and woke me up by throwing in me a cold shower.

Later, another good friend of mine who was there that night, named Adam, came to me and confided there was more to the story. While I was unconscious, Mark kept trying to pull my underwear down because he wanted to see my dick. Adam, and the other guy there besides Mark told him that what he was doing was fucked up, but he kept ignoring them and trying to remove my boxers. The other friend confirmed the story, but assumed he had been joking around. 

I took it hard. Another time, not too long before this event, I remembered Mark trying to get me to watch male on male porn.  I thought he was pranking me, because we had both exhaustively spoken about and had been keenly interested in the opposite sex as only young straight men are. However, that along with him trying to undress me because he wanted to ""get a good look at my dick"" and the jealousy over my girlfriend freaked me OUT!

The day I found out I told Mark that I didn't want him to be in the senior year photo with our friends. Everyone, except for Adam, thought I was being an asshole to Mark for ""suddenly deciding he wasn't cool"" and I was happy to let everyone think that. I didn't know how to deal with the situation better than a crash and burn scenario.

And it worked too well. My sudden rejection deeply hurt Mark, which, for him, seemed to have come out of nowhere. Years later, he still had not gotten over it and demanded an explanation. I lied again and said I was an asshole and apologized.

611,t3_rummnb,AITA for refusing to invite my father to my wedding?,"more context in comments.

I (F28) was adopted at 5 months old and raised by my paternal grandparents my whole life. my father was my neighbor and he had two sons after I was born and raised them with my stepmom. he never made eye contact with me growing up, barely acknowledged my existence and doesn't know my birthday or middle name.

so today my grandmother (his mother) cried when I told her he wasn't invited. I have too much pain associated with constantly trying to gain his love from a young age. I don't think he deserves to see me on my special day and it's more embarrassing to have him there without walking me down the aisle. 

my grandmother is a very stubborn woman who holds grudges against many family members that she hasn't let go of for 20+ years. she's being hypocritical by begging me to let it go and invite him. my fiancee thinks I could break the cycle of the grudges that all my family has against one person or another. and that I have a chance to say I tried to be a good person and include him. but he is also supportive of my decision and wants me to just consider it for her sake. he agrees that it is ultimately my decision but he didn't like seeing her cry either.

it hurts me so much to see her hurt because there's always division in my family and I feel like an asshole for not sucking it up for her since she's 80. I know it would make her happy to see everyone there, but it's either my pain or hers. my father is so indifferent toward me and I know it wouldn't affect him in any way.

613,t3_rumhgp,"AITA for putting locks on my door, because of my wife's grams","So, I(28M) and my wife, Laura (26F) have a wonderful little boy, 6. My wife's 8 months pregnant.

We have a huge bed, however I'm apparently a kicker, so to make sure I don't kick Laura, I put up an air bed in the baby’s nursery and decided that we'd be better than my wife having to sleep on one.

Laura's grandma (74) moved in with us last year, due to her old people's home being shut down. She is sleeping in the guest bedroom. While she may be old, she's still fighting fit. 

So at the beginning of Laura's pregnancy, I hear my door opening and still being half asleep, I assume it's Tommy. I realised it wasn't Tommy when someone double his height with and thick curly hair crawled into my bed next to me. The only person I know with long nails and that kind of hair is Laura’s grams. I jumped up and screamed wtf do you think your doing. She hushed me and said be quiet as I may wake her pregnant granddaughter. I told her to get out and it was weird. 

The next morning when I was stood in the kitchen with Laura and her grams I brought it up and asked what tf did she think she was doing. She said she forgot where the bathroom was, and blamed it on her age. Laura said she couldn't argue with that.

The same thing happened for about a month until I decided to buy a sign for the bathroom, and illuminated tape leading from her bedroom, to the bathroom. 

This stopped her for a few weeks, matey a month or 2, but soon she came up with a new excuse off ""I needed to go get her water as she forgot how to do it"". Laura said to her grams that if she has a problem then go and see her in the night as its not my problem, but she blames it on the stairs(Laura's and I bedroom is downstairs but all the others are upstairs.) 

She thankfully stopped but then her excuses got plain stupid, she was saying stuff like ""I need help getting of the toilet"" or ""I was hungry and didn't know what I was allowed to eat."" I was sick of it as we had spend hundreds of pounds on stuff like a snack bar in her room, or a water dispenser, I kept telling my wife that if she carries on, then we're putting her in a home, but my wife uses the excuse of ""she's old""
The other day I bought a lock for my room, just a simple one that you can easily take off. Laura's grams tried to get into the room 2 nights ago and when she couldn't she started jimmying the door asking to come in. Laura and Tommy woke up and everyone, especially my wife was pissed at me, because now her grams can't feel safe in her own home, as though she's the one paying bills or something.

 The only reason why I bought it was because I just wanted 1 full night sleep. Last night I had the best sleep as I wasn't disturbed by her grams, but now I feel bad for my wife because her grams might have to disturb her If she needs anything (she hasn't yet thankfully)

So AITA?

614,t3_rume5m,AITA for not letting my daughter attend a college party?,"I(48M) have a daughter that is turning 16 years old this week.

615,t3_rumc6w,AITA for making my new coworker cry?,"I (19F) have worked in a factory for almost a year. It's simple work, but it's 10 hour days 5 days/week on your feet doing fast-paced physical labor, and takes a while to get used to. 

My coworker ""Maya""(29F) joined our crew \~3 weeks ago. It's worth noting that English usn't her first language, but she's conversational, and others on our crew do speak her first language. She was in training for the first 2 weeks, per standard. Usually this is long enough to make someone competent in all necessary stations on the production line, but Maya still struggles. This is a problem since every station needs to work seamlessly together or risk damaging the machines by putting product in wrong. The line also can't be stopped to fix mistakes. When someone makes a mistake the rest of the crew can usually pick up their slack and fix it, but this is very stressful for everyone, especially if mistakes are frequent.

On the day in question, Maya and I were together on a 2-person station. Boxes would slide off a chute in front of us, and it was our job to alternate catching them, fit the proper number tightly into crates in the correct arrangement, then send the crates on the next conveyor belt. This is a fast station- \~2 boxes/second. Maya kept fumbling her catches, forcing me to break rhythm and do the work of 2 people until she managed another catch. I was very focused on moving fast and keeping the line running, and apparently I was placing the boxes with more force than necessary. I didn't say anything or even look at her funny, but I got scolded after for ""scaring Maya"".

Later, we were making a different product. Maya was toting- she was supposed to put lids on totes of product, stack them on a pallet, and call for a runner to take the full pallet and give her a new one. I was runnning, and noticed totes piling up at her station. Her pallet was full, and she hadn't said a word. That's somethig I'd gotten chewed out pretty bad for when I was new, so, trying to sound cheerful and lighthearted, I told her ""Hey Maya, you gotta holler 'PALLET' when your pallet is full so we can get you a new one!"". She responded ""I don't speak English!"" then burst into tears and ran off her station in the middle of production to go find a supervisor. I genuinely didn't now she was crying until later, when I got laid into by our supervisor and 4 other coworkers

I honestly didn't mean to upset her, but it's worth noting that I was dealing with a very painful loss that occured a few hours before my shift. I may not have been regulating my emotions as well as I thought I was. That's an explanation, not an excuse.

616,t3_rum4cj,AITA for getting mad that my siblings won’t try to communicate with my father?,"I (nb18) have two siblings, m21 and nb16. Recently my nb sibling has begun to try to change up their clothing style by wearing dresses and skirts. To my brother and I this isn’t an issue, but we are concerned with how my father, mother, aunt and uncle take the news. My nb sibling has not officially come out to the family yet, but is still wearing dresses around the house. They hide themselves away when my father enters the room because they think he will be mad at them.

The thing is, I don’t feel this should be such a major issue. My older brother is trans and came out to my family years ago; it took a while for my parents and aunt and uncle to fully get around to the idea, but generally they all treat my brother well, if with a few pronoun slip ups.
(I am personally not out to my family yet because I don’t see the need for the hassle. I know the adults have a harder time adjusting to pronoun changes and my pronouns are she/he (afab) anyway, so I don’t think it’s a big deal.)

Because my sibling is not coming out to anyone, though, things have been tense around the house. They buy dresses and skirts without my parents knowledge and then wear them to school or out shopping. I, personally, entirely believe that if they came out to the family my parents would be more than willing to buy them new clothes themselves, if only a few; we are decently well off, but we do live in a conservative state in the U.S, and they don’t want to see their kids being attacked on the street for how they dress.

Both my sibling and my brother, though, are unwilling to even consider coming out to the family because they think my father will be displeased. I, apparently neutral in the matter, have insider information to what my dad thinks: he doesn’t care if my sibling is trans, he just thinks they need better outfits.

Recently this came to a peak when my siblings went out shopping. As they left the house my dad saw my sibling’s outfit, but didn’t say anything. My mom told them to change into something else over text because she doesn’t like being dragged into their drama. After shopping, my brother texted me that they were afraid to come home because mom and dad might be mad at them. I told them that they really weren’t and were over it, but he was still panicking to me, and I, admittedly, snapped. I told them straight that my dad is genuinely trying to be accepting towards them and their identities (which he has said to me in private) and that things are constantly tense around the house because they refuse to address the situation at all. I told them that they either needed to have a discussion with dad about their clothing and their gender or stop wearing skirts and dresses around the house because being half out of the closet isn’t making things easier on us.

My brother told me my advice was terrible because my dad is transphobic, but I still elect to give him the benefit of the doubt and trust my dad. Am I wrong in this situation? Should I leave it alone even if my family has another fight because of it?

EDIT: Yeah, I’m coming around to realizing im an ass here. More Info:
It took a long time for my dad to be accepting of my older brother, about a year to really get it in his head that he was trans. My siblings are worried of it happening again and my dad denying my sibling’s identity.

My dad tells me in private his feelings about my siblings because he is afraid that they will hate him for not understanding. He knows that my siblings still hold his year of denial against him, and he admits he was wrong, but my siblings don’t forgive him for it. He is terrified of losing a good bond with his kids because of his mindset, and he’s having trouble adapting to more progressive ways of thinking, as much as he tries.

And about the whole “not a hassle thing” - ya’ll are completely right: saying that is super bitchy. I shouldn’t try to tell my sibling to communicate with my parents if I can’t even do it myself. Thanks guys.

UPDATE: I’ve apologized to my siblings about the whole situation; still feel really guilty about it. They’ve forgiven me for being freaked out about the whole thing (which I didn’t even realize was happening oops thanks anxiety) so we’re ok now. I’m gonna give my sibling as much time as they need to come out like they deserve. Thank you so much again. &lt;3",8.0

My mom constantly calls me the “rebel” and “black sheep” because I dont just go along with everything she says and she thinks some of my harmless opinions are slights against her. Shes not my biological mom (my dad is my bio dad) but shes raised me since i was nearly 6. Idk why, but I always feel like Im not the type of daughter she wanted. Both therapists i had have told me to cut them off and so have many friends over the past 10 years, but I feel like I can’t because all lose the rest of my family that I haven’t already cut off and not everyone sucks.

I’ve been dating my current bf for 6 months and honestly hes the best thing thats ever happened to me. Amazing communication, working on himself constantly, his family is so kind all around (which is unusual to me lol), and despite it only being 6 months marriage is already being discussed. Theres so much more but thats not the point of this.

So - family loves my bf, which is usual. Bf hates the way my family treats me (except my little bro and grandparents).

Even when shes around I ask my bf not to start anything with my parents cause ultimately thatll come back on me. My grandma has shut down some rants/berating that has come down solely on me over the years, but my bf really wants to go off on them. I told him its useless because even the therapist THEY CHOSE for me as an adult couldnt even get through to them. They think everything they do and say is in the best interest of me regardless of what anyone else thinks is what theyve told me.

Theyre starting to notice his silence which i dismiss to them, and all I ask of my bf is to just show face and that we dont even have to stay long and somehow my parents/older bro manage to say sh*t about me in a short amount of time.

I’ve always worn my hair short (since I was a teenager). When my hair gets below my shoulders it starts giving me headaches and I just hate the way it looks on me. It drags my face down and makes me look older than I am.

So this afternoon I cut my hair from about down to my mid back. I just couldn’t stand it anymore.

I didn’t cut my hair short like my previous styles, I cut a sort of longish bob with curls. 

I feel better, my daughters love it. I’ve already gotten a compliment of it when I went for takeout. So I didn’t have a manic episode (I’m not bipolar, I just hate the mental health community has treated women, now and in the past).

I thought it through. Weighed the risks and benefits, and cut it a little longer than normal in case I messed up and a stylist would need that length to fix it.

ANYWAY

My husband laughed at me and shook his head. He turned it in to something about lesbians and how I’m becoming one. My two daughters (5 &amp; 9) were in the room when he said this to me.

Here is where I might’ve been the asshole. I sent the kids to go play and I asked him if he felt insecure that I would suddenly turn lesbian and like elope with another woman. I told he he has no right to my body and I’ll do with it as I please. And what the hell kind of parenting is that to say those things (as a father to their mother!) in front of young girls. I really chewed him out. He gets his hair cut once or twice a year and just hides it under a baseball cap. I don’t tel him to get a haircut because I don’t like it.

He got angrier and and has been treating me like shit, more than usual.

Am I the asshole for not telling him or *shudder* getting his permission?

Edit: I overheard my 9 year old telling him, “Dad that wasn’t nice. Mom let’s me decide how I want my hair, shouldn’t she get to choose how she wears hers? And her hair looks good. Why are you mad if it looks good?”

621,t3_rum3eu,"WIBTA for ""banning"" my daughter's friend from our house for a fake reason?","My (42M) daughter ""Sarah"" (18) has been friends with Amy (18) since they were about 12. My wife is a doctor so she isn't in the house much leaving me to cook. On Fridays my work finishes early so I make us an extra nice meal. One day 5 years ago my daughter brought some friends home after school on Friday and asked me to make them some food since they were starving and dinner was going to be a while. So I used some of the ingredients I was prepping for dinner to make something different. The girls (most importantly Sarah) loved the food and asked for it again the next week. Thus started a tradition of me making a meal for her and her friends every Friday after school. As her friend groups changed people came and went, but Amy always stuck around. Frequently Amy is the only one who comes. Also the kitchen and dining table are open plan so sometimes I'd talk to them while they ate or get food opinions. This stopped over lock-down and only started again September last year.

At my daughter's birthday party my wife joked that my her friends have a crush on me. I laughed and told her not to be gross. Looking back it might have been a hint to be more standoffish, since I'm really thick when it comes to women/flirting (got asked out 3 times without having a clue any of them were into me). But I started noticing weird stuff since the joke, especially from Amy. So far she's said: ""I wish I could find a man like you"", "" You're in such good shape, how much do you workout?"" (I'm not really), ""your wife needs to be careful, someone might steal you"" etc.

I brushed these off and just tried to keep my distance. But 2 weeks ago I got really uncomfortable from one interaction. Sarah was in the bathroom and Amy was finishing up her food. Then she suddenly got excited and told me ""Me and Sarah are planning on having sleepovers in the break"", I responded ""cool"", then she said ""You know I'm 18 right?"" and winked at me. While getting up from the table she tried to do what I can only describe as a weird version of ""the bend and snap"" from Legally blonde. Thankfully she didn't sleepover because she was self-isolating for most of the break.

Anyway I hope you appreciate that stuff like that would make me uncomfortable in my own home. I don't want to talk to Amy directly because I'm worried about making the situation worse or her lying to Sarah or her parents. I don't want to talk to my wife or Sarah because otherwise Amy is a great best friend to my daughter and I don't want to ruin their relationship and hurt her feelings. My wife would probably tell her if she thinks what I said is true and the dinners will stop forever this summer anyway.

So my solution is telling Sarah that she can't have friends over on Friday anymore because she has to focus on her A-Level exams. Then I'll try to make sure that my wife is around when Amy visits or I'm not in the house.

WIBTA for lying to my daughter?

Edit:  
Sorry for the delay in response, work has been very hectic the last few days but I read the comments whenever I could. 

I ended up talking to the wife as everyone suggested. She had already guessed the crush but didn't actually expect Amy to act that way. We agreed that if she does stuff like that again I'll tell her to stop and how inappropriate it is at the moment, then me and my wife will have a sit down with our daughter to talk through it.

622,t3_rulzum,AITA for calling my husband lazy?,"Backstory: I'm  7 months pregnant and two weeks ago I fractured my ankle. 

My husband has a habit of saying he will do something, but puts it off and usually I will end up doing it because it needs to get done. This weekend was the last straw. Yesterday and today he slept in until almost 10 AM while I was up at 6 AM with our 3 year old daughter. When our daughter woke us up this morning, he just assumed I'd get up with her and rolled back asleep. I made her breakfast and had to help get things ready for her to go back to preschool tomorrow. I also did some dishes and laundry. I asked him if he could start taking some of the Christmas decorations down and he said he would try to later, but he had a bad headache and needed to rest. Not taking into consideration I'm in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy and have been hobbling around on a fractured ankle (that is seriously throbbing) ALL WEEKEND.

So I told him he needs to step up and stop being so lazy. There's no reason he can't help with things and there is no reason he needed to almost sleep until 10. He went on to mention about his headache and I told him I didn't want to hear it. He reluctantly went to take some decorations down but of course had to tell me I was being TA.

624,t3_rulys4,WIBTA if I don't give up one of my days off?,"Background: I work in a home for mentally/physically disabled adults. They are not able to speak or move on their own. I myself am 27, diabetic, have a bad back from an accident and have my own battles going on with my physical and mental health. My job is very hard on me and I have had very unhealthy habits when it comes to work. Going in even when sick, allowing myself to be taken advantage of to avoid guilt and feeling lazy, ECT. 

I used to be very enthusiastic about my job until a few months ago. I got a very contagious and painful stomach virus that left me dehydrated, unable to keep anything down and just generally miserable. When I called in I was harassed for hours and even told things like: 

""So you could get a ride to the hospital but not work?""

""Just so you know, you're fucking everything up for everyone here.""

I was pushed to the point of a severe panic attack where I tried getting to my car to drive to work and I ended up injured because I couldn't see straight or keep balance and fell. My boyfriend was not happy and gave me a very long lecture about my letting my jobs bully me. I took it to heart and have since made an effort to stop this. I've done an alright job but since then I've realized my job asks a lot of me. 

Driving on my days off because my home coordinator refuses to drive. Giving up days off because people want vacation. I've missed appointments because I'll come in for ""just an hour until she gets here"" and I get stuck there for hours with no reply. I even had to make up hours I'd taken for bereavement when my father died, I only took three days and I was still asked everyday when I was coming back. Most recently, I was told to work even though I had the possibility of having covid. 

On top of this, my home coordinator tends to leave me half or more of her tasks for the day to do during my shift. I've begun dreading my job and I'm bitter about being the only one who cleans, finishes my tasks and keeps up with my job. I'm looking for a new one but haven't found one that pays enough yet. (Not that my job pays well, I just work so many hours it does alright)

My home coordinator took her position knowing we were the only two employees at this house and that she would be getting very few days off. I was offered the same position and refused because of that.(It's this that has made me say nothing about picking up parts of her job. I understand she's tired.) I have my limits. I work 4 days with 12 hour shifts and have three days off. 

Now, I'm being asked to to give up one of my days off so she can have a break. I've offered to work a double on Friday instead because I have things to do. I always do, I use my days off to care for myself and my home and do things that need done. 

She doesn't seem to accept that, I already know how they all react to me saying no and I just want to know if I'd be an AH to say nope, can't do it.

Edit: I never only work my scheduled hours. I'm supposed to have 80-85 hours every two weeks but frequently end up with 95-130. My most recent was 110 hours. I do pull my weight. I'm confident I'm a good worker I'm just unsure about if I'm being an ass in this case.",6.0
625,t3_rulv8r,AITA for not accepting my BIL and SIL apology for what they said about my son?,"Disclaimer: I am on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.
A little back story) about two years ago, my BIL was very bad off on hard drugs. My husband and I helped him to get off of them because his wife would baby him and let him continue to do it, waiting for “god’s intervention.” 
Shortly after that, him and his wife got pregnant and had their baby.
My younger SIL started baby sitting their child, and eventually came to my husband and I and told us that my BIL was talking crap, about my then 1 year old, son. Saying things along the line about how he hoped his child didn’t turn out “retarded” like ours and stuff along those lines.
My son does suffer from a speech delay, and had a bad habit of doing odd things like, for example, hitting himself when throwing a tantrum. Thankfully he doesn’t do that anymore, but he’s very smart when it comes to other things. We think he may suffer from ADHD or may even be somewhere on the autism spectrum.
I asked my younger SIL if his wife stuck up for my son at all, and she said no that she agreed with what he had said.
(Also side note) we did ask why she felt the need to tell us knowing it could start problem, and said she felt we just needed to know and that it hurt her really bad because she loves our son almost like her own, because she’s been helping look after him since he was a newborn.
After that my husband was understandably pissed and confronted my BIL and things got heated and we just stopped all communication.
I haven’t spoken to them in years and this past Christmas while we were visiting family they showed up and pulled my husband and I to the side to apologize, saying “that they shouldn’t have said what they did But they said it out of the well-being for my son.” 
I, not wanting to cause a scene, kept my cool and just told them that I don’t appreciate what they said and I will not be accepting their apology and that I never want them around my children ever again, and to not speak to me again. 
They got mad and said that I should be grateful they even apologized to begin with but at the end of the day they still stood by their word.
I packed my kids up and we left. 
My MIL called the next day and said I was being unreasonable and that I should’ve accepted the apology to make peace within the family.
I told her that their apology wasn’t sincere and that I wasn’t going to allow anyone to talk badly about my child and them still be in their lives.

'Its too extreme! It's too dark!' she screeches, I drop my hair back into place and speak up 'what is?', 'Your make up!'

I was taken aback, she had complimented it and even said it was subtle yesterday, i had done the exact same look too. she gasps again 'Take that hair out of your eyes! its too extreme! you're our pretty little girl! We want to see your face!'

'No,' 'No what?', 'No, I won't take my hair out my face!' I raised my voice a tiny bit.

I also smoke beforehand if I'm going anywhere casually because I really don't like interacting with people so it helps.

My SIL is one of those people who hates smokers. She didn't know for a long time that I did so we actually developed an unbiased friendship. When she found out she was super judgmental but she did accept that I smoke so our relationship didn't take a massive hit. She does nag me from time to time about quitting.

SIL invited my hubby and I to a NYE party. Of course, I'm high. I'm chilling with hubby and a few other family members, mostly being quiet and listening.

My ex is very difficult to co-parents and unfortunately I only have my daughter every other weekend and one day a week. I used to coach her team because it gives me more time with her, but she is too talented to be coached by dad now. I am fighting like hell to change this (to get more time). My daughter (13f) has expressed to me that she is hurt that I spend more time with my two younger kids (6f, 8m) and my stepson (15m) more than her and I am doing my very best to let her know that she is not loved any less and if I had my way I would get to see her way more

My wife and I want to travel with the kids and my ex has made it very difficult and always refuses to allow my daughter to go. She needs permission from both parents to leave the state, so unfortunately there is nothing I can do at the moment. My wife thinks that the other three should not be held back because of my daughter (I can share more about my daughter's and wife's relationship if this info is necessary to make a judgment)

I agree that the others should not be held back and I don't want them to resent my daughter if we do not travel because of her. However, I am not comfortable going on these trips if she is not there. I gave my wife my blessing to travel with my stepson and two younger kids, but told her that I cannot join her because I do not want to hurt my daughter more. I told her we can travel in state as a family but until she is 18, I do not feel comfortable going to places without her

My wife is really angry with me and says she does not want to travel alone with the three kids and I am  being a bad husband/father for not going. I told her that I understand her feelings and that we can pay for her mother or someone else to go with them if she feels like it is overwhelming. We got into a really big fight and I ended up telling her that I am looking out for the well-being of all four kids but she is only looking out for her 3. She told me that I am an asshole for not going on the trip and accusing her of not loving my daughter (I did not accuse her of this I just said she is not thinking about my daughter's feelings in this instance)

I always just thought they were overly friendly with me but didn't really think much about it until recently.

Since moving in with my roommate her mom has taken on the role as my mother and will constantly criticize me for any and every choice I make. How I dress, how I eat, way I talk and dress. All that stuff. Which everytime I've let her know that she is not my mother and I can do what I want with my life. Worst one was when I accepted a manager position I've been working very hard towards and roommate's mom told me I was ""making her daughter look bad"" because she can't keep a job for more than a year.

I decided in November that for once was going to stay with my family and spend it with them. After I got off the plane in my hometown on chirstmas eve. I got an angry phone call from my roommate about how her family was expecting me to be there. When I told them back in November that I'd be out of town. She then told me that her family adopted me as their own, calling me their daughter and all that, when I didn't have much and that I OWED it to them to be there. We got in a huge argument about it. And I told her. ""I've told you and your mom that it makes me uncomfortable. Your family didn't adopt me as their own. I've only ever been criticized and belittled by them. It's weird to me that they think they deserve thanks for that."" The argument continued and once I got in my Uber I just hung up and turned off my phone until I came home after the holiday.

When I got home my roommate continued to argue about how I have taken advantage of her and her family. I told her ""I never wanted a new family and that they just imminently played the parent role and never listening to how it made me feel. I'm not part of your family. Yeah my family life isn't the best, but I'm not gonna have a family relationship forced on me.""

There was cat waste all over the apartment and you could smell their apartment before you got to their front door.Denise has a very crippling kind of depression and her gallbladder was having issues.She rarely could clean or could she work and since her gallbladder was not life threatening it couldn't be remove and was constantly in the ER. Dan would always miss work when she had to go to the ER. He did not get FMLA since they weren't married.

He was let go by this company and claimed unemployment and was making a living amount off of it but  decided not to pay rent. Luckily, he got a rental aid for the missed rent.For unemployment he was required to apply and interview for so many jobs a week.

When the eviction date was close he asked if he could stay with us. At first I said no. I changed my mind and my husband said ok to letting him stay for the sake of his elderly dog. We told him that he could stay rent free if he did some chores and said Denise couldn't stay nights. (We felt like if they wanted to stay together they would of worked out a way to stay together.) At first he was doing well with the chores and then started slipping. We had a talk with him about what we expected from the chores. Not long after his dog passed. We allowed Denise to stay the night his dog passed but we let them know this was an exception. A few months later we had the expectations talk again.

636,t3_rul82z,AITA for rebuking my SO's immature behavior?,"My girlfriend and I generally have a good, solid relationship, but there are a couple of things that we both know we need to work on. By her own admission, one of those things is channeling frustration when she's having difficulty with something. We're both the geeky, introverted type, so we spend a lot of time playing games together.

Today we went out for a walk to play Pokemon Go. We were walking along our ""Main Street"" and stopped to do a raid. We won, and as we were trying to catch it, she was getting increasingly frustrated (swearing under her breath, etc.). By the time I caught mine, she'd been getting louder (though not so loud that I would've expected anyone else to hear), until finally she threw her hands up and stomped her foot (she leaned back, brought her knee up to her chest, and slammed it down). Then she thrust her phone at me to catch it for her.

As I took it, I quietly said to her ""the stomping is a bit much"".  I caught it for her, but when I offered her phone back to her, she was just staring daggers at me with her hands jammed in her pockets.

""Are you going to take your phone back?""""No"".""Alright, I'm going to start walking home."" (It had started to rain, and we'd both agreed we'd head home after the raid).""Okay.""""Are you going to come with me?""""Yes.""

We walked a few blocks in silence, until she started talking through why she'd been frustrated in the first place (stuff about the game). I acknowledged everything she said as legitimate. Then I said ""I understand why you were frustrated, and I think it's totally valid. It was your reaction that I found concerning.""

Her response was ""I was actually feeling better after I stomped my foot, until you started dumping all the SHAME on me. It was that, or shouting, or start crying, and now I feel like I'm going to do both anyway and I'm STILL frustrated. So what would have been acceptable? Should I have just bottled it up inside and pretended it was nothing?""

With the explicit caveat that I know different people handle such feelings in different ways (there's no one solution that works for everyone), I said that if it had been me, I would've wanted to channel it in some way that didn't draw attention to myself or the fact that I was so frustrated. When I'm that upset, the last thing I want is people staring at me, wondering what my deal is, etc. I acknowledged that when it's me, I usually end up swearing a lot (but quietly), and I tend to disengage from whatever I was doing and try to count in my head for a bit. I told her that when I saw her stomp her foot like that, my first thought was ""she is quite literally acting like a child throwing a tantrum"", which was what prompted my statement to her at the start of this whole thing.

By that time, we'd reached home, and she said she just wanted to get away from me for awhile, so she took her phone back, got in the car, and drove off (this is the first time that has happened). Did I overreact? Should I have just let it go?",2.0

However as I said the 4-5 months has been getting worse and worse.  He won’t shower or brush his teeth or do his usual chores he has always done for his allowance.  He bullies his brother. Cusses at his dad and calls him names. He flips out any time his dad punishes him by taking devices away stating his mom never does it and we “aren’t teaching him anything just making him hate us more”.  Told us he wants to go back to his moms asap because she will give him his phone back (she pays for it).  He cussed his dad out several times, one time when he wouldn’t buy him vbucks?? And once because his dad made noise close to midnight on NYE and stepson was on the phone with his gf??

So my stepson tried sucking up to us for a few hours, then asked me to put netflix on his phone.  I told him to ask his dad, as his dad had expressed to me earlier he did not want me to reward him for bad behavior.  My SO told his son about how he isn’t happy with the cussing and disrespect, and that being nice for a few hours right before he wants something just makes it feel weird.  That he needs to be more respectful in general.  We then told him to please take his shower and brush his teeth and I would think about it.

He completely flipped out - screamed at me and his dad saying we “always want him to do something before we will give him things” and “thats not how it works”. Then told us he will not shower or brush his teeth.  I tried explaining to him that if he had a friend who was frequently rude or disrespectful to him would he want to be sharing his accounts with him? But now I feel like I wronged him somehow :( or maybe we need to be more like his mom and not expect him to “do things” for something basic like netflix?

638,t3_rul6l0,AITA for telling my parents I would not visit them again until they learned sign language?,"When I was 18 I was in an accident that caused TBI, resulting in me losing most of my hearing in both ears,  making me deaf. I didn't qualify for cochlear implants, so being deaf was just my new reality. 

Obviously this derailed my life for a while. University got pushed back, and I was depressed for a long time. Eventually I got back out there, discovered the deaf community, learned ASL (american sign language), and at 26 I now feel very content with my life. 

My parents were devastated by my accident, and our relationship has never been the same. A few years ago I told them I have embraced being deaf, and I asked them if they would learn ASL, as that is now how I prefer to communicate. They said no at the time because they didn't have time to learn a new language. I have tried many times over the years to try to give them information on deafness and ASL, but they have shown no interest. 

We communicate now mainly by using voice-to-text on our phones, which is far from perfect, and very chaotic when multiple people are talking. Trying to keep up with conversations is exhausting, and people are constantly getting frustrated with me for not following along. Often we watch movies, but they refuse to turn the captions on because it's ""annoying"", despite the fact that it means I can't understand the movie at all. 

This past Christmas, I once again struggled with conversations, which once again resulted in me being either ignored or yelled at. Before I went home again, I sat my parents down and told them that if they did not begin to learn ASL, I would not be visiting again for a long time. I told them I don't expect them to ever be fluent, but I need them to show effort in learning. I told them that they have continuously dismissed my needs as a deaf person, and that if they want to continue to have a meaningful relationship with me, we need to have some kind of shared language. 

This didn't go over well at all, as my parents accused me of wanting to cut them off, which isn't true. I just can't do any more visits where my presence feels like a burden. My brother and I have been texting since then, and he thinks I'm being hugely unfair. 

So AITA?

EDIT I can't respond to everyone, but thank you everyone so much for your kind words and support. I have been spending the last few days wondering if I'm being unreasonable or dramatic, as even though my friends (most of whom are deaf) support me, I didn't know what the hearing would would think of this. I can now see that my parents are clearly being unfair.",15938.0
639,t3_rul4nl,WIBTA if I told my family about my fiancée’s past career?,"I, 28M, am engaged to my fiancée 27F. We have been dating for 8 years, and engaged for 2, though our wedding is postponed due to COVID. I met her in college, and at the time, she was an exotic dancer, and she continued to be one until she finished her studies (at age 24). This has never bothered me but, a few years back, my brother 26M found out about it after seeing my fiancée at the club she worked at. Ever since, my brother has been holding this piece of information over my head, and uses it to blackmail me. My family is not very accepting of sex work, and a couple relatives have been disowned because they decided to pursue that line of work. They would most likely object to our marriage if they ever found out.

A few days ago, my brother came to me, asking for money (around 5 thousand bucks). He says he’s short on money and needs it to get through the month. His wife is a SAHM and they have 3 kids, and he recently lost his job, due to reasons I will not dive into. He claims he will pay me back, but I know he won’t, as he has pulled the same stunt in the past. He can barely hold a job, and always asks me for help, yet treats me like shit after i give him the money and he never pays me back (like he says he will). So, this time I put my foot down. And he didn’t like it. He screamed at me, calling me a selfish bastard, before threatening to tell the *whole* family that my fiancée used to be an exotic dancer.

So, I was thinking, why don’t I already tell my family, get it over with, best him to it? I have discussed telling my family, in the past, with my fiancée, but she wasn’t comfortable with me telling. However, I am sick of being blackmailed by my brother and I’m sure my fiancée would understand. WIBTA if i told my family that my fiancée used to be an exotic dancer?

640,t3_rul1tv,AITA for not being happy when my friend told me I was an asshole for not quitting my job.,"Like most of us, 2020 was a shit show.  I quickly found out that my boss hired her friends, like to be surrounded by yes men, and had a very questionable professional history (*cough* selling fraudulent bonds).  Basically she made my life hell, but my saving grace was knowing I was going on a deployment (I’m a military Reservist).  I was talking to my best friend about everything going on and she seemed surprised I wasn’t just quitting my job before I left.  A lot can happen in 6 months, plus I had promised my husband I wouldn’t quit until I had another job lined up.

Of note, my boss doesn’t even say goodbye to me or good luck on my last day.  I hear from none of my employees or anyone else while I was gone.  January I get a threatening email from HR demanding to know if I was looking for a new job.  I told them I had no plans to leave at this time; they didn’t like that answer and sent me a follow up, clearly written by a lawyer.  I got JAG involved, and sent them a nice worded email basically telling them to back off.  Once I got back in the country, I quickly lined up other employment and told the other company where they could stick it.

I’m very hard on myself and didn’t understand how I went from being the shiny penny to being shit on the bottom of my boss’s shoe.  I talked a lot to my “best friend” about my situation, considering she had been in a similar situation.  I also listened to how she hated her new job, though she had only been there for a few months.

One day she texted me and asked if she could be honest with me.  She then proceeded to tell me I was just as shitty as the job for not quitting before I went on the deployment, even though I had “no intention on returning.”  My boss was basically trying to get me to quit before I left so she could fill my position with someone less qualified (which she ended up doing anyway).  I said I was 1) not 100% decided 2) I had made a promise to my husband (which she told me I would have been able to find a job while I was home on leave…maybe?) and 3) legally my job was protected under federal law for being a reservist.  I expressed to her how hurt I was about how unsupportive she was.

Later in the day she texts me about something unrelated, like nothing had happened.  I don’t answer back right away, being upset.  She then texts me, tells me how dare I ghost her, she doesn’t need “shitty friends like me.”  I try to answer back, explain I was still upset.  Nothing.  So Reddit, AITA?

641,t3_rukzi4,AITA for not cooking anything?,"For some context I am currently a little over 8 months pregnant and have began the stage of needing help to get up from the couch or even put on my pants. My husband has been home for the past week and will be home for at least another week. I usually do all the cooking, cleaning and general housework. 

Now recently my hips have been jello and I've been struggling to stand for much too long so I'll cook and then clean up an hour later. I cook for both my husband and I always and I've been getting so tired. Three prepped meals with at least 2 including a meat source gets a little much to keep making. 

Yesterday my husband asked again as he does every day ""What are you making for lunch?"" Now I was tired and had just finished cleaning the bathrooms and replied ""I'll cook when you wash the dishes."" Since then I haven't cooked. I've scavenged the fridge for my own meals (hard boiled eggs in the fridge, hot dogs, hashbrowns, waffles, etc) or just washed what I was using. I've offered him some nibbles of my food here and there but he is now complaining that he's starving. 

We've been married for over a year and he's washed dishes ONCE the whole time. He doesn't clean and only ever takes out the trash once a week or so and checks the mail. He insists because he is the working one in the relationship he shouldn't clean or cook. I've been on trips alone and came home to a weeks worth of dishes because he just doesn't clean. He assumes that picking up the trash around the living room counts as ""cleaning"". So I feel justified in this standstill of not cooking. 

He has now been calling me a ""bitch"" and telling me he's the working one so I should do the bare minimum of cooking for him. 

So am I the asshole for not cooking?",1817.0
642,t3_rukwnx,AITA for not letting my wife take our daughter hiking?,"I’ll try and keep this relevant and to the point;

My wife has been hiking and caving since she was 16, we’re both in our 30s now so as you can imagine she’s an experienced hiker (although she won’t be conquering Mount Everest)


Early on in our relationship she told me it was essential that basically we had the same interests; camping, hiking, caving etc and at that time I was like “yeah I can suck this up” but truthfully I hated every moment of it.

We actually live right near mountains, my daughter doesn’t have any extra interest in the outdoors, she's actually afraid of heights and bugs - although she does get upset whenever my wife goes camping for the weekend with the dog but not her (not every weekend + sometimes she goes for a week or two doing whatever) 

When she got pregnant with our daughter I used it as an out to all the camping and hiking, when our daughter was born I stayed home during her hikes etc. Now our daughter is 7 my wife has shown interest in bringing her hiking, she planned a whole weekend where they’d camp out there.

I refused because I’m just not sure my daughter is  ready for that, I’m not ready for her to be out there either and I’m just overwhelmed with anxiety - I said to leave it till she was 10 at least! But my wife got all pouty saying I was “ruining what could  their bonding activity” and then went for a hike around this morning and only got home this evening and is in bed.

I spoke to my friend who thinks I’m being an asshole bc my wife has experience etc, but I’m allowed to say no to something if I don’t feel comfortable especially because while yes, our daughter wants to go hiking the realist in me goes she’s afraid of bugs and heights!

643,t3_rukuo3,AITA for telling a bride her wedding dress was average at best?,"I would like to say I'm not a fashionista. I'm not someone who would typically even think this but she was acting ridiculous.

My husband's grandfather is getting married for the fourth time to someone 10 years younger than MIL. I will call her ""Amanda"" Amanda is pretty awful and always thinks everyone is jealous of her. Recently FIL and Amanda had us over for dinner and she showed MIL, SIL, and I her wedding gown. It is fine but pretty trendy and something I've seen a lot before. I told her it was lovely and we moved on.

Later in the evening she got mad because MIL started walking away to go to the bathroom without asking permission. GFIL told Amanda that she was being weird and MIL doesn't have to announce it and ask permission. Amanda decided that MIL was trying to steal or tamper with the dress and said she would escort her.

It was so bizarre. She was right at the door yelling at MIL that she can't hear her peeing, hurry up. MIL was telling her to leave. FIL joined and was laughing hysterically. MIL screamed that Amanda was a dumb bitch and Amanda told MIL to stop peeing and said maybe she has diabetes from those cookies she was eating (MIL is not overweight but has a history of an eating disorder, and she had been eating cookies) FIL snapped at Amanda to shut her damn mouth. Then Amanda said ""flush bitch, we don't have time for this and i'm not taking chances that you are planning something in there""

I finally had enough and snapped at Amanda that no one wants her dress. It is average at best and looks like it came from the surplus rack at David's Bridal. MIL's dress was better, mine was better, and why would we steal that?

644,t3_rukul0,AITA for talking about my weight loss to my overweight friend?,"Throwaway because I’m pretty sure they use Reddit. 

I (26M) recently lost some weight. I was never exactly OVERweight, I’ll admit that. My BMI was on the high side of normal (23.4) but a few months back I decided that I’d rather be right in the middle. I realize the BMI isn’t a perfect measuring tool, and that I didn’t NEED to lose weight. But I WANTED to. I didn’t like the idea of being even a little chubby so I decided to set a 15 pound weight loss goal this past august.

And I DID IT. Reddit, I have never worked out or dieted in my life. I honestly did not expect to lose anything at all because I have no clue what I’m doing, but jogging and cutting back on booze did the trick for me. I weighed myself just before New Years and I had HIT my goal weight and I know it wasn’t much but I was proud goddamn it. 

So I called someone I thought was a good friend (26F, we’ll call her P) about this and uh, the conversation did not go well. P is overweight, possibly obese, but we’ve been friends for so long I honestly don’t even think about it. I honestly just wanted to share my joy but right away I knew this was a mistake. The conversation went something like this:

Her: “Why are you telling me this?”

Me: “uh idk. Because I accomplished something I set out to do and I’m proud.”

Her: “great. You moved your body a bunch ate like a rabbit, who gives a fuck?”

She then hung up so I texted her a question mark (because I was honestly just confused) and she responded with a text that was like “miss me with your fatphobic nonsense please”

I was even move confused because I don’t even think I have even MENTIONED fatness once in our entire friendship. I literally just had a fitness goal and reached it and was happy. I told her as such and P responded :

“The fact that your skinny ass even thought that you had to lose weight is the definition of fatphobia. The fact that you think it’s acceptable to come to me, a fat person, with this shit and low key shaming me is just gross. There is nothing wrong with my body and there was nothing wrong with your body, except for the brain part. Now leave me alone.”

I responded with an apology and that I meant no offense but she’s ignoring me now. I asked some friends about it and they were mostly on my side but a few people i trust said that I was a dick for bringing up weight loss to an overweight person.  

I honestly did not mean to offend her and really have no problem with fat people! I mean I was aware that P is overweight, but i never really thought about that—she’s just P, you know?

645,t3_ruksix,"AITA for wanting privacy and not embracing my ""white"" side?","To start, I'm biracial &amp; bisexual, 16M. Mom is white; dad is Latino. I look relatively Latino &amp; I'm racially Indigenous. Most people in Latino stores assume I speak Spanish. My last name is of Spanish origin. I don't think my mother meant to have me; she became pregnant unmarried at 18.

My parents claim to not be homophobic, but I hear them talk bad about the LGBTQ+ community. My mom &amp; her family claim to not be racist, but they've said racial slurs, stereotyped POC, called me &amp; dad ""crazy Guatemalans"" when they got mad, &amp; more.

One day, my mother asks for my phone. I give it to her. She says she's checking it to make sure I'm behaving. I obliged. After a year of this (I was in 6th grade when this started) she began to go through my photos, search history, DMs, apps, etc. My cousin told me she was doing all of this to find out if I was gay. My cousin said she stalked my social media &amp; asked her &amp; family members if they knew my sexuality. (I'm currently closeted, but after I found this out &amp; she tried to force me to come out, I never felt safe around her. Legally speaking, she has a right to do this, but it mentally scarred me.)

Thus I became less affectionate with her. I feel like teenage guys aren't that affectionate anyway. I don't feel like I'd be safe if I came out, so I never did. I think I have a right to come out when I’m ready, yet my mom won’t respect this.

I started to embrace my Guatemalan side mid 2020. Everyone saw me as Latino anyway, but I embraced my culture &amp; Spanish. It's been a difficult road identifying as Indigenous Guatemalan, but I'm proud of myself. I always saw myself as a percent of how ""native"" or ""Guatemalan"" I act. I realized how I ethnically identify is my choice---nobody else's.

It starts when I told my mother about an old friend who ghosted me. He didn’t like me embracing my Latino side. I told her I can’t associate with racists or people who supported my oppressors. She got mad at me, saying, ""That's discrimination. You can't group people together &amp; say you'll never befriend them. What if that was your boss?” I told her that not wanting to associate with racists &amp; oppressors is not discriminatory. She, a white person, has no business telling me what's discrimination &amp; what isn't.

She said I’m crazy &amp; that it was all in my head that my white family is racist. She ended the convo with ""I'm not religious, but every religion says you need to love thy neighbor. Stop being so hateful. Love your neighbor. You're just as bad as the racists. What if I said I wouldn’t befriend gays?""

She said I need to be proud of my white side. I started identifying as Guatemalan-American/Latino/Indigenous. Ever since, she's been calling me an asshole for tiny mistakes, saying I'm hurting her, etc.

I feel like my lack of affection &amp; not identifying as white is valid. But I'm not sure because she's very manipulative at times. AITA for wanting privacy &amp; not embracing my ""white"" side, even if I don't ethnically identify as such?",20.0

The younger two are still in grade school while the older one just started college. My father (m49) found out about and started working at a nightly bingo my old high school about a year or two ago (after I had graduated high school). Working at the bingo nights earns credits towards a child’s tuition and builds up over time.

I (22f) and my husband (24m) got married in April of 2021. When we got married, we had discussed with multiple parties that we planned on having our ceremony in October/November after I had our baby. Things have been pretty wild over the last year, including moving cross country, going through the courts to fight for custody of my step-daughter, having a baby, getting custody of SD, buying a house, then a second one, moving again, and taking two cross country trips to visit family. 

My mother is not in good health, and keeps asking what plans we've made for our wedding ceremony. I have no answers for her, because every time I bring it up to my husband I get the answers: ""I don't know"", ""let's talk about it later"", or ""we can't afford it right now"". So it just gets put on hold. My mom asked again today, and after asking him repeatedly to help with planning over the last few months he blew up at me. ""You're never satisfied, even when one big thing is done you're still upset the next big thing isn't done!"" He told me we would have to wait roughly two years before a ceremony can be had, since we hadn't even STARTED planning. Also mentioning I would most likely have to choose between a wedding and a honeymoon, which really doesn't even seem fair. 

I understand things have been rough and we've barely made it through this last year. In no way are we financially capable of hosting a wedding ceremony *right now*. I was hoping to maybe have our wedding this year, around the same time we had originally planned if he would work with me. I want a small wedding, with only a few friends and family, nothing fancy or spectacular.. Normally, the family of the bride would pay for it but we've had some pretty big disagreements with my family over the last few years and have assumed that we will just be paying for it ourselves. All I wanted was to start, since it usually takes about a year to plan a wedding. 

My biggest issue and the main reason I'm upset, is that if we wait another two years, we will have been married for over 3 years before having a ceremony. I've accepted that we won't have a ceremony before our 1 year anniversary, which is fine. But 3+ years? That just seems like too long to be waiting.

649,t3_rukhmf,WIBTA for telling my BFs disabled friend he is disgusting?,"OK, so please hear me out. 

My BF and I held a little New Year gathering for some friends on NYE. His friend, Jeff who is 43 asked to come. I'm not that keen on Jeff. He sang a song about me being fat at a wedding a few years ago, and I was mortified. (I have an ED and have always struggled with my weight). 

Anyway, in the past couple of years, Jeff lost both his legs due to him not taking care of his diabetes. So he moved into a nursing home with his elderly mom who has since passed away. 

I agreed to pick Jeff up from the home, helped him with his wheelchair and we said he could stay over at our house on NYE. I told him later that if he needed the toilet to let me know and I would help him. 

In front of people, he got creepy and started making jokes, asking if I was gonna ""hold it"" for him and stuff. It made me so uncomfortable and feel a little violated since I was only trying to make sure he was being taken care of. 

He's known my BF for years, so I assumed he would let one of us know if he needed to go. I bet you can guess where this is headed...

I woke up on Jan 1st to find Jeff asleep on an armchair in the dining room. The room was smelly but he was pretty drunk so I assumed he was just smelly because of that. I asked if he was OK and he told me he just wanted to sleep. So I left him. 

Later in the afternoon my BF made him tea. I was hungover AF and the smell of him was making me wanna vom, so I stayed in the kitchen with the back door open. My BF asked Jeff if he was ready to go home, and Jeff said he was still drinking his tea so it was another half hour before he got ready to go. As my BF was away getting his shoes on, Jeff said ""OP, I'm sorry but I think I might have had a little accident."" He made it sound like it was minor and I assumed he had just peed himself. I told him not to worry about it. He then asked for a hug but given him being creepy and smelly I declined. 

It was only after they left and I was wiping the chair with disinfectant that I realised he had literally shat himself. Instead of calling on us for help to go to the toilet, he shat himself and then sat in it for hours afterwards. It was caked into the leather, it took ages to clean it properly and we're gonna need to get a professional in because I can still smell it no matter what we do.

I'm appalled at him and so insulted that he thought that was OK even after the offer of help anytime he needed to go to the toilet. I think I might be TA because he IS disabled and maybe he was embarrassed to ask for help to go. But on the other hand we invited him into our home and both told him to ask if he needed help to get upstairs to the toilet. He chose instead to shit in our chair and then deliberately sat in it drinking tea like nothing happened.

I (28F) have a boyfriend (25M) that we will call BF and a best friend (31M) that we will call BFF.

So, I am into making audiobook. And I like it to be as lively as possible so what I usually do is that I record the narrator's voice, and the female voices myself, and ask some male friends to do the male voices. I then add music and sound effects, it is a hobby of mine.

Last month, I decided that I wanted to offer an audio-fairytale as a birth gift for a friend, in which there are only male characters.

So, I asked BF to help me with the male voices, he came over and we started recording. He is not the best actor + it was his first time, so it took us the whole evening, and I was being quite directive. But he was super cute and willing to help, we overall had a great time and a great laugh.

BFF is used to making that kind of projects with me, I asked him to make some other voices but he ended up sending me all the male characters so I can pick and chose what role I want for him.

BFF is way better an actor than BF. So I am considering chosing BFFs version over BFs for the main character...

I am currently making the final voice soundtrack and BF is supposed to help me next week with the music soundtrack. I am afraid that he would be upset that I pick BFF over him, and that I basically throw away something he put efforts in...

Kate likes to take Ann for ""mother-daughter"" experiences and has taken several important ones I wanted to take Ann for: ear piercing when Ann was 14, prom dress when she was 17, graduation dress to wear under her gown when she was 22.

I never brought it up with Ann because I didn't want her to feel bad, but after the earrings, I told Kate I was upset because I wanted to take Ann for it. I even told Ann I wanted to take her to shop for her prom gown and later her graduation gown, but both times, Kate took her anyway, and Ann told me that Kate said that I said it was okay. Both times I talked to Kate and asked her not to do it again but didn't press the issue to avoid fighting.

At Christmas, Ann and her boyfriend Jesse (30M) announced their engagement. Everyone congratulated them, but I pulled Ann aside and made her promise that no matter what, she would include me in her dress shopping and offered to pay up to $5k for her dress--I even told her I would take a personal day at work to shop with her because it was that important to me. I also pulled Kate and Jeff aside and informed them that I planned to take Ann dress shopping.

On the 28th, Ann called me to tell me that Kate had taken her to a bridal shop to look at gowns, and when Ann asked about me, Kate told her that I had said it was okay.

I'm not proud of myself because I blew up and started to cry. I said that no, it wasn't okay, that Kate was lying, and she had lied to Ann when she took her for her graduation and prom dresses and for her ear piercing because I was going to take her and Kate stole those experiences from me, and I wasn't going to let her take this one, too.

Ann was silent while I collected myself, and I apologized and assured Ann I was not mad at her and was grateful that she called. Ann wanted to know was why I hadn't told her, and I said it was because I didn't want to cause a problem because she liked Kate.

Ann told me she liked Kate, but that I was her mom and she loved me, and she promised she wouldn't shop for a dress without me.

We hung up on good terms and I thought that was it.

My ex called several hours later to scream at me that I had ""turned Ann against Kate"". What I managed to piece together from his ranting was that Ann disinvited Kate from the wedding.

I told my ex I would talk to Ann. Ann told me that she told Kate she was going to wait until she could shop with me and her friends. Kate argued and Ann told her about our conversation, who them blamed it on Jeff as ""his idea"" for bonding time between Kate and Ann, which Ann didn't believe.

I called my ex back and told him about both conversations I'd had with Ann, and Jeff denied it and told me Kate had also told him that I said those things were okay, too. So now neither Ann nor Jeff is speaking to Kate.",1619.0
653,t3_ruk8hq,AITA for talking to the guy my best friend likes?,"Context. Jane (21F) and I (20F) been friends for over 3 years now,  I consider her one of my best friends. We have the same type when it comes to guys. 

We started liking the same guy, of our classmates, but we neither of us really knew him that much. She matched with him on Tinder but I didn't know because I was on a... let's say retirement, for about 4 weeks. They talked a lot while I was gone and she really started to like him. I was a bit jealous at first because I was attracted to him, but she seemed very happy, so I couldn't do anything besides being supportive. A couple of weeks ago, she told me they had stopped texting every day. I didn't think much of it. 

And then he started texting me. We had been talking for about a month when Jane found out. We were hanging out and I got a text from him. She saw it and got really quiet, she even left early. Later, she told my other friend that she knew we had been texting the whole night. I told her that the conversations were meaningless -they are- and that I would stop if she wanted me to. Jane said she couldn't force me to stop talking to him, but that she would appreciate it since she still likes him a \*lot\*. I said that I would stop, but I haven't. We still talk to this day but what I said it's true, the conversations are not romantic in any way, I think. I genuinely like him as a friend, but I still feel guilty about it because I'm starting to like him too.

654,t3_ruk8c4,AITA for telling my brother that his gift to my wife &amp; I was a “selfish gift”?,"The argument happened over text. R=Rob, M=Matt. 

Rob: Did you &amp; Jen get my gift yet?
Matt: We got something, but we don’t know who it’s from. Did you send this? (picture sent via text of a metal trough/bucket - intended to hold ice &amp; drinks, or dirt &amp; plants).
Rob: Yep
Matt: Ha, yup. We got it. Just didn’t know who it was from. Thanks! What’s it for? Beers? Plants?
Rob: for beer, water, soft drinks. Ice it up.
Matt: Awesome! We’ll definitely get a lot of use out of if for the (swimming) pool
Rob: Your basement refrigerator has a minimum of 38 degrees at the lowest I think
Matt: SMH (shake my head)
Rob: Plus ice up beers &amp; liquor while shooting billiards, darts &amp; movies
Matt: So it’s a selfish gift lolHahahah
Rob: &amp; the pool

My (Matt’s) Notes:

Rob stays in my basement when he visits. We watch movies, play darts, billiards. I believe he was thinking of himself when buying this gift bc he mentioned the fridge temp. 

Rob said he wont visit anymore &amp; I should apologize for calling it ‘a selfish gift.’ I told him I was appreciative, but I wouldn’t apologize ... that “I didn’t care if it was selfish &amp; thought it was a funny.”

If anyone should be upset, it should be me. I believe his temp comment proves he has a problem w/ my fridge, thus the gift.

Rob says a text he sent a week before proves the gift was not meant for him, but for my parties &amp; get togethers. Here is that text:

Rob: “Hey Matt just to let you know I got you &amp; Jen a gift. It’s an ideal must have for the basement - wine beer &amp; champagne , etc.
Matt: Ok, thanks
R : Or anywhere in the house &amp; out back on the patio or at the (swimming) pool.

I want this AITA to be 100% fair, so I invited Rob to provide his side.

Rob’s Notes:

I usually visit Matt about 2 to 3 times a year averaging 2 weeks.

This is one of an ongoing series of conflicts between us. Our conflict escalated a bit more after this one.

When I sent follow up texts (after he confirmed he got the gift) I had assumed Matt remembered our 12/20 texts where I mentioned this gift. It’s funny how each person’s memory is selective, they remember things but not others, it’s human nature.

Initially Matt didn’t say ‘a little bit selfish’, he said outright that it was ‘selfish’. It wasn’t until later in the argument when Matt finally admitted it was maybe “a little bit selfish”. His statement where he mentioned ‘a little bit…’ was in the ballpark. Probably just about right.

The thinking behind my having said “I don’t want to visit anymore” had to do w/ my gift being ‘selfish’... I was like “Why would I want to visit? Is it so whenever I visited I could use the ‘selfish’ gifts that I got for them? I don’t think so.” &amp; secondly, when you buy gifts for someone w/ out asking what they would like for a gift then aren’t you being somewhat selfish or similar?

While searching online for an ideal gift for Matt &amp; Jen, it took me a while bc they pretty much have everything that they need.",0.0

656,t3_ruk87p,AITA for accusing my boyfriend of gaslighting me?,"This has been nagging at me for awhile. About a year ago (right before Halloween 2020) I (37M) broke up with my then-bf ""Jake"" (42M) after eight months. We had met online and he said in his profile he was non-monogamous. During our first chat I asked him what non-monogamy meant for him. I told him I'm all for an open relationship but I draw the line at polyamory because I personally find it exhausting. Jake said he was in full agreement and that his last poly relationship had been a disaster. His answer satisfied me and I agreed to go out with him.

Eight months later, we had been happy together, or so I thought, even discussing our long-term plans and if we were ready to start living together. One day while hanging out at his place, Jake said he wanted to give polyamory a try. I reiterated my stance: friends with benefits are okay but not multiple romantic partners. He said he *wants* to romantically pursue others. I told him that wasn't what I signed up for, he got angry and said he had made his stance clear from the start. I said no he didn't and reminded him we talked about this. He said he had always been clear, so I went and got my laptop. I had saved our first chat for sentimental reasons (we chatted for hours that night and basically fell in love on the spot), never thinking it would become Exhibit A in an argument. I showed him how I had made my boundaries clear from the start, and that he said he agreed with me. Then I told him that frankly I didn't appreciate being gaslighted. He was pissed that I used that word with him and accused me of ""archiving"" our chats as dirt to dig up against him; the argument got heated and he ultimately broke up with me and threw me out of his house. I had to call an Uber home from a nearby CVS

We haven't spoken since (he immediately blocked me on Facebook and my number), and I'm mixed on how I feel. On one had it was traumatizing to go from being boyfriends to suddenly becoming exes that hated each other, but on the other hand, in retrospect our values and goals differed in more ways than we anticipated and the polyamory issue was most likely just the straw that broke his back. I keep replaying the event in my head wondering what I could have said or done differently and how we could have at least parted as friends. AITA?",3.0
657,t3_ruk6x6,AITA for yelling at vet staff for laughing at my dog while she was in serious pain?,"I am from DFW and I'm currently in El Paso for work. This morning I noticed my 6 month old female puppy began showing signs of a UTI. As a former vet tech I know veterinary medicine pretty well. We came in expecting a urine sample to be taken to confirm the UTI and to be given some antibiotics. Instead, the vet decided that my 6 month old puppy was ""too young"" for a urinalysis and was going to treat her purely based off of her symptoms. She was taken to the back to be seen by the Dr. rather than the Dr. coming into the exam room to evaluate and treat her. This made me uncomfortable as a pet parent. My usual vet back at home has always allowed me to be present and in the room during exams. (side note, I was wearing a mask and have been fully vaccinated). She was given some antibiotics and some Carprofen for pain. They also gave her a penicillin shot in between the shoulder blades. Penicillin does normally sting a little bit when it is first injected however, my dog was SCREAMING, I mean writhing in pain all the way out to the car. The crying went on for well over 5 minutes. She was in so much pain she proceeded to try and bite my significant other as he slowly removed her harness once she was back in my vehicle. This behavior is absolutely not like her at all. When I walked back into the clinic concerned as this is NOT a normal reaction to a penicillin shot, the staff laughed at the fact that my dog could be heard crying out and whining from my vehicle. That's when I lost it and began yelling. I said something along the lines of ""This isn't fucking funny. My dog is in a lot of pain. What time hell did you do, what injection was she given and where?"" The staff was pretty taken back by my reaction, which made me feel like an asshole. However, at the same time to laugh at an animal that is so clearly in pain is absolutely disgusting to me and really struck a nerve. Maybe I shouldn't have yelled, in hindsight I feel like I may have been the asshole. On the other hand, my animals are my children and I was appalled by the staffs behavior. There ya have it folks, I need to know. Am I the asshole?

EDIT #1: For context, I know for certain they were laughing at my dog. They specifically asked me ""is that your dog crying?"" While laughing and saying things like ""what a baby"" and ""that's ridiculous, she's so loud"".

658,t3_ruk3sc,AITA for not respecting my housemate’s demands and doing laundry at night?,"My bf(23) and I(21) have been living together in a house share since mid last year. The other 4 rooms are filled with 4 old men. We have spent the last 3 weeks arguing with one of them (D). A rota was agreed upon for the laundry &amp; my bf and I were allocated Sun&amp;Mon which worked for a little while but we found ourselves busy all day &amp; would start our washing 5pm but made sure it finished before late. D had a conversation with my bf about the pipes being loud in his room at night. My bf apologised &amp; agreed that wash machine finished before 10pm. The point is that he didn’t have this conversation with me so I did not know.

Next night, I got blood on bedsheets and I panicked &amp; went to quickly wash them. This was around 11pm &amp; my bf was playing D&amp;D so it was just me. I went to take the sheets to the wash but found another tenant, W, already doing his load. I waited until midnight &amp; bf did not realise i did this until it was in dryer. Next morning D is very loudly cursing and cussing at my bf because of the time laundry was done. My bf was very respectful, calm &amp; apologetic &amp; tried to defuse the situation because D was so, so angry &amp; aggressive. He tried telling D the reason why I did it but he said he ‘didn’t give a f*ck, theres no reason to do washing so late’ despite W, the tenant D respects the most, washing past 11pm. When I told him this he just shook his head &amp; denied what i was saying. It seemed we were the only ones receiving this abuse. 

It was settled &amp; once again was agreed 10pm, with me now in the loop &amp; willing respect this despite the rudeness. But the second argument was a week later when my bf was washing @ 8:30pm &amp; D stormed in shouting ‘you better not be putting that wash machine on’ which was insane because the cycle to wash and dry would be complete before 10pm. Suddenly the time we were ‘allowed’ to use both the washing machine &amp; dryer was 9pm &amp; my bf received more abuse from D that night, ordering him on what to do and when. 

We would actively avoid going out of our room if we didn’t need to &amp; we would spend longer being out of the house. One time we were leaving the house, he was outside cleaning his pellet guns &amp; proceeded to make more aggressive &amp; argumentative comments at us whilst getting into our car. He also caught up to us the day after boxing day as we were washing dishes to send us more abuse.

After that, I sent him a respectful text telling him we feel harassed &amp; to leave us alone. Since then when we leave the house &amp; he out there with a gun on him in a way to intimidate us. We feel so uncomfortable we are tossing up moving out.

I would like to know from some outside perspective if we are the AH. I know we may seem like it for the first incident at midnight but I was unaware, &amp; the second I found out we apologised and respected his demand to finish washing &amp; drying by 10pm on our allocated days.

660,t3_ruk1o5,"AITA for not going along with my husband's family's way of ""ragging on each other""","My(24f) husband(25m) and I have been together since we were 16, and throughout this time I've always known his side of the family to be rather ""brutal"" with each other. They like to call it tough love, but I've always been uncomfortable with it, and my husband doesn't appreciate it most of the time either.

It basically goes like this where the older family members(Parents, Grandparents, Aunts, and Uncles) will ""rag"" on the kids. Regular boomer stuff I guess, but the always manage to make it personal. My husband has always asked me to try and put up with it since they never go after me, and usually only go after him, his siblings, and cousins, and so far I've always managed to hold my tongue. We only see them 2-3 times out of the year so I just have to remind myself it's temporary.

This year(past year now) however, I couldn't go bear to along with it like I normally do. My husband has been studying to go to law school. He was meant to apply to go this past fall, but he only scored a 158 on his LSAT in January(this is not a score to be ashamed of, but it wasn't where he wanted to be.) We made the very hard decision to wait another year so he could continue to study and take it again. He had only planned to take a year off between graduating with his BA, and I also had a fantastic job opportunity lined up but I turned it down so he could take the test again. This is what I wanted to do for him, and I wasn't pressured at all.

He worked his but off and in late October of this year he took the test again. In November he got his score back and he had scored a 177. For those of you who aren't familiar with how the scoring works(I wasn't either until he started studying) it is a great score, better than great, it was like a win the lottery score. I cried openly at work when he told me I was so happy.

So, it was a huge accomplishment for his, and when we went to Christmas this yet I figured his family might try to say something about it, but I hoped they wouldn't. They did, of course. As soon as we arrived they congratulated him, but then started to talk about him taking another year and it being his second try and I could visibly see it made my husband upset, but I could also tell he was trying to brush it off. Again, it's all in ""good fun.""

I didn't say anything, because I knew my husband wouldn't have wanted me to, but when one of his uncles turned to me and tried to make a joke about him being ""two-timer"" and made some sexual innuendo about how he has to try again in the bedroom(hard to explain, but either way it was disgusting). I didn't say anything to him, and instead just gave him and the others a completely blank stare. One of the other uncles tried to joke around with me again, and I again gave him a blank stare. It really dampened their mood, and for the rest of the time they didn't joke about my husbands score for the rest of the time.

After we left my husband wasn't upset with me, but his family were. They said I was being a ""debbie downer"" and ""overly sensitive"" and ruined the mood.",118.0

~7 months ago, a friend of mine (34f) left an abusive relationship and indicated that she didn’t know what to do next. She was living with another ex in the meantime. Since I lived alone and I’m pretty low maintenance, I invited her and her kids to live with me rent-free while she got back on track. According to her, that meant losing ~45lbs and reenlisting in the army. Obviously, this is definitely not an easy goal with two kids and probably depression/ptsd. However, 45lbs was all that stood between her and her independence and her supporting her kids me getting back to my low maintenance, sleeping nekkid on my couch, bachelorette lifestyle. 

This was 7ish months ago. I have urged her to see a therapist (free with the VA), hired a personal trainer for her (she agreed, then blew the trainer off), got her a membership at a gym with daycare (she does not go.) She recently panicked that she was running out of money and that she didn’t know what to do … And then just a few days later, was bragging about a ~ $50 purse she’d just bought. She gets va disability but not much and she works “to get out of the house.” I finally asked her what was going on with her plans to reenlist and she admitted she wasn’t planning on joining the military for a few years, if at all. 

I was floored. I told her the oldest could finish this school year but that they’d need to find their own place by summer. I also confronted her about the purse specifically because of what she said about her finances. She minimized the purchase and said she just wanted something nice for herself. For reference she’s also bought furniture (I’ve owned my home for like 9 years, it’s furnished) because she wanted a sitting area in her room and a deep freezer which is currently loudly sitting in my living room.

I ended up changing courses/university and he stayed and finished his. He supported my decision completely, even if I was trading to an area that is not valued at all in Brazil (I was studying neuroscience/biology and now visual arts, quite a change I know). I went back home and he stayed. After college he went back home too.

We've been living together since october 2020 (at his parents house) and alone since july 2021. 

I am currently unemployed. He is currently working and studying for his master's and I am just studying and taking care of our house/dog. Nowadays I make enough money monthly only to pay our bills and my personal expenses with freelance work. He pays the rent (3x what I spend with bills on average), dog expenses (food and vaccines) and he receives a very good groceries ticket. This was previously accorded, he even wanted to pay everything, he receives a good salary and it is not a financial problem for him being the provider, just the psychological aspect that is bothering me.

He is studying his master's at that college that we met and we have discussed in these past months that we could move to that city to be near his college and the friends we still maintain from that time. But nothing concrete. 
We're currently living in a nice house, near both of our families, but kind of small and we're having some problems with space, neighbours and our dog. We've also already discussed moving out and even looked at houses to rent in the city we currently live in and the college city. To move out from here there is a fine (3 rents) and our contract ends on December 2023.

We've spent new year's with our friends from that city (separated places) and mine asked why won't we move now that my college is over and he is studying there again. I explained this and a part of the group said that it would AH to bring the subject again because the expenses would be on his pocket and some said that it would be okay.

I'm very sensitive about the money subject because I barely make enough to handle my own expenses but he supports me and doesn't make any pressure for me to get a work right now. He is very supportive in many ways and I kind of know that if I bring the subject again he will be tempted because he know that it would make me happy.

666,t3_rujicl,AITA for telling my friend she's doing too much?,"&amp;#x200B;

I(17F) have been attending extra classes every weekend to prepare for a competitive exam. For the majority of the past 2 years, we had online classes and it's only in the last 6 months they provided the option of offline classes. It’s there I met Noah (M) and Paige (F). As we 3 seemed to be the only regulars, being the same age and the general torture of high school made us fast friends. We went to the movies and had lunch/dinner often after class.

Due to midterms, we had a month-long break and hence were wildly unprepared for our surprise test(online). Halfway through the test, when I gave up I texted the group chat about how difficult it was. Noah said the same and that he had asked Paige to send him answers. She generally scores the highest amongst us.

Isn’t surprising, since they’re closer. They're in the same school in different classes and became friends. They chat, call more often and do study sessions together (which I got to know from social media, not that they invited me, which admittedly, stung) Recently between classes, they talk about school and mutual teachers, friends etc. so I occupy myself with my phone.

Paige asked if I wanted the answers as well, to which I said sure, why not. Noah kept pestering her for answers, and Paige said she’d send once she'd finished.

N:Bro can you send quick

A few minutes later, she sent her answers with around 90 pictures. Honestly it was so nice of her but had me surprised, considering she had an hour left of 3 hours and hadn’t done lengthier sections.

667,t3_rujoom,AITA for walking out on my parents?,"I (24f) went over to my parents’ place for dinner today to wish them a Happy New Year. I went in the late afternoon, so we also had dinner together. We just talked a bit and I don’t know how but for some reason we ended up talking about a comment that my dad made about one of my friends.

The comment was made about her ass quite some time ago. It happened after graduation and he said something along the lines of her having a big ass in the dress she wore at the ceremony. I have never supported this comment at all (English isn’t my first language, sorry) and have actually told him a few times already comments like this make me uncomfortable. We went back and forth a little and I said: “well I just think it’s messed up that 50-60 year old men get to make comments like that about 20-something year olds’ bodies and just because it happens doesn’t mean it’s okay.” He then went on a rant about that it’s real life and welcome to the big world and my mom chimed in with that I sometimes say bad things about my dad’s family (his brother is a junkie and his sister is a religion fanatic and his parents enable them).

I then had enough and left the house despite my mom saying that it was a shame I was going to leave so angrily.

I think I might be the asshole here for just walking out and saying something about 50-60 year old men which was not adding to the discussion.

EDIT: I should have given a bit more context in regards to the timeline, my apologies for the confusion. The reason why this topic was brought up in the conversation, even though my graduation ceremony was two years ago, was because I played a game of Secret Santa two weeks ago where that friend was involved. I was talking about the game and my dad said “oh yeah I remember her. She wore that red dress at your graduation ceremony right? She has a huge ass.” He has said this before and I keep telling him he shouldn’t make comments like that but he keeps doing it.",246.0
668,t3_ruja7e,AITA for calling a guy who held the door for me an asshole after he sarcastically told me you’re welcome?,"Nice lunch out at a Mexican place. On my way home with a couple leftovers in one hand. The entryway of this place has one of those short rooms in between two sets of double doors on both sides. 

I get to the inner door at the same time another gentleman reaches the outer door, just in time for it to be awkward about who goes first. I make to hold the door for him as he quickly adds his foot to hold the door for me. I decide he wins, so I smile a quick smile, lightly salute, and hustle through the short room and out the door he’s holding for me. Now I definitely didn’t say thanks loud enough to hear, but started making for my car when I here a clear, sarcastic, “You’re welcome!” I glance back, realize what happened and holler back, “No need to be an asshole about it,” as he enters into the short room. He hears me, comes back out, asks what I said. I repeat myself and he says he can be an asshole if he wants. I declare, “Mission accomplished,” as he tells me to go make love to myself or something thereabouts. 

In relaying this story to my wife, she says IATA because I escalated it by commenting back. However, I felt his sarcasm was unnecessary and if his pet peeve happens to be people who don’t verbalize thanks when he holds the door, he can certainly choose not to hold the door. The backbiting sarcasm as he tried to disappear like some hero is what got my dander up the most. 

So anyway; I leave it to you: AITA for calling a guy who held the door for me an asshole after he sarcastically told me you’re welcome?",3.0
669,t3_ruj933,AITA for NOT buying him new glasses after they got lost in my house?,"A friend of mine came to my house to confess some feelings and I gently rejected him (this is relevant to the story). When he left he forgot his glasses at my house, and I left 2 pairs of my keys in his car. I called him and notified him Hey you left your glasses at my house, I left my keys in your car, feel free to stop by to swap. He said his car was in the shop until Monday (2-3 days from then) and he'd stop by then. Monday came by. I never heard from him again for almost 2 MONTHS (thus why I said earlier might be relevant, maybe he didn't want to be around me?). I eventually just replaced all my locks to my house, got new keys, and slowly forgot about this. He calls me after 2 months, and says, ""Hey I got your keys and you have my glasses, when can I come by?"". I told him it's already too late, I replaced all my locks and keys, and honestly I don't know where the glasses are anymore as this house is full, 5 people, 4 dogs, and everything is constantly being moved and cleaned out, so I don't think they are around anymore. He then tells me it was MY RESPONSIBILITY to keep them safe/somewhere I knew they were at, that I have to REIMBURSE HIM, or buy him a new pair of glasses. I then go off and say that it was HIS responsibility to pick them up the day HE promised and or keep them on his person, and he doesn't see me demanding HIM to PAY for all the locks I had to replace and new keys, that I hold the same standard to myself, I lost my keys and that was on me, so I don't expect someone to pay for my mishap. I also told him if that's how he wants it to go down then he should pay for all the new locks for every door and the new keys, and he went silent. He then just tells me he needs those glasses and he would just raid or search my house himself but covid is rising so he can't. I just tell him well I'll look a 2nd time but I didn't find them. He ends the call by basically saying find them or buy me a new pair. AITA for not buying him new glasses?
TL;DR: My friend left his glasses at my house, I left my keys in his car. He said we could swap on Monday. 2 months went by and he never came or contacted. I bought new locks and new keys. I kept track of his glasses but eventually lost them. He called and demanded I pay for his glasses. AITA for not wanting to pay for them?",187.0
670,t3_ruj83d,AITA or better Are we the assholes for kicking one friend out of our friendgroup even if he didn't do anything wrong?,"For back ground information our friendgroup has started as a youth organization from our village when we were kids 
and even if we all got into very different social circles while growing up, we still regularly meet up. Most of these meetings are spontaneous, one of us has nothing to do and asks the group chat if they have time today. 

Having other friendgroup has never been a problem for us, sometimes we even bring them along, however in his case it kinda became one over thelast 2 years. Since he became friends with them, he changed a lot. Especially his attitude. Most of the time when we'd meet and he tagged along he expected either that we had something planned, wanted more people to come or wanted to drink, while the rest of us just want to a relaxed get together after work and it kinda ruins the atmosphere if he always asks if we should get a beer (especially since I don't drink) or if he should ask his friends to come because more people mean more fun. Here's the deal most of us don't actually like his friends, so we really don't want them to come. He also started to prioritize them a lot over us, for example if he would ask in the group chat if we want to meet up, by the time we haf planned something, he would cancel and say he has already made other plans. Even if we were already spending time together, he would make up a shitty excuse to go home, just that we can see him posting pictures with his friends afterwards.

One time where we had a bigger thing planned in the evening after he wrote that he wanted to spend the day with us, just to not show up in the end, one friend decided enough is enough and made a new group chat without everyone except him and we now usally use that chat to plan things, so he has no chance to come and we're excluding him from most activities.

So now our contact is declining, but he still sees on our social media when we are spending time together and ask when we run into him when we planned this or why we didn't ask him and we would make up some poor excuse. It honestly makes me feel like a huge dick, but I still don't want him to actually join us.

671,t3_ruj46g,AITA for not telling my daughter in law I like her new haircut?,"This Christmas Holiday my(53yr W) son, 27, and his wife, 26, drove 4 hours home to see us. We don't see them very often because they are both in the middle of getting their doctorates and due to covid they haven't travelled home much and we were all very excited to see them. My DIL is a gem, but I admit, for as long as they have been together(7 years) she has always worn a very unique since of style. My two younger son's tell me she is ""alt"" or ""punk"" or however. It can be shocking at first, but she is a beautiful girl none the less. 

This year when they arrived home my DIL was sporting a new haircut, and it was certainly unique. My 2 younger sons and the other cousins called it ""cool"" but maybe it's because I'm in my early fifties, I didn't see the appeal. That being said, I am not one to state my opinion unless prompted. I am a very honest person, but only when asked for it. So while everyone was giving her hugs and complimenting her I stood back, and when it was my turn I just gave her a hug and told her I was happy to see her. She seemed perfectly happy to see everyone, and not upset in the slightest and the holidays went well, but later that night I got a call from my son, who was quite upset with me. 

Apparently, my 2 nieces, 17 and 19, told my DIL that I had made a ""face"" at her new hair, and this of course hurt my DIL's feelings when she heard this. My son was upset with me but I tried to tell him I didn't make a face, or do anything rude. My son asked me to send my DIL a text just telling her how much I liked her new hair, and this is where I drew the line. As I stated before, I am an honest person and I don't like to lie. I don't like my DIL's hair, but I never told her it looked bad, and the only reason she thinks I don't like it is because of my 2 nieces who are very wrong.

I don't think I should have to right a wrong I didn't commit, but my son and even my 2 youngest want me to apologize, but I didn't even say anything that needs apologizing! My DIL hasn't reached out to me about this, and I'm not even sure if my son told her he was reaching out to me, because he told me not to mention him doing so if I apologize.

672,t3_ruizy1,AITA for making my friend's boyfriend pay for my meal.,"I still don't know what to make of this situation that happened to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Seven years ago, I was studying for six months in Australia. I had a friend/family friend 'Rose' living there, which was a comfort. Unfortunately, during the Easter holiday, I was ill for two weeks and hardly ate anything and took the doctor's pills. When school started, I felt a lot better, so I decided to invite Rose for a girls lunch since that was my birthday present for her. Due to not knowing Australia, I asked her to choose a restaurant.

&amp;#x200B;

On the day I arrived early, I waited for her, and soon she came with her boyfriend. I thought he was dropping her off, but he joined us. I didn't say anything because I was so excited to see her. We had a lovely time. Due to having been ill, my appetite was small, so I had a kid's pizza, ice cream and a mint tea. In contrast, they had alcohol, starters, main and dessert. When the bill arrived, I said I was to pay since it was my birthday gift to her; they said they would pay. It went back and forth until I gave in.

&amp;#x200B;

After leaving the restaurant, I thanked them soo much for the beautiful meal and thanked them for paying. When I got back to campus, I sent her a text addressed to them, thanked them for the lovely time, and was thankful for the meal.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't hear from her for a week when suddenly, during my break from class, I got a phone call asking why I hadn't messaged Rose's boyfriend and thanked him for the meal. I was surprised since I was taught that that was acceptable if I messaged my friend and thanked her and her boyfriend for dinner. I apologized to her and said I would send him a message after the call.

&amp;#x200B;

After another week, I relaxed in my dorm bedroom when I got another call from her. She asked me why I still haven't sent a message thanking her boyfriend for paying for me and that her boyfriend said he felt uncomfortable that I had made him pay for my meal. I was soo shocked and stunned I didn't know what to say for a while. My whole mind clocked off, and I didn't hear her rambling. I remember saying that I told her that I sent him a message thanking him, and she said it had to be his old number. Then she asked me why I sounded so strange...I lied and said I was surprised that he had changed his number.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting off the phone, I was still shocked and couldn't wrap my head around it.

I go back and forth on the whole payment issue and wonder if I have missed something.

673,t3_ruiylx,AITA For asking my mom not to complain about ppl for a moment?,"Me ( f17) and my mom (47) are usually very close, and we are together the most of the time. We are in an association from our city for the Hispanic population (we are from Mexico but we live in France) the thing is that someone from there told a lie about my mom and some people started to avoid her and it lasted for almost a year until now, we decided to move to the same association but in other place of the city so she can be in peace since the people there are strangers and we make sure there won't be trouble with the other people. The thing is that she keeps complaining about the people that are in the other zone and keeps recalling how some people were with her. I'm not bothered with that, I actually appreciate she tells me things like that since I've seen other girls from my school who barely know about their parents. But the thing is that it's been a while now and she's still into it, and one thing I see is that she says she doesn't criticize anyone but she talks even about people who were nice to her but had a something she didn't like.

 The thing is that a friend of us who's in the zone we left invited us to go out today but when she arrived she came with the person who started the gossip. I noticed my mom was awkward so I tried to soften the situation by trying to make jokes or something (the friend who invited us wasn't aware of the  )

When we were on our way back home, she started to complain about how could that person dared to come ( which I understand). But she also started to complain about our friend and I honestly didn't feel comfortable at all. I don't really know a lot of people here and hearing bad things Abt the few nice ppl I know is something I don't stand ( i tend to change my opinion about people but I try not to judge so I avoid this kind of topics) . Also I wasn't feeling okay and my mom kept going for a while so I told her we are not in that place anymore so if we want to make things better from now, we should try to leave those things in the past and move on. We moved from the problem so we should continue what we just did. She then said i was just shutting her up and that I didn't care about what she says, i told her I did but I didn't think it was fair to put our friend in the same level and that since I saw how the people became after the gossip I felt bad too but hearing what they did again and again doesn't make feel any better and it won't be good for her neither. She assumed that I just didn't care about her at all and she said she won't tell me anything from now and now she doesn't want to talk to me.

 I feel kinda bad because I don't tend to talk about myself to my mom since sometimes she doesn't listen to me or doesn't try to understand what I feel about a problem I have, so I just limit myself to listen to what she says and try to handle my own problems by myself. It's not like I don't want her to tell me what she feels, but I don't want her to do what others did to us because we are not like that. 

I have to accept that I don't consider myself very sensitive so maybe what I thought or said wasn't okay and maybe I was a little rude so, AITA?",7.0

676,t3_ruiu3r,AITA for lying to my best friend?,"Okay so me (F18) and my best friend (F17) got really close last year during quarantine. Last week her boyfriend (M18) broke up with her. For the context, they had been together for around two years, a little longer than I've been friends with her. They apparently had many arguments that almost led to breakups.

Now, I didn't really even talk to him, all I knew about him were the things she told me, and usually it weren't positive things. She would constantly complain about him and she would rarely seem happy with him. Other friends and I told her over and over again to break up with him, yet they stayed together. 

One day all three of us hang out in her place. Her boyfriend and I instantly got along and it turned out our personalities, humour and thinking were really alike. My friend made some jokes about how we should date cause we're so similar, however she didn't seem jealous or mad. Later we started texting on a group chat with all three of us. Her boyfriend jokingly (I think?) flirted with me but I didn't respond to these jokes at the time cause I didn't want to upset my friend. After a while I asked her if it's okay for me to respond to the jokes and she said it's fine cause she knew it's all jokes. So I, jokingly, flirted with him too. She really seemed fine with it, not only cause I asked her about permission multiple times, but also because she made some jokes herself.

In the meantime she asked me a couple of times if I liked him, and I always said no. I had feelings for someone else, however I always said that I don't know if I'm not going to have a crush on him, because he's really cool and I can't predict the future. I also mentioned that even if I liked him and they have broken up I wouldn't date him.

Well, he broke up with her last week. And I was in a call with him when he sent her the breakup text. He told me about how he always had to lie to her and that he thinks their relationship was based on arguments and ""serious talks"" that led to no improvement. A while later it also turned out he has a crush on me.

My friend never seemed too worry about the relationship, she joked about breaking up all the time, but she got really upset over the real breakup. She cried a lot and all the texts from her talked about how much she cares about him and that she loves him. She asked him to give her a second chance multiple times, but he always rejected her and was uninterested in continuing a relationship. 

She asked me a couple of times if I have messaged him, and I always lied and said no (which I guess is where I messed up - I shouldn't have lied). However, all three of us met yesterday and she found out we've been texting, and she got mad. I told her that all of our messages are jokes (which well, right now I think they aren't), however she's furious that I lied to her, but really I just didn't want her to worry.

The problem is, I guess we have a mutual crush on each other. He really is a great person but I don't want to lose a good friendship.

My parents divorced when I was 4. My dad (M/64) never remarried, but now has a girlfriend (F/62) of about 3 years. They don't visit often at all. My dad averages about once a month, and I think I've seen his girlfriend less than 10 times in 3 years. The frequency and length of their visits a determined by them, not us. We don't restrict their time.

My dad is convinced I don't like his girlfriend because I don't really interact with her when they're down. I've told him that's not the case, I'm just not a very talkative person and that they are down to see my son, so I try to let them have as much time with him as possible (both of these are true). I also tell him that I'm the same way when my in-laws are down (also true). This has been a conversation several times, that has now blown up in the last 48 hours.

They are sick, and I simply told them no one in my house is sick, so I said ""if it was covid, you (guys) got it from her family"".

That set him off, after texts about covid he added ""by the way HER name is \[her name\]""

After another long text from him, I told him:

&gt;As I’ve said time and time again, I don’t dislike her. I am happy you found someone that makes you happy. But also as I’ve said before, I am not a very talkative person. When you are over now, the focus is mostly on my son, where is where it should be. I don’t interrupt that. It’s the same way when my mom’s over, and the same way when my wife's parents are over. I don’t know how to phrase this right, so I’d going to come out poorly and harsher than I intend, so I apologize for that. I don’t dislike your girlfriend, but my relationship is with you, not her, and I don’t really care if I have one with her. That’s nothing against her at all, as I’d feel the same way that if Mom started dating someone. A parent’s significant other is much different when the child is older than when the child is younger. Even if you guys eventually get married, she may legally become my step-mother, but it’s never going to be that kind of relationship with someone I only see a few times a year, that isn’t raising me as a child.

Well that sent him off on another long string of texts. He's now called me anti-social, rude, mean-spirited, and saying a whole lot of other things. I haven't responded to any of it yet, as I find the whole situation to be ridiculous.

What I sent him was the honest truth. If she makes him happy, then I am happy for him. I don't dislike her at all.. I nothing her. I just have no desire to forge a relationship with someone that I see so rarely just because my dad is dating her. Am I really the asshole for that?

Am I really the asshole for telling my son to be supportive because his brother needs him now? 

Anyone who wants to visit my son, in person outside of the covid virus, or on a video visit or over a phone call must be on the approved list. Now that my son has been sentenced and sent out of county lockup to the prison, he has to have his visitor list done. The problem is my other son [the one not incarcerated] wouldn't talk to the prison or answer questions. Without co-operation he didn't pass the approval check and can't be approved. His mom and I both told him to co-operate but he wouldn't do it. If he was living with us or supported by us it would be non-negotiable. But he doesn't so even though we put our foot down he won't budget. It lead to a huge blowout between his mom and I and him. Before my son was arrested they were close as anything. They were raised as twins and did everything together. Same class, dress the same, same hobbies. Any attempt to separate them was met with strong resistance on both their parts. Now he states his brother is dead to him. We tried to put our foot down and tell him to grow up but that led to the blowout.

After his arrest they wanted information he didn't have since he wasn't part of the ring.

682,t3_ruif1z,WIBTA for rehoming a previous foster cat that was adopted out,"Myself and another foster are struggling with whether or not we should rehome an adopted cat that was a foster of mine earlier this year. I take adopting my animals very seriously, doing a meet and greet, talking on the phone, and conducting a check up. While I didn't conduct the meet and greet with the kitten being at a pet store adoption center, I did conduct a phone interview and checked in. The Adopter did not return my phone call, but it's mostly just to make sure everyone is getting along and seeing if they have concerns. All the adopters have my number and have reached out if they had any issues. 

So background to the story. This started the week before Christmas. My foster lead (we'll call FL for short) reached out about one of my fosters, Katy, being found and dropped off at one of the nearby Humane Societies. The microchip wasn't registered so it still had the rescue's information on there. FL was able to get ahold of Adopter found out Katy got out and was missing, and thought that they were going to pick Katy up on Saturday. They never showed up. We weren't getting a response back so I, being the former foster, opted to pick her up and hold onto her until we knew what the situation was. Monday Adopter reached out and said they were on vacation (no big deal) and didn't have great reception. FL responded asking when they were coming back. No response from Adopter.

After a week, I messaged Adopter and also mentioned a boarding fee since it had been over a week since Adopter had sent FL a message. I kept it simple, $10 a day. I asked for a response by Tuesday thinking this could prompt Adopter to respond. Again, no response.

Finally, today (after New Years day), I messaged Adopter letting them know that Katy is going up for adoption Tuesday and considered abandoned if we don't hear from them. Adopter FINALLY responded with a quick, they're back today and will pick her up tomorrow. I mentioned the boarding fee, and Adopter tried to say they only owe from the text. I told Adopter, no, that Katy has been in our custody since the Sunday before Christmas. FL communicated this to her when we initially picked her up from the Humane Society.

WIBTA for rehoming a former foster kitten before the Adopter is being difficult and not responding? The Adopter didn't disclose they were going on vacation when we were trying to coordinate returning their kitten, didn't give us a timeframe, didn't find a way to message us until after we said we were putting their kitten up for adoption, and also didn't ask about their kitten or showed any concern.

EDIT: I feel that I would be TA because they did reach out (finally), and we're still wanting to rehome even after they messaged us about picking up their cat. 

TLDR; Both myself and another foster (same rescue) are considering rehoming a former foster kitten since the adopter is not disclosing their vacation and left the kitten in our care for over two weeks with little communication.",5.0
683,t3_ruidgc,AITA for arriving 26 min late?,"Not an American living in the East coast. Photography and fall in New England are 2 of my fave things. I’m trying to get fall pics of all NE states.

My friend ‘Lauren’ drives back and forth every other Saturday to a neighboring state where her second job is. I wanted to take pictures of the leaves in that state for my collection so one day I asked her if next time she went there, i could go with her. I said I’d meet her at her place in the am and then again at the end of the day at her job. All she had to do was allow me to be in the car w her. She replies saying she wasn’t going there that weekend but how about we go together and hike there. It can take me hours to take pics of a place I like so it’s best to do it alone but I thought it would be awkward to tell her I didn’t want her to come, that I just wanted a ride, so I reply saying that was a great idea. I figured I’d still get to take some pics and it might be nice.

Later she tells me she invited 2 more people. I’m not thrilled cuz even tho I like them fine, I really just wanted to go alone and spend the day taking my damn pics.

Lauren wants us to meet her at her place at 7:30am. I hate waking up early so I ask her if we can go a little later and she says no because it takes over an hour to get there and 3 hours to hike up the mountain and 3 hours to come down and this girl she invited to come along had to be back in town by a certain time. I was like wtf, 3 HOURS TO GO UP A MOUNTAIN? WHAT MOUNTAIN?! It turns out that’s what she meant when she said hiking. I thought ‘hiking’ was a synonym for taking a walk (not a native speaker). I’ve never hiked in my life. So now I’m incredibly annoyed because 1)I don’t wanna go up some freaking mountain n 2)I have to get up early cuz of some girl I barely know (Lauren’s friend) who’s on a schedule. This little trip was my idea, I just wanted to take some pics alone. Still, I don’t complain but I do insist on going later so Lauren says 8am is the latest she can do.

Lauren lives far. I miss a bud so I text her several times while on my way just to keep her updated if where I am. All she says is ‘hurry’. At 8:10am I’m still on the bus but getting close so I tell her and she says they’re getting inpatient, that I should hurry. I get to her house at 8:26am and to my astonishment they’re gone. They just left, didn’t even tell me. I text her and she says it was getting late so they had to leave. Then I text her the most horrid garbage I can think of at that point, over and over again because I am so livid. No response. I go home.

I think this was absurd but some people say I shouldn’t have accepted to go if I was already unhappy. I say that’s irrelevant but they say my being unhappy is what made me subconsciously late which is what caused her to leave since almost a half hour is a long time especially cuz she had already agreed to meet at 8am when she actually wanted to leave at 7:30am.

My cousin (29F) texted in our family group chat and said that they had set the date for the wedding, great! I asked when the wedding was and they said “00/00!”

If this was any other birthday, honestly I wouldn’t care. This is my 18th birthday. For personal reasons, my 18th is genuinely such a huge milestone in my life. I wanted to spend it celebrating myself and how far I’ve come.  I’m proud of myself for making it that far. 

This wedding is states away and not anywhere close to the original date they said it was going to be. If the wedding wasn’t so far away maybe I would be fine with it, but I don’t want to be traveling all day, then spending the whole night celebrating someone else, and then traveling again. 

I didn’t say anything about it being my birthday, quite frankly I don’t know if they even knew that it was my birthday. I’m not upset with my cousins at all, I’m just upset with the way that the dates worked out. 

My sister and my dad are both saying that if I don’t go it is selfish and I would be TA. 

My dad keeps threatening to tell my cousin that I don’t want to go to the wedding because my birthday is more important than her but that isn’t true at all. I love my cousin and her fiancé a lot, but my 18th is important to me. Maybe I could celebrate another day, but it just isn’t the same as the actual date. 

I’m sure that I’m still going to end up going to the wedding, but I just want to know if I’m really in the wrong for being upset over it.

I’m talking no presents, no birthday parties, sometimes having to remind them of my birthday. They’ll put in more effort into New Years. My 20th birthday is on Monday, and my parents were taking me out to dinner that day, but then this afternoon they said they were doing it tonight instead. Now, this has been planned for a week and a half and my birthday has very rarely actually been celebrated on the actual day, so I really wanted to do it on my birthday. But, I would’ve been fine if they told me about it the day before instead of 2 hours before, leaving me in a hurry to get ready. I’m the type who likes a day advance warning or the timing for my day gets messed and I get put out of my routine and messed up. They started telling me where we’re going and when we’re going and getting mad at me when I said I wanted to leave about half an hour later. They said I shouldn’t complain when someone offers to take me out to eat. Whenever that happens, I don’t complain, but this is my 20th birthday dinner and I want at least a little control over it. When I said I wanted to have a nice dinner tomorrow as well for my actually birthday, my stepmother bitches at me saying “no eating out two days in a row” even though that’s not what I said. I explained my self saying a nice dinner at home.

This last part may sound petty, but they didn’t even get me my birthday cheesecake, which is something I’ve put on the grocery list and has been a birthday custom for me since I was 13. They said they forgot it, even though I put it on the grocery list in big writing at the very top. It just feels like they don’t even care about my birthday at this point and are using it as an excuse to go out.

However, they also had a tendency to use my hearing loss as the punchline to their jokes, calling me the ""WHAT???"" girl, laughing when I mishear something and repeat it back wrong, and getting frustrated when I didn't hear them. I've tried to get them to stop, but I've been told I'm too sensitive and that ""it's just a joke"", so I would just laugh along instead and pretend it's funny. Amidst all of this, I became involved in disability advocacy projects (and never really told my parents) because I didn't want others to experience what I went through.

I'm now a college student back home for winter break, and the jokes have resumed. It's actually only gotten worse since they found out about my advocacy projects, calling me a ""social justice warrior"" when all I deserve is a little respect.

My younger sister, who lives with my parents in another county, tested positive for Covid a few days before Christmas, but only had mild symptoms. 

When my family was making plans for Christmas, my parents wanted to celebrate  with the whole family on Christmas Day. I let them know in pretty strong terms that I didn't think it was a good idea given that my sister had tested positive just a couple days before, and Grandma probably didn't have the strongest immune system at the moment, but my mom assured me that because ""everyone except your sister is vaccinated or has had covid"" and they were going to get tested before that it would be fine. I reminded my mom that while I was vaccinated, my SO wasn't (for personal reasons, I have tried to convince them to get it, without success) and that even if she had covid before, Grandma could still get it again. This doesn't convince my family, but they've never really taken the virus seriously before so I am not surprised. 

My SO and I agree to go visit my Grandma on Christmas Eve instead, since some other family members will be stopping by then, we can celebrate with them and not have to worry about my family. We bring the gifts for my parents and siblings too so we can leave them there for when my parents come by the next day. 

Christmas Eve comes and we're all enjoying dinner when there's a knock on the door.

My mother-in-law, who my husband has a very guarded relationship with, keeping her at an arms length, because she was/is a complete narcissist, she was mentally and emotionally abusive and an addict when they were kids. But this controlling/self-pity/attention-seeking behavior still permeates her behavior now, however improved she is nowadays. 

For Christmas she asked us what we wanted, and my husband sent her a bunch of ideas and links. Instead of getting anything remotely similar to what we suggested, which were not demands because she asked because we don’t really see her so she just don’t know us very well, she went two 2 stores and selected a gift card for 1 thing from each place. A specific brand of shoes from one place, and a fragrance from another. She had the exact dollar amount including tax loaded on the cards because didn’t know what size/style/scent I wanted. So this is a very strings attached gift. 

I don’t like any of the perfumes from this one place, which are cheap and shitty, and I have a pair of shoes that’s the same style as the brand she wants me to use the gift card for, I don’t like having multiple identical items because it doesn’t make sense to me.

I told my husband that I’m probably going to put both gift cards toward a new blouse or something from each store, and he told me she would probably be upset and call me out on it when she follows up. He doesn’t care what I do, but was warning me. I don’t really care either, because she’s so distant I literally just don’t care.

691,t3_rui0e9,WIBTA for asking my friend to stop talking about her (lack of) sexuality?,"(Wasn't sure if I should mark this as nsfw or not; it sort of has to do with sex, but not explicitly, so I decided not to. I can add the nsfw flair if it needs it though!) 

One of my closest friends (26F) and I (25F) have known each other for about 7 years now. We moved into an apartment together about 3 years ago, and have lived together ever since.

She's always been unsure of her sexuality and has gone through a few labels, but about 6 months ago she discovered that she's asexual, as in she doesn't feel sexual attraction to others. It's awesome that she's finally found an identity that fits her, since I know she's been struggling with it for a while.

Ever since then she's fully embraced her newfound identity, and finds every opportunity to mention it. That in itself I don't have a problem with; being a lesbian myself, I know how exciting it can be to embrace an identity that fits.

But sometimes she takes it to an extreme. She personally finds sex disgusting, which is totally fine, but every now and then she says things that belittle people who like sex somehow, or make it seem like she \[and other asexual people\] are somehow better than everyone else because they think sex is gross or filthy. The two of us don't really talk about sex or attraction much anyway, but whenever it comes up, she does some combination of making faces, rolling her eyes, sighing dramatically, or making ""you all need jesus"" jokes, usually followed by an explanation of how she doesn't ""get"" sexual attraction.

I want to be clear that the issue has nothing to do with the fact that she's asexual, I just have an issue with how judgmental she is when the topic comes up. But at the same time, I don't want to take away from her experience of expressing herself; she has as much of a right to express her sexuality (or lack of) as anyone else.

I recently had a big family party for my son's first birthday. My sister and I had been talking about some hypothetical things and just speculating about our social theories. It all started with talking about wedding cake and if smashing it actually indicates divorce. 

We decided to ask people at the party if they smashed or not and see if there was any correlation to happiness. Obviously we can't know 100% how a marriage is, but I'd say we had a pretty good feeling due to spending a lot of time around the families and everyone being pretty open. I'd also say I am able to be objective, because MIL and I have some issues, but her marriage actually came out number one in our ranking.

So we asked about the cake smashing, did our tally, and then my sister brought up another question which was slightly more personal about if you use the bathroom in front of your spouse. I asked MIL first and she wanted to know what it was for (she was laughing, not mad) I explained what we were doing and that it was just a sociology experiment. I said MIL proved the current theory wrong because she did cake smash and she is also relationship goals. My mom wanted to know where her marriage was. I said I wasn't going to share the list, but MIL snatched it out of my hand and announced the ranking.

FIL's wife was very upset. FIL and his wife definitely love each other, but she has a temper and when they fight they fight hard, so I'm not saying they don't love each other, but yeah they did rank beneath MIL and one other person. My parents were towards the bottom due to having had some serious issues. My mom realized that and began to cry. I apologized and said we would stop, but my mom told me she hates me and called me stupid. MIL announced that despite ""winning the list"" I'm a bitch for making my mom cry, and that really put a damper on the party.

My mom was super mean when she left too and said I can't emotionally fulfill my husband. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, because it was just a silly game, and to be honest we are all semi-aware of who has a better married. I get that it is objective, but there are some hard facts.",69.0

It took months before realizing he was dealing with a mental health issue and I've arranged for him to see a therapist. He was against it at first but then agreed to give it a try.


He got better and his quality of life improved. He regained his quality of life, he started going out and became sociable, he bought a new car and did a 180% makeover from hair, clothes, and working out, and even adopted 2 dogs.

It was miraculous and I was happy that he got his life back. Except that he still doesn't work, not only that but he used my money to get this tranformation done. When I tried to talk to him about finding a job since he's now doing well he'd try to put the idea off and say he needs more therapy to be ready to start committing to a job and start working.


This went on for months and he jumped from a therapist to therapist and still said he is not ready to look for a job yet goes out with friends, eats out, buys new Gadgets and a now a screen to watch his fav shows.

Last night we had a huge argument after I found out he bought a $200 wrist watch for himself using my credit card. I couldn't handle it and I shouted at him that it was time for him to find a job. He tried to use the ""I'm still not ready for this kind of committment yet"" but I blocked his attempt and told him I'd stop paying for everything including his therapy, he got mad and replied that threatning to stop paying for everything even his therapy will set him back and we both won't get where we want to be but I told him he was a hypocrite for saying he's not ready to look for a job since he's living completely normal and may I say lavish life?. He called me unbelieveable and walked out.

He called his mom telling her I was losing it and she got in the middle telling me off about what I said and told me to have some sympathy for him as he's still struggling to regain his strength but I told her to stay out of it which caused more rage from my inlaws.

Send proof of membership, and I will send over the joining fee, and £500 for you to buy the new dress and shoes for you to feel like the beautiful woman you are.

Enjoy the first date. Raise the bar. Aim high. Do not accept second best. Remember they have to raise their game to deserve you. We both so want you to be happy. But you need the helping hand , and advice. Meet a good man. 27-33. Degree educated. And London based. Look at what university they attended. Look at the degree.

To address a few things - yes the email is oddly specific, but no it isn't spam or an advertisement, nor is he affiliated with Eiite Singles or Eharmony. My Mother was with him at a pub/restaurant when he wrote it, so they essentially composed it together (she was also copied into the email). I was having a few issues with my living arrangements, and shared some of the details with my Mother. Mark's solution is, you guessed it, a man! Unsurprisingly, he met my Mother through an online dating site (though it wasn't eHarmony or Elite Singles). Mum is aware that I am with a woman, though I haven't spelt it out per say, but she sent both my girlfriend and I Christmas presents. My girlfriend felt conflicted accepting them, after she felt indirectly insulted by Marks email.

I’ve been living here for 5 mo &amp; the bff is not nice to me. I have made effort to find the good in him &amp; be his friend BUT HE IS A MAN BABY. He is 27, My boyfriend has known him for 12+ years. He does not change, he is not open to letting me put my stuff anywhere. He does not pay rent! &amp; has these weird entitlement issues. My boyf &amp; I BUY everything for the house. &amp; he takes my clothes WET out of drier to dry his. Why don’t you just run the drier? just common respect?So then he is just always judging me. Makes me feel unwelcome. My boyf knows I am not being crazy bc he has seen it &amp; has asked his friend multiple times to give me a chance. The friend was never going to change his mind. I love the boy so I didn’t know how to approach it but I needed him gone. Since he is a manbaby, I know that kicking him out will be the end of their 12+ year friendship. I don’t want my boyf to lose his best friend so I could just suck it up til the lease ends. So my boyfriend convinces his 27 y.o friend to quit because he was unhappy working at dominoes, he is also an artist. my boyf said he will support him while he focuses on his art &amp; makes something of himself, he moved out of his moms &amp; within the year living with my boyf he did barely any art&amp; PLAYED VIDEO GAMES EVERY DAY Then one day he bought bananas, he is notorious for buying food &amp; not eating it. I asked my boyfriend if I could have a banana &amp; the bff doesn’t speak or make eye contact with us for a week. My boyfwas sad &amp; when they spoke he said I bought those bananas with my own money. &amp; what about all the stuff I buy for you? You don’t pay rent? He ends up throwing the other banans from the bundle away. So the friend just got a job,back to dominoes So he is employed, &amp;his mother moved back in the area &amp;has vocalized she wants him to live with her again but he chooses not to&amp; he’s engaged. When I expressed I want to sublease the place when my boyf moves so he is not paying 2 rents, the bff simply said “I think we should both stay here&amp;save money”, but you don’t pay rent? You don’t pay bills? How is my boyf your BFF saving money?I have also told him my boyf can barely afford anything for himself &amp;he doesn’t really care. I asked my boyf to ask him to leave",0.0
697,t3_ruhaty,AITA for giving my sister bananas?,"This is my first time posting on this sub and I’m pretty sure I’m the asshole but would like other opinions. 

I (f19) was in the kitchen making noodles for myself and my sister (f9) came in asking me for perogies, we had finished them yesterday so I told her and she asked for bananas instead which I gave her in a bowl. When I went to sit at the table, my mom (41f) was laying down on the bed.

She suddenly snapped at me and was really pissed off, asking me how I can make noodles for myself and only give my sister bananas. I was shocked at why it even mattered so I asked what’s wrong with bananas? She said bananas aren’t fucking food, you didn’t even make her noodles. I told her we had no more noodles left and if bananas weren’t food then what were they? I asked if banana’s were shit that came out of someone’s ass if they aren’t food. She got annoyed and I told her it wasn’t my responsibility to make sure her kid was fed and if she hates bananas so much she can make my sis food herself.

She then made a comment about how I’m just like my damn father, so I said she’s just like her damn mother. And how her mother got pregnant at 14 and had 9 kids. 

She started going crazy and told me not to even mention her mother so I yelled back and told her not to mention my father. I tried to go to my room after to eat but she continued yelling through the house and I didn’t want to hear any more of her yelling so I raised my voice while walking to drown out her words, because I knew if I heard what she was saying it would’ve triggered me even more into anger. I wasn’t talking to her while raising my voice and walking to my room. She then called me a psychopath and I called her an asshole. 

I just don’t understand why she started yelling and freaking out over me giving my sister banana’s and I will admit it triggered me really badly to react in such a bad way",26.0
698,t3_ruhak9,AITA for wanting my roommate to keep her stuff in her room?,"I (19F) currently live in a house of six girls. There are two cats living here as well with two different owners. It is only one cat owner that is the problem.

This cat has pooped on my roommate's bed and broken items in the house without the owner (referred to as C) (21F) offering to pay or help clean. C initially kept the cat's litterbox in the laundry room, but this grossed us out because she rarely cleans it and the laundry room is meant to be a clean space. Also, the cat food was being kept in the kitchen where kiblets would be all over the floor and C wouldn't sweep it up.

Myself and my other roommate (referred to as E) (20F) had a conversation with C about moving the cat's litterbox and food into her bedroom but it did not go well. C claimed that she didn’t feel safe in the house and did not address any of our concerns.

C struggles to keep her room clean and often leaches her mess into common spaces. One time, when her mom was coming to help her clean up her room, C and her mother consulted the rest of us and requested that the litterbox not be moved into her room but rather the furnace room instead. We agreed to a trial period as long as she cleaned it more often. 

This did not last very long as fleas were found in the house. The cats were locked in their respective owner's rooms, and different methods of flea removal were attempted. Currently, it has been over two months and we are waiting to see if any fleas appear on the cats. If so, the girls have agreed to hire an exterminator. During the conversation where we discussed an exterminator, C had the audacity to request that we pay for it, claiming that it is a ""house issue"". No one else agrees with this. 

During this conversation, we discussed the litter again and decided that it needed to be removed from the furnace room as there are some serious health concerns with it being kept close to a furnace. We agreed that the only place for the litter was her room. C did not like this, however agreed.

Recently I had found a flea on my bed. I texted my house the next day and C had responded saying that it didn't make sense since she hadn't seen any. That night she came into my room and said it didn't make sense and accused my hamster's of being the ones with fleas. We checked and no fleas were found. She then accused me of lying and when I had asked if she was serious she told me that this is what she would believe for her peace of mind.

After this, C then told me she wanted to have a house chat to move the litter box back to the laundry room. She said she’s been feeling miserable and that it wasn't fair for it to be in her room. This conversation was sparked because earlier that day I had stepped in cat pee and told her that she needs to keep her door open at night if she wants to let the cat out. 

Neither I nor E are comfortable moving the litterbox back to the laundry room. Am I the asshole for not wanting to take responsibility for C’s emotions and requesting that everything remain in her room?",6.0
699,t3_ruh9ma,WIBTA If I (20F) moved in with my boyfriend?,"I might actually be the AH here. I have been living abroad for Uni for 1.5 years. I have a boyfriend for a year and we want to move in together next August. 

It makes sense for us financially, as we'd be able to afford a bigger place for cheaper than if we shared a house with 4 other people like we are now (different houses though), time wise ( sharing cooking, laundry and cleaning) and roommate wise (we both have had bad experiences by getting random roommates. Thing is, we don't want to tell our parents about the relationship yet for different reasons. His is mostly cultural, you tell your parents very late into the relationship, essentially when proposal happened or is around the corner. Mine is because of my mom. She didn't take well when I told her about previous bfs. She's highly narcissistic and has used my relationships with my peers against me. Telling my bfs details of my life before I was ready to open up, lying, manipulating etc. I tend to tell her the minimum necessary about my life. 

Thing is: my dad helps pay my rent and university fees. So if I moved in the apartment Id have to lie about who I moved in with and he'd be helping me cover my part of the rent without knowing my boyfriend also lives there. My boyfriend would still cover half the rent, of course. We would still have our own room. My dad would not pay any different than he is now. But would that be fair?",5.0
700,t3_ruh7da,AITA for not speaking to my grandmother?,"Ever since I can remember my grandmother (dad's mum) has hated my mother. She would always make very rude remarks about my mum and try to hide them as compliments. (Example: did you get a new hair cut? It looks very nice but it makes you look old, you were much better off with your old hair) She would always make sure that my dad had left the room before saying those things to my mother. Her hate of my mother carried over to me.

She would tell me that she does love me as her granddaughter but if I ""allowed"" my parents another child she wouldn't love me as much and nor would they (I was 3 then). She would also always scare me with various things for no reason. She had one of those German shelf toilets (look it up) and would always say that rats loved to climb up from inside and sit up on it (and sometimes bite) when you went to the toilet. I'm now, 21 and realise a few years ago, that all she has ever said was bs. And that it wasn't okay to say to a child. 

Last year (with brexit going on) my provider has decided that it's not in my contract to be able to call outside of the UK (my grandmother lives in Europe). Which meant I couldn't contact her other than by post. I went almost a whole year without speaking to her, and it was nice. I didn't have anyone make remarks on my personal life or body choices, etc.
I had to speak to her over Christmas, as I was visiting my parents and they called her up, and she said she misses me and then proceeded to tell me off for not calling her and making her cry and that she doesn't understand why I hate her. She also proceeded to blame my mother for me not wanting to speak to her by saying my mother is doing the same thing to me as she did to my dad where she's taking me away from 'the family' and that I don't talk to her nor any of my cousins on my dad's side of the family. (The reason I don't talk to cousins is because after I met 3/4 of them, they all tried to steal money from me or make me do inappropriate stuff.) 

Now here's where I may be the a-hole: I told my grandmother that it has nothing to do with my mother nor the rest of the family, but the reason I don't wish to speak to her is because she does nothing reddit critics me and I know that she doesn't actually love me, she just wanted to turn me against my mother for some reason ever since I was a child. I then told her I'm just calling to wish her a merry Christmas and that other than that I do not want to speak with her. I felt quite bad after it but I realised it had to be said at some point. My grandmother has said that I'm being an ungreatful little thing that doesn't respect her elders. Both my parents agree with her. Even my mother who has always had it uphill with her, said that respecting elders is a priority and I shouldn't be this disrespectful no matter what. I refuse to go to visit her and give her calls even though my contract with my provider is fixed now and I could call her at any moment.",2.0
701,t3_ruh0ei,AITA for not wanting my husbands family at my sons birthday party?,"For context, every holiday we've celebrated with my (F23) husband's (M32) family there has been some type of drama/arguement. It always results in someone lashing out, ruining the holiday for everyone - including the kids.
Thanksgiving 2021 there was conflict, and my husband and I decided we're not going to family functions anymore. I specifically remember saying that they will not be invited to the functions we hold, such as our sons birthday party. Conveniently, my husband does not remember agreeing to that. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt cause this conversation did happen 2 months ago. We held our ground for Christmas, and stayed home. It was a wonderful day, and little drama happened.
My son is turning 3 on January 20th. Today i brought up going somewhere special with our son instead of having a party, so we dont have to deal with either of our families being upset that they're not going to celebrate with him. My husband got very upset about that, telling me it wasn't fair to my son to not have them come, he needs his family, and that we agreed they could be at events we host and we're in control of. I know i wouldn't have agreed to them coming around for our events cause i dont want these people in my life at all. They are very toxic, even my husband agrees! I dont want people celebrating special moments with my child, when they could and most likely will ruin it with some type of bs. None of them come around to hang out with my son, they don't call, and they only see him on holidays out of obligation. Am i wrong for not wanting people around when they clearly don't want to be? I don't want to deal with the stress of walking on eggshells making sure they don't ruin the happiness of my son.
Mind you, my husband was perfectly okay with allowing MY family to be cut off cause they don't make an effort in my sons life either. So why am i wrong for cutting off his family? I think what's best for my son would be doing something special with the people who actually care about him, rather than being in a house with people he barely knows. I also don't think these people deserve the opportunity to be around him. They have not made an effort to see him in almost 3 years. They don't deserve to see the smiles, to hear the laughs and giggles, to give hugs and kisses, and they certainly don't get the chance to think they're contributing to my sons happiness when they only ever ruin special occasions.

702,t3_rugzwy,AITA for not forgiving my cousin?,"Okay so obligatory on mobile, English is my first language, throwaway account, everyone involved is vaccinated stuff. Not American.

So long backstory here I 23f have 4 maternal cousins 29m, Ryan 26, Finn 23 and Matty 17, not real names. Our mothers both died when we were young. We lived in a rural area a couple towns apart, when I was 17 the local authority decided that having multiple schools open with the low population of students made no sense and decided it'd be cheaper to pay for buses to and from school. 

The day arrives of the merge and Matty doesn't arrive with Finn and his friends. I'm a bit confused since my uncle had told me Finn would be driving in instead of getting the bus. I ask Finn where Matt is and they all snicker. Finn says he was taking forever so they decided to leave without him and make him get the bus. Okay... Finn and I have a cuddle and are chatting away.  

The bus arrives, I wait..no Matty. I call him... no answer. I pull Finn away from his friends, tell him I can't get hold of Matty and I'm worried. Away from his friends Finn gets this guilty look on his face. I press and finally he admits that Matty was being annoying in the car so they dumped him on the side of the road. The kicker, Mattys bag is still in Finns car with his mobile and HIS INHALER! 

Every bit of love and respect I had for this person seemed to evaporate as I panicked over my asthmatic 12yr old cousin, walking tobschool in the cold on a road without a pavement. I lost it. I got one of the  teachers, retrieved Mattys bag and off we went to get him. He was 4 miles from the school having a full-blown asthma attack. He went to hospital, thankfully he was alright, cold and shaken. I found out later that Finns group had been bullying him for ages. After some discussion my uncle and dad, decided it'd be best if Matty came to live with us for a bit.

It's been 5 years now, Matty still lives with us and has come so far. Finn eventually gave him a half-hearted apology, Matty forgave him.

At a family party over Christmas Finn tried to talk to me. I brushed him off then Finn got upset and started talking about how I use to be his best friend and he loved me and he misses me being part of his life. He also said it shows how much I loved him that I could just drop him like he didn't matter to me at all. I told him I use to love him than he almost killed my baby cousin and showed me his true colours. Matty could have died and Finn was stood there laughing about it! I told him he will always be my cousin but he's a complete stranger to me and the person I thought I knew did die on that road and walked away. 

It made the rest of the party super awkward. Matty later hugged me and told me he's so glad to have a cousin that will always have his back. While my dad, Blane and other family members all said I went too far and should let it go. So AITA for not being able to let it go and for calling Finn out for nearly killing our cousin?

Just editing to add Finn was 18 when this happened, he's a September baby, he was the oldest person in our year.

Adding one little thing just for clarification because I mentioned it in the comments. Matty isn't blood related to me. He's my maternal aunts widows son. My uncle had a relationship after my aunt died and that's where Matty came from. Not a reason Finn ever stated for disliking Matty or even ever brought up apparently. Mattys mum was never in the picture, she's alive just didn't want kids, so there was no jealous to our knowledge about that. He's still my baby cousin, blood be damned.",332.0
703,t3_rugysk,AITA for lying to family to cover for another family member?,"So I maybe the AH and I feel guilty as I’m not generally a liar. My family is very close. My best friend is my cousin, Tasha, who is 14 years older than I am and her son, Max, who she had at 19, is 5 years younger than I, so we were always very close to and still are. 

I come from an area where binge drinking is the norm and NYE was no different. About 4am Tasha went to bed. Max, a family friend and I were still up drinking. Max and the friend were still drinking. I wasn’t feeling a 100% so I stopped drinking about 1am. 

Max was going to sit down at the table but caught the chair awkward and fell over breaking his ankle. I handled the situation. I made him stay down ordered our friend to make sure he didn’t move because drunken cousin was swearing it was only a sprain. I called an ambulance and he was carted off. 

Here’s where the AITH begins. Since I was the only mostly sober one Max’s mom who is my bff, Tasha, and her mother, who is my 80yo aunt asked if it was because he was drunk or was it some freak accident. I didn’t want them harping at Max while injured, so I lied and said that it was just because he sat on the corner of the chair and it was a freak accident. He broke it while trying to stop the fall. 

I’m sure alcohol played some role. 

So now I lied to family and my best friend… and just for good measure I screwed the friend (we’re both single) while Max and Max’s wife were at the ED. It was an interesting way to ring in the New Year. 

So AITA for lying to my family for my cousin?

704,t3_rugx5h,AITA for not letting my friend stay at my house until her apartment is ready to move in?,"She (25F) decided to move to a new place a few months ago, but things didn't go according to plan because the new apartment is not ready to move in yet, and she has three days to leave her current apartment. So she asked me if she could stay at my (24F) place for this month until her apartment is ready, but to be honest, I don't want her here because she will bring me problems. Don't get me wrong I love her, but she's the messiest person I've ever met, and my husband (31M) doesn't like her because every time she comes to visit she makes a horrible mess and doesn't even offer to help clean up the mess she made. 

So I know that he won't want her to stay with us for a whole month, and there is also the problem that our house is not big enough for her to stay here. We only have four bedrooms and they are all used, two are our two kids', one is mine and my husband's and the other is used as an office, so we really have no place for her to stay. And I told her that, but she only said that she would be fine in my eldest daughter's bedroom (6F) but I don't know if my daughter would like to spend a month with an adult in her room, she loves her space, also she sleeps with her dog and my friend doesn't like animals, so there's no way she can stay here.

And when I told her that she probably can't stay here she was offended because she thinks I'm being a terrible friend, that friends should support you all the time and that I'm not doing that. So I talked to my husband about this and told him that another option would be to move the baby into our room for a month so that my friend can stay in that room and he said that there is no way we would do that, because our baby could get used to that and then we couldn't get her to sleep in her room. So I told my friend that she can't stay with us, and now she ignores me when I text her, am I the asshole for not letting her stay here with us?",9.0

706,t3_rugjt3,AITA for selling a gift I got from my dad?,"A couple of weeks ago I moved from a house with a shared kitchen to a room with my own kitchen. There was an oven and microwave in the shared kitchen, but as they belong to the girl I lived with, I did not take them to my new room. I like to make food using an oven, so I had to get one for myself. My dad said he would get me a microwave with oven function. The oven function is the most important to me as I use it multiple times a week to prepare my dinner. I rarely use a microwave.

My dad bought a microwave/oven for me online. He would bring it with him the day he would help me move to my new room. Unfortunately, the microwave/oven did not arrive on time. My father lives 2 hours away from me, meaning that he could not just drop it off at my new place. The microwave/oven arrived a few days later. A month or so after I moved, I went to my dad’s house with my boyfriend for the weekend. We took the microwave/oven, still in the box, with us to my new room. He also gave me the invoice, so I could return it if it was broken.

As I did not have a lot of time, I opened the box a few days later and placed the microwave/oven on my kitchen counter and threw away the box. When I wanted to use the oven a few days later, I concluded that the thing he bought me was actually a microwave with a grill function, meaning I could not use it to make some of my favourite food, like pizza or lasagna.

When I texted this to my father, he said to just buy a small oven. The thing is, the microwave is taking up quite a lot of space in my small kitchen. An extra oven just would not really fit. Returning the microwave to the web shop was not an option, as I had already thrown the box away.

In my opinion, the best solution was to sell the microwave with grill function and use that money to buy a microwave with oven function. When I proposed this solution via text to my dad, he reacted very short but irritated. A bit passive aggressive.

I asked if he does not like me selling it, because it was a gift from him. The next day I sent him a question mark, because he had not yet responded to my message. He then texted that he indeed does not like it. I responded that I do not like it either, because it is a very nice microwave and that I felt kinda bad about it. I explained that I wanted a microwave with an oven function and that we both thought that was what he had given me. I added that I normally use an oven multiple times a week and that my kitchen has limited space and that I understand that he doesn’t like me selling it, because it was a gift. It is much more convenient to replace the microwave/grill. I put it up for sale a few days ago.

My brother has a 9 month old girl. The other day I was going to visit my parents and my brother was leaving (he lives there) to drop his daughter off at her other grandparents house. Hes always in a bad mood when he goes to drop offs because he’s  not technically supposed to see his daughters mother (*long* story, it’s the other grandparents rule) and is just supposed to keep all interaction strictly about his daughter and then go.

She introduced me to many of my university friends and helped me get student accommodation, I would consider her a friend although we don't see each other very often nowadays.  

I graduated 20 years ago and she still lives at the vacation spot and married and has 4 children, she is self employed and picks and chooses her work hours to work around her family responsibilities, she also has a lot of family nearby to help with her house/kids/childcare for work and date nights etc. She is an extrovert but has always struggled with confidence and always feels like people don't want to be her friend. It's unfortunate because this makes her needy and leads her to call out people who she believes are not being good friends to her which drives people away which reinforces her negative feelings about people not wanting to be her friend. This is all relevant to the issue here. 

I live in a big city, I'm married with 2 kids, I am employed at a demanding job, I do 50/60 hours a week, my life is very tightly scheduled, my family do not live close to me, I rely on paid childcare when I work and I don't get a lot of time for myself or for date nights. I am an introvert. My family is kind of well known and it would be of interest to some of the gossiping people in the vacation town that we would be visiting. 

This Christmas I travelled to my family vacation home for 3 days with my husband, kids and my extended family, we hadn't all been together for years. I had some much needed time off work and was looking forward to spending quality time with the kids, maybe getting family to babysit for a night so I could go on a date and maybe get an hour to sit and chill by myself. 

I text my university friends whatsapp group to say happy new year and mentioned that I was at the vacation home with family. I later heard from friends that Abby is upset and angry that I didn't visit her and that I don't always tell her that I am going to be in town... 

I'm a little upset that she spoke to our mutual friends about me but whatever it is not a big deal, my issue is that while I feel bad that she is upset, I don't feel the need to apologize to her for not visiting her every single time I go on vacation... I get to go to the vacation home like once or maybe twice a year if I am lucky, and sometimes I need this time for myself and my kids, other times I'll catch up with Abby if she is free. I also don't feel she can expect to be notified when I am in town, I feel like this is a small town mentality and is driven by her wanting to have the gossip, I don't understand why she would care to be informed if I am in town or not. 

Abby is always invited when I arrange university friend meet ups. I would never exclude someone. 

AITA for not making time for my friend every time I go on vacation and not actively notifying her every time I visit?",6.0
711,t3_rug9qr,AITA for blowing up during a NYE celebration?,"Im home from college for the holidays, living with my mom and her bf. Ive only known him a couple of weeks, and so far he seemed pretty nice. 

During NYE, we drank some wine after dinner and started talking. My moms BF (about a bottle and a half deep at this point) veered the subject to some uncomfortable topics, and then about my mother and I's relationship. My mom and I do not have the best relationship, she acted in some hurtful ways during her divorce with my dad resulting in me not speaking to her for some time. We have largely resolved this or else I would not be spending the holidays with her. However my mom's bf really started digging in, asking about what happened, doing some really shitty ""psychoanalysis"" on the nature of our relationship, and repeatedly insisting that we hug in front of him to make things right. My mom was sitting on his lap talking a bit, but he usually interrupted her and told her not to make it about her ego. It was very awkward for me, I felt cornered and I didnt know what to do. 

I also have an anxiety disorder. They both know this. I just barely managed to keep it together until I got to the couch (my bed) and started hyperventilating under the sheets. They checked up on me a couple of times but then went to bed. The next day I refused to get out from under the sheets to talk to them; my face was puffy from crying and my arms were covered in welts because I scratch myself when I panic. This was very embarrassing and I just wanted to be left alone. I heard my moms bf talking about how I was part of a spoiled generation and was too old to be doing stuff like this (Im 21), so I waited until they left the house, packed up all my stuff and rented an airbnb. 

AITA here? I felt like I could have handled this better, but I also feel like my moms bf was way out of line in his actions. Im not about to have a Hallmark Christmas moment in front of a guy I barely know, and during the conversation he was making a bunch of assumptions about the nature of my mom and Is relationship. It could also have been the wine, I only had a couple of glasses but I have a very low tolerance.",15.0
712,t3_rufw8y,AITA for waking up my boyfriend's grandmother in the middle of the night and making her drive an hour for a small medical emergency?,"Hi everyone, long time lurker and first time posted here. My (19F) boyfriend (19M) is a type 1 diabetic and has been since he was 12. We've been together for 11 months now. He lives 65 miles away with his grandparents. Because he lives so far away and doesn't work due to his disability, he spends over half his time with me in my apartment. He always brings LOTS of supplies for dealing with his diabetes, but this week he was running low and wasn't able to pack as much. This is where the problem began. 

Last night around midnight, my boyfriend's insulin pump got caught on a knob and ripped out of him. He only had one spare attachment, and it malfunctioned when we tried to put it on. Panicking, he called his grandmother, who said she would get dressed and meet us at a halfway point ASAP. It was storming really badly outside and I was worried about the long drive to his house and back (he can drive, but he doesn't have his driver's license due to circumstances outside of his control). We met, she helped him set up his pump and gave him extra supplies, we thanked her, and drove him. When we got home I texted her a long thank you message and apologized for bothering her so late. She said she understood that these things happen sometimes and she didn't mind. I thought that was the end of it. 

This morning when my boyfriend woke up, he saw that he'd received a text from his grandfather that waking up his wife in the middle of the night and asking her to meet him with his supplies was very rude and not to do it again. Like I said, I felt terrible that we had to bother her so late at night, but his blood sugar was already high and we couldn't wait until the morning to replace his pump attachment. Taking him to his house and spending the night wasn't an option because his grandparents don't allow me to spend the night over there for some reason (his grandmother has told me she adores me and thinks the world of me, so my guess is she's just old fashioned and doesn't want us banging in her house). I suppose we could have driven to his house, but then I would have had to drive all the way back, not arrive until 2am, in a major storm, alone or with him. Meeting halfway was her suggestion, not ours. 

I don't believe we are TA, but I want to get outside opinions to make sure. Are we the assholes?

EDIT: some people have said my boyfriend is using his diabetes as an excuse to get out of working. That's my fault for not giving more info, sorry. He has many health issues besides his diabetes and as a young man with no degree (he is currently in college), the only jobs available to him ATM are not ones he would be able to do with his health problems (which I won't get into for obvious reasons). Also, the reason his grandmother was able to bring supplies was because she got more after he came over. He's been here for a few days. In the past, he's ALWAYS brought way more supplies than he needs just in case, but this time he just didn't have enough. This is the only time we've ever had anything like this happen. He's very careful. Thanks for your feedback!",21.0
713,t3_rufp6o,AITA for refusing to move into a house if I’m not a co-owner,"I (27F) have been with Ben (29M) for 1.5 years. We agreed if we got married we’d have a prenup and keep our finances separate. He was clear from day one he would never want to combine them. 

Ben bought a 5 bedroom house. He lives with friends and calculates their rent by dividing the mortgage by the number of people living in the house. His mortgage is high in part because it’s a 15 year mortgage, he had a bad credit score, and his down payment was small. This also doesn’t give Ben any money to maintain the house. He uses credit cards and  payday loans for urgent house repairs. 

Ben doesn’t agree with my decision to prioritize my savings over paying off my subsidized student loans. Things he thinks I should stop doing until I’m debt free: 

* I contribute to a 401K to maximize an employer match benefit. 
* My checking and savings have 6 months of income. 
* I’m building an investment account I might eventually use to buy a house.

Ben has suggested I drain these accounts and use the money for debt repayment. He thinks I need to be more like him; at the end of the month all of his extra money goes towards debt.  He doesn’t seem to care about the amount of debt I have, just that it exists and I could be paying it off faster. I’m a database administrator, my debt to income ratio is low, and my credit score is excellent. 

Recently Ben has been saying it’s a waste of money for us to have two places and suggested I move in with him. We don’t stay at his house often because of his roommates. I don’t like his house and would rather keep my apartment. He argues the money I spend on rent is money we could be saving. I wouldn’t be saving money and I’d need to buy a car. The house is expensive for reasons I wouldn’t benefit from and it’s big. 

I don’t want to live with someone unless we are renting a place together or own a place together. I’m uncomfortable with him being the sole owner of the house we live in. He’d control how much we’d both have to spend on housing and what changes/upgrades are made. I want us to contribute equally and have an equal say in the decisions. 

He says we can’t rent a place together because paying rent is money down the drain. And we can never own a house together because we agreed to have separate finances. I thought separate finances meant we could eventually buy a house as long as we split the down payment and mortgage 50/50. He thinks owning a house together is combining finances. I said that’s fine, he can someday move into a house I own. He said that was ridiculous as I don’t know when I’ll be ready to buy a house. 

He said I have no valid reason for refusing to live in a house just because he owns it and this would force him to either go back to renting or combine finances with me. He especially doesn’t want to co-own a house with me because I’m irresponsible with debt.  

AITA for agreeing to separate finances and now being unwilling to live in a house I don't own?",10461.0
714,t3_rufi15,AITA for taking my notes back?,"I’m a twin (F and M) and we’re both in our last year of school. A lot of exams are coming up so I’ve been spending a lot of time in the library to make sure that I have all the necessary resources to revise. One of my subjects I share with my twin so in the past I’ve previously given him some of my notes for his to revise from - for a price. Not a lot of money but what I felt was fair for my hard work. My twin however spends most time playing video games so often doesn’t have the notes he needs to revise.

A few days ago we agreed that he would buy some notes from me for a set price - which he had negotiated down from. After I had printed them off he started looking at them to see if “they were worth it” but then 30 mins went by and he began criticising them and saying he wouldn’t buy them if there wasn’t important info on them. Eventually he took them to his room to fact check them. After around 20 mins he hadn’t sent me the money or given them back so I texted him to do one or the other. He randomly replied calling me a selfish person who only helps others when it benefits me…? (and a whole sleuth of other names) I thought I was doing a nice thing by letting him use my notes in the first place, all I wanted was something to compensate for the hours I spent making them. I didn’t think that was too much to ask for (it also wasn’t a lot of money for the amount of work). He then went on a rant about how real family don’t make each other pay for things and that I mustn’t love my family; also that I want to see my family fail (which I don’t, I just don’t think he’s deserving of having my notes).

Eventually I got my dad involved because he wasn’t giving them back but he came back empty handed and sent me the money himself, even though I don’t want or need it (dad said he would take it off him when he gets pocket money or something).

He kept onto the notes and after talks with my dad I decided to move on, but then I talked to my mum about it. She said I didn’t deserve to be treated this way, which I don’t. He‘s always been a negative person but I never thought he’d treat me like this - I suppose I don’t usually fight back so he’d thought he’d get away with it (unfortunately for him my new years resolution is to not let others take advantage of me). After speaking with her I decided to take them at the next opportunity - when he left the house I snuck into his room and took them (I know this will cause more arguments but at this point I don’t care).

My mum was onboard with it, my dad not so much. Whilst I wanted to take the high road and forget about it, it annoyed me that he could get a good grade from my work when he’s treated me like complete shit. AITA for taking them back? It’s going to cause more drama if I keep them so is it worth it?

edit: The agreement was that once my twin paid he could have the notes. Instead he took the notes to his room, refused to give them back so my dad tried to get them back for me (since he still hadn’t paid and was refusing to do so). When he wouldn’t give them back (at which point I didn’t care if he paid, I just wanted them to be destroyed and I said so) my dad paid me so that I wouldn’t be upset about the loss of money. The only reason I got paid by my dad and my brother kept the notes was because he refused to give them back (despite 30 mins of pleading). I hope that makes sense.

edit 2: i definitely was not clear enough with this post so here’s some more details. when my brother took the notes upstairs i expected him to bring them back so he could pay me and he did not. after we had been texting back and forth i asked him to just return or get rid of the notes (i said that he didn’t have to pay me anymore if he got rid of them) because i was becoming frustrated and didn’t want him to have them anymore. he didn’t get rid of them so my dad went to get them and when he didn’t he just transferred the money, without telling me about it, and when i offered to return it he told me to keep it (i’m going to send it back anyways it was only £12). i didn’t want anyone to pay at that point and i made it very clear but my dad did regardless because he didn’t want there to be an argument but it’s obviously escalated.",22.0

716,t3_ruf2j4,AITA for encouraging my son to rethink starting a life with his (possibly) schizophrenic fiancé?,"I am a mom(51) of 4 and my oldest(32) has been with his fiancé(28 female) for 4 years now. From the very beginning I liked her, and she has always been lovely to me and the rest of the family, but I will say she seemed mysterious. For one she never mentioned family, ever, and when we would ask about her parents or siblings she would say something vague and change the subject. My husband(60) and I didn't think much of this at first because we thought she was shy, but throughout the years it didn't change even as she got closer to us.

I also found it strange that it took my son so long to propose since I knew just how clearly smitten he was with her. They were both in good financial places in their lives, careers, and of course with the pandemic going on it was understandable but we still wondered. 

3 months ago he proposed a little after her birthday and now they are planning to get married, but recently my daughter(29) has told me some things that I and my husband have found concerning. My son's fiance had mentioned to his sister that they have serious mental health problems that run in their family, specifically schizophrenia. For years my sons finace was worried she might even have it because she was still young and her other sibling and parent are diagnosed with it. That's why my son waited so long to propose because she made him, because she wanted to feel more sure she didn't have it, but she also told my daughter that there is a possibility she could still be diagnosed later on and that she will never be completely ""in the clear.""

This concerned me for many reasons, but mostly because I know my son, and I know how much he wants children. How would this affect them having children? Could it pass along to them? I called my son and talked to him about it, and of course he was upset with his sister for telling me, but at this point this was a family matter. We discussed what was said, and my son said that he and his f would not be having children. 

I asked if this was what he wanted, and he said that he yes he did want children, he would still pick a life with her rather than finding someone else and starting a family. While I understood my son's feelings, I couldn't help but worry about him regretting this decision later. It is a huge decision and not something to give up on easily. Plus, I think it's important couples share the same ideals( both want children, both don't want children.) 

I discussed the matter with my husband and the rest of his siblings and we all agreed my son would most likely come to regret this in the future, and while we all love his fiance, schizophrenia is a serious mental illness and it could ruin both her and my son's lives and careers if she is diagnosed. My son has told me to ""stop meddling"" but how can I? I am his mother and I love him more than this world. I don't want him to make a mistake.",479.0

i (17F) am a lesbian and live in the bible belt. i came out to my unaccepting mom (37F) and stepdad (39M), and my accepting stepmom (35F) and dad (39M) at 15.

my mom called me derogatory things and had special rules for me (basically grounded for being gay). she allowed my stepdad and her MIL to bash me as well. it felt unfair that i was treated different from my siblings, and it caused a huge rift between us. she outed me to my aunt who told me i’m going to hell, and insisted i talk to a “fixed” former lesbian at her church.

in 2020, i moved in with my dad full time. this opened her eyes, and she’s been trying to be more accepting and mend our relationship. i was excited, and i’m in the process of moving back in part time. she has met my long term gf, J (16F) and tries to have a nice relationship with her.

i went to J’s house and my usual ride couldn’t get me, so my grandmother picked me up and i was to stay the night. my sister (19F) lives with her, and texts me that my mom told my grandmother that J is my girlfriend. my grandparents are VERY religious, and if my grandfather knew, i would be disowned. i texted my mom, and for transparency here’s the exchange:

me: please don’t tell mamaw stuff without asking me first, that’s my decision and makes me VERY uncomfortable. it crosses a very big boundary and that has seriously hurt me.

mom: What’s that? I haven’t talked to her

me: you told mamaw J is my girlfriend

mom: She asked where you went and I told her… so they have to get use to it. I’m not ashamed to tell her that

me: okay but mom that’s my choice to make and i wasn’t ready to tell her that

mom: She already knew… I told her before who J was when stepdad brought her over… she act like she didn’t know but she knew unless she forgot. But it wasn’t out of intent of causing any issues… did she say something to you? Because I’ll tell her to keep her opinion to herself. She knew along time ago… 

me: no, but it really bothers me that you told her. that’s something i should get to do

mom: Well sorry I didn’t know it was a secret… if I had a bad intent behind it then I could understand you being upset about it but it wasn’t. It’s okay you pointed it out that it hurt your feelings but don’t be upset over it. 

me: i know you had good intentions, but that’s my choice and it really bothers me you took that away. it’s not a secret, but it’s a conversation that i would’ve preferred to have with her 

she called my dad who berated me for ten minutes over the phone. he said i need to “pick one, in or out” and that it’s proof she’s come a long way. i explain that i know she meant well, but for my safety it made me upset and to just let me know next time. i then called my mom and explained that to her.

The other day my mom mentioned that they wanted me to draw them some plans of a garage for our camping car. I said that no problem and that we'd talk more about it later. Then today, my parents started to explain to me how they wanted it to be. After a minute or two of conversation I told them **""I don't really understand where you want the garage to be, can you draw it real quick for me?""** my mom said **""Sure""** she grabbed a paper and started drawing shapes and explaining **""So here is the entrance to the main gate..., and here is the fence with the well...""** then I said **""What well?""** because I wasn't aware that we had a well. My mom said **""You don't know where it is?""** to which I answered **""No""** and when my mother started explaining I saw my father laughing at me, at first I didn't understand and then I realized he was making fun of me for not knowing where it is. I felt a little offended by this, because he is one of those persons who can make fun of everyone, but no one can make fun of them. At that point, I felt horrible and tired of his constant lack of respect especially towards me. Because I know he was just laughing, but it wasn't a one time thing, he always makes fun of me for every single thing I do. So I guess it was the drop that spilled the glass, and I left. I went to the kitchen and started preparing me a snack. Then my mom told me to come back and said **""What the fuck is wrong with you?""** to which i responded **""I'm sorry but I'm not going to stand here while he makes fun of me when I'm just trying to help you""** She told me that my father wasn't making fun of me and then i said **""Yes he was, he was laughing at me""** to which he answered **""Don't lie, I didn't do such thing""** then he proceeded to call me a liar ,that I probably didn't want to draw the blue prints and that I was just starting drama because of that. I saw this as clear gaslighting and I finally said **""You know what? I don't want to argue anymore, so just admit that you were laughing and then we can move on and I can help you.""** He said that he wasn't going to do that so i said **""Then I'm sorry but I'm not going to help you, I'm not going to let you get mad just because I didn't let you disrespect me.""** and I left. As I was going to my room my mom said **""Than don't you dare ask anything of me, you know, with christmas coming up and all.""**

I truly don't know what to do. I don't know if i overreacted and should go downstairs and apologize, or if I did the right thing. I don't care that she insinuated that I wasn't getting any gifts for christmas, couldn't care less. I'm starting to think that maybe I was too sensitive. But I'm tired of not being appreciated for anything that I do and feeling like I'm never enough.

720,t3_rueyaw,AITA for refusing to pay 1/2 the vet bill for a dog I ran over?,"On NYE, I was doing food deliveries for a restaurant I work at. The way the parking lot is set up, it’s a one way road with the parking lot on the left and there’s and apartment building to the right of the parking lot. 

As, I was pulling in I put my turn signal on and pull into the driveway when I heard the yelp of an animal. I stopped and got out to check what it was. I saw an older woman, probably in her 50s and a limping dog. It didn’t register at first whether I had hit the dog or not because it was walking around and the woman was just standing there and didn’t say a word to me. I thought the dog had just been barking at me at first until I asked the woman if I had hit the dog. She told me that I did and panic set into myself. It is important to note here that the dog was NOT on a leash and did not have a so much as a collar on. The woman next to the building throwing her trash out and had left the dog unsupervised on the sidewalk. The woman went and got what I presume is her daughter, the real owner of the dog. 

For the next 5 minutes the daughter and her boyfriend came down to see what was going on while I told them that they needed to go to the vet to check out the dog. When they lifted the poor thing I could se a clear tear by the dogs leg in which I stepped out of the entrance of their building because I started to cry looking at that. I’m a huge animal lover and the fact that I caused that pain to an animal was a lot for me. They finally got the dog into the car and I gave the boyfriend my phone number and said my first name.

I knew I wasn’t at fault due to the fact that the dog wasn’t on a leash. Which, I’m sure in many states, is a law required for pet owners when their dog is in a public area. 

The boyfriend then texts me asking for my info. Although I feel really bad about running over their dog, I know I’m not at fault due to the negligence of the owners and I know, had the dog been on a leash or supervised, this wouldn’t have happened. I told him due to NYS law I was not responsible and would not pay for any of the vet bill. He proceeds to tell me that the bill was $1500 and I was to pay half of it. He said that he understands that it’s the law but told me to “have some heart” and pay half. Im a dog and cat owner myself, so I am aware of these laws. He then sent me pictures of his dogs back legs and said “This is what u did to my dog. Please help us out financially. We can work something out. If not I will be taking legal action.” It is also important to note that during this I received 5 calls from a different number in the same area and 2 from an unblocked number. I ended up blocking these and had to put my phone on DND. So AITA?

INFO: I drive an early 2000s pick up truck and the dog was no larger than the size of a Yorkie, I’m unsure the specific breed. The dog survived thankfully and seems like the back legs were mostly affected.",20.0

My husband likes to cook when we're on the Road. I'm thankfull, and always offer help or to take over (which he Often declines). 

Very Often, when we had a day of activity and we get to our logee, I enjoy having a snack before dinner. My husband is the same. But he prefers to have it once the dinner is already cooking. I don't. If it was up to me, we just would have a snack before starting to cook dinner, that way it's together 

He wants me to wait with eating something untill he has everything cooking otherwise he feels rushed. 
I totally get that and having a snack together is Nice. 
But sometimes I am veery hungry and I just want to quickly eat something small, but my husband always gets very mad and wants me to wait. So i just can't eat anything because he prefers snacking together after he put on the food.

I Mean,I'm happy that he cooks and I Often wait for him to have a little pre dunner snack together. But sometimes you are just hungry after a long day and I hate not being 'allowed' to eat before him.

My wife however felt that it is our duty as parents to teach her to be kind to all animals. I eventually relented on the condition that she'd not force our daughter to eat any vegan item and would let her eat anything she wanted at a any point of time if she wanted to. My wife had agreed to it and we have been trying to get our daughter to eat vegan since then. We have been cooking different kinds of dishes so that she'd be more willing to try vegan food. 

Today, while I and my daughter were walking home from the park, she saw an ice cream shop and said that she wanted to eat a particular ice cream. I offered to make it for her at home but she insisted on having that specific ice cream and looked like she was about to cry so I got her the ice cream. 

When we came home, she told her mom that she just had her favorite ice cream. My wife got mad at me and said that I am undermining her parenting by letting our daughter do what she wants. I reminded her of the condition that I had placed(our daughter will not be forced to do anything she doesn't want) however my wife started saying that I should've tried harder to distract our daughter from the ice cream and not just relented. 

She is now saying that I am not allowed to buy or cook food for our daughter for which I said that she has no rights to tell me what to do. She started to cry and said that I'm being disrespectful to her by not listening to her.

My f29 BIL m34 lost his wife a month ago. I have to say I have never been close to my husband's family in general because of past disagreements and I was intially somewhat tolerant of my BIL because I sympathized with his circumstances.

The reason I'm bothered by having him stay with us is lack of privacy and the fact he took extra space by bringing his wife's stuff with him as well (he could've sent it to his inlaws) also the overall vibe his presence brings, I mean he's obviously grieving but literally all he talks about is his wife.


I talked to my husband about him finding his own space but my husband insisted that we have more patience and be more supportive since his brother is heavily greiving right now and it's expected that he needs time and we as family should help which is fine by me but my last straw was yesterday, my husband came into the room to tell me his brother was crying in the other room and asked if I could make him something soothing to drink and that's when I blew up and told him no I won't because I didn't agree on being on his brother beck and call. He said his brother is grieving and I should show some respect but I told him he's brother is a moocher at this point and he was encouraging his laziness. My husband immediately left the room then came back and yelled at me saying his brother just heard every nasty word I said about him including ""moocher"". He started arguing with me about how heartless and selfish I was to talk like that about his brother and hurt him during his grief then walked out.

He's expecting me to apologize though he may not understand that I said what I said out of frustration. Still he says I messed up and I need to apologize.",1404.0
724,t3_ruem0o,AITA for insisting my roommate move his car late at night?,"I rent a three bedroom house (side-by-side) with 2 other guys. The house includes two parking spots in the back. Because of a large employer nearby, street parking is restricted to two hours during the day. This has generally not been an issue, as until recently, we've never owned more than two cars between the three of us. Since there are only two cars, the parking spots are not assigned but are on a casual, first-come, first-server basis (one is under an apple tree which is unfortuante when its dropping apples). For a small fee, $40 or so, residents of the area can purchase a car pass which will allow them to park on the street during the day despite this restriction; a common practice throughout our city.

One of the my roommates moved out, and existing roommate and I invited a mutual friend to move out of his parent's place and in with us. He did not own a car at this time. There were some unfortunate tensions with New Guy, as there are often are with new roommates, like my having to explain to him why he couldn't blend a smoothie in an incredibly noisy blender at 1am when my bedroom is directly over the kitchen. But we're all friends so we're able to work things out.

One day, New Guy informs us his parents will be gifting him their old car at some point in the future. Nice! Congrats, New Guy! But what to do about parking?

Me: New Guy, your workplace is literally 2 blocks from the parking office, think you can swing by over a lunch break and pick up a parking pass? We can split the cost between us all.

New Guy: Sure! I can do that.

Well, a couple of weeks go by, and he's not gotten the parking pass, despite a few gentle reminders that it needs to be done. No harm, no foul as he's not taken possession of his car yet, and doesn't think that's going to happen for a little bit.

One night, fairly late (we're all night owls) I come home to find both parking spots behind our house filled. New Guy has taken possession of his car (unexpectedly, he insists) and parked it behind the house.

I am not impressed. My options are either park my car on the street, and make sure I'm up early enough to move it (I don't work the next day), or park it several blocks away.

Well, I park my car temporarily and come into the house, to catch New Guy about to get ready for bed, as he works the next day. We have some words, but everyone stays calm, which culminates in my insisting he move his car before he goes to bed, especially since he works the next day and would be moving his car anyway, and he was supposed to get a pass and never did. He refuses, not seeing why I can't just park a few blocks away. I insist. He refuses. This goes on for longer than I'd care to admit, but eventually he relents in the face of my quiet rage.

So. AITA for forcing my roommate to go out late at night and move his car, rather than parking a few blocks away and walking home?

ETA: It is worth noting that in our situation, there is little reason to prefer parking in the back ('reserved') rather than on the street. Parking directly in front of our house is always available. Minor disadvantages are balanced by minor advantages (eg better lit).",14.0

726,t3_ruefg0,AITA for refusing to thank my husbands cousin?,"4 years ago my husbands grandma passed away. I made a post on FB about her passing &amp; made a comment stating “don’t worry about your favorite grandson, I’ll take good care of him for you” this was part of an inside joke as his grandmother always stated that a close family friend was her favorite &amp; not my husband. I also made this statement completely forgetting about his ACTUAL cousin since I had only met him once before &amp; he was rarely spoken of. They were very low contact.

The sister saw my post &amp; texted my MIL saying “she’s got a lot to say for a fat slob” (I may be fat but I am NOT a slob) &amp; then talked shit about me during the whole funeral to their friends &amp; family. I kept my mouth shut &amp; did apologize explaining it wasn’t my intentions to upset them &amp; it was an ill timed joke.

Time passed &amp; things calmed down, they even came to our wedding. That’s until their father passed away unexpectedly. I didn’t say anything on FB (plus at this time they were blocked). On the way to the wake my MIL told me that the female cousin requested I do not speak to her, she claimed I made a nasty comment about her father on FB. I had no idea what the hell she was talking about but for the sake of everyone’s sanity I kept my distance. 

We got through it &amp; I decided to go no contact from them. The cousins proceeded to make my MILs life a living hell after because she was helping him with his finances before he passed &amp; his ex-wife went as far as to blame my MIL for his death

Last year I got pregnant, I told my MIL that I didn’t want them to know but it slipped &amp; they found out. 

The female cousin sent us a couple of gifts equaling about $25 &amp; a note about how elephants reminded her of grandma. No apology or anything so I returned the gifts bc I want nothing to do with them. 

My MIL asked if we sent a “thank you” &amp; I told her no as I didn’t think it was needed. It was a half-assed attempt at a peace offering &amp; she wasn’t deserving of our thanks after the way she’s treated me.",13.0
727,t3_rued65,AITA for refusing to accommodate my Out of Town family for a week after my wedding and postpone my honeymoon?,"My sisters (I have 3 who I asked to be my bridesmaids) and my MOH (close friend who recently started dating my eldest sister) were adamant that I was being inconsiderate of my entire side of the family for not postponing my honeymoon for at least 6 days to entertain and be with my family while they were still in town. The frustrating part is that husband and I tried to push out flight to Hawaii a few days to accommodate them and were foiled when we HAD to go and do our preflight PCR test (flying internationally) in a different city. Our wedding was on a Saturday and our flight was booked for Tuesday. We ended up HAVING to leave Sunday day by 5 to make it for the small window we needed to have a negative test before boarding. 

To top it off I am/was pregnant, 16 weeks along at the time, did not want to postpone any further because we didn't have more available vacation time, I didn't want to be further along and likely more uncomfortable. We had communicated that our intent was to leave shortly after the wedding to my sisters and both of my parents (who are separated and both live out of town) - they still chose to stay in town for a week (or 2 in the case of my mom) and the only person to see after them was my eldest sister. She was concerned about being with both parents and around her girlfriend/my MOH when she had recently come out to my mother who is highly religious and has expressed some homophobic opinions. This sister, my eldest sister, would not hear no for an answer when we first started discussing our plans for when to leave for honeymoon and tried to convince me to change my mind, despite hearing several reasons why we were not considering postponing. As a result, we chose to leave her out of the discussion altogether and go forward with our plans. She talked behind our backs and spread throughout my family that I was an inconsiderate bridezilla. Enough so that I had another sister blast me for being inconsiderate of her sacrifices to be at the wedding, and my father felt the need to tell me that the whole commentary wad not coming from him and he hoped I would enjoy my honeymoon. Everyone on my side of the family, including my dad chose not to gift us anything (we asked for financial gifts only) and stated that their travel costs were gift enough. 

We paid for our entire wedding. I made my wedding dress and my eldest sister's bridesmaid dress. Our wedding happened to be at a perfect time when restrictions were lightest and everyone got to have a beautiful time. We announced our pregnancy and had a gender reveal at the wedding. I drove my MOH and sister home at 3am. We had brunch with my side of the family the next day. We had to clean the venue before leaving to get our PCR tests... During which my eldest sister blew her lid and screamed at me, chasing my down the drive of the venue (I slammed a door in her face and walked away) for asking for help getting our cake cut and put in our freezer while we were away.  

There is So much more to this story... And I have been ruminating on it for so long I am exhausted. I haven't spoken with my eldest sister since the wedding, and thus my MOH as well. I am due any day and I still feel like welcoming them back into my life would just welcome their gaslighting abuse and manipulation.

728,t3_ruecgn,WIBTA if I didn't invite one of my friends to play on my server?,"So I (22F) have created a private server for an online game that I really enjoy. I want to get some people together to play with, but I'm torn when it comes to a particular friend of mine.

The friend in question (23M), who for the sake of anonymity I'll call Ron, is a really fun guy. He's creative and funny, and I genuinely like to be around him and listen to his ideas. The thing is, I don't like to play multiplayer games with him. He gets way too serious and competitive. He'll stop the whole game so we can carefully read the exact wording of the rules, he takes forever to make his plays, and he questions everyone else on all of their actions when we play together. No one wants to confront him about it because he does have good intentions. He just drags the game out and makes it less fun for everyone else.

So back to my server- I know he plays the game and has expressed interest in being part of a private server before. However, if he plays online the same way he plays any other game I've played with him, it's going to ruin the experience for everyone. He doesn't know about the server and if I decide not to invite him I'm not going to talk about the server to him or in the group chat we have with mutual friends. I just feel bad for not inviting him to join when I know he would want to.

Is it okay to exclude him here? Or am I just being an insensitive asshole?",5.0
729,t3_rue8uz,AITA for not inviting my college friend to my wedding?,"Hi. I’m (F) currently planning for my wedding that’s about to happen sometime this year. I’m contemplating about my guests list since I want those who attended are the ones who matter the most to me and my fiancé.

Background: My college friend (let’s call her A) used to be close to me in the beginning of the college until another friend (let’s call her B), got close to us but at the same time she was badmouthing me so our friendship got a bit complicated. A bit after our graduation, we had a friendship break up because our other friend who became my close friend (let’s call her C) confronted them about how they always badmouthing me and then I didn’t talk to them until last year.

Last year we got news that A was getting married and long story short, me and C along with our partners met up with her and the fiancé (at that time). So she told us that she decided her bridesmaids were gonna be B, her high school friends and two of her cousins. But one of the cousins apparently couldn’t be the bridesmaid because she had some college stuff going on and would be impossible to attend the wedding. So after some time, A reached me and asked me to be her bridesmaid. So I said yes, considering we were close in the beginning of college and we knew each other from there. Then I became one of the bridesmaids and I thought we were starting to sorta mend the friendship (not getting back to best friend phase but still close, I guess?).

Now why I’m considering to just invite her for the online wedding (we are planning to have livestream due to pandemic travel restrictions) is because: 1. My fiancé proposed to me a day after her wedding because it was our anniversary date and then when everyone congratulated me (even B), she said, “LOL your boyfriend is so random” (?) Idk how proposing is a random stuff to do. 2. She showed no intention of being close anymore. 3. I have a bad feeling that she was gonna ask us to pay for her and her husband’s accommodations during our wedding (our wedding is out of town), because we planned to only accommodate our family members and not friends.

I initially wanted to include her and her husband in the guests list because they invited us to their wedding last month. But seeing the circumstances right now, I think I might need to think again.

So am I gonna be the asshole if I’m gonna be excluding her from my guests list?

730,t3_rue7v0,WIBTA for calling out my gf's mom on her mean comments?,"People involved:

Me=""James"" (26M)

GF=""Emily"" (32F)

Gf's Mom=""Sarah"" (68F)

My gf's mom is so mean to my gf.  Think Monica's mom in Friends and you'll get a good idea of what she is like.  She picks at everything about my gf, from her appearance to her personality.  Emily usually just kind of takes it to keep the peace because they are around each other so much.  They live within very short walking distance of each other.  I don't witness the stuff Sarah says, (she's super nice in front of other people), but Emily tells me about it and it just really pisses me off.  

What makes it even worse is that Sarah apparently sometimes ropes me into her comments.  For example, Emily got pretty drunk at the NYE party we went to (honestly everyone did, the only reason I didn't was because I was DD).  And yes, everyone is vaxxed and there were only 6 people there.  Emily told me that when she saw her mom the next day, Sarah told her that her eyes looked terrible, then asked if that was the most drunk that I had ever seen her.  When Emily said yes, Sarah asked if I was ok with that, and then ""joked"" that I may want to stop seeing Emily because of it.  There have been other times where Sarah has commented on Emily's weight and said that she doesn't want Emily to lose me over it.  Now, Emily does apparently stand up for me when Sarah says these things (saying stuff like, ""James isn't like that, he loves me regardless), but I'm still very offended by them.  Sarah has said that she really likes me, so I don't understand why she would have this negative opinion of me.  

I love my gf very much and honestly wouldn't care how much she weighs or what she looks like.  Actually, I think she is 100x better looking than me anyway and she has the best personality of anyone I've ever met, so I feel very lucky that Emily wants to be with me.  I'm just so tired of Sarah digging at my gf.  What makes it even worse, is if Emily says anything back, Sarah gets upset and says things like, ""you are so mean to me!""  Emily has told me to just let it go, because she says she knows saying something won't make a difference, and she's moving in with me in the spring anyway, and then we'll be about 45 minutes away from her mom and the distance will make it better.  But I don't know if I can wait that long without saying anything.  So WIBTA if I confronted her?",6.0
731,t3_rue5pd,WIBTA if I don't go to my friends wedding where I'm a bridesmaid ?,"(english is not my mothertongue, sorry) 

I(F28) told my friend(F30) I'll be her bridesmaid for her wedding. When she asked me, I was pretty enjoyed but the thing is I don't feel it anymore. I know her since school (19 years friendship), I do like her but we always have a reltionship with some disturbing aspects. Since few months it's been worth. Everytime I see her or her fiance(M32) who's a friend too, I left them with mixted feelings, our friendship moments are exhausted to me and I can't say why as I don't feel that with other people. Even when I don't see her I can't stop to think of some stuff she said.
For exemples, she had some ""funny"" but bad words about my flat in front of people. The thing is I'm paying it by myself so, yes, it's cheaper than what I could afford if I was living with my boyfriend(M28). But I like to live alone for now and he's living with a childhood friend, so it's ok for both of us. This flat is more than great to me and I love my independence. 
Another thing that shocked me was that time she told me that if I was pregnant, she knows I would want an abortion. I don't want to create a debate about abortion here, but I do thing that's not something normal to say to a friend (or anyone...).
The last time I saw her, she also told me that I should pay the most part of our restaurant bills as I have a job that pays more than hers. It's ok to me to pay more but I do think people don't have to ask to be invited like that.
These things and few others (like the fact that they're ok to ask my help for their moving house but did'nt wish me Christmas - I did'nt either as I forget because I was taking care of my ill grandfather the all weekend so the fault is ours, not only their) make me ask if I should go to their wedding or just avoid it, as I just really don't feel it... But with no real reason, just bad feelings.
I will be alone at this wedding as she doesn't want to invit people she doesn't know (and that's completly understandable, it cost a lot to invit people so I don't want to ask her to pay for my boyfriend as I did'nt introduce him, and I don't want to because she had some pretty bad behaviours with my exs).
I know I have an abusive family, which makes me defensive most of the time and I'm working on it. So maybe that reaction is just my way to protect myself from *I don't know what* and I should just go talk to a therapist and go to that wedding. Or maybe my feelings are right and I should stay away from her and stay with people who don't make me feel that way (which is what most of people I talked about that situation told me to, but most of them don't know her). But it's pretty sad to do that to someone I know for years now. 
So, would I be an asshole if I just avoid that wedding even if they count on me ?",4.0

Once I finished in the bathroom, I had to go and get firewood. My bro (12) had a flashlight because it was dark, and I asked him to shine it at the ground so I could see without tripping.

I got married 2.5 years ago to a wonderful man who came into our lives while I was already 16 weeks pregnant with my second child (long story lol).
Anyway he took onto the papa (the kids call their own dad, dad) role immediately.  He loves them like his own (11m) and takes care of all of us.
A few months ago, my mom and I got into a fight while we were over for dinner (not unusual).  My husband over heard my mom insulting me and told the boys to leave and go to the van for us to leave.  As they were headed to go say bye to my mom she made a rather derogatory comment about my husband infront of the kids.  He got mad and they left without saying bye.
She has called him psycho and a bunch of other nasty things since then.  I tried to maintain the peace but she explicitly said that he is not allowed on her property until he apologized to her.  I wasn't going to let that happen because he did nothing wrong in my opinion. 
Flash forward to Thanksgiving- she called to invite us for dinner - I reminded her of her statement and she again said all he needed to do was apologize.  I told her it wasn't going to happen and then she got mad at me this time.  I Haven't spoken to her since telling her that if she wants to maintain a relationship with me or the kids she would need to apologize to me AND my husband.
At Christmas she again reached out to invite us for dinner.  I reminded her of the condition and invited her to my sons bday party if she did.
She sent another nasty text again insulting my husband, calling him psycho and multiple personality, anger problems and such.
I ignored it and moved on

Flash forward to this morning.  She sent me a text saying that she was going to take me to court to have access to the kids.
The text itself was incredibly long and very dismissive of everything that was spoken about before - she refuses to acknowledge that she's done anything wrong.
She stated quite clearly and verbatim ""I'd rather see you go bankrupt so that I can see my grandkids""

She has always been a very mean person, I grew up with it so I got used to it.  Very manipulative and ""conditional"" in her wanting anything.  Giving me money to use against me later if anything she does I call her on for being rude or mean.
I'm keeping the kids from her because I'm afraid that she will bad mouth my husband to him, because she did it throughout my childhood for my bio dad and then my step dad when she left him and the comment she made during the initial fight.
Given the current situation I'm second guessing myself on if I'm in the right to keep the kids from her.

734,t3_rue0cg,AITA for buying a car when I am planning to buy a house with a friend?,"My friend (22F) and I (21F) have talked about buying a small place together for about a year now. There were a couple concerns such as, what are we going to do about the mortgage and down payment, what’s going to happen when either of us get married, etc. Also, not to mention, we’re still full-time students with only part time jobs. 

Hypothetically, if we were to get a place together, the majority of the down payment would be from my savings. Currently, I have two part-time jobs that pay very well and since I am still living at home, most of my paycheck goes into my savings. The same goes for my friend except she is working a minimum wage job that she doesn’t put as many hours in. Another thing is that after loosing her scholarship, she has been paying for her tuition and with her small paychecks, nothing is really getting saved. However, this isn’t really much of a problem for her since she comes from a upper middle class family and is only paying her tuition herself because she doesn’t want to tell her parents that she lost her scholarship. I’ve offered her job opportunities at my two better paying jobs but she really likes her job so that’s fine.

Personally, I don’t see us getting a place for a while with our financial situation and I’m also planning on going to veterinary school so my savings are for my future tuition. However, I got in a really bad car accident and had to buy a new car for myself since my parents don’t have the financial means to buy me another car. With COVID, the prices of new and used cars were only slightly different and I chose to get a newer car. 

However, since then, my friend has been making comments such as “how could you get a new car? How are we going to get our own place if you keep spending your money like this?” She’s even went behind my back to talk to other friends about how I am careless with my money. Our friends are split 50/50 with one side agreeing that it’s my hard-earned money and I should be able to spend it how I want and the other side saying that if I was planning on getting a place with my friend, that I should’ve consulted her and tried to get a cheaper car.

It's complicated because they aren't always outwardly horrible, and just a bunch of horrible sh\*t that happened throughout my childhood. We are low contact at the moment because I am really close with my other family members and my parents are very much still integrated into the mix so it's easier not the cause drama for everyone involved BUT in a month my wife(26) and I are moving 5 whole states away and not looking back, and we will be officially going NC with my parents then. I don't want to tell them beforehand because my mother(a narcissist) will definitely cause a fuss and it's so much harder for her if we're hundreds of miles away.

So, that being said, my parents still suck while we're here. Recently, my wife had to be committed due to her mental health. It was an extremely hard time for us, but especially her. She is diagnosed with BPD because of her own f-ed up family sh\*t(she is already NC with her entire family) and while she was there she was also diagnosed to be on the autism spectrum. It was a lot for her all at once. Only very few family members of mine knew exactly what was going on, and most everyone just knew a very small jist. My wife was in for 2 weeks, and now she's been out for another 2 and is doing much much better.

But a couple days ago my parents called and asked me to come over, just me. I went and when I got there they sat me down on the couch to have some sort of ""intervention"" about my marriage. Somehow they found out and they were ""appalled"" by my wifes ""lack of mental stability"" and they also thought I should seriously consider divorce because my wife is autistic. It was appalling and cruel and I left without hearing the rest. I told them off, but probably not as much as I should have, or as much as I wanted to, because we are leaving soon, and my parents really do know how to completely ruin everything for everyone. I did plan to call and tell them off once we moved away though. (I know this is cowardly, but there's really no way to get into how manipulative and horrible they can be in under 3,000 characters)

When I got home my wife could tell I was visibly upset, and I ended up venting to her about it after she pressed. My wife was PISSED and also extremely distraught. She wanted to call my parents and curse them out, but I asked her not to and explained it would be better to wait. It took her a while to calm down(her bpd makes it hard for her to be non-confrontational sometimes). When she did calm down she was still really mad at me, and told me I shouldn't have told what my parents said about her if she wasn't allowed to call them out. I did feel bad for telling her, because I honestly didn't think about it in the moment.

I floor the gas pedal, he overtakes me, I go full throttle to overtake him again, he goes full throttle to prevent that and we end up going  90 km/h (55 mph). He didn’t let me overtake and I had no power…

3. In a road where the speed limit is 70 km/h (43 mph), I am going 80 km/h (50 mph). A Passat is trying to overtake me. Me, having my mother’s Golf (140 ps), floored the gas pedal once again reaching 130 km/h (80 mph). He still somehow overtook.

1-2 other times I was able to prevent the overtake.

738,t3_rudubi,UPDATE: AITA for eating at my boyfriends families Christmas dinner?,"Previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rq8gz1/aita\_for\_eating\_at\_my\_boyfriends\_families/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rq8gz1/aita_for_eating_at_my_boyfriends_families/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I've gotten a lot of dms asking for an update, so I thought I would give one.

I first want to say thank you to all the comments and support I've received, they helped a lot! One suggestion I kept getting was that my boyfriend could be lying about his mother saying I was embarrassing or what not. Someone even suggested me texting his mother and apologizing for the way I ate. I ended up taking that advice for two reasons to figure out if my boyfriend was lying and to genuinely apologize.

His mother replied almost immediately telling me there was nothing to apologize for and she was absolutely delighted to know that I enjoyed the food. I didn't want to bring his mother in the drama so I kept the convo between us short and screenshot the messages to send my boyfriend.

I confronted him saying that his mother didn’t seem to be mad that I ate a lot at her place. We argued back and forth about it until he asked me to come over to his place. Ever since our fight I haven't seen him in person.

I arrive at his place and he seemed to calm down a lot from when we were on call. And then he explained the whole situation on why he blew up.

Apparently his parents are not doing well financially at the moment and he knew that the leftovers of that Christmas dinner would be there leftovers for the past couple of days. He said it just angered him that I ate more than usual just because of the situation of his parents . I then told him I understood but that gave him not right to call me fat, which he apologized for saying that the word he was referring to was greedy and not fat. He then apologized saying that even calling me greedy wasn't right, because I wasn't being greedy intentionally

I asked him why he didn't tell me beforehand of his parents situation and he said that he didn't think of it as an issue since I usually eat really small portions (which is true). He then explained that his mother was truly happy that I ate the way I did, because his siblings and him tend to eat little of her food just because of her situation.

I felt guilty afterwards and he said I shouldn't have been because I didn't know and he was sorry for not clearing everything up earlier. He also explained that his parents didn't want anyone to know of their struggles, which is also why he avoided telling me from the get go to respect their wishes.

I know this is against all of the advice I've received of leaving my boyfriend, but I've decided not to and to take things slow and easy. I'm sorry if this isn't the revenge update many of you guys wanted, but ultimately I think everything turned out perfect.",3723.0
739,t3_rudk0e,AITA for not wanting to wear a wig for my brother’s wedding?,"I (31F) dye my hair bright, vibrant colors all the time. 
My brother is getting married in May 2022. I am not a bridesmaid or involved with the wedding at all. I am just an attendee. I will be in the family photos. 
I told his fiancée that I wanted to have a holographic, pastel colored hair (look up holographic, pearl, or opal hair color) for the wedding. Because I figured that would be a bit more subtle than what I normally do. 
The fiancée said I can have whatever hair color I want for the wedding and reception. But I must wear a natural hair color for the photos. Which means I have to wear a wig. Mind you, I am a bridesmaid in my best friend’s wedding in April 2022 and I was told I can do whatever I want with my hair and the best friend totally loves the holographic color. So I honestly don’t want to have to go back to my natural blonde hair for the brother’s wedding, just for 5-10 photos. 
I was pretty upset about it because I’m not sure why she can dictate what my hair looks like when I’m not in the wedding. 
Before this conversation, my brother already said I could have bright colored hair, but then didn’t stick up for me when his fiancée said I had to wear a wig.

740,t3_rudil6,WIBTA if I tell my dad how I feel?," paraphrasing from a veeery long message i sent to some friends

i (f15) have autism. and i hate loud noises unless it was made by me, and i don’t like things touching me if i didn’t touch it first. my sleep schedule has been abnormally fucked this whole week, staying up all night and (trying to) sleep all day. but my dad will constantly walk into whatever room i’m in and either, shake my bed, yell, or call me through my amazon alexa and proceed to make loud obnoxious noises that i’ve asked him to stop making

  
earlier this week he did these things then for dinner he went out and bought me ice cream. for two days in a row. then proceeded to wake me up as previously mentioned. in the past two weeks, i’ve only managed to get a day and a half’s worth of sleep and today, when i refused to sit up to “prove i was awake” he stood in my door way and asked “are you just gonna lay there all day like the alt teen girl with daddy issues you thing you are?” every single time he wakes me up, the first 10 minutes of being awake is a fucking shitshow of us screaming and me crying. he likes to talk about respect a lot, and how it seems like i don’t respect him. well bith no wonder why, you’re always stealing my electronics, yelling at me to wake the fuck up when i can’t even keep my eyes open, and when you lock damn near every sugary food up behind AN ACTUAL FUCKING PADLOCK (including his office closet full of soda, the freezer outside full of meat where he also keeps ice cream, and a filing cabinet full of little debbie shit) and then he has the audacity to tell me i’m getting fat like him.

and he wonders why i never want to go on any trips with him.

  
he’s always stressing me out about school shit and acting like the only damn thing that matters about me is grades “or i’ll be poor and homeless like he would’ve been if he hadn’t dropped out of college to help his parents pay bills” he’s always telling me to do work or do some dumb chore he can do himself, and it’s causing me to not spend time on personal hygiene. and then he gets pissed whenever i don’t brush my teeth or take a shower “like he asked” (which he never did) but then gets mad when i stop doing a chore to go take a shower or brush my hair (that he used to always ‘joke’ about cutting off if i didn’t take care of it) they’re always telling me i should get a job soon then when i actually brought up a job i found that i liked, they said oh but think about your schoolwork you won’t be able to stay focused or have it done like excuse me what the fuck

i’m just so tired of his two faced bullshit and i want it to end. I can’t move out because I’m not 18, I can’t send a report in saying it’s abuse because it’s not, all I can do is complain like by saying “my dad doesn’t want to get what I want” and sound entitled. so WIBTA if i confronted him about how im feeling and what i want him to change about the way he acts around me?",2.0
741,t3_rudekr,AITA for letting the dog off the leash?,"AITA?I was out on a dog walk with my sister with the dog off the leash and playing with a ball like always. she's really worried when she hears cars because our dog is hyper. I get that, I can't say that I don't get a bit worried but hers is to an extreme. so anyway, I hear a car and bring the dog onto the pavement like usual. I see that the car is going into the house owner's driveway. so I let the dog go knowing that the car is not gonna drive out. she screams at me and calls me, and I quote, ""YOU DICKHEAD CUNT SHITTER"" after a while, we walk back and I throw the ball into the garden. she gets mad and grabs my hood and trips me onto the floor, runs off, and is about to lock the door. I grab the handle and open the door, let the dog in, and just leave it there. then our mum walks into my room along with my sister and it looks like she pitted the blame on me and twisted the story. I got pissed but didn't react. then she told me to make my own food for the rest of the month which I don't mind but, please I'm 13 for shit's sake. I don't have an income or any idea of how to make a decent dinner. I already manage my own breakfast and tea. AITA?

742,t3_rudd2h,AITA for making my sister pick up her cat early?,"My sister has a new kitten and is in town for the holidays. She made all these plans with her friends for an extended week-long trip to visit them a few hours away. She didn’t tell me, but she assumed I would care for her kitten during that time - I live in a tiny, tiny studio apartment. I was angry that she assumed I would care for it for over a week without telling me, but my sister assured me - the kitten is amazingly behaved, she sleeps all night, she doesn’t eat plants (I have many plants),  and she doesn’t stick her claws in furniture.

7 days later, this cat is batshit insane. She has spent nights walking around my house fucking up everything she can. Eating all my plants, climbing my expensive curtains like a spider monkey, sticking her claws in all my furniture non stop. I have barely slept in days - and it’s a studio apartment so I can’t separate her from my self or anything.

My sister said she would be back by Sunday or Monday. Last night - that cat is acting weird and has gone into HEAT for the first time. Literal constant meowing and yowling, and she is more troublesome than ever wanting MORE attention because she’s in heat and doing it by fucking up my things even more.

I called my sister and told her to please come get the cat sunday rather than Monday - I am so sleep deprived and am close to being enraged with how this cat behaves, that my sister lied to me so blatantly about it’s behavior, and that she saddled me with it without asking for so long. 

My sister is now angry because picking up her cat early gets in the way of her plans. She wanted to spend an extra day there, but is just now telling me. She also might have covid and needs somewhere to quarantine and picking up her cat gets in the way of her quarantine plans. 

She is guilting me like crazy and is expecting me to help her find out new plans because “I so desperately need her to get her cat”. I’m really confused if I’m being an asshole or not.

743,t3_rudcqy,AITA for asking my sister-in-law to not invite my stepsister to her wedding?,"Me and my stepsister have never been close, we pretty much hated each other growing up and used to fight constantly. Things only got better because we started interacting only in incredibly small doses. 

After I got married my stepsister latched onto my sister-in-law. Their friendship made me uncomfortable but I never said anything to my sister-in-law since I didn’t think it was my place to tell her who she can and can’t spend time with and I didn’t want to air my dirty laundry to my in-laws so early into my marriage.

However, now my stepsister has started making sly remarks about my marriage and keeps trying to dangle the fact that she supposedly has information on my husband and his “extracurricular activities” from my sister-in-law. We’ve had two massive blow ups over it already and I’ve asked her to repeatedly stop but she hasn’t and won’t. 

My sister-in-law is getting married this summer. She was planning to invite my stepsister but I asked her not to as I don’t want to be around her. My stepsister recently found out that she wasn’t invited but all of “their” friends had been and rightly guessed it had something to do with it. 

Now she’s mad and said I’m trying to ruin her friendship with my sister-in-law because I’m jealous and insecure that my sister-in-law is becoming closer to my stepsister than she is to me.

744,t3_rudbrs,AITA for yelling at my step dad?,"I am a 19 year old girl and my mum has been with my step dad ever since I was 3 years old. Me and my step dad have always had a strained relationship, this is because he has a very strong personality whereas I have always been quite sensitive. 

My mum also says it’s because he wasn’t used to having a little girl to look after. So he never really understood the hardships I was going through. I used to get bullied and I would come home and cry, he would just laugh at me and tell me I was being silly but it was a big deal to me. 

Anyway, I have a transgender friend called rose, she is a great friend and I cherish her very much, even before her transition we had always been close. I invited her for a sleep over to my house and my mum was thrilled to have her, when she arrived my step dad pulled me aside and said it was inappropriate to invite “ someone like that for a sleepover “ 

I asked him he meant by his statement, and he said it wasn’t “normal” and people like rose should be separated from society as they have been brainwashed at a young age. Rose over heard his comments and left very angrily. Of course I do not blame her. 

This is where I might be the asshole, something inside me clocked and I got really angry, I shouted that he was a small minded stupid ass hole and how could he be okay with saying those things when my friend was in the other room. My mother instantly started screaming at me saying i can’t    Disrespect my stepfather or his opinions. I started crying as I was shocked my mum didn’t stick up for me. 

My step farther rolled his eyes and said god what a cry baby. I royally lost it and told my mum that I refuse to stay in the house with either of them, and that it really hurt that she wouldn’t defend me or at least be neutral about the situation

746,t3_rud7oq,AITA for not having a deeper interest in my (17f) older cousin’s (23f) newborn and telling my very excited mum (49f),"My cousin (C) recently gave birth to her daughter.
My family was never close. Currently we’re all living about 600 km apart and have for years.
My grandma(deceased) moved near us when I was born. She didn’t reach out to her other grandkids, as she was in a bad place when they were born (she was addicted to gambling). I know that doesn’t excuse the blatant favoritism she showed towards me or that she never tried to build a relationship with them after she recovered.
So there wasn’t a connection through shared grandparents and my mum has a loose on-off communication with her brothers, while those two don’t speak directly at all.
When my cousin's daughter was born I displayed some mild interest. When my mum showed me a picture her brother had sent her, I asked about C‘s and her baby‘s well-being, but that was it for me. Glad they’re fine, moving on.
I get why my mum is so excited. I made it clear over the past few months, after C‘s pregnancy brought it up, that I don’t want kids.
So I completely understand if she has grandparent-y feelings towards C‘s kid, as she‘ll likely never have grandkids of her own. Completely fine, if she respects boundaries the parents or actual grandparents set.
I indulged her interest at first. Whenever she showed me a picture and gushed how cute the baby is, I nodded along, because, yeah, babies are cute. But I always had the feeling she was expecting more of a reaction.
When she wouldn’t stop and started to “up the game”, I couldn’t help but feel like she was trying to pressure me into something. I doubt it’s something creepy like “see how cute babies are, you could give me grandbabies too someday”, but I started feeling uncomfortable, as I don’t have a connection to my extended family and didn’t know what she was trying to get at.
So a few days ago I tried to explain something like this:
“Mum, I understand that you’re happy, but I don’t actually know these people. I met C a total of 3 times, the last one being grandma‘s funeral in 2017. You grew up with her dad, so I get that they‘re family to you, but I don’t feel that way towards them. They also never really acknowledged me, so I don’t think it’s my duty to reach out to them. I would prefer if you shared your excitement with someone who actually feels the same, instead of with me, as I can’t sympathize.“
She blew up at me and accused me of “trying to break up the family”, like grandma. Just because I never had extended family, didn’t mean the little one had to suffer through the same. But I never had an extended family. And how I see it, it isn’t my duty to fix a bond I never had, with people I never knew, especially since I’m technically a kid myself.
I want my relatives to be okay, but I don’t view them as family, as the only thing we share is blood.

747,t3_rud385,"AITA For being ""crude"" when my cousin kept asking to babysit?","I have four month old twins, and an eighteen month old daughter. All three are breastfed, twins exclusively breastfed (EBF). Since my boys my family has been insane, constantly showing up unannounced, to the point where my wife had to literally escort my cousin out.

We went to my parents place for New Years Eve, we were only planning on being there for a few hours so our daughter could have some interaction that isnt just us. 

Naturally the boys came up, people kept asking to hold them. My cousin then piped up and asked if she could babysit the boys. I said no, they're breastfed and dont take bottles.

She said she was sure she could get them to take bottles as she'd ""managed before"" (she gave out daughter a bottle when she was twelve months, after she'd been using a cup for a few months). I told her that, no, they wouldn't be having bottles. In any situation. 

Every few minutes she'd ask again, keep pushing it, coming up with new ideas. None of which I am going to go for, obviously. 

Just as we were getting ready to leave, she followed us to the door, and quite literally tried to pull one of the boys from me so she could give them a cuddle. She then asked, again, if I was sure they couldnt have a bottle, or if I could just pop back in whenever they were hungry.

I turned back to her and said ""Unless you plan on popping a tit out and putting it in his mouth you are not watching him.""

Wife found it hilarious, I took my baby back and we left. 

Since then family has been calling me crude and stuck up, because she was just asking, saying I could of been kinder. In my opinion, I said no multiple times and she kept pushing.

My wife thinks that I could of potentially left it, but agrees that she had it coming. Although my wife doesn't like my family so take that with a grain of salt.

I do feel a little bad - she's autistic and sometimes doesnt understand things, but I feel like I was being obvious enough. I dont know. I have apologised, but she left me on read.

My family has since stated they don't want to see my until I make it up to her. Which I presume means letting her babysit, which isnt happening. My children arent dolls.

But, I'm still being treated like an asshole. Was what I did really that bad? A few friends said they'd be really upset, but I dont think they really grasp how agitated I was.

Ever since my wife and I started dating 6 years ago(married for 3) whenever we would jointing vacation with them, my parents would pay for me along with my siblings: at restaurants, tickets, share of the room, etc. but my wife(then gf) would have to pay for herself.

My wife didn't have a problem with this while we were still dating, but after we got married she started expressing with me more and more how uncomfortable she was about it and it came to a head at our most recent holiday vacation a week ago. She says it makes her feel awkward when she's the only one being handed the checks at restaurants, or has to stand off by herself to buy her things. She instead wants me to just pay for myself with her. Financially this isn't a problem, and we can afford it, but I feel awkward telling my parents not to pay for me. Plus, it lets us save money on trips so we can have more to spend on having fun.

Personally, I think my wife is just feeling slighted by my parents(but I doubt she would actually admit this) but I also think she's being a bit immature. I feel bad because I can somewhat understand where she is coming from. She isn't wanting my parents to also pay for her, but wants us to be a unit on vacation, but I still think it's silly when we could be saving money.

Lately we noticed a new car about 2 houses down on the opposite side of the street, which is still within throwing distance. Shortly after we noticed there is usually a person inside of the car. The car is filled with stuff and after a few different times of each of us going to and from work, or taking our son to school, we realized there is *always* someone in that car.

 I am a restaurant manager and have to get up very early (before daylight) to go prepare the store for breakfast. My wife waitresses part time and is sometimes not home until 9,10, or 11 pm. At first I didn't think much of it, but after some time my wife expressed some concern about the situation. It does make sense, because this guy sees me leave for work every morning and knows when she is home alone with our 6 year old. He also knows that when she leaves, she will likely be arriving home late at night. 

Now, I will say that we have no other reason for concern, but it has been a couple of weeks at this point and he still hasn't appeared to move or show any sign of leaving. I was very conflicted about calling the authorities because he hadn't done anything wrong really, and also it's winter so it's very cold.

750,t3_rucv9x,AITA for being friends with somebody my friend didn’t like?,"this happened awhile back, and i apologize for the layout, I’m on my phone. ill be changing the names. for some context, theres me (duh) Mary (F, used to be friend.) and.. i guess ill call him alex. (M, still my friend to this day.)

for starters, me and Mary were longtime friends. like, since 3rd grade. however, i moved away and we only spoke on discord. she introduced me into a server to some people, and it was very nice. me and alex didn’t really talk all that much yet, but that doesn’t matter.

come a year later, alex friend joins out of the blue, calls everybody a slur and some derogatory terms, then leaves. Mary took this very seriously. she banned alex because he was associated with somebody like that, and i private messaged him about it, asking what happened. we soon became best friends, and Mary obviously found out. she then proceeded to ban ME because i’m friends with somebody who’s friend literally sucks. i don’t even know his friend on a personal level either. 

i yelled at her about it, asking what the hell was wrong with her for throwing years away just because i was friends with a guy she didn’t like. she said something along the lines of, “i believe that people are the same as who they choose to surround themselves with. you can either be friends with me and ghost him, or you can stick with him and i’ll leave.” either way, i chose to stick with alex because he didn’t put me into cliché situations like these. in all seriousness, why can’t i be friends with both? they both meant a lot to me.

we got into a very heated argument, which resulted in Mary getting all her friends in that discord server against me and alex. they all yelled as us, saying how we were terrible people and they couldn’t believe they were friends with us. talking trash about us in the server and we weren’t even there. we haven’t spoken since, but i’m still pretty close with alex. granted i probably just stuck with him because i had feelings for him, but i still found the options Mary had given me rather childish.

there’s plenty more stories with Mary that are also just as dumb, but this takes the cake.

My mom usually cleans the house with my help and dad’s every weekend of every week. 

However I couldn’t help last week because I have been studying in my room the whole time, she didn’t even come up to ask for my help like she usually would do if I was in my room, and I didn’t even notice that it was cleaning day until I walked in the very messy kitchen (after a big dinner, it was the only messy part in the house) that I offered to clean myself. 

This week I had food poisoning with rather painful complications that lasted until yesterday. I couldn’t get up from my bed for 4 days and I still had so much to do but yesterday I finally did and studied pretty productively. 
Today I woke up early to study, and I’ve been in my room until my dad called me to get lunch. On my way to the kitchen I met my mom who was cleaning and I told her to take a rest and eat. She ignored me but I thought it was fine because she usually doesn’t respond when I tell her to go eat or stuff like those.

We waited for so long but she still didn’t come and she went upstairs, I knew something was wrong so I followed her and asked if she was mad at me. She told me “shut up and leave me alone” I asked if she needed help and she said “no, go and continue your dear studies” in a sarcastic manner. I kept insisting but she was getting angrier so I went back to my room and here I am.

I think I am the A here because I couldn’t clear some of my time to help mom cleaning. 

However, I may not be the A because I’ve been sick and stuck to bed unable to move a limb for 4 days while I was witnessing my classmates studying for our exams and being productive while I couldn’t even sit without feeling extremely sick.

I talked to Dylan and to make a long story short, he apologized, told me about how he had a toxic family growing up (his dad was a chef and his mom didn’t approve because obviously only gay guys can cook /s) He said he does still have the bracelet and said that he shouldn’t have called it ‘gay shit’ and that he doesn’t want to turn into his mother by acting that way/saying things like that

I also believe he was given a stern talking-to by my grandma later (who had also come to my aunts house, they were gonna go get massages)

753,t3_ruct1b,AITA for not helping my son get another job?,"I(50M) work in a large lobby firm that has offices all around the United States. My son(23M) graduated from college and wanted to stay in Virginia. My ex is in his life, but will only talk to him when he reaches out. He has always talked about wanting to do similar work that I do. I did some phone calls and my son got an interview with one of the firms in Virginia. He did get the job and was very excited to start. 

He started in July and talked highly about the job and everyone he works with. I assumed things were going well as I didn't hear otherwise until we all got together for Christmas. My sister asked how his job was going and he responded back saying I quit. I was shocked and asked what happened? He looks at me and says They gave me some feedback that I needed to improve on some areas and it pissed me off. I quit and left during lunch. 

My son turns to me and says Oh dad, I was hoping you could ask a few of your friends if they have any openings. That would be great. I tell him sorry son, I can't help you. Son looks visibly upset and says Come on dad, I am unemployed right now and I know you can help me get a job. I told him that I would be happy to help him look for new jobs. 

He went back to Virginia and has been very distant with communication. My ex found out what happened with the job and was very disappointed that I was not going to help son.

754,t3_rucsyl,AITA for quitting my father's business just 6 months after starting to work there?,"My father has run this business for ages and the plan was always for me to get some experience and then work under him until he retires. I have spent 5 years working in a Fortune 500 company in corporate finance. 

He let me look through the records after I joined the company. The accounts were a cluster The company has not spent anything on capex for years while using its valuable assets as collateral to fund horrible real estate deals. It probably takes actual skill to lose money in this real estate market and they were ripped off by the general contractors to an obscene degree.

The management team is great at running the core business but they are all old and will probably retire in a few years but almost everyone working under them is not given anything meaningful to do. We will have to replace half the core management team in 5 years but won't have internal talent to promote.

The real estate assets can be valuable but they are not complete and are already massively over the budget. The company has to borrow against them to complete the projects and those loans are going to be expensive. It makes sense to sell them as is and eat the loss but my dad wants to complete them but completing them will mean less investment in capex and more debt.

I realized that I didn't enjoy working with my dad and his management who were never willing to share even the tiniest bit of control and wanted to do everything themselves. I was not learning anything and I became increasingly frustrated as I realized that when it came time to take over the business I will have an uphill task for me.

The business will need massive capex to grow but will have no funds to do and I will have to hire good managers to run the company while the company looked like a clusterfuck. I felt like I was being set up to fail. I tried talking to my dad to just give more responsibility to people working under the management team and start training replacements and thinking about implementing new systems. He totally ignored me and said the company was doing well and things will be fine.

I told my dad that I was quitting, He was very angry with me and he told me I was entitled to think I would understand the business in just 6 months. I told him that I didn't understand the business and no one was willing to teach it to me. He said he wanted nothing to do with me if I quit and I was betraying him and that really hurt me and I ended quitting and going back to work for my old boss.

I feel like I should have tried more with the team. It was my dad's dream for me to take over the company. I know it hurt him a lot when I quit after just 6 months but I knew that I was not prepared to take over a company that is in a horrible situation and I felt like I didn't belong and I would be left trying to fix a broken business.",72.0
755,t3_rucn17,AITA for laughing when my nephew hurt himself doing something I told him not to do?,"EDIT: (I just want to say its funny as hell to me that this got TWO wholesome awards)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I (27M) was working on some paperwork and my nephew (5M) and my brother (31M) came to visit. I stepped outside my room to see my nephew was getting ready basically slide down the staircase with an inflatable beach bell that he was basically planning to slide on with his belly.

I look at him and go 'I wouldn't do that, you're going to hurt myself' and he screamed 'No!' So I try to stop him but I was too late.

He proceeds to do the opposite of what I said. And he rolls down the steps like a boulder and basically runs into the wall at the bottom of the stairs

Now, I KNOW its bad he got hurt. But the way he just hit the wall was so funny and had almost a 'Splat' like sound effect that I couldn't help but let out a laugh.

Well my sister came running after she heard the splat. And my Nephew didn't break anything, he just basically bumped his head and starts crying.

Then i proceed to get yelled at because I didn't stop him from doing it. And I'm sitting there like 'Hey i told him not to, and he told me No, but look on the bright side, I don't think he'll do that again.'

I mean, If he was seriously injured than yeah it would suck, but it honestly looked like something out of a cartoon.",4666.0
756,t3_ruci6o,"AITA for ""stealing"" a dress from my MIL and wearing it to her NYE party?","My MIL has been really awful in the past (my husband supports me and I'm aware no contact is an option but it wasn't what worked best for us) She is a little better now, but she likes to get a rise out of me and I've had to learn how to not react. She has even admitted she does it for fun and I'm not the only person she does it to, but think high school mean girl antics.

I had a lot of reason to believe that MIL would do something to upstage me at my wedding. That is very much her MO, and at the time I hadn't learned to ignore her. I was very stressed and already feeling insecure as a bride and MIL's MIL told me she would handle it and to just not worry.

MIL showed up in a sparkly white dress. It was brighter than mine and her MIL did take care of it for me with a travel mug of coffee (sitting out for hours NOT hot) and a chocolate cupcake to the ass. MIL's MIL also had a couple of MILs dresses in the other room, so she could change. MIL took the white dress off and tossed it in the trash.

My friend pointed out the label on the dress and and couldn't believe MIL just tossed it because it was such an expensive brand. I took it out of the trash and held onto it just to see if it could be salvaged and I took it to a great cleaner. My feeling is she put it in the trash and it is a nice dress.

MIL always has a cocktail party on NYE and I decided to wear it, because I don't have a ton of dresses i like, and to be honest I didn't think she would notice. She did notice and demanded to know if I stole her dress. I said she put it in the trash. MIL got mad and said that her husband didn't buy that dress so I could wear it, and I'm sneaky for taking it out of the trash. MIL's husband actually said I was in the clear because she did throw it away. MIL got over it quick enough, but I did hear her telling someone that I did that to annoy her. My husband was also slightly embarrassed that his mom and stepdad know I wore something out of the trash, and said it is fine that i took it but I shouldn't have worn it to her party.",1837.0
757,t3_ruci5p,AITA for telling my roommate to stop flipping off my dog?,"My(25f) roommate(22f) is very funny and quirky. She is fun to be around, but also has a strange sense of humor? I have a dog(Siggy, 30lbs, 5 years old) and she has 2 cats(Joe and Dirt). My roommate talks to her cats like she hates them. Like if she see's one of them on the kitchen counters she'll go ""get the f off there!"" from across the apartment, and she also regularly flips them the bird.

I don't think my roommate dislikes her cats, in fact she really loves them, but I have never acted like this towards my dog and it was a bit of a shock. I had also never owned cats or lived with them before this so I don't know how cat owners normally talk to their cats, but still I can't help but feel a little bad every time she does it. That being said, I mind my own business and don't say anything because those are her pets.

However, the other day she came home and my dog was barking at the door, kind of acting like she was a stranger but not seriously afraid of her, and my roommate said(seemingly jokingly) ""screw off, Sigs"" and flipped him off. I didn't feel comfortable with this, and Sig hadn't even been doing anything bad. He's a dog and dog's bark sometimes.

I very calmly, but sternly said ""please don't flip off my dog."" My roommate laughed at first, but when she saw I was serious said, ""oh, are you being for real?' I confirmed that I was. My roommate gave me a weird look and said, ""he's just a dog, they don't understand what it means, and I wasn't really mad at him."" but when I didn't laugh with her again she just said ""sorry"" and shut herself in her room.

758,t3_ruci0r,AITA for buying my boyfriend a train ticket behind his back?,"Me (23 F) and my boyfriend (25 M) don't live in the same city - in fact our homes are an one hour train ride away from each other. We have been together for 7 months now. He lives in his own flat and I moved back in with my parents half a year ago due to personal reasons. Because of my parents and my younger siblings, I go down to his place 99% of the time. Don't get me wrong - it's NOT because my bf and my parents don't get along with each other (my parents literally love him and vice versa), it's solely because we want some alone-time and peace when we meet and that's not really possible at my parents place with my younger siblings around.

The last time he was over at my place was months ago and my parents already get kinda worried that he might not like them (which is absolutely not the case, my bf loves them). Of course they know the reasons why we don't stay over that often (which they totally understand), but I promised them to bring him over sometime around Christmas.

Well, for one month now I'm trying to get him up to my place and EVERYTIME he agrees at first but then backs out last minute (because ""something unexpected came up"" - which is totally not the case) and asks me to come down to his place instead. I know that he just doesn't want to come over because my siblings can be really exhausting, but I still wish he would ""bite that bullet"" and come to my place for a few days.

Last week I did something that might make me look like an asshole. Once again we both agreed that he comes up to my place on Wednesday and in order to prevent him from backing out last minute again, I bought him a train ticket without him knowing. Well, Tuesday arrived and of course he tried backing out again (because ""something unexpected came up"" ), but in response I showed him the train ticket I already bought, which caused him to get mad. He said it was sneaky of me to buy a ticket without him knowing and that I kinda went behind his back. I responded that he should calm down, since first of all, I paid for the ticket myself (so he didn't lose any money) and second of all, he PROMISED me to come up to my parents house and I just acted according to what he promised me.

Luckily our argument died down quickly and we both apologized, and he eventually came up to my parents place. I still wonder tho, am I the asshole in this situation?",3.0
759,t3_ruch1q,AITA New Years and cupcakes,"Back story we had family down for Christmas but with my husband and his dad cooking I pushed back all my baking understanding it was important to them. New Year’s Eve I was so excited to make cupcakes my husband cooked an amazing feast for the day I then made cupcakes. He called his family they showed him a tradition desert and he told me when he hung up “ugh I wish we had that” then about 45 mins later he came in and said “ugh I just had another piece of pizza and ricotta roll, when are they (indicating our kids) having cupcakes. I took it as he wasn’t going to have any and was hurt, I didn’t cry as that’s a trigger for him to get mad, didn’t try to converse about it because talking about how I feel is also a trigger so I thought I was handling my disappointment well in retrospect I realize I was wrong to assume anything about what he said without clarification. 

I stayed silent, gave the kids their cupcakes, saved one for him in the fridge once I realized some had butter separation in the icing I threw those out, took our son to bed at 11:17 making sure I had enough time to come back down before midnight, came down realized I forgot my phone and asked him the time. I thought that would be a tension breaker, at 11:58 we go to open champagne he says “where are the cupcakes?” I say “don’t worry about it now wait until the new year” thinking it would be cute to pull it out at midnight and not having time to explain about the others/the kids having had theirs, he keeps insisting I keep saying wait until next year. 

Midnight comes he doesn’t kiss me and I can see how far this situation has gone so I then explain what happened and that his is in the fridge, he doesn’t believe me, says I didnt talk for an hour on purpose during that time he didn’t say anything to me so I wasn’t ignoring him, I hurt him by ruining something so important to him(last holiday of the year), I have a serious mental disorder, I want to be miserable, I do things to purposely be miserable. At this point I wasn’t upset about anything and truly realize I was wrong for assuming anything about him asking when they kids were going to have cupcakes meaning he wasn’t going to eat one and that is my fault. We ended the night with him saying he was done with me, basically our marriage was done, didn’t want to see or speak to me I told him I was really sorry I assumed something I shouldn’t and even when I had been really upset I still thought he was an amazing man but was upset at the nasty things he said to me. He didn’t talk to me yesterday, ignored a txt asking what we were going to do so I stayed upstairs with the kids wondering if I’m the asshole for not immediately reading the situation and trying to be cute pulling the cupcake out at midnight and bringing the situation on myself.",3.0

761,t3_ruc5dv,AITA for getting engaged the day after my sister?,"Throwaway. Me (f31) and my sister A (f29) aren't close, but I have been trying to reach out to her more often even though she lives in another state. She and her boyfriend have been together for 4 years and have been waiting to get engaged due to finances. My boyfriend of 6 months is wealthy and me and my children moved in with him 2 months into the relationship. He is also the owner of the company I've worked at for a over a year.

On NYE, her bf of 4 years proposed. She texted our mom letting her know and mom told me. I texted A asking for the story and a picture of the ring. She replied with everything I requested and I told her I was happy for her. She was pretty excited.

The afternoon of New Year's Day, my boyfriend of 6 months proposed. I just finalized my divorce and I knew he had the ring so I was semi expecting it.
 (before anyone asks, yes there was some overlap in the relationships, but that isn't the point here). Turns out he intended to propose in the spring, but after seeing my sister engaged he decided to move the date up so I wouldn't have to wait for my own proposal. He was planning on doing it regardless.

I texted A with the announcement, excitedly telling her we are both engaged now, but apparently my mom had already told her. She didn't text me first with a congratulations, which I was surprised at. She did respond to my announcement with a simple congratulations. I guess she texted our mom after telling her to not tell anyone she is engaged now because I obviously need the spotlight on me (which is not true). She also mentioned to another relative that she wouldn't have minded if it were a week after her engagement, but since my fiance proposed the day after, we stole the thunder she and her fiancé have been waiting years for. I feel like the date doesn't matter. I feel like she is being selfish, to be honest. I think she is jealous my boyfriend was more financially capable of buying a ring and proposing sooner. She has escalated into telling our mom that she will not be attending my wedding and insulting me by saying she may possibly attend my third. She has also stated I will not be invited to hers.

AITA for getting engaged the day after my sister?

Edit to add a few things:
1) My affairs have nothing to do with this.
2) My children are safe and happy.
3) For those asking what my sister and her fiancé do that I am so sure she is jealous of money. She is in school and I don't know what her fiancé does. I know she was an HR rep before going back to school, but I don't know what she does now for work. I know she had to borrow money from our mom to pay her property taxes last year though. I also know through our relatives that she published a couple of books this year (now that I think of it, she may hate me for the way I acted about that). I guess I just assumed she was jealous because she lives a much more toned-downed life. I just assumed it wasn't by choice. But maybe it is? Typing this out, I sort of realize that I don't know her at all anymore...
4) I get it, everyone thinks I am a gold digger. That's not true. I love my fiance.",1787.0

I had 2 friends, one with kids, &amp; my son's father come. I paid for pizza for everyone before leaving because I know food there is expensive &amp; then this way there weren't a bunch of people complaining about being hungry, I even brought left over pizza with &amp; some snacks. 

We go on the train, we watch Santa do his thing then go to the dinosaurs. We have to be back by 8 for the actual show which would have been fine. But then when they announce at 7:45 we have 15 minutes &amp; son's father is now determined son has to eat &amp; the left over pizza isn't good enough.

He doesnt really respect peoples boundaries and overshares stuff to the point it makes people feel uncomfortable, e.g. Graphically describing his medical woes, messaging some other co-workers privately even though they didn't give him their phone number, and flooding the group chat with all his problems which is only meant to be used to post peoples work hours.

anyway J turned up late by 90 minutes the other day even though it was crazy busy I was the only driver at the time, I knew he was about because I saw his car parked a couple of streets over and him talking to someone even though he should have been at work,

when J got in he didn't even apologise for being late, just continued as normal, and when he asked me how my day has been a completely lost it at him, I told him how it was selfish that he didn't turn up when he was supposed to and how we had to stop taking orders because I wasn't able to clear them all and it would have been preventable if he had actually turned up on time, which wasn't difficult because he has Specially arranged fixed hours (the only person in the shop to do so), and that I saw him in town 20 minutes before (while he was meant to be at work) so he doesnt actually have any excuse

for context, in my rant I didn't raise my voice at him or use any personal attacks

766,t3_rubsn7,AITA for refusing to let my best friend use my apartment and making her feel bad?,"I (22F) am currently staying in my hometown with my parents for the holidays. I am a college student so I usually live alone in an one-room flat.

My best friend Lily (22F) recently contacted me because she and her boyfriend (27M) wanted to spend a few days in the city I usually live in to celebrate the new year. She asked me if she could crash at my place — I wasn’t thrilled because 1) I have never met her bf and living an entire week with a man I’ve never met is not my cup of tea (I have social anxiety), and 2) the dates she wanted to come clashed with my back-to-college week, so I was going to be tired and anxious. However, I live in a very expensive city and I didn’t want to tell her to get a hotel or a BnB, so I agreed. Important detail: my apartment is a studio flat, and even though it’s rather big for what you can get in my city (most of my friends live within 9m2), I only have a double bed and a very small, uncomfortable couch on which you can barely sit two people.

She thanked me, and then said: « So what are you going to do? ». I asked her what she meant by that and she said : « Well, are you going to sleep on the couch or are you going to your friend’s? ». I was dumbfounded, because I was agreeing to let her crash at my place, and she just assumed I would give them my bed (or even my entire studio for themselves) for an entire week. As I’ve said, my couch is utterly uncomfortable (and she knows it) and my friends live in very small apartments— I can’t crash at their place for an entire week.

I asked her if she was joking and she said « No? Where do you expect my bf to sleep if you sleep with me in the bed? ». I told her (perhaps bluntly) that this wasn’t really my problem since SHE asked me to crash at my place and she knows how my studio is— I expected her to think this through. She answered « Ok never mind, we’re just going to cancel our trip. ». I didn’t respond right away because I was still a bit taken aback, and I thought this was the end of it.

However, she sent me another text a bit later saying I made her cry because she felt my message was full of malice and spitefulness, that she just took on offers that I made (where I indeed said SHE was welcome to crash at my place, but obviously bringing more people with her would cause logistical issues + I never offered to just leave my apartment whenever she needed a room for her and her boyfriend), and that it was mean of me to make her seem like she was ill-mannered for asking when it was my offer to begin with. I simply answered that I never made such an offer, that it was probably a misunderstanding but that I felt that simply assuming that I was going to sleep on the couch/leave my studio during my back-to-college week, and just letting me choose between these two options was a bit rude nonetheless. However, I feel bad since she’s my best friend and I like her, and perhaps I overreacted.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT/UPDATE: Wow, first of all, I certainly did not expect all these reactions! I really believed I would be getting like twenty answers. Anyways, thank to all of those who took their time to share their thoughts and insights on the matter. I've mentionned this in a comment, but somebody said I should put it in an edit, so here you go. 

My friend already did something similar a few years back. She was with her (now ex-)boyfriend, and they had to spend a few days in my city. Her bf was to catch a flight, so they planned to stay at one of their friend's who had bed settee, and then, after her boyfriend's departure, she would've come to my place so we could spend a few days together. 

Long story short, shit went down and they couldn't stay at their friend's place. I agreed to let them stay with me, even though, as I said, I do not have three beddings. The bf said he would be fine with sleeping on the floor, even though I was insisting on going to the store to get an inflatable mattress. He apparently didn't know how uncomfortable linoleum can be, because he got up in the middle of the night to ask if he could sleep with us in the bed. The next morning, I said I would be sleeping on the couch because my best friend, worried about her boyfriend's comfort, wanted to sleep on the ground so he could take the bed, apparently not realizing that it would mean that I would have to sleep next to her boyfriend. Well, as I've said, my studio is very small— when you '""open"" the bed, you have to push the couch against the wall and the only ""separation"" there is, is the sofa's backrest. There's not even enough space between the couch and the bed to walk. 

Well, so we were all sleeping with this setting (my best friend and her bf on the bed, me on the couch) and Lily later (we're talking a year or two later, I can't remember exactly when she came clean about this) confessed to me that she fooled around in my bed with her bf. While I was next to them. Yes, I was really grossed out and offended— however, this is something that has happened to A LOT of my friends (sleeping/being in the same room as a couple who start doing the naughty next to you). So, even though I was angry, it was not in a ""I'm never speaking to you again"" kind of angry. Keep in mind I was 20 when this happened, so I didn't have the experience to realize how gross it was. I was like ""Yeah, a lot of people do this, it's shitty but it's not the end of the world"", but actually writing it all out, thinking about it and reading your reactions, I'm actually a bit baffled myself, lmao. 

Now, to answer some remarks I've seen in the comments: 

**She's a people-pleaser, and not a real friend**

Reddit, although I do appreciate your concern and all, I want to remind you these are only two events that occurred in our ten-year-long relationship. I completely understand, reading your comments, why you might think she is not a real friend, but she's been here for me on multiple occasions, stood by my side, cared for me, picked fight on people who disrespected me... Yeah, she's also done things that got on my nerve, or things I was offended by, but we've grown to be different, and I think it's safe to say we don't always have the same thought process. So yeah, maybe we've outgrown our ""best friends"" relationship, but she's not a bad person or a fake friend. 

However, yes, she does need validation, especially romantic validation. I've always known that and always encouraged her to go to therapy, but she always refused because ""she doesn't have the time"". Maybe y'all are right and it's gotten to the point where I need to put some healthy distance between us, though. 

**You're a doormat**

Yeah, it's very likely lmao. As I've said, I have social anxiety and that comes with a crippling fear of conflict and rejection, so I tend not to affirm myself. It's something I need to work on, I know that. 

So anyway, for the update: she recently came around with a half-assed apology. A mix between ""I love you and I don't want to lose you"" and ""My mom agrees with me and remembers that you made this offer too"". I had to remind her *we* never discussed it in front of her mom, so if she went to her mom to recount the ""offer"" she mistakingly thought I made, yeah, her mom is going to have the same misconceptions as her. I told her I love her too (which is true), and since she wasn't planning to come to my city anymore, I left it at that. 

However, I think I'm going to take my distance. Even though I don't agree with comments saying she is narcissistic, etc, I agree she has some issues she needs to work on, but I don't want to cut her off completely because she is still a person I really love, and who loves me too (despite what these paragraphs seem to hint at lmao). But you all are right when you say this situation is unhealthy, and I fully accept the few YTA/ESH I got, because it's true I also allowed this situation to happen. ",965.0
767,t3_rubtyk,AITA (20F) for making a joke about frying pans?,"About a month ago I was at an LGBTQ event. (I followed all masking etc rules in place.) It was the first one I had ever been to and I was feeling awkward/nervous.

We were in small discussion groups (it was a casual kind of thing), and at one point briefly discussed the difference between being bi and pan. This one guy “Jake” said he thought the difference came down to which colors you preferred, and the other people in the group, including Jake’s friend “Emily,” laughed a lot.

I had said that I was still trying to figure out whether I was technically bisexual or pansexual, and joked lightheartedly that if I said I was pansexual some people might be confused about whether I was into frying pans. (I thought I’d heard another queer person  online make a joke like this before and I wanted to make the others laugh too like Jake did.)

Well, Emily (bi) got after me basically and said the joke was homophobic. I immediately apologized and felt terrible, but was I TA for making that specific joke in the first place?",5.0
768,t3_rubqsf,AITA for turning down a job my friend offered me?,"So I'm 19 and I just finished high school. I get good grades and I've never been in trouble at school which makes me a pretty model student. My parents and I are confident I can get into a good university but our issue is finances. My parents are divorced and in their divorce contract it states that my dad HAS to pay for my studies. I'm kinda confused on whether I should be worried or not about paying for uni in the future but I still want to get a job and save up in case. My plan was to get a job in 2022 and then save. My friend knows this and she has the same plan. However, she's studying this year which means she will mostly be taking on part time jobs. 

Recently she's been helping this guy get his restaurant onto a food delivery app and he was paying her. He offered her a job to work the restaurant as a manager while he's away or whatever on business and she got me a job there. She told me I'd be working as a waitress and gave me no other information. We meet with the guy and he tells me the job is something else completely. Me and her would be running the restaurant alone. We'd cook, clean, handle finances such as doing orders for stock and taking stock intake and such. I was shocked when I heard that because I didn't agree to it because I thought id just be a waitress since I have NO work experience and I mentioned this to her but she said she'd never forgive me if I turn down the job. The restaurant is also in a dodgy area far from where I live, I have no consistent form of transportation and the hours are 14h per day for 5 days (6am to 7pm) and 7h on Saturday (8am to 3pm) for the basic legal salary offered in my country which is very little. I don't feel comfortable taking this job at all. I feel like the boss is poor planner and organizer and I knew nothing about the job until I met him like a few days before I was supposed to start.

I've asked many people their opinions and many agree that it's just weird and i should turn it down or that I should stick it through since thats what adult life is or whatever. I'm mostly scared of hurting my friend's feelings and losing our friendship. If someone could give advice that would be great :)


Edit! I turned down the job today :) my friend decided to turn it down as well. Thanks!",14.0
769,t3_rubk1g,WIBTA if I didn't let my cousin live with me while they flat hunt,"On mobile so sorry for formatting etc 

Six years ago I (27M) moved to a city in the south of England from my hometown in the North West. For context, the cost of living here is increasing and getting close to that of London but without the London wages. The cost of living in the North West is a lot cheaper. I got lucky with an apprenticeship and landed on my feet here after a huge gamble moving down. I recently bought part-ownership of a two bedroom open kitchen/lounge flat, where the second bedroom is essentially a glorified cupboard which I use for storage. 

My cousin (20M) wants to move to this city from our hometown as its getting quite popular with young people and has more opportunities. He works for a pub chain that will transfer him to a store here for work, but their offer is for a limited time so he's asked if he can have my spare room while he looks for a rental. 

The issue is that rentals are impossible to find here at the minute due to the global situation and just rising demand for the area. Flats are being advertised, viewed, and let out within one morning, 
and people are offering a full years rent + extra up front to secure listings. And that's if his wages cover his own flat, the cost of rent here is nearly double back home and the wages are the same. The houseshare situation is equally high demand too, but cousin has always made clear he wouldn't share in the past when I started doing it here anyway. 

If I let him move in I am sure he's gonna be here longterm while he finds a place and space wise it will get pretty snug in my flat. On top of that I work a WFH/office mix and due to the nature of my work can't be overheard on calls when I'm working from home, having him there in the day will mean I have to head into the office more. 

On the other hand things were tough for me when I first got here and it took a few years for the gamble moving here to pay off and become financially in the green. To be able to help him out like this would be a great way to break the cycle and give him a leg up in life &amp; my reasonings for saying no are purely for my own comfort. 

WIBTA if I told him he can't live with me while he looks for a place? That I'm cool for him to do short stays if he wants to do viewings here etc (it's a five hour drive from our hometown), but it can't be a full-time arrangement until he finds a place?",17.0
770,t3_rubj8h,"AITA for ""punishing"" coworkers for offending me?","AITA?

I have been at my job for three years. Everything has been great up up until a few weeks ago. I had excellent rapport with my boss and coworkers, we all worked great together as a team, I enjoyed my work. 

A few weeks ago we had a departmental christmas party. There are only five of us so it is small, takes place during our lunch break. My boss tells us to bring something that meets one of the following criteria: something special to you, like a recipe handed down in your family, something you are really, really, good at making, or something unique that maybe people have not had before. Now, we did not have a christmas party last year, and the year before I had made cupcakes, which were very much overshadowed by a cake my boss brought from a rather famous bakery. So I listen to see what everyone is bringing and I decide to bring a charcuterie plate. It was really beautiful if I do say so myself. It had meats, cheeses, nuts, crackers - a good medley of stuff, plus honey, jam and mustard. I was super proud of how it turned out. 

Well the day comes and everything is laid out. People start eating and after a while I notice no one has touched the charcuterie. I'm very confused. Well then my boss starts talking about the individual items everyone else brought and is complimenting them like crazy. Saying ""oh coworker A this dish made the party! Coworker B, this is the most delicious thing i have ever had!"" Making sure everyone is mentioned - except me. He completely ignores my contribution like it isn't even there. But after an hour or so he goes over, takes a single olive and says ""what kind of olive is this?"" I say Kalamata. He responds with ""the only good olive is castrelevano"" and leaves it on his plate. Then picks up a piece of hard salami (that was cut thick on purpose), waves it around and says ""someone needs to teach you how to cut deli meat"" and throws it away without even tasting it. 

I cannot tell you how mortified and insulted I was. One coworker tried to say she personally ""ate a lot"" but I know how i laid out the tray and almost nothing had been touched. This entire thing came 100% out of the blue. No one has ever spoken to me or treated me like that the entire time I have worked here. I have no idea where it came from or why. 

Now its weeks later and I still can't get over how rude this was. My boss went on vacation after this party and won't be back until tomorrow.  He is going to say something because the atmosphere in the office has 100% changed, and thats because before, I was the one to come in and make light conversation and keep everyone chit chatting and friendly, which he loved. Now it is like a morgue in here. I only talk to them about work matters, otherwise I have headphones in and just watch the clock. One coworker said the other day I need to ""snap out of whatever mood I'm in"".  This tray was a huge waste of time and money for me, am I being the AH by not forgiving and forgetting?",10.0
771,t3_rubgxq,"AITA for not installing a ceiling fan after wasting my day trying to install old one, then new one, and ending up in a worse position then I was before","Background: my wife and kids live with my in laws (have for several years now) while we save up to buy a house. We are finally debt free but due to rising home prices in our area, have been finding it difficult to purchase a home (single income family). Also, this is not the first time we have run into this similar scenario.
About 5AM New Years Eve, our ceiling fan fell from the ceiling, took a bounce onto our bed (where my wife, 5 year old son, and I were sleeping) and crashed to the ground. No one was hurt fortunately and because we live mostly rent free, I offered to buy a replacement and install it myself. Father in law looks at fan and says it should be ok to reuse. It might be but the light fixture broke during the fall. We try to fix but that part of fan is unfixable. Wife picks up a new fan (nothing fancy but decent quality, already installed same fan in the kids room), and I unbox everything to install it. Father in law is adamant that we but a replacement fixture for same cost as the fan we just bought, fix that, and put up old fan (which honestly, even if we buy and fix, are not even sure the old fan still works as a result of fall). I’m furious, but I put everything back in box and decide to call it a day. Meanwhile the in laws come up with an idea to take the fan from their room down, put up in our room, and then put a new fan in their room. I have no time for this. It would take me an hour tops to just put in the new fan we already purchased so I can move on with my life.

772,t3_rubgj6,AITA for saying I'm glad my cousin is infertile?,"The title looks bad but hear me out please, then form your opinion, many thanks in advance!

So I (21M) have received news that my sister (26F) is 6 months pregnant through ivf with triplets!! She  said felt it was safe to announce it at the time, I am so happy and excited to be an uncle and I know that my sister and SIL will be great parents.

Right after that my mom asked sis and SIL if she could post it on my mom’s family group chat which is about my mom’s side until her parents, so my grandparents, they agreed. Mom posts it and everyone is happy to find out about the pregnancy until my cousin texts the cousins groupchat.

Well my cousin’s text comes into the cousins group chat and she is calling sis and SIL every name in the book for having a baby before her. She also insults myself and every other cousin for being happy about sis’ pregnancy (the only other cousins here are 15F and 14f) “insensitive little shits that favor sis over her happiness”. I asked why she called us cousins “insensitive little shits” honestly I don’t care if she called me that, but our younger cousins are literal teens, they don’t deserve that, and my sister is super emotional and sick because being preggo w triplets is a lot. She said my sis always got firsts and she wanted to be first for once, I asked why was there a need for competition, she redirects to saying its almost been a year since she last miscarried and to see sis pregnant was depressing (my cousin E (F26) has been trying to have a baby for 3 years with her fiance F (M30) so far, she has had 2 early miscarriages and 1 mid term miscarriage) , I only found out about the miscarriages after I asked my mom why E was so mad. None of the cousins knew about the miscarriages, we only knew they were trying since they got engaged. She proceeds to say that my sis and SIL would be a horrible mothers since the poor kids wouldn’t have a father figure in their life, I went full on rage and said that I was happy she was infertile so that people like her wouldn’t increase and infest the world we live in. She blocks me and kicks me out of the gc. I get a phone call from aunt screaming at me for being a shitty cousin and calls me TA for what I said to E.

Thinking about it my sister said she was happy I defended her, cousins and their parents (my moms other sister and her husband) and my parents are on my side and say that what she did was mean but my aunt and uncle as well as cousin are blowing up my phone and demand for me to apologize, I need unbiased insight so I know if I need to apologize or not. Many thanks in advance.

Update: So this post blew up a bit after I was only expecting a few opinions, I just want to thank everyone for their judgements whether it was ESH, NTA, or YTA, these have given me more guidance as to my apology for my cousin. 

So far, E has only been contacting me through phone calls (like landline, telephone stuff), I've told her that I will apologize when E apologizes to my sis and cousins for her insults and for her homophobia. E has then said that she will not apologize for her actions because we (my sis for being pregnant, my cousins for being happy, and I for my comment) should apologize to her for ""making her utterly miserable"". I am totally fine with apologizing about the infertility comment, but I will not apologize unless she does for her other actions towards my sis and cousins.

My sis, SIL, cousins and aunts and uncles have decided to go NC/LC with E because they are afraid of what might happen if E says something worse, all the cousins except for E have made a separate cousins group chat to let sis know we are supportive of her. We all agreed to only put up with them for our grandparents when necessary (grandparents do not know about the situation, our aunts do not want them to stress out) . 

I agree that my comment made me a bit of an AH but in the heat of the moment I said what I said, and I own up to it. Thank you all again for giving me insight, and my sis says thank you all for congratulating her.",2278.0
773,t3_rubfup,AITA for not considering my boyfriend’s credit card points money when he asked to split a purchase he made with it?,"My boyfriend (28M) and I (25F) split household items 50/50, and were making 2 expensive purchases for our home. I bought the first one (“P1”) with my credit card, whereas he used his credit card points for the other one (“P2”). The purchases were a 100% mutual decision. 

I figured that credit card points are not exactly money and, prior to purchasing the items, asked if he’d be willing to split P1 I was buying with my credit card evenly. He did not dismiss, but didn’t give a clear response. 

After the purchase, I asked again. He refused because “his hard-earned points count as money, he had to spend a lot with this bank to get them, and he could have spent them on something else, but he spent them on P2.” (I emphasize that it was an essential purchase, so I never pressured him into it whatsoever to get such reaction.)

I got really upset and he got furious. We never split it because he refused to do so, though he also makes more money than I do. It’s been some time, but pretty sure he even mentioned that he spent about $100 (worth of points) more than me so I don’t have the right to be upset. 

I have a very bitter aftertaste about it because I feel like I suffered financially more over it while in my eyes he didn’t spend anything for it. 

Do you think of points as of money? AITA?

774,t3_rubei7,WIBTA for not paying my ex-girlfriend's rent?,"Context: My (23M) ex-girlfriend (23F) and I broke up about 2 months ago after she moved to a new city where I'm going to grad school. This was both of our first serious relationship and we decided to try to live together rather than do distance (we would have been 15hrs apart for the past 1.5 years). A series of impulsive decisions led us to get a pair of kittens while we were together, I knew it was possible we might break up, but I always knew I would be willing to take them, or even let her have them if she wanted. Things didn't work out living together so we broke up and I found a sublet and moved out.

She has a ""real person"" job as she has graduated, while I am working for a stipend to pay for my tuition/rent (it is not a large amount of money). The apartment we moved out of was VERY nice and expensive and I never would have chose to live there myself but together we could afford it (another bad decision, I know). The apartment I moved in to was much cheaper (almost 1/2 the price of her's). Because of this and because she said she couldn't afford this nicer place on her own, I offered that I pay a portion of her rent / utilities so that *in total, we end up paying the same per month.*

When we broke up, I decided to let her make the decision about who keeps the kittens. I told her I was totally open to taking them if she didn't want them and would always be there to help if she needed it. She said she wanted them and seemed to be happy with them for about 2 months.

Eventually she said they were a lot of responsibility, and asked if I wanted them about 3 weeks before Christmas (we both knew we were going 15 hrs home for break). She framed it as she wanted a break from them, and even said if I changed my mind she would take them back / help take care of them on breaks, etc. I was ecstatic, as I would love to have them, but also thought it was a little sus that it was right before Christmas and we would have to pay someone to watch them. I figured whatever and I'll take the hit because I wanted them.

Fast forward to 3 weeks later, and she tells me she bought a new puppy. I said I was happy but I feel totally taken advantage of. She didn't get rid of the cats because they were a lot, she just didn't want them and didn't want to admit that. She also basically lied about helping with the cats (if I ever need it in the future) as she has a dog and wouldn't be able to take them. Also I feel like she can't be in that much financial trouble as she bought a new dog which is not cheap! Keep in mind she makes more than I do and also has the beautiful apartment while I am living in a much more modest place, so I feel like its not fair to pay the same if she is financially comfortable. I am struggling to pay my bills and have had to be super conscious of my money recently because I am borderline not making enough to pay my rent/food/etc. WIBTA if I said I don't want to pay her rent anymore?

775,t3_rubck6,"AITA for kicking a kid out of my house, without knowing if he has anywhere to go?","Ok. So, my new year has been... Stressful.
I have a stepkid 15m who has this friend who he gets into a lot of trouble with. We'll call them Adam(stepkid) and Steve (14 or 15m, the friend)


TL:DR Adams friend who he gets into trouble with, snuck into my house late at night cause he got kicked out of his house. Won't tell us why, and their history together gives us no reason to trust him, so I kicked him out of our house too.


Yesterday morning, Steve shows up at our door at like 5am. He's been kicked out. Doesn't wanna tell us why, so I'm not willing to let him stay, I know what kind of trouble these kids get into, it's usually breaking things, stealing something, or vandalism, they've been arrested together twice now. 


So I gave the kid some water and a few cereal bars, and offered to call around to shelters, he wasn't interested, cops were certainly not something this kid wanted to see, said that his dad might ""light all his shit on fire"" so I didn't get them to pick him up. But my stepkid took him out for breakfast at A&amp;W so I called the cops while they were gone because I'm 99% sure kicking your kid out in -20 weather is endangerment or something anyway. 
Cops won't do anything without knowing exactly where he is, so that goes nowhere.


So the stepkid never comes back, at about 5/6pm we get a call from the cops because they've been arrested, Steve has been pulling emergency break switches on the city train line. $5000 fine a peice. The officer lets them off with a warning, and just lets them go. We don't see them all night. His mom texts with the adams girlfriend, so we figure out where he went, But he doesn't come home. I sort of assumed he's run to his dads to avoid punishment. 


Turns out they snuck in late at night. 
So here's where I might be an asshole, girlfriend goes down stairs because she's woken up by the two of them bantering about videogames. She comes down and gives the kid a chance to explain what happened, he won't tell her. So she tells him he can't stay, he doesn't leave. So I get up. Call cops to have him removed and brought either home or to a shelter. 2 hrs later and 2 calls, nobody shows up. The dispatcher is clearly getting anoied with me, and tells me to try to get him to leave and call them if anything changes. 


So, I walk down to the stepkids room and clearly announce ""your not welcome here, you need to leave, your trespassing now. Do you understand?"" He does. And I explain I've called the cops, and he can either leave now, or wait for them. He leaves. 


Honestly, I feel shitty cause I wanna help the kid, but I'm unwilling to take the risk. I know both boys have almost no respect for authority, and are bad influences on eachother. But I know this kid doesn't have a place to sleep tonight. he didn't want to go to a shelter, he just kinda wandered off into the dusk, and I'm here left thinking ""goddamn I wish the cops just did their job and showed up, I really hope that kid doesn't freeze to death.""

776,t3_rub6lz,AITA for not making my (24f) girlfriend (29f) dinner?,"So yesterday as I was leaving work I thought it’d be nice to grab the left over desserts I made (I work in a restaurant as a pastry chef) and give them to my gf to hand out at her work. I think it was around 5ish when I arrived to her work. I talked to my gf for a bit and mentioned that she was hungry and asked what we were going to have for dinner. I left her work around 5:30 to go home and shower. By the time I finished shower I went on the bed and just decompressed for an hour or so bringing us to around 7. 

Mind you this is really the first time I’ve got to just lay down and relax. I’ve been working 12 hour days since around Thursday in preparation for the NYE event and through the weekend because the other pastry chef is unable to work as much. Every day has me going in at 7 and coming home at 7 or 8. I also don’t get any breaks at work other than stuff my face with some food over the trash can for like 5 minutes.

Well my gf comes home at 7 and immediately says she doesn’t smell any food. I apologized and said I got distracted and was reading for a bit. She got pissy that I didn’t make food and that she was starving. And had she known I didn’t start cooking yet she would’ve gotten something on the way home. Honestly I started seeing red. I’d been working my ass off being basically the only pastry chef at work this whole week. I’ve made hundreds of desserts and not only was it stressful, it was physically exhausting. 

I told her that I’d been standing on my feet all day. And she said that she had too. She works in sales and has a basically 1-9 job with breaks and lunch breaks. I understand that it’s hard dealing with difficult customers and whatnot, but I feel like at least for this week my work has been way harder. Me making deadlines and rushing around to prepare desserts and getting yelled at by the chefs. 

Anyways I started cooking food about 10 mins later cuz I was getting hungry and was just putting dishes away loudly and cooking loudly. I know I was being petty, but I was just so angry. My gf asked why I was angry and I told her that I hate it when she just demands I make food from her like I’m some maid. She can make food for herself (which she did. I guess she couldn’t wait for me to make food and got herself some pizza rolls) like an adult. After that I just put some earbuds in and continued to cook which was probably a bit of an asshole move. Eventually she went to the second bedroom because I was too loud even though she was blasting the TV in the living room. I continued cooking at what I thought was a normal volume until she burst open the door and said that she was just going to bed at like 7:30. 

Now she’s ignoring me and slamming doors in my face this morning. Idk how to proceed with this. I’m not sorry that I didn’t start dinner before 7. This is actually the first time I’ve been able to get off “early” on a Saturday. Usually I close and leave at 1 in the morning.",1.0
777,t3_rub348,AITA for saying that MIL needs to apologize and I don't care how sleep deprived she is?,"My husband has a pretty strained relationship with his mom at this point. We moved across the country five years ago and before our move my relationship with MIL was contentious. It has since calmed down and I was open to fixing it. 

MIL has visited once in five years. She says that the burden should be on us, because we moved but we also have small kids. She also sucks at keeping in touch, so my husband hasn't had much of a relationship with her and she has never met our youngest (she goes on multiple vacations a year, so it isn't a money or mobility issue)

My husband asked her to come and meet our two year old and because he wanted to see her. MIL agreed and was originally going to come with her husband, but there was a big falling out when some things her husband said about us were exposed and we did not want him in our house. MIL wasn't sure about coming, but ended up agreeing to.

Well she has been here for 3 nights and she hasn't slept since she arrived and right now isn't eating. She has past the point of sleep deprived and is crying and jittery right now. She is probably also embarrassed because she is a very stiff upper lip type, and she just cannot stop crying. She was supposed to stay five nights but is leaving today, and I am aware sleep deprivation is horrible and she is somewhat out of it right now.

My husband called his stepdad to ask him to change her flight. SFIL was very concerned and said he knew this was going to happen because she can't sleep unless she is held. He further elaborated that it is more restrained than held, and he holds her still for about 15 minutes so she can't move her arms or legs, and that is the only way she can sleep, but MIL thought she could suck it up for a week.

The real issue is MIL has been awful since we woke up this morning. I think she had a panic attack last night but that isn't really an excuse. she has told me twice that I'm ugly, once that she hates me, and once that she feels bad for her son that he married me.

I told my husband that when she ""comes to"" or lack of a better word I do expect an apology, or I will never be willing to have her in our house again or visit her, ever. He asked if I could just let it go this time because it isn't her fault. I said I really dont care and that isn't an excuse. She can still apologize. 

To be clear I don't expect her to right now. She is a mess. She is in the other room video calling her husband, she's shaky, she keeps falling asleep and jerking awake and crying, but when she gets home and gets some rest I am staying firm that she will apologize or there will be no future visits. My husband thinks I'm being heartless because ""look at her""",179.0

[the story] My bf recommended watching The Labyrinth just now but we could only find it on Amazon Prime and it cost $5. I say to him “do you wanna buy this?” he said no to buying it, so I asked him if he wanted to find something else to watch, he said no and that he was going to play video games instead. 

He’s upset with me because I said do *you* want to buy it, making him feel like he should pay for him, but I meant it as in “is this film worth paying $5 to watch once?” And I thought we were signed into his Amazon account so thought the money would be going out of his account. I was expecting to buy it myself and was perfectly happy to do that, I realise i should have expressed myself better but when I clarified/told him what I meant he just said “no” (as in disagreeing that’s what I meant) and has been off with me/not talked to me since. (Also just to explain, I asked him in the first place because I know he gets uncomfy me paying for stuff so if he had a problem with it I’d rather have just found something else to watch for free)

[thoughts on his side] I think he’s upset because he feels like I expect him to pay for stuff and he feels bad that he can’t do this at the moment.

[extra info] I think it’s worth noting that while he’s been out of work I haven’t expected him to pay for anything. I’ve covered his share of rent for this month until his benefit allowance comes in, and for New Years I wanted to go out and said I’d pay for everything and would even give him the money for New Years so he didn’t have to feel “embarrassed” not paying for stuff (he said no to this and we ended up staying in for New Years). 


So AITA here? I know I made it sound like I was expecting him to pay at first but that’s not how I felt, and I tried to explain what I meant but he wouldn’t listen. i get why money is a sore spot for him but it’s not as if I’m constantly expecting him to buy stuff or anything, and I just feel like this has been made a big thing when it’s a simple miscommunication.",3.0
779,t3_ruayh7,"AITA for not allowing plumber who did a bad job to come back and fix snags and finish bathroom refit, and withholding some money to pay someone else to do it?","My uncle (an electrician) and his plumber friend did a refit of our bathroom. Plumber friend made lots of mistakes with the bathroom fitting side of things, but all the actual plumbing and pipework was fine. Likewise, my uncle's electric work was fine.

Some examples of the plumber friend's mistakes: 
* Plastering - accidently mixed polystyrene and spaghetti into the plaster mix so these were embedded in the wall. (He used spaghetti as spacers for the tiling). He knew the polystyrene and spaghetti was in the plaster but used it anyway rather than get a fresh bag of plaster. After finishing he thought he did a great job with the plastering even though it was like a cheese grater, and later we found the plaster had blown. 
* Tiling - in the corners he said he would split tiles in two and put one piece on one wall and the other on the other wall. He didn't do this so now we have one tiny piece of tiling on one wall and a full-size tile on the other wall. Also, the tiling is wonky, looks like it's wavy even though he put new plasterboard behind it to make the wall flat, and there are bits of spaghetti and tile adhesive in the grout. 
* Toilet - cistern came away from the wall the same day it was installed, and it looks like he only attached it with small blobs of silicone and 2 screws in the wall with wall plugs that are too small. 
* Bath panel – bath installed wonky with waterproof cement so now the bath panel doesn't fit properly and scratches the floor when you try and fix the panel. 
* Water leaks - he put glue and silicone all along the bath when installing it but water is leaking down the side of the bath. 
* Sink - used black pipe for the waste pipe under the sink, didn't put the pipework in the pedestal so it's sticking out the back and looks ugly, and didn't use the right connectors/size pipe so bent the pipe to fit. 
* Didn't install the flooring in the way we asked and cut it wrong so there is a gap between the wall and the flooring that is bigger than the depth of the skirting tiles.

Everything I've mentioned he doesn't see as a problem and thinks he did a good job. They asked for £3000 out of the total £4200 the job was quoted for, leaving £1200 to be paid to them after they came back to finish. We paid the £3000 immediately. But we didn't want them to come back as we didn't trust that plumber friend would do a good job fixing and finishing considering what I've said above.

We got quotes to fix things and finish (£860), sowe sent them £340 out of the £1200 outstanding, bringing the total paid to £3340 out of £4200. My uncle says we’ve treated them unfairly, we’re completely unreasonable, and we’re just trying to scam them out of the rest of the money.",2.0
780,t3_ruaxmi,AITA for refusing to vacation with my MIL again after her disgusting actions?,"All fake names for anonymity.

This past week, my wife “Chloe” and I (both 33) went on a family camping trip. Attending were my stepson and daughter “Miles” (16M) and “Alice” (11F), my sister “Kay” and her two kids, my brother “Zac” (35M) and my MIL “Lindy” (55?F). Chloe and I’s families are close (we were family friends before we even started dating), so it’s normal for both sides of our family to do things together. We generally all get along, too.

Now, this particular campsite has bath houses with toilets, but they are 15 minutes walk from the campsite we booked. I told the kids that they could relive themselves in the woods, but they needed to bag any used TP and throw it out, rather than leaving it in the woods. I also told them to bury any number 2 and not leave it lying around.

My MIL overheard this, but I guess she didn’t take it to heart. She spent the trip leaving “droppings” all over the place, and it was honestly pretty gross and embarrassing. She doesn’t have any health issues that would prevent her from walking to the bath house, other than being a little fat. She didn’t want to go far into the woods because of “spiders and rats”, and so she kept doing her number two right at the edge of the woods where people were likely to step.

On the second to last day, Chloe and Alice confronted MIL about her actions and asked her to be more discreet. MIL went to sit in the truck and audibly cried for a half hour. She didn’t change her behavior either.

MIL and my ex-FIL got divorced about five years ago, and MIL’s been a PITA since. As far as I remember, she was always fine during my and Chloe’s childhood, but after the divorce, she got really careless and narcissistic. She got some expensive cosmetic procedures (while also refusing to contribute to Kay’s hospital bills after she had a seizure), constantly harasses ex-FIL, and recently even joined Pure Romance. She’s turned into a big, obnoxious character, and nobody thinks her antics are cute anymore.

After the trip, I told my wife I was never going camping with MIL again. We were meant to go to the family beach house for spring break this year, but I’m also reconsidering since MIL will be there. Chloe thinks I’m being too extreme about one incident, but I see it as a build up of obnoxious actions that I just can’t stand anymore.

This has never happened before. I call my mom to know about said messages. She was confused as well by my texts. After the call I went to my bf and asked him if he had went trhu my phone. He said no. I didn't believe him since only we are in the house.

He said he really needed to brush his teeth, so I went so search for any toothbrushes I could have at home but since I didn't have anything new and unused I told him no.
Since I was a child I was told to not share personal items such as my toothbrush to anyone.

784,t3_ruaihb,AITA for snapping at my friend who left me all alone at the airport?,"My friend (25f) and I (25f) were at the airport to fly back home after we had traveled together for a week. We first handed over our luggage at the airport check in and decided to grab a bite while we wait for the boarding to start. Then we went to go through the airport security and had our hand luggage passed through the x-ray machines. We both had small backpacks and hand bags. When we started collecting our stuff, my friend noticed that her handbag was missing and apparently she forgot it upstairs at the ladies room. After a long debate, one of the security guys agreed to let her go look for the bag with him while I waited for her there. Quite a time passed and she was not coming back, neither answering my text messages. I was already checking the next flight dates as I thought we were gonna be late for the plane.

She came back with the bag when there was only 15 mins left for our flight. We immediately ran to the passport control, she got her passport stamped pretty quickly by the officer and then she told the guy that was checking mine “could you make it faster, we are running late”. I’m not sure if it was the reason but I felt by the look he gave her that that made the guy a little mad and he decided to keep me there for a while.  He stamped my passport literally 3 minutes before the flight time. I got out and my friend was not there. She didn’t even let me know that she was leaving. I started running to the gate and a guy who saw me from distance asked me which city I was going to and ran before me to tell the airplane crew to wait. I got to the plane and she was just comfortably seated. She was sitting behind me. I was so furious with her that I turned to her and angrily “thanked” her for always being there for me . I told her that it was so unthoughtful of her for just leaving me there while I was ready to wait while she was looking for her damn bag. She started crying and tried to explain that the reason she didn’t wait was because she wanted to get to the plane and let them know that I was coming. I didn’t listen and just turned back. Later when she wanted to talk I told her that I was still angry and didn’t want to talk. She went on to say that I’m being disrespectful by not listening to her. I even apologized for yelling at her earlier. When we landed, she just went ahead without saying anything.

785,t3_ruafsa,AITA For not helping more when the work being done was for me?,"I know the title sounds bad, so please hear me out.

My Uncle moved to Florida in November. We agreed that I would buy his home and land and pay him monthly. The house needs a LOT of work. My Uncle and cousin said they were going to come back the week of Christmas and finish doing work on the home, Flooring, ceiling, new doors, base boards, electrical, etc. This was their idea, not mine. My plan was to go over to the house and work on it from the time they left until they came back so it wasn't so much.

Well, I found out that I have ACML and have Aplastic Anemia. I also work a full time job and am often in the office 12 hours. I've have had to work on the weekends for the past 3 months (Sat AND Sunday) so I'm just exhausted. My Boyfriend has also had to work very late days and his job is more physical. He also waits for me to get off of work to drive me home because I'm so exhausted, I don't trust myself behind the wheel. This didn't leave us much chance to go over and work on the house.

So, the week of Christmas comes and my Uncle and Cousin drive up to spend the week working on the house. They arrive on the 19th. Every night that week, I didn't get home until 8:30-9:00pm and neither did my boyfriend, I also had my blood transfusion and iron infusion on the 20th and the 27th and a sleep study on the 28th, so I was feeling even worse, so we didn't get to go over to the house until that following Friday (Christmas Eve). We worked on the house some with them and then left and got home around midnight. Christmas Day comes and I'm up cooking an entire Christmas dinner for everyone and my Boyfriend has to go to his parents 3 hours away, so we weren't able to go help on the house that day until much later so we didn't get a lot done. We went over on Sunday and helped and then Monday-Wednesday we went over as much as we could. We pulled up old and laid down new flooring, painted the ceilings and the walls and put in the new baseboards.

On Wednesday, the day they are leaving, I get this long text from my cousin telling me how I'm an asshole, selfish and ungrateful because I didn't go over and help them more. Because I didn't make more of an effort. That they lost a very important holiday with their family in Florida to come up and work on a house that he was selling me and I didn't have the decency to come over there and help them. Still today I'm getting passive aggressive posts made about me on social media, I'm being messaged directly and just having vile things spewed at me for not doing more than I did.

I know this is a hard thing for the family and it'll always be a sad thing for my husbands side of the family but when his side of the family suggested we move *all* his future birthdays to a different date as that was ""Her day"" I got rather upset and dug my heels in. 

For context in case anyone wonders they don't do anything on this day in her memory she was cremated so it's not like there is a grave to visit and they don't have a family get together in her honour either, in those cases I could understand though i'd still be upset.

I don't want my son to grow up in the shadow of his cousins death and always have his birthday be compared to her but I also don't want him to have his day pushed to the side, my husband insists it doesn't matter and he'll be happy whatever day we celebrate and yes maybe *now* he will be as he's young and doesn't know better but what about when he's older?

787,t3_rua5y9,AITA for storming out of a New Year's Eve party?,"My family usually has a big New Year's Eve get together. Due to the ongoing conditions, we mostly passed on a big gathering. But my Grandmother (93) wanted to do a little gathering, restricted to people who lived geographically near her and were both vaccinated and boosted. That led to a guest list of 6, myself, my wife, one of my uncles and aunts, and my younger brother. Party was hosted and grandmother's.

For as long as I can remember Grandmom has had trouble with names and faces, and in a lot of these gatherings or just other social visits, you are likely to be called anything from a grab bag of names of all of the people present. This pattern continued in the New Years party, with the first ten minutes being called my Uncle's name twice and my brother's name once, and her getting my own name right 0 times. Tried to ignore it, but I was kind of annoyed by this. More annoyed than I usually get from her name forgetting, and I think it might be because I hadn't seen her much in the past 2 years, what with the plague and all.

So when we settled down on opposite ends of the couch to chat, I was already in something of a bad mood, and as the topic of conversation meandered, I started talking about how my wife and I were watching this old British spoof news show called Brass Eye. Yada yada yada, and after talking about it for a few minutes, in which she certainly seems to participate in the conversation, I suggest seeing if I can link to youtube on her TV and find a clip or two to see if the humor is to her liking. Find a likely one, start playing it, and grandma immediately comes out with

""What's this?""

Goddamnit it's the thing I was explaining to you for the past 5 minutes, and has clearly made no impression. It just made me see red. Got my coat, stormed up and out without a word to anyone and walked home (about 2 miles). Wife left shortly thereafter in the car because she wasn't sure what happened to me when it became clear I wasn't coming back. Well, my folks have been calling, mostly out of concern, and I've kind of sheepishly told them that I was absolutely furious with the family matriarch and simply had to get out or say or do something I would regret later. I can tell this hasn't gone over all that great. And from what I hear, the rest of the party was awkward and just kind of trailed along for a half hour or so before everyone else went home. AITA?

I want to be clear that I'm sure grandmom doesn't do it maliciously. But like I said, she's always been terrible with names and faces, and I think her hearing and/or her ability to focus is going. That part is definitely new.

EDIT: I am going to apologize to my grandmother and the other partygoers.  


Edit #2, because it's coming up a lot in the responses. I do not believe my grandmother has memory issues. She retains and can communicate very well on things that are going on. I do think she has trouble hearing and maybe trouble paying attention. Once she's noticed something though, she is definitely remembering it. Just because she's old doesn't mean she's senile, or losing her memory.",0.0

At Christmas dinner she told me about how her son received a gift card from her friend and said, “that’s it?” Not knowing he had also bought him a nice/expensive toy. She was embarrassed by his reaction!

Later, when the kids opened presents, my nephew opened our gift, a $60 toy (more than we spent on anyone not in our immediate family, but those were the suggestions she sent me) and said, “Is that all?!” She didn’t react at all.

My kids each had a nice gift from him/ my sister but nothing crazy expensive as she doesn’t have a lot of income atm. She also tends to buy things at auctions and discount stores to save money.

I explained that we bought him a very nice present, per her suggestions and that I would not be buying him anything else as we have 3 children and not a ton of disposable income. He also receives “everything he asks for” from his dad and my sister as he’s the only child on both sides.

This is an understandably touchy subject but please hear me out first. My friend (32f) and her son (11m) have gone through the ringer these past few years. They escaped a rough with my friend's now ex-husband, the ex had a kid with his mistress, then there was the divorce and move to a new state, the ex has now been MIA from the son's life for years. It's a really horrible thing for anyone to go through let alone a little kid. Understandably, he's found an outlet for his stress and has really clung to eating junk foods. My friend told me that he's nearly double his weight from 3 years ago at this point and the doctor is concerned because he now has very high cholesterol. They've implored her to change up his diet, something she told them she would do several times now but has told me privately that she simply cannot.

She told me that he will literally only eat junk foods and will refuse to eat at all if he doesn't get what he wants.  It's only pastas, cakes, cookies, chips, pizza, fried foods, etc... she complains about it pretty often but she really doesn't want advice, she just likes to be comforted and supported but when she sent me a recent picture of him I had to say something.

I told her that she needs to do something before he's hospitalized. Stop buying cakes and most of the snacks and opt for some healthier options. Don't cut him off all the way but there's no reason why there needs to be cake at the house 24/7. Encourage time outside since all he does after school is play video games. They have a dog that never goes outside save for bathroom breaks (a whole separate issue I have), but tell him to take the dog for a walk. Go with him, even. It'll be a bonding experience. Whatever she decides, she has to do something before he gets more sick.

The unsolicited advice wasn't well received. She was really hurt and angry that I criticized her parenting when she's doing the best she can and I have no idea what it's like so I can keep my opinions to myself. She basically told me to butt out and thinks I'm looking down on her. She's really hurt and I feel badly but more than that, I'm very concerned. I don't think anyone's going to help that boy.

791,t3_ru9dlh,AITA for suing my father after he kicked me and my mother out,"Some context: My mother (43F) and me (19M) had been living in an apartment owned by my fathers parents. My father (45M) and mother had gone through a divorce 12 years prior, due to my mother cheating on him, which she explains is due to his abusive nature, to which I agree. Court had decided that my mother got full custody of me and no assets, my father had to pay child support.

Throughout the years me and my father have never really bonded well. He would always bring up my mother in conversations, insulting her, calling her very bad names, saying we're parasites. My mother on the other hand has no ill feelings. He can't seem to move on from the divorce and sees me as a bad reminder of my mother. He had married again and had a child, my half-sister. The way he's treated me has been horrible compared to the way he pampers her. For example he would never come see me on my events, my graduation, my birthdays, insulted my mother in my birthday message from him.

For the past couple of years, we'd been living in the mentioned apartment, provided by my grandparents with the promise that the apartment will be handed to us when I become 18, but in turn my father won't be paying child support. As such we sunk in a lot of money into the apartment, thinking it will be ours eventually.

Well, a couple of months ago we were greeted with the fact that we'll have to leave the apartment with no given reason, despite me begging them for one. My grandparents and father told me that they will let me stay in a single-room apartment while I study in university, but my mother (which was looking for a new job) will have to pay for my expenses. I also had to accept on the same day the offer was made, and was given no explanation of what the apartment looked like. Asking for photographs was frowned upon, with them telling me I'm insulting them for not trusting them.

I refused the offer they made. We moved out, and I decided to sue my father for money he didn't pay, effectively ending the relationship between us. My mother said she would be supportive of me either way and has not influenced my decision.

Edit 1: Thanks for all the replies! I see a lot of comments regarding the case I have made in court, and there's a misunderstanding I need to clear up: I've only requested the unpaid child support money, and I won the case. I haven't had any preferences toward the apartment.",1608.0

As background I am 19 now and I have lived with very severe social and general anxiety for years before diagnosis at 13, as well as depression and undiagnosed adhd. When I am anxious I find it very difficult to speak and I generally can't form long sentences, when I am very anxious I cannot speak at all.

This year I had to live alone for school, and due to lockdowns  I was completely isolated and my mental health plummeted (prior to this I was in a very good place with my anxiety and was able to shop completely alone, have limited conversations with staff ie ordering or asking where products were, and was even able to book an appointment over the phone with a support person)

Now I've moved back to my mother's for the holidays and have mentioned a couple times I'm struggling with chronic pains and exhaustion, she told me if I want to see a doctor then I'll have to book an appointment, I tell her that I can't and she kinda shrugs it off and says okay. Other times I've mentioned my anxiety and depression have gotten so much worse, she tells me to book in with a psychologist and I say I don't know how (not knowing how to do things/do them right is a major anxiety point for me) outside of doctor's referral so she tells to make a doctor's appointment and the cycle continues. 
She's done this since around when I was 13 to 14 but usually ends up booking an appointment anyway, but during the pandemic none of us have gone to the doctors and now she won't make one.

My grandmother, thinks I'm being ridiculous and that I should just book it and stop being a baby, that I'm an adult and I should act like one, but she also doesn't believe in mental illness, so I'm at an impasse AITA?

Edit: I did mention it at the start but I cannot physically speak when I am heavily anxious, for this reason I am in the middle of learning auslan and can currently communicate non verbally. 
○I tried to book via email or online so I didn't have to speak but neither of those are available, a lot of people keep saying this and I don't want to respond anymore 

Edit 2: I do not intend to live like this forever, I don't know where people are getting that idea from. I know I am capable of making appointments, but anxiety isn't logical and that's the frustrating part, the progress I made that allowed for me to make my own appointments was independent of professional aid and annoyingly regressed by isolation, stress and severe depression. I just felt like people were misinterpreting that part.",46.0
795,t3_ru97c7,AITA for asking my SO to help me more around the house?,"Yesterday I, 32F, asked my SO, 35M, to help me more around the house. For context he is a nurse and I am a teacher. We both have jobs that work long hours and can be very demanding. Yesterday he asked me to plan a get together for his family while he was at work. I tried deep cleaning the entire house and cook food for said party before everyone arrived but did not get to our bedroom in time. So I locked it to make sure no one could see our mess. Everyone arrived and the kids were upstairs playing in our daughter’s play room. When he finally arrived from work two hours later he went to change in our room then came back down. Once the party was over we noticed the kids were all playing in our room as he had left it unlocked and we were so embarrassed. So I let him know that I wish he could help more so this wouldn’t happen again. He claimed that he does do a lot and I shouldn’t be asking him to do more. He said he does the dishes at times, takes out the trash, puts away laundry at times and cleans the toilets. I tried to explain to him that I wished if he did the dishes then he’d clean the entire kitchen like I do. Clean the stove, mop the floors, pick up anything on the counters and so on. If he was going to clean a toilet then do the whole restroom, the shower, the sink, the floors, etc. He said I basically want him to do everything around the house but he shouldn’t have to because he pays the mortgage. I reminded him that I also work and pay everything else besides the mortgage and still do all those things. He then said I do the bare minimum too because I don’t iron for him or make him dinner every night so I shouldn’t be talking. He then broke up with me because in his mind I was basically saying I never think he’s good enough so he’s tired of having this conversation with me when according to him he does do a lot around the house. Now mind you, he is a travel nurse so he will be gone the next two months and I will really me doing everything myself while taking care of our daughter and working as a teacher. I reminded him that I’ll be doing it all myself so I just wished he’d help more while he was home but he refused to talk to me anymore as he usually does and started ignoring me from then on. So now apparently I’m a single mom and really have to do it all myself because I asked him to help… am I really the asshole here?",21.0
796,t3_ru91ln,AITA for not wanting to send my friend her belongings?,"Until march 2020, me (22F) and my friend (22F) lived together. Since we were living abroad and didn't know at what was happening with Covid, we both travelled back to our respective countries. As this was a rushed decision, we didn't pack everything, assuming we'd all be back soon.

During the six months we were living together, she would ignore my landlord's calls and texts and avoid his presence at all costs, because she couldn't afford to pay rent, as her dad got sick at the start of the contract and couldn't work. So, when we left, she still owed him £2K.

I returned half a year later to our house, she didn't so she could work in her family business.

I, because I was the only one returning to the UK, was asked by some of my friends to send their stuff back.

I sent everything to everyone (they planned their own delivery, paid for everything including packaging and were very hands on with the process) except her. She asked me to go through her stuff so she could choose what she wanted to keep, and so I did on a video call with her. She then just told me to figure out how much everything weighted and the least costly way of sending her her own things. She knew we didn't have a scale in the house and that I was an unemployed student without any savings, trying to find a job while also studying hard so I'm not sure how she hoped I'd go buy a new scale, buy new packaging, package everything, compare prices and deal with all the responsibility for her to only pay me later.

Part of our contract says that my landlord can keep the belongings of anyone who has not paid their rent.

By the way, I know usually landlords suck but not this one. He made our rent so cheap and, when I owed him 2 months of rent, he completely understood and patiently waited for the money. He also has told me several times that if he got his money back, he himself would send her stuff back if she wanted to but, for now, her belongings are the only thing giving him hope that he will one day see the money.

He's unaware what she has been asking me to do for over a year now. She hasn't been harassing me or anything with it online but she says she really needs her winter clothes, that she can't afford clothes right now. This is why I feel I am an asshole. I genuinely understand what it is to be in need, I've been in the same position before, but I also do not want to betray my landlord.

While I love her very much and I understand her situation, I also do not not want to be in the middle of this. In my opinion, paying our landlord has never been her priority from the start and her belongings are now his.

Even though I've expressed this to her, she just said he won't even notice and told me she intends on paying everything back. I'm just not comfortable with all this.

AITA for not sending my friend her belongings even though she can't afford more? Let me know if you have any questions.",28.0
797,t3_ru8ve3,AITA for telling my boyfriend he was embarrassing us when he started sobbing in the Vet clininc hallway?,"

My f26 boyfriend's m30 dog has been sick lately. He took him to the Vet to get him looked at and run some tests and yesterday the Vet called us for a quick appointment to talk about the dog's condition.


We were told that he had cancer, my boyfriend didn't take it well, he did not even give the vet time to explain to us what was really going on he just had a break down.

We exited the office and next thing I knew he dropped on his knees sobbing, Literally sobbing. I was shocked because for one I know his dog is important to him, he had him for years and so I get this was a lot to take in and cancer is no joke, but what really bothered me was how he handled it. His knees were on the floor and he was sobbing loudly in the hallway making everyone notice. Ngl, as a woman I've never even sobbed like that, I felt embarrassed for both of us. I kept trying to get him to go to the car but he ignored me and kept sobbing.

I didn't say anything til later after we got home and he calmed down a bit and got some sleep.
When he woke up I brought up what happened at the clininc and expressed how embarrassing what he did was, he looked at me shocked asking if I was serious and I replied that I didn't mean to seem insensitive but I really thought he should've got a better hold of his emotions and handled the news better but not sob in the middle of the hallway causing people to stop and stare. He lashed out at me calling me ridiculous and shallow to be worrying about what people think when he was dealing with a traumatic kind of news and trying to process it, I told him he overreacted because it wasn't like the dog had died and seeing him act this way worried me. He doubled down and lashed out again accusing me of implying that he has mental issues and was acting crazy but that wasn't what I meant. He told me to leave the room after we got further in the argument and today he's gone quiet.

I honestly felt like I probably should not have brought it up like that given his reaction but I didn't mean to seem insensitive.

AITA?


Editing this to say that my issue was never about him reacting like that just because he's a man, No, this isn't about that but it's about the way he reacted, I just did not think it was handled right, that's all.

And also, I do show support and the news was devastating to me too since I help take care of the dog and that bond is there even though it's his dog.",9391.0

I’m kind of umm haphazard with my cash because I don’t carry a wallet or purse (ID and bank card fit in my phone case but that’s it). So I generally have cash in my jacket pocket. I tend to take out a bunch of cash at a time (maybe a couple hundred euro) and end up getting a couple 50s, some 20s, and 10s. Several stands at the outdoor market are cash only. Often the bills end up smooshed in a random wad in my pocket. So when I pull money out to pay, it’s like a fistful of cash that may be 50s and whatnot. My husband does not like this. He says he is ashamed of me because by doing this I’m giving the impression that I’m so rich that I can be sloppy with my money.

800,t3_ru8s2y,AITA for refusing to give my mom recyclables?,"My mother has always had everything in life wither handed to her or she has manipulated people into getting her way and giving her things instead of working for them. Because of this, she is now poor and relies on other ways to supplement her income (government assistance, side hustles, etc.). She has also borrowed thousands of dollars from me with no intention of paying me back, even though she has had the ability to do so.

Recently, she has come to me asking for my boyfriend and I to save our recyclables. BF and I agreed together that in order to do this that she would need to supply a garbage can (10-12 $ 13 gal.) before we do so. Upon telling her, she became visually upset when my BF told her and had told him that she shouldn't have to because we make more money than her. She never bothered voicing her concern to me, only acting entitled towards my spouse at the time. Mind you, this was also during a late holiday gathering that she brought this up as well, making the rest of the night an awkward experience for us and other guests around at the time.

Due to this, I am considering revoking my offer. 

I would like her to help provide a can because I know she will be receiving the money back and have it at least doubled via recycling. However, I feel like  I am being a bad daughter for not helping my mom out, even if she has others to lean on. AITA?

Edit: a good portion of her money is spent on vices like weed and beer. I figure if she has money to buy an ounce a month, then she has the money to buy something as simple as an open mouth garbage can for us to give her these recyclables.",9.0
801,t3_ru8dmi,AITA for telling my gf sister she will be treated like an adult,"Mobile post- There’s now an update

I (22F) have been living with my gf (22F) of 3 years for the past year, we moved in together after the pandemic restrictions went down in my area but she asked if her little sister S (17F) could move in with us about 4 months ago since the apartment is under my name. The apartment is a 2 bed 2 bath so the living conditions don’t matter here- we have enough privacy and her as an adult can come as go as she pleases with of course a few rules. She doesn’t pay anything and has never been asked to. Bills are separated between my gf and I as if we were living just the two of us. So recently my gf and her sister got into a big argument because S kept coming home really late around 3-4 sometimes 5 in the morning, S kept saying she was almost a legal adult so she’s free to do whatever she wants so I stepped in and said if she wanted to act and adult we would treat her as such. I told her when rent was due, split cost between the 3 of us, and told her her phone bill and car Insurance was hers to take care of my and my gf would no longer take care of it. She left upset and called me an AH. Their mom called me and said it was not my responsibility to talk to her in that way and only she could make decisions on what S pays. My gf said she’s not taking sides but she does appreciate me defending her but also states I shouldn’t have meddled. So AITA for telling my gfs sister we would start treating her as an adult? 

Edit-IMPORTANT EXTRA INFO- Yes, the apartment is under my name only so I can kick them out BOTH if I really wanted to but I won’t-at least not my gf.- S lives with us because the university campus is almost one whole hour closer to us than to her parents home (yes dad is still in the picture but that man only speaks to say hello lol) we also live in the middle of the apartment complex during the day we can hear the upstairs neighbor moving up and down all day and we don’t want that to be the case for the downstairs neighbors so late at night when it should be quiet. I myself am a heavy sleeper so unless she comes home drunk I do not hear her but my gf who is a light sleeper says S is not as quiet as she thinks she is and will come in talking/FaceTiming sometimes she’ll make a late night dinner etc. S “cannot get a job” because she’s a full time student and wouldn’t be able to commit to a job and her studies. S lives literally for free, never has she once been asked to pitch in not even her snacks that neither my gf or I will touch and uni expenses are covered by mom and dad. I think those are the most asked questions. SECOND EDIT- subletting seems to be the issue here a lot so to clarify. We live in Chicago for those asking. The apartment complex landlord we live at knows about 3 people living in my apartment and as long as we pay on time rent and utilities it has never been an issue. My SIL isn’t living there secretively she’s just living there freely.",3981.0

He brought her to the family Christmas dinner, I brought our families Lentil soup as my contribution to the day, i'm the only one who currently knows the recipe as my late Grandmother taught it to me and it has been in our family for generations.

My brothers girlfriend loved the soup and asked me for the recipe I told her I couldn't as it was a family secret, she got very quiet at that and said nothing more about it, later on my brother chewed me out apparently she is upset at what I said and views it as a sign I don't accept her as part of the family and that if I did i'd give her the recipe, my brother is demanding I just give it to her as i'm being entitled over a ""silly soup recipe.""

803,t3_ru8azr,AITA for telling my dad I hate his girlfriend?,"Tw: mentions of ed's

My parents got divorced when I was ten, I am now 15. My sister recently moved in with her boyfriend, so it's just me and my dad, he and I are very close.

My dad has been with his girlfriend, we'll call her E, for just over two years.

First, back in march of 2020, we went to dinner at hers one night, and then lockdown was announced. We had to stay at hers. This stressed me out a lot, I'm autistic and struggle to cope with unexpected things. I started to panic. E started making comments about how I should be able to cope since I was 13 (at the time) and her nine year old can handle it, so why can't I?

I brushed it off, it was a stressful time and I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She continued making the comments.

She would consistently make food I had told her I couldn't eat because of my texture issues, and she would laugh and say something like ""well now at least you can lose some weight"". I am recovering from an eating disorder and these comments really hurt me. I tried to ignore them, because my dad seemed to like her. 

Also in lockdown, in around late April, I came out to my dad as a lesbian. He was super supportive. That evening, E pulled me aside and told me not to talk about it in front of her kids because she didn't want me influencing them.

I gave her the benefit of the doubt yet again, even though my sister thought it was a bad sign.

On my fifteenth birthday in August, she kept trying to talk about how inappropriate it was that a young lady like me wanted to go to brooklands (an old racetrack and now an aeroplane/bus/car museum). I yet again brushed it off, but I felt like my day was totally ruined. 

The final straw, however, came at Christmas. This year, my dad and I spent Christmas with her family. It was a total disaster. She insisted I spend time with her children and not complain about the noise, even though she wouldn't allow me to wear my ear defenders. E also rationed the amount of food I was allowed, ending up with me eating less than her eight year old son.

Finally, we sat down to watch a film. This film had a gay character, who was often made the butt of the jokes. E was happy to laugh at the homophobic jokes very loudly, even though I was clearly uncomfortable. I had had enough and left the room in tears.

My dad came to ask me what was the matter and everything just spilled out. I told him how much I hated E and how she made my life miserable when I was around her. I told him that she wasn't a good person, he told me to try harder and He told me not to be so rude about E and left. I felt really horrible afterwards.

804,t3_ru8amw,AITA for getting mad at my friend for getting drunk too quickly and going to have a nap?,"So my (f18) friend (f18) invited me to come spend New Year’s Eve with her in a different city from home. We both wanted to get drunk for New Years and wouldn’t have been able to do that at home. 

She lives in a different city to me for uni and so I don’t get to see her very often. The agreement was that I would spend New Years at her flat but her two flatmates would be there as well

Of course I couldn’t object to the two flatmates being there, it’s their flat as well but from the one time I met them and all the stuff she’s told me about them, I really don’t like them. They seem rude, mean and not easy to get along with. 

My friend knows this but assured me that the two of us could spend time together without them. 

The day before New Year’s Eve we spent pretty much the whole day with them which upset me a little bit as I really wanted some time with just my friend. 

So on New Year’s Eve, my friend ate basically nothing (anyone who drinks knows this is a very bad idea before drinking because it’ll get you drunk incredibly quickly.) and started drinking at 3ish. I told her she needed to eat something and that we should pace ourselves if we were going to make it for the next 9 hours. 

Of course she didn’t listen to me and by about 7 o’clock she was completely drunk. She then leaves me to go have a nap for 2 hours to try sober up a little, leaving with me two almost complete strangers who both neither like me in return. 

I’m not mad that she got drunk or anything, she’s an adult and she can handle herself. But I did tell that I was upset that we hardly got to spend any time together and that she ditched me with people who are strangers to me. I know that if I’d done the same with her and my flatmates she wouldn’t have spoken to me for a few days.

805,t3_ru89xu,"AITA for refusing to force my son to apologize to my wife for ""ruining"" her New Years toast speech?","Important context:

My son ‘Finn’ (18) is from a previous relationship. Since early childhood I had full custody; his mother is not in the picture. We were both young when he was born, so his childhood was a little unstable for a bit. However, I have my life together now. I got married when he was 7, and together me (m37) and my wife ‘Mary’ (f40) live as a blended family, with my two stepsons ‘Cody’ (16) and ‘Lucas’ (18). 

Yet, I have noticed some issues. Finn is a very sensitive kid, and Cody and Lucas are nothing like this. So, altogether, they tend to get along for a bit, like most kids do, and then have fights. It’s always Cody and Lucas vs Finn, which is a bit upsetting, but again – kids fight. Everyone gets disciplined and these fights were pretty normal stuff, arguing about games, tv, etc. However, recently, I have noticed them get a little political. The boys tend to disagree about topics like these, so I’ve banned it at the dinner table.

Finn then came out to us as bisexual this year. My wife is Christian; so are the boys. I’ve always been unlabelled, open to it, but not entirely into organised religion. Due to this my wife used unfortunate phrasing, like calling him confused and saying that he was too young to know for sure. I told her at the time to respect how he identifies. My logic is - so what if it changes? You need to support your kids regardless. So, that was that dropped. The boys seemed confused by it, but they didn’t say anything in front of me after that.

Overall, I thought it went well. All the worrying behaviour Finn displayed – staying out late, being withdrawn, etc. seemed to fade away for a good week, like a weight had been lifted.

Then it started up again and came to a head on New Year’s. My wife traditionally cooks a big dinner for New Years, we have a few family members over, and we all say things that we are thankful to God for, and how we’re going to improve ourselves. She was giving her speech, which was all about how family was the most important thing in life and how we should be grateful to each other, to which Finn gets visibly upset to the point of tears. He stands up and says that that was ironic, considering the things they say to him. I asked what he meant, and it all came out that the boys had started making gay jokes frequently and that my wife, separate to that, had started scaring him by showing him worrying statistics about LGBT youth/bisexual men. I was stunned and disturbed when this came to light. Finn was crying and left the room after exposing all the things they’d been saying without my knowledge. I left the party to comfort him while my wife continued hosting.

So, my wife thinks he’s humiliated her in front of the family, ruined the night, and overreacted to things and thinks he should apologise to her, the boys and the family. I, however, have refused and this has caused a big argument between us. Am I the asshole for refusing to make him say sorry? I think my wife owes him one.",15641.0

I f25 gave birth to my daughter weeks ago, My experience was pretty traumatic and since it was my first, I had no clue what to expect. Forgive me for the vague details for privacy but I'll mention all the relevent stuff, I promise.

When I went into labor I had the most difficult time of my life, I was in pain for hours. My mom was with me but she had to go and my husband was with me the entire time. I did something so embarrasing in the delivery room, I pooped myself which was unexpected and just...I don't know but it was embarrassing and although my medical team were very professional about it, my husband couldn't help himself and started laughing about it later and even telling my family about it but they didn't react, just didn't find it funny and neither did I, In fact, I found it embarrassing and I already told him to stop bringing it up especially when he started joking about getting me diapers for my ""opsies!!"". It got really tiring and chipped away from my selfesteem and confidence.


We were with his parents celebrating new year's eve together when I excused myself to the bathroom. while I was getting up he made a quick remark and said ""oh yeah, you should go quickly because we don't want any accidents just like the one we had at the hospital, you know what I mean?"" While blinking at me. His family actually laughed and BIL commented ""good one!"". I was astonished and so angry and ashamed, I literally just lost it on him and yelled at the top of my lungs calling him a cruel insensitive jerk to be using the difficult experience of birthing his child as a joking matter and humiliating me infront of everybody. He was shocked, staring back at me and not saying a word. All went silent and I just stormed off to the bathroom til we left and that was when he snapped saying I messed up by talking to him like that infront of his family during dinner, I said I couldn't hold my tongue for that long and after he kept joking about an embarrassing thing when I told him to stop. he said he was just joking and I went overboard with my reaction and also, I should've sucked it up and waited til we got home so we could address this privately and I could even yell at him as long as I wanted.

My partners mum is notorious for buying us random, unwanted gifts (e.g. clothing or jewellery that is not mine or partners taste, random household items that we don't need or want etc). She always buys these things without asking. When we receive these things, my partner is usually very blunt and tells them he doesn't like the gifts, and he'd rather straight money if they want to give him anything. But he takes the gifts. I usually say thank you, and I accept the gifts and say something along the lines of ""you didn't need to do that"".

After their coffee, they decided that they wanted to go to the art gallery too. Since we had already seen it, and we knew his parents would not take long to have a look, we decided to wait in the car. 

Partners mum comes out of the gallery carrying an art piece that we had seen in there. It's a wood carving which has creepy faces, and is generally not to our taste. My partner immediately said ""I hope you're taking that home with you because we don't want it"". His mum just did a small nod. His dad didn't hear this because he was still in the gallery. 

We get home (much later in the day, and about 2 hours away from the art store) and his parents present us with this art piece. They said it's a gift for us. Again, my partner was very blunt and said that he had told his mum he didn't want it. Usually I graciously accept these things, but I knew that this piece had cost them over $300, and the truth was that it was never going to be displayed or appreciated in our house. I said thank you, but if they like it, it should go to their home.

Partners dad said we can't deny it because it's a gift, but we insisted that if they like it, it should go home with them. Eventually they agreed that they would take it home, but it's too big to go on the plane, so they'll have to organise freight for it. They eventually said it was okay, and agreed that art is subjective, but they seemed quite hurt.

There was so much beautiful art that we would have loved, but this particular piece was so far from our taste. And it's not a cheap thing that I would feel comfortable  about putting away in a cupboard so as to avoid hurting their feelings. This was quite expensive. 

After they tried to give us the carving, and we rejected it, I (secretly) went to our bedroom and had a little cry. I've been feeling terrible about this for hours now, and I wonder whether we should have just accepted it and said nothing.

810,t3_ru7sfd,AITA for refusing going in Holiday with Mother-in-law?,"My (29f) husbands (30m) mom is a really cool person, I want to state that right away - she is not some cliche mother-in-law from hell at all, but she is the type of person who clings to her son and expects him to make her his first priority in life. He is not giving in to this at all and he lets her know that he has his own family now, etc. I do think she kinda made him her surrogate husband when he was younger. She lives 1,30 hours away from our city, so we visit her every month for a couple of days and weekend because we can both work from home, I think this is important to note. Its not like we see her only for Christmas..

Her birthday is on 12th of August. We live in a country that has its own big seaside and summer is the holiday season where we all plan our vacations around end of July/beginning of August. I love going with our friends, the sea, the parties, eating out every night (delicious sea food..) and I wait for that time the whole year. We always make our plans around her birthday which I totally understand. We usually go to the sea for holiday and then on the way back to our city we make a stop for 2/3 days in her city to be with her. Last year we went for her 50th birthday on a full 7 days holiday with her and the year before that we went for 4 days. I understood that because it was her 50th birthday and reaching that age is more special in our country. 

However, yesterday she calls my husband and says that she went ahead and booked 6 days trip the beginning of August for her, her bf and us to “certain holiday place” that she wants to visit for her birthday. Not only that but this holiday place is in another country so there is no way we can combine our own holiday with hers. Well, I got upset. I spoke to my husband that I dont think its okay for her to just plan a holiday without even asking if we agree to this, even if its her birthday and even if she is paying, especially during the holiday season which I really prefer to spend with friends (spend 6 days with friends and then 2-3 days with her, her birthday fall on Friday this year, so we can spend the friday and weekend with her). Also, we have to take those days from our paid vacation time, its not like we dont have work or we can just take whatver days we want so we can just go with her and then with friends. He said he is going to talk to her but its hard  for him and we gotta come up with a compromise.

I feel like TA because its his mothers birthday and maybe its not right to make a big fuss about it, but I realy think that its not okay to just book 6 days without even asking. She is not alone as well, she has friends, she has a bf, she could always do the holiday trip with them and then have the weekend with us, but my husband says she wants to spend it with us (well him mostly). 

Just to mention and give some other perspective, my mother always asks us if we have the time for a trip for her birthday and if we dont she goes with dad and her friends and then we do a dinner with her.",13.0
811,t3_ru7oas,AITA for telling my sister it's her fault nobody likes her husband?,"I'm asking you please to engage in cultural relativity here. You don't have to like our practices, just temporarily accept them to understand this post.

We are from a culture where its customary that a dowry is paid when a woman is married - this a customary marriage (CM) and what one must do in order to start a life.The CM serves many purposes: it shows you that a man is serious about you: he'll have worked to save and declare his commitment to you and your family; it joins your family to his; its the right way to marry a woman; it honours a womans parents, family and community, and it let's the ancestors know you're leaving the home.The CM is one of the core principles of our society: we're a family oriented people and that's how families are forged. 

Now my sister decided to marry a yt man who's not from our culture. He refused to marry her customarily because it was ""demeaning"", ""barbaric"" and ""backwards"".everyone advised her not to marry a man who viewed her that way but she stuck to him and had a European marriage ceremony. Our parents weren't supportive but they did attend the church ceremony.

This is already a *huge* faux pas in our culture. To add insult to injury, her husband is consistently rude and disrespectful to our culture. They live together in our home country. 

He comes into my parents home and refers to them by their first names. This is not done with anyone older than you, especially not your in laws. My parents try to look beyond the absence of a customary marriage and treat him like their SiL anyway, but he throws it back in their face each time. The other men who've married into the family have get togethers and days out: he was invited once then never again. I recently had a baby and my parents slaughtered a cow to host a feast, something that wasn't done when my sister had hers. My mums also moved in temporarily to help me as a first time mum while she only daily visited my sister.

She came crying about preferential treatment and everyone's mean to them. I have a new born: I'm tired and I'm not in the mood. I said It's her fault she's treated the way she is. She chose to abandon her culture to appease a man who thinks shes beneath him. She then never taught him the culturally appropriate way to behave or conduct himself and he's consistently disrespectful. He has an energy about him that reminiscent of colonial settlers and, duh, none of us like it. The cow that was slaughtered was one that my husband gave as part of my marriage agreement: her husband never did that so there's no cow to kill.
She chose to carve her own path and turn her back on our ways - nobody forced her to stick to our customs, so she can't force us to stickto our end of the deal. She wants to nice parts of our culture without going through the proper channels: she wants to have her cake and eat it. I told her she was in a mess of her own making. She could either rectify it or learn to live with it. Aita?

Also, I feel being asked if we've learnt his culture is kinda ridiculous given how we're a former colony of his country and his culture is dominant pretty much globally. I can guarantee most people who have been victims of western imperialism - that is to say basically everyone outside Europe -  have at least a basic understanding of your cultures. Forced assimilation and colonialism meant we had no choice but.

The name thing - I know it seems minor to westerners. You don't call people by their first names here unless they're a child. Anyone older than you you don't call by your first name. Your in laws you're supposed to call your parents because you and your spouse are one. If for example your own parents are mum and dad, you may call your in laws ma and pa. Not comfortable with that? No problem: call them Mr and Mrs, call them aunty and uncle - anything thay recognises their position to you. This is about humbling yourself and showing respect to your elders no matter how old you are.

812,t3_ru7ng3,AITA for asking my husband to fake enjoying Christmas?,"Christmas has always been a favorite holiday of mine, and the time with family has only become more important to me over time, even though I am not Christian. My (31F) husband (34M) is the complete opposite. He does not like Christmas, does not like to celebrate it, and finds family celebrations tedious. He is a areliguous like me, but doesn't enjoy  the holiday as a cultural holiday like I do.  

We spent almost a week with his side of the family for Christmas this year and got some great family time in. Christmas with them looks different than it does with my side of the family, but it's an enjoyable time. We had some good family time, some great food, and got to watch the kids open presents. The adults mostly stick to exchanging cash. We did a small gift exchange with my side of the family after we got back in town, and after an hour my husband was texting me that he was ""over"" Christmas. He opened gifts but showed little enthusiasm or gratitude, and actively seemed to pretend he didn't like them even though he later admitted he did. After the gifts he fell asleep with his head down on the dining room table, so I packed up our things and we left after 2 total hours. I was really upset since I had been looking forward to my family's Christmas, and we had a pretty chilly night between us. 

We've been together for a long time and my husband maintains that he does NOT want gifts. He even wrote a letter to me the next day to try and express how uncomfortable it makes him. This year I helped out my family with his gifts by ordering him things he already said he wanted, and then giving them to my family for them to wrap and give to him. This way he would only get things he actually wants (which has been a problem in the past). He felt hurt and undermined by this strategy, when I thought it was a good compromise. I've told my family multiple times he doesn't want presents, but gift giving is a huge part of how my family celebrates and I do not think I'll ever convince them to opt out of giving him something.

We have fought about this every year for the last 8+ years and I'm not sure where to go from here. This is our biggest argument every year. I think he should fake a couple hours of enjoyment a couple of days each year for my sake, and he thinks me making him receive gifts is intolerable. I maintain that I can't control what other people do or do not get him, and he maintains that it is a surefire way to put him in such a bad mood that we have to leave quickly.

We are in an interracial marriage, him being white (German) and me black. We both speak English as our home language, however, his family speaks German as their first language. 

I’ve gone on holidays with his family when we were dating and even stayed with his parents for two months before we purchased our house. Whenever I’ve been around his family the language spoken was 85% English and 15% German, I understand basic German words. For our first holiday as a married couple we decided to spend about 5 days with my family and 10 with his as his sister flew down especially for this holiday. Now the problem is that since we’ve been on holiday his family speaks 95% German and only 5% English on the dinner table, alienating me from the conversation.

I raised this with him and he said he’d fix it. Yesterday during dinner he started replying to his family in English, hoping they would also switch to English but this never happened, it was still 95% German. I lost my cool this morning when we were all having breakfast and his mom prayed in German, she mentioned everyone on the table except for me during the prayer. The conversation then proceeded to be 100% German with absolutely no English. I finished my breakfast, got up and went straight to pack my bags. My husband could tell that I was upset. I told him
I’m going home to enjoy the last 7 days of my holiday in peace. He proceeded to say I’m overreacting &amp; that everyone just forgets to switch to English, it’s not personal and he’s gonna fix it. He had 3 days to fix it and did nothing.

818,t3_ru731z,AITA for not wanting my soon to be mother in law to help with my wedding planning?,"I have known my fiance, JP, for 8 years and been dating for over 2, just after his enlistment in the Navy. He proposed just before Christmas this year.

JP’s parents are divorced &amp; live 5 hrs apart. JP got leave for the holidays &amp; the plan was to spend time with his dad this year as he hasn’t gotten to in a few years. This plan changed so we only had a few days with dad &amp; many more with mom. After getting back from time with dad is when JP proposed. 

JP’s dad did know about the proposal as well as my parents. He knew because of the OG plan being with him &amp; needing help finding a place to do it &amp; my parents knew because JP asked for their support beforehand. His mom did not know. I did not want any family there as I preferred it to be more intimate. JP delivered on this, &amp; it was perfect. 

The day after the proposal was the first Christmas gathering with his mom’s family. We wanted to surprise her so we pulled her into a side room to tell her the happy news. 

His mom gave a very fake, half smile &amp; muttered out a “congrats.” I had held my hand out with my ring but she didn’t even look at it. My fiancé made a joke about how she was speechless, to which his mom said, “well, I said congrats.” My fiancé gave her a hug, &amp; then she asked if we had a date set. We do not &amp; we told her as such, &amp; that was the end of that conversation. There was now a very thick tension between us &amp; it was very awkward for the rest of the night. To say it hurt would be an understatement as I had always thought we got along great, that she loved me, &amp; was telling the truth when she had talked about me being a part of the family. I can’t even imagine how my fiancé felt &amp; still feels about it, being that is his mom who reacted so poorly.

The next day at another mom’s side gathering, I was talking to a cousin about the proposal and how my parents knew. My soon to be MIL overheard &amp; cornered JP about it. He brushed it off saying they didn’t really know details, just that it was going to happen &amp; they were not there. 

The day after Christmas, JP’s mom texted him at 2 am to meet him out in the car. I stayed up until he got back after 3 am. She had driven around and asked him about my parents knowing. She then asked to be a part of the wedding planning &amp; helping set up when the day comes. 

I am fine with her helping set up. I know I wont be able to do it. My real issue lies with the planning. 

She was not at all excited &amp; it hurt both JP &amp; I a lot. She also did not ask me &amp; I am half of the wedding! It is our wedding &amp; not hers. As well, I have a much different taste, being more moody &amp; elegant, vs her Christian decor, burlap, and mason jars. Nothing is wrong with that, it just is not me or JP. I don’t want that forced on the wedding. I also am not Christian, &amp; do not want her to try and convert me during this, which she has kinda brought up before.

She told my sis after a fight (when she kissed my then boyfriend 3h after we broke up) that she is jealous of me for getting prettier, thinner and smarter. We made up and talked about it and everything was good.
Fast forward, I met this boy, all happy for 4 years, we took a break, he kissed a girl that me and J considered not good looking way before that. We made up, had couple therapy, all happy, we're now engaged after 8years of relationship(can also extend this if necessary).
Fast forward, 1 year ago she gets into a relationship with a toxic, manipulative guy. I support her decision of continuing the relationship, but I also state my concerns when she finds out he was flirting with another, only stopped when she refused seeing.him(that i stated is pretty when she asked, before telling me what happened; i wouldn t have lied, but i would have said she is not bad looking-better phrasing) and played the victim when he got caught. She tells me she feels bad seeing me and my boyfriend and him being so nice to me when her boyfriend is such a di*k so I avoid talking about my relationship or even her seeing us together. 
We were both unemployed at 24 even though we finished good universities, but then I lended this job which led me to a nice life 4 years later and she s still struggling with her job. I avoid talking about it with her, I have only told her when I got promoted only because she asked me if i got them.

She gets mad, starts attacking me about how i make her feel bad with my life being better, when in fact it isn t since i got lucky with the job and how my fiancé is a di*k as much as her boyfriend if not more of a di*k cause her bf just flirted, while mine kissed her.
She kept on with this and I said that i feel like she isn t even my friend and instead of being happy for me, she just makes me feel bad for how my life is to which she replied ""it only started because you can t stand that yhe girl is prettier than u"".

Me: How much are you willing to sell for just one?

Her: I'm sorry I don't even look at the Facebook no more

Then she sent two pics of the aquarium. No prices. It's clearly used, not ""brand new,"" since it's been set up with everything minus the fish.

I tried to end the convo with ""I'm not interested since you're not giving me a price after I've been asking for it from the start. Good luck.""

Right now there spending New Years with us and it has been terrible in every way and I got interested why her and my grandfather divorced and why she doesn’t have a good reality with her children so I called my mom and she didn’t tell me. So instead I asked me uncle who I love very much. He told me she had a to year affair with D. When my uncle went on a soccer trip she just packed her bags and left without telling either of them. She did this for money as my grandfather wasn’t rich at the time and she wanted a man with more money. She went of and married D and moved across the country and caused so many trust issues for my grandfather and my uncle. After I heard this I saw red my aunt told me this was years ago and didn’t affect me so I should just ignore it. But I can’t ignore it I can’t look at her without anger in my eyes and to stop me from cursing her out I haven’t talked to her or D cause they don’t deserve anything except for little one word responses with a lot of anger in them. My Amin told me that this made my grandmother sad and feel like she wasn’t important to me and I said that I didn’t care what she thought cause she was a bad mom to her kids and a terrible grandmother who doesn’t just get to have a relationship with me. She’s leaving tomorrow and I need to now if AITAH? Btw my uncle was 13 when she left.

Edit to Add: Someone told me to add that my grandmother is still abusive and a bad person who was fat shamed my sister causing her Ed called me fat after learning about me Ed and making fun of me for not eating not knowing anything about any of her grandkids and causing me at 12 to baby sit children cause she didn’t know how to do it making me my grandmother’s babysitter for her babysitting",4.0
825,t3_ru5s84,AITA for ruining my hardwood floor?,"I [13 M] am really emotionally weak. It might come from trauma, it might just be that I'm weird, but I cry pretty easy. My parents, however, aren't fans of this. They teach me how to do things my throwing me out of the nest and seeing if I fly. 

So when I don't know how to do something, they usually repeat the same unhelpful instructions. They get frustrated, I get stressed, I start crying, they start yelling. I've been trying to break the cycle.

My dad asks me to clean under my bed once a month, and expects me to move it aside. I try pushing it, but just see that I'm going to scrape the floor. I'm definitely not strong enough to pick it up, so I just crawl under it to pick stuff up from there.

I'm pretty skinny and flexible, but can't reach a certain part of my bed. So I just leave it there thinking ""it's just some wrappers"". What I didn't know, is that when my parents get fed up with the dog, they toss him in my room at night. Causing him to sleep under my bed, and pee on the floor where I can't get it.

The smell of my room started to become worse and worse with the odor of urine becoming too strong, so I threw out my rug because I thought the dog might be peeing on that.

Today my dad took apart my bed and moved it aside to renovate my room. Lifting it up, there was a huge stain(?) of pee under my bed. He told me that I clearly don't give a shit about this house, and it would cost over $5,000 trying to fix it.

I knew that my family wasn't the most financially stable, and I didn't want to cause more issues. I start crying and asking how I didn't know that it was there.

He started yelling even louder, claiming that I'm spewing crocodile tears. I feel so bad up to this point that I just lock myself in the bathroom to re-collect.

I hear my mom talking to my dad about the possibility of me being a sociopath, and that she doesn't know what to do with me anymore. I don't know if I'm in the wrong or not, because I truthfully didn't know. But on the other hand, I should've worked harder and just lifted the thing. AITA?",13.0

828,t3_ru5f4s,AITA for leaving the shift?,"I moved jobs in September and still do the odd bank shift at my old job. I'm a nurse. They requested I stay on as bank to help out.

My current manager agreed for me to do bank but if there's covid at my old place I'm not allowed. Makes sense, we work with vulnerable people and don't want to spread it. Told my managers at my old place this and it was agreed if they knew of covid in the building that they would tell me and would need yo rearrange covering the shift.

Old place has 2 units but the staff switch around. Heard in handover that the other unit has covid. Staff that work on both units have tested positive. Explained I would need to leave.

The other nurse gives me attitude that it's only on the other unit at the minute, states I ""should have rang to check"" and ""Well I don't know where you're going to work because everywhere is like this"". To be honest they gave me a lot of other attitude too. I reiterated the agreement and left. Shift was 7am start on a weekend so I let the manager from there know but I'm not expecting a response until later today.

I get it sucks for the other nurse but this is a clause in the agreement and I could face disciplinary for not sticking with it. Nevermind could spread illness to my current unit.

829,t3_ru5dre,AITA for making my husband do skincare with me ?,"UPDATE: I wasn't really going to post any update because in hindsight it was pretty stupid of me to post something here and not really that big of deal, but since people are still commenting here is one - So my husband spent the day with few of his friends and they might have sensed something because they asked and he told what happened and well everyone laughed because it was a pretty stupid argument and they said it really was not big of deal for men to take care of their skin these days and they were infact jealous that I was the one applying things to his skin.
For context, and I think I should have mentioned it before, we are Asians and I am assuming in west, there is more taboo regarding men using skincare products and makeup because here now days, a lot of men especially the young ones have more rigorous skincare routine than most women and it is not considered weird and even encouraged so you can look young and good. My husband even carries lipbalm and hand cream with him in his car to use (assuming it's not common to do in whichever countries the commentators are from). He never used anything on his face because he thought that since he already has good skin he wouldn't need anything.

Anyways, when he came back we had a conversation and we even apologised at the same time ! I apologised for my remark and forcing him to to do something he clearly dint like and he apologised because he was somewhat embarassed at what his cousins said, he dint hate the routine and enjoyed it. So to make up we put masks on each other and sent a selfie on the group chat which has all of his cousins because he said they had no business joking about him but surprisingly there were no jokes or remarks this time. I guess the jokes on the get together were because they couldn't imagine my husband who normally has a serious personality to be the one taking care of his skin. So thank you to everyone who commented, even to people who called me creepy and weird and manipulative. The lesson I learnt is that I shouldn't be be posting relationship issues on net because imo it's difficult for people to judge without knowing the personalities of the people involved and having an in depth knowledge of the issue. Thank you everyone and I hope you have a good year !!  







Throwaway because my husband is on Reddit and obligatory English is not my first language ! 

My (28F) husband (30M) have been together for 7 years and have a 4 year old son together. My husband has a job which require him to be outdoor some times. He is a very good looking person with an amazing skin that doesn't really tan and doesn't require a lot of looking after tbh. Still since last year I started making him do a simple skincare routine with me at night and use sunscreen before going to work. I will be honest that he was not really keen on it at first. He thought of it as a hassle. I said that I would be the one putting everything on him and he just had to wash his face and sit still. I put on a moisturiser , a serum and under eye cream on him. On weekends we also do face masks. Over time it has become a sort of a bonding time for us especially the weekend mask routine and he remarked how it made his skin soft and felt refreshing  Last week we had a family get together and my son must have blurted out this in front of someone(I don't really know how or what exactly happened, I asked my son later at night but he said he forgot haha) because his brother and few of his cousins made few jokes about how it's a girly thing to do or something similar. Few other family members joined but since according to me it was not really malicious and my husband also dint really get angry, I laughed politely and left it at that. 

But since then he has refused to do the nightly routine or the face mask routine. I thought he was joking at first but he said he was serious and he really dint need any of it because his skin condition is great and none of his friends or male cousins do it. I said I thought the face mask routine on weekends was a bonding time for both of us that we both loved but he said he only took part in to make me happy. I also asked why did he then say that all of this did made him feel refreshed but he said that while it did, it wasn't all worth the hassle. I was really sad because he was not really doing anything except sitting on bed and washing his face and I was the one putting stuff on him. I asked him if he would be alright with just putting on a sunscreen and doing the weekend routine but he refused outright. I then angrily said that none of what his cousins or his brother said was maliciously and he shouldn't have such a fragile ego. We argued about it and have this weird atmosphere between us since morning ( all of this happened yesterday) I don't think I am wrong because everyone should have a skincare routine and wear a sunscreen but maybe it's not correct to force him if he is really so averse to the idea ?",4.0
830,t3_ru5bi2,AITA for discouraging my friend from pursuing his “dream”?,"So this is a situation between me (22m) and my lifelong friend (22m) who I’ll call Liam. Liam has always been the type to love attention, and I don’t blame him. He grew up in very awful circumstances (abusive alcoholic father, overcrowded household, etc.) and never got a lot of attention from the people he looked up to. He’s always told me that my family has felt like his second family and my father became one of his role models as we grew up together. We were like brothers for a long time. 

So here’s the thing. I decided at the end of high school I was going to pursue medical school, and came up with my plan. He then decided about a day later he was going to do the exact same thing. Like the EXACT same thing. No big deal, it’d be fun to have my friend on this journey with me. 

Fast forward 4 years I’m about to graduate college and apply to med school. I’ve worked really hard to keep my grades up and do well on my entrance exams and maintain extracurricular experiences. My friend received an institutional action his freshman year and then took a leave of absence due to poor financial planning. Yet he still tells everyone he’s going to med school and even gives unqualified medical advice at times. Again, I feel this is all for attention. 

He recently reached out to me saying how uncertain his future was and how he wished he had been as “lucky” as me. This is where our argument started. My success wasn’t luck. I worked my ass off for 4 years while he was out partying and doing irresponsible things. 

I told him this, as copied from my text: “Look Liam. You know I care about you but I think you should reevaluate what you’re doing right now. You say being a doctor is your dream but you haven’t done anything to prove that to admissions officers. People don’t overcome institutional actions and sub-2.5 GPAs easily, these things can take years to correct. I think you should really evaluate your decision and either commit yourself fully to this goal, or you should try to find fulfillment elsewhere.”

And he blew up on me saying I’ve been a fake friend all these years and how I used him to get to the point I am today. I replied with some stuff I probably shouldn’t have. I said his past shows he wouldn’t be a good doctor because he’s abused a power dynamic to get with a girl younger than him in the past and that makes him untrustworthy as a medical provider. 

He told me to burn in hell and never to talk to him again. Then slandered me on social media before blocking me.

831,t3_ru598q,AITA? Issues with Parents,"I have a very strained relationship with my father and I try to avoid him and having to talk to him at all cost because I always get disappointed. My father puts himself above me in every situation and i see him as a very selfish person. 

He’s always been that way since the day i was born when he started smoking cigarettes right next to me as a baby because he was too lazy to move elsewhere and didn’t really care, even though i’ve talked to him about it he’s like “i’m sorry” yet to this day smokes in the house and car when I’m there. I’ve had issues with my breathing growing up because of that. 

My parents divorced and remarried 3 times each since i was 6 and we barely saw my father especially after he forced me to live half way across the world with my sister and mom when i was 12 and we lived there for 4 years when I didn’t even know the alphabet of the language the education system was taught with there. Also forced us to stay there in a desert climate country with the only thing keeping us cool is a fan we as kids were forced to pay for ourselves and very poor nutrition sometimes barely able to eat for the day (it was not like this when we lived in USA). I’ve been to over 10 different schools and lived in 4 different places before i was even 18. 

My parents never saved a penny for my education or health costs which i had to pay for myself and my dad would say “I don’t have any money” and always goes on to me about all the bills he pays for to keep a roof over my head. Yet even when he got an accident settlement over 100k 3 years b4 I graduated he spent it on getting married and sponsoring his wife to bring her over to live with us which i wasnt comfortable with and wanted him to wait till i graduated (I’m a 23 yo male) like he waited for my older sister. He also spent it on his house, bought some land, and got my sister married with it. He told me to take out a loan when i asked for just 1k of my education expenses (he paid thousands on my sisters education). The good hes done is keep a roof over my head, kept me fed, and helped me partially pay for my used car.",0.0
832,t3_ru53qx,AITA for telling my friend's ex in highschool to harshly get lost?,"Throwaway due to some reasons.

So back in 2017, when I(19) was in Highschool my friend ""David"" Had a boyfriend named ""sam"".

David genuinely liked sam however he was a total creep. As an example, sam never showed affection to david unless it was s*xual. And often would dismiss his feelings. Even so far to call David harsh names when he refused his advances. Which had david feeling down for a while and it took some time for him to be his old self again.

But when david broke up with sam, sam would constantly stare at david, or anyone else in our friend group. Which creeped us out alot. He would also ask how was david doing constantly even though he never cared when they were together.

When we graduated, no one heard anything from sam until about 3 days ago. My friend ""emma"" ended up getting a message from him on insta asking what's up. She didn't respond and blocked him. Turns out, he's been contacting the whole friend group (6 of us total). 

When one of us actually responded he wanted to know how David was doing and he looked ""cute"" in his posts yet never responded to his dms. Which just set us all off since David blocked him on all socials once they broke up. And David said he still had him blocked.

He ended up contacting me and I just went off on him, calling him a creep and a few words I can't say here. Apparently he made a post on us saying he never asked to get ""harrassed"" and just wanted to"" reconnect""

833,t3_ru52ks,WIBTA for not inviting someone’s girlfriend of 3 years to my wedding?,"My fiancé and I recently got engaged. We are starting the wedding guest list.

Context:

His girlfriend has 

1. Yelled at me publicly in a bar and called me a slut because her boyfriend said I was dressed nice. 

2. Cursed at me publicly in a bar because a bartender gave me a free shot. 

3. Ignored me for 3 weeks because I got a new pet and didn’t send her photos as fast as she wanted. 

4. Ignored me for 3 months because I was having lunch with a friend and she happened to go to the same lunch spot and was mad she wasn’t invited. 

5. Yelled at me wearing a crop top because she wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing one. 

6. Just lots of stuff where she ignores me over petty stuff or verbally attacks me in public. 

Why is she like this? No idea. Why is her boyfriend with her? No idea. The boyfriend is amazing and a really good friend to my fiancé and a totally normal mature person. 

My fiancé understands i don’t want her at the wedding so he is okay not inviting his friend. I want him to be able to have his friend though but I will not allow someone who treats me like that to attend our wedding.

834,t3_ru4ce4,AITA for not wanting my parents to call me obedient?,"For context: My parents are Chinese immigrants. The most common  ''compliment'' I've heard up until now is how obedient I am.

But recently I just couldn't stand them calling me this, I want to be independent and have my own thoughts, I don't want to just follow them around like a dog following its master.

Today I (18M) brought this up to them when my dad (50M) said I was obedient and while he didn't react much, my mom (50F) completely lost it. She went on a rant about how she's Chinese and how in our culture obedience is a virtue. How she'll always be Chinese and how she doesn't understand western culture. I personally never even thought of this as an Asian v. western thing. She cried and said that everyday for the rest of her life she would remember that I don't want to be obedient. I told her I didn't think it was this big of a deal and that it was just my personal preference for myself.

Trying to think of this from the others perspective, I know I can be a procrastinator and don’t want to do stuff especially if it’s right after I get off of work, but I don’t know, I think it’s reasonable to want a clean living room and kitchen. His room can be as messy as he wants.

Every time I ask him to clean up a mess he makes he just says “Yeah I know” and then doesn’t do it.

838,t3_ru44er,AITA for relaying the details of my illness to my squeamish father?,"I, (18F) am home on break from university. My father and I generally have a positive relationship, although he has expected a lot in terms of household tasks since my mom passed a couple years back. Obviously, this doesn't apply since I've been away at school, but since coming home, I've been expected to do most of the housekeeping and childcare.

Generally, this doesn't bother me much aside from the occasional frustration. But, I recently had an unfortunate run-in with food poisoning, which left me unable/unwilling to keep up with the tasks. My dad is usually a pretty even-keeled guy, but if anything sets him off, it's coming home to a messy house.

So, he was a little upset after he got home that night, although he had seen me that morning and known I was sick, and came into my room to tell me how he had expectations if I wanted to live in his house and have my tuition paid. 

Here's where I may have crossed the line. Upset, I launched into a commentary on my illness. About how I'd been up every hour the night before and it was a both ends situation. You get the picture. This, in any case, would probably be in poor taste, but within my family, it's pretty well known that my father is very squeamish. One of my first memories of him was from when I got sick as a kid and he freaked out and made himself vomit. In short he doesn't do well with even verbal descriptions of vomit. As I was describing the details, he looked visibly nauseated, and left the room. He did not come back that evening, and he hasn't brought it up since.

839,t3_ru41xo,AITA for not paying for my food when my boyfriend ate it?,"Hi. Yesterday, as you all know was New Year. My boyfriend Alan (M26), a couple mutual friends and I (F26) went for out for dinner to celebrate at a restaurant. Just for extra information, I'm a little on the heavier side. I'm on diet currently trying to lose the extra lbs, and Alan knows.

At dinner, I ordered something called the ""Crispy lemon chicken with creamy parmesan spaghetti"". It looked so amazing, and I decided to give myself a treat after eating healthy for a while. Alan gave me a weird look when I ordered it, and said loudly to all my friends ""Woah, no more diet?"" which was kinda embarassing. Alan ordered a mushroom cauliflower rice with sweet peas.

The food came in about 20 minutes time, and to my shock, Alan immediately started digging into my spaghetti. I said ""Hey, that's my food"" and he laughed ""You can have mine, it looks nice."" I argued that I didn't order that (I sadly HATE cauliflower rice with a passion) but he said that I didn't need the extra calories. I would've grabbed back my food but I didn't want to embarass myself in front of everyone, so I angrily relented.

Later when we were footing the bill (we were all supposed to pay for our own meals), Alan asked me for $14 to cover my food (which was the cost of the spaghetti). I said that I wouldn't pay because I didn't get to eat it. He asked for $10 (price of the cauliflower rice), but I still disagreed, because I didn't order it. He got angry and said that I was acting like a golddigger. He said that I was an asshole.

My friends think he shouldn't have been rude to me, but that I should've paid for the cauliflower rice since I ate it. It's petty, but he's been bitching about me to people, so AITA?

Then she snaps and says so your saying I'm wrong and I just say well technically in a way anything anyone says can be wrong in a way and was going to continue to and say in someone's mind but she cuts me off and says so everything I say is wrong and gets very upset and goes up to her room 

My father sighs and tells me to apologize, but I instead excuse myself to the washroom to avoid this because I thought she overreacted but when dinner is done he tells my younger sister to get my mom, but she refuses, so he tells me to get her so I go up to her room and try to get downstairs but goes on to say things

You think everything I say is wrong

You think everything I do is a mistake

You always argue with me

Do you know how many nights I stay awake and worried because of you 

Do you know how many times you teachers called me about you

I tell multiple times that I don't hate her and explain what I meant to say but she won't listen and finally get upset when she says she won't eat dinner because I'll be there so I give up and fine then I'll eat after you guys and go down there stairs but my mom stays in the room and my dad tells me to try again, so I go back with him he just stands there and says nothing and my goes on about me and talks about I'm never happy and always negative and also says that my dad never does anything about me and my attitude. I also tell her that I don't think most people would react this way to what I said. But after able bit she just goes down no apologies, nothing

We all just go down and eat dinner normally, that's the thing with my family we can fight but it just stops and we act like it never happened, we don't talk about it and we don't really hold grudges 

Fights like this have happen before between me and my mother, she talks about my motivation in school, how if continue I won't make it through high school and not go to university

I think she overreacted, but also think at her perspective, I don't think she's a bad person or anything, she is trying her best and does a lot for me and my sister's future, she signs us up for classes, she foes the house work and expects more from us because how she was raised and I am not the best daughter nor person and feel a bit bad this situation.",2.0

I'm engaged but my family doesn't accept my fiancée at all in any way. She is persona non grata. They are against our whole relationship.

I was married before. So was my fiancée. We were both married when our relationship started (see my disclaimer above). For my part I did love my wife, but we had married young, we didn't live together beforehand and we were struggling with infertility which did a number. Since we are Catholic we didn't see most fertility treatments as an option. I should have acted better I know. My fiancée and her ex-husband and their families also went to our church, same as me and my wife and both of ours.

When my fiancée found out she was pregnant we made the decision to get divorces because we wanted to raise our child together. Neither my wife nor her husband wanted a divorce. Between them not wanting it and the law here that a divorce can't happen while a woman is pregnant (even if she wants it, the judge's hands are tied) it took a long time for both divorces to happen. My fiancée is pregnant with our second child, due this week. When the waiting period to get married again after divorce is up next month we will get married immediately. We have been ready for a long time. We can't have a Catholic wedding because neither of us were able to secure annulments which you need in the church if you want to get married again. Due to the pandemic and us wanting it done right away we are going to do a civil one at City Hall with no fuss. Both her family and mine have said they wouldn't attend even if we were having guests. Our families will see us on our own and our son but otherwise won't accept us being in a relationship. Both families are mad at us over the scandal it was in church. My family supports my ex-wife vs. my fiancée.

I told my family they need to accept my fiancée because we are getting married, she's the mother of my kids and she isn't going anywhere. My parents said I was being petulant, my siblings agree and so does my extended family. They say they don't have to after our actions. My fiancée had a similar conversation with her family but it went the same. My own brother said I'm the jerk and had nerve to make demands after how I acted. It's been hard, the lengthy divorce time, the denied annulments, that our son couldn't be baptized because we weren't married to other people and there were doubts he'd be raised Catholic due to our situation. Which will also apply to our new baby. Being called entitled on top of it was difficult. AITA here?",7.0
843,t3_ru3x6l,WIBTA if we decided to not have a friend moving in with us?,"I (24f) desprately needed to move out of my parent's house due to my mental health being totally shot from living with horrifically immature and abusive people. My sister (who is currently still living with them but far more on her feet than I am) gave me an escape and helped me move into an apartment with one of her friends who we'll call Beth and her BF Tim.

Now, I was warned by my sister who was warned by her friend Beth that Tim was really toxic and abusive, and my sister has made a plan that once I get on my feet, she, Beth, and I will all move out together and enjoy our freedom.

I moved in, aprehensive that I'll have to deal with some awful BS from him, and what I found was... an absolute gentleman. He says nothing but great things about Beth and how much she's worked on herself. He cooks and cleans regularly and communicates really well.  He doesn't expect anything from anyone other than rent (even then he's extremely flexible) and expresses gratitude for others as much as he can. 

No, he isn't perfect, and he clearly has trauma but when you talk to him he's very upfront and hates making anyone feel uncomfortable. He's been in therapy for years, is very interspective, and is actively trying to get on medication.

He does have an issue with rumination and going on tangents but if you communicate that you're overwhelmed he doesn't force it on you, and you can walk away. Of cource I know that dating him is a whole other story and if Beth doesn't find it good to be with him then I won't judge her for it, but from what I see I don't find him nearly as bad as how I was lead on.

Beth on the other hand is a whole other story. She also has trauma from an abusive past and Tim helped her away from that. She got a job and stuff but her depression and frankly awful attitude toward others is risking her chances at keeping it. While she claims otherwise, she comes off as totally codependant to him even to the point of him making sure she has enough to eat and isn't starving herself. There are times I try to connect to her but she's just instantly invalidating and hanging out with her boils down to staying in and watching movies.

When Tim talks about anything infront of her like expressing gratitude for having this really fortunate life and such awesome roomates she looks at me with a knowing glance. Yes, I have to leave room for him being manipulative, but I just can't help but feel bad for the guy. 

I was talking to my sister who had no idea the depth of the situation until I started living it, and she agrees that Beth seems to have catastrophized way more than what she led on. We're worried that if we have her move in with us then it's more likely for her to be a liability than an asset. We don't have the mental bandwidth to help her out of her depression the same way her BF seems to work tirelessly for her.

I'm scared that deciding to not let her moving in with us would be a dick move given the fact that Tim letting me move in allowed me to get on my feet.",9.0
844,t3_ru3wc6,AITA for throwing out the gifts I got my friends?,"Disclaimer: typing from phone

To preface this I am from a foreign country and this is the first time I’m spending the holidays without any family. Also I live with someone however they have the rona so I would be alone for the holidays. 

For Christmas I traveled and visited another country with my family while in the country I decided to get some gifts for my friends and told them that I got them presents.

Fast forward to New Year’s I realize that I would be completely by myself as my roommate had rona and left the apartment. So I asked my friends what they were planning on doing for New Year’s so that I wouldn’t spend it alone. My friend group which consist of six people (me being the newest addition) all texted me that they were gathering at one of their house. 

At first I thought they were going to invite me but no one said anything so I ended up asking if I could come and also bring my best friend as she has planned on spending the holidays alone but was driving 3+ hours to come see me. 

The response I got from one of my friends was basically “yeah we’ll see how the vibe is and let you know”. No I am a little bit hurt but I understood that maybe they wanted to spend the holiday amongst the original friend group. However, because they knew I was spending the holidays alone I thought they would at least invite me. 

Anyways, ended up throwing away all of the presents that I got them after they texted me the morning after asking when I could drop off the presents I got them. I told them that I threw away the present and now they’re all acting off with me.

845,t3_ru3ry5,AITA for threatening to sell my husband’s stuff?,"My (36F) husband (49M) have been together 18 years. Money has always been a problem between us - I am frugal, and he is not. We have always kept separate bank accounts and split expenses, depending on how much each of us was making. After I graduated from college, I began making more money than him. I covered most of our living expenses at that time. Then we began making roughly the same amount and started splitting our expenses 50/50. 

The problem is like I said, he isn’t good with money. It’s cost me significantly financially because he is so bad with money. He makes irresponsible decisions and spends recklessly. So over the years, I have picked up more than my half, even when he was out-earning me by a lot. He wasn’t always honest with me as far as how much he was making, and I wouldn’t find out until we filed taxes, then I realized he was making way more than my pay and having me pay for 75-80% of our expenses.

When COVID hit, I was laid off. He reassured me that he would pay for things and I wouldn’t have to worry. Well, he did for 3 months. Then he decided he was going to quit his very well paying job, that we could have easily lived off of alone, and open his own business from home. I was not happy about this because I felt like it wasn’t a good idea when I wasn’t working and was having a hard time finding a job to lose a steady paycheck.

I was lucky enough to get a very good job about 6 months later. My job would be enough for us to live comfortably if he was contributing some. Right now he is not able to consistently pay his half of the mortgage on time and the only other bill he pays is for our cell phones. Everything else is on me. His business is not doing as well as he initially thought he would, and this has been going on for over a year. I am literally carrying almost the entire financial weight, even though he somehow has money to buy stuff for his business. Even though I make good money (low 6 figures) you wouldn’t know it because I usually have no money left after each paycheck because of how much falls on me.

I have reached my breaking point and told him that if he doesn’t get a job within the next 6 weeks that I am selling all of his business assets. At this point, I don’t even care what kind of job he gets. He just needs to have a steady paycheck. He got angry when I said this and says I’m being unsupportive and that I don’t believe in him or his business. He said I’ve always been negative about it and that this just shows that I am negative and I’m not giving him a chance. I feel like I’ve given him plenty of chances, and I am tired of it. It has impacted how I feel about him and I am honestly considering filing for a divorce if he doesn’t get a job. It makes me feel like I am being greedy though since he says all I care about is money. I honestly don’t but I am tired of instability and living like this.

847,t3_ru3m1i,AITA for being mad that my boyfriend (31M) finished my (31F) birthday cake?,"We spent the holidays in NY with my family and my birthday was on the 30th so I asked my mom to pick up a cake from a special bakery here in NY. That was all I really asked for. Didn't have any special dinner plans, no gifts, I was just happy spending time with my family. So my birthday comes around, we get dinner, we eat my cake, we celebrate. The cake was pretty big so we had leftovers. My boyfriend and I were the only ones really eating the leftover cake because my family has gotten cakes from there before so it wasn't anything ""special"" to them, but they knew they could grab some if they wanted. 

A few hours ago, my boyfriend asked if he could have some of the cake, and I said sure. When I walk into the kitchen maybe 30min after he asked, I saw that he finished the rest of the cake. It wasn't like there was a tiny slice left, there was a good chunk of it. I thought he was playing a prank at first and was hiding it from me, but he kept apologizing and saying he didn't realize how much he was eating and he wasn't sure if I said he could have SOME or if he could have ALL of it. I asked why he didn't ask, and he said he didn't think it would be a big deal. I told him that I thought it was really disrespectful and I was really hurt. He just kept saying that he didn't think it was a big deal because I already ate some cake and we had the whole celebration and it was just the last slice (it was more than a slice). He said he understands why I feel the way I do, but he doesn't understand why I feel that way..? I told him the cake was sentimental to me and he should have just asked. We got into an argument about it because I kept trying to explain it to him, but he just wasn't listening/understanding. He said he would just not eat any of my stuff anymore, and I told him he was just avoiding confrontation that way and it's not going to help the relationship in the long run. 

For context; I had a rough childhood and ended up getting kicked out of the house as soon as I turned 18 and was homeless until I was like 25. That being said, I haven't been able to spend any holidays, birthdays, special events with mom, brother, and sister all together since I was a kid. I didn't get to watch my younger brother and sister grow up so this was kind of a big deal to me. AITA?",42.0

We were discussing how to help him when he said I had no right to call him names and pretended and act like I’m a better parent to his kids when I’m not(I’m their aunt and never claimed to be their mother or a better parent). I hadn’t called him anything in the moment so I asked him to elaborate and he brought up the time I called him a bad dad in a previous fight. I told him I wasn’t going to take it back because I was right and it didn’t mean he couldn’t fix it. I told him I won’t lie to him and I’m there to help but we won’t get anywhere if he refuses to listen or accept help. He refused to listen anyway and kicked us all out.

So my cousin Mia recently moved in with us until she could get back on her feet, recently shes been going out a lot and she'll tell me and my mom shes not gonna be out all night then comes back really late at night. One day I went to mom and asked her if she knew where Mia was (as she's my favorite cousin and I wanted to hangout with her that day) She told me to mind my business and to stop asking so many questions about my cousin and what she's doing. I didn't wanna argue with my mom as it never gets me anywhere so I let it go. A couple of hours go by and then my cousin calls my mom to let her know she's spending the night at her friend's house. This irritated my mother as my cousin only told her that she was going out, not spending the night anywhere. So she goes off on my cousin and in the end told her to come home. After the call had ended she started talking to me about it. And telling me everything that my cousin had been doing lately. I sat there and listened but didn't say anything. She called me rude and said that I never listened to her and said she wanted my opinion on the situation. I told her I was listening but I didn't have an opinion on the situation since it's not my business and she told me to mind my business. This...triggers my mom. She begins yelling at me and calling me names and telling me that she doesnt care about what she said if shes asking me for something then I need to do it. She went on for 2 hours about the situation and then left me alone when her friend came over.

852,t3_ru2xoc,AITA for putting my foot down with son and DIL?,"My son and his wife are expecting my first and from what it seems only grandchild. I haven’t been allowed to be involved in anything up to this point in the pregnancy as DIL convinced my son to move over 4 hours away when they were dating and she doesn’t want anyone but my son at appointments even when I offered to drive to accommodate her choice of doctor office etc., 

I know that I’m always the second text to get ultrasound pictures and what not too. When they called for Christmas they even admitted they had talked to DILs family first. When I told my son it hurt me to always play second fiddle my son said it wasn’t like that and it’s because DILs family live in a later time zone so they call them first and then us but it would have been 10pm in her parents time zone so I doubt they would have been in bed and could have waited.

Overall there are a lot of things they do that seem to favour DILs family over me and I’m getting fed up about it all. The final straw was yesterday when DIL called and said son told her I was feeling a bit left out (I’m pissed he did this as I told him not to tell her because of exactly this kind of empty gesture) and asked me if I wanted to plan the baby shower with her “just us”. I said no, first of all this wasn’t her idea, I told my son I was annoyed she was planning the shower with her mom and not me so it’s not like she was being creative to include me and anyways I’ve already bought what I wanted them to have for the baby. I told her what I want is to be in the delivery room so I can meet the baby first and actually feel involved. 

She said that wasn’t possible because she was only allowed one person and she wanted it to be my son and she’s “high risk” so they need to keep “variables to a minimum”. Fine. As a compromise I said then maybe they could reconsider their 2 week rule (they told me and her parents they didn’t want anyone staying at their house for two weeks after birth to “recover” and “bond”) and let me come stay as soon as they are back from the hospital to help. She said no to that as well. 

So I told her it was obvious she wasn’t interested in making me feel like a part of the family or making this a good experience for me so they could go ahead and return the Christmas gifts and baby things I had given them to me and hung up. The way i see it if my company isn’t good enough for them why should my money be?

My husband is furious with me but he’s blind to how rude and difficult DIL is. Neither of them have reached out to apologise either. Some of my friends have said asking for the gifts back was a bit much but again it’s my money. I got them the gifts assuming they were going to let me be a grandparent and they aren’t so why should I be put out for them if they won’t make accommodations for me?

ETA: Okay I get it. I was an asshole and made some wrong moves but really I think a lot of you completely misread my excitement at being a good grandmother as being this awful controlling person and that’s not the way it really is at all. 

Also people are really fixated on me asking to be in the room, as I said below both my mother and mother in law were in the room for my sons birth and I had no issue so I didn’t think it would be such an outrageous request but obviously I was wrong and I accept that. Though as I said in my original post I didn’t argue that point with her when she said no. 

I’ll call my son tomorrow and tell him to keep the gifts but I do think it’s a bit ridiculous so many of you just want me to sit around and wait like some stranger until they deign to find it in their hearts to invite me over to meet my grandchild especially considering all I did to raise my son and support his relationship with my DIL making it possible for them to have a child but alas I guess if that’s how things are done these days that’s how it is. 

Overall I wasn’t looking for judgement on my relationship with my son or DIL I was looking for judgement on if taking back gifts from people being disrespectful and dismissive of the gift giver was wrong but I feel that got lost in translation so I’ll take it for what it is and just tell them to keep them.",0.0
853,t3_ru2q3j,AITA for washing my GF's roommates dishes?,"My girlfriend (F24) had to move across the country to finish her masters degree. So during winter break from classes I (M22) flew out to spend 2 weeks living with her and her 3 roommates. Prior to winter break, we asked and made sure that the roommates (and landlord) where comfortable with me staying for such a long prior and even offered to pay more in rent.

Before she moved, she would cook and I would do the dishes since she didn't have a dishwasher then and they don't have one now. So in the morning after breakfast I would clean all the dishes, that had been piling up for the last 24 hours and leave them in the drying rack on the counter since I didn't know whose was whose or where they went.

After a couple days of this, one of the roommates stormed into the living room fuming, and started yelling at me, with my girlfriend next to me, going off about how I don't know boundaries and I shouldn't be touching her stuff without asking. Me and my girlfriend where both puzzled so I asked what had I been touching?

To our surprise she said that I had been touching her dishes and she didn't like that they weren't left in the sink where she had left them. I responded by saying I clean all the dishes and leave them on the drying rack to dry for her and others to use or put away later. She wouldn't let me finish and ended the conversation with stating that I have never lived with roommates and should know to respect their possessions and that I should just leave things where they are if they aren't mine.

We haven't had much interaction with that roommate since, since it's a big house and me and my girlfriend usually spend our days out of the house or hibernating in her bedroom. But my girlfriend says that she thinks it's a projection of the roommates jealousy since her dog seems to take a liking to me more then anyone else in the house.

854,t3_ru2ox6,"AITA for only saying ""no"" once?"," 

TL/DR: I'll give you ""no"" only once. If I have to convince you that my answer is ""no"", I'll pretend to agree, with no intention of following through. Does that make me an asshole?

My wife's friend ""Christine"" is in town visiting her in-laws for the holidays. Christine called my wife and they made plans to go out shopping together the next day. The problem is that Christine expected to drop her 3 kids off at my house first, and I’d babysit them. Christine did not check with me at any point. Her kids had visited a few days earlier and broke my kids’ toys and I didn’t want them doing that to my kids' brand new Christmas toys. I told my wife I'd be willing to watch Christine's children outside, perhaps at the park, but not at our home (in California it's 50F/10C so plenty warm enough for the playground as long as the moms wrap up their shopping by sundown.) My wife brushed off my counter-offer, and insisted that it'd be fine to just watch them at our house.

Quick note here: I am highly dyslexic. Wordsmithing is very difficult for me, so I cannot articulate things well on the spot. I also have a rather large chip on my shoulder about my inability to verbally push-back being mistaken for me being a pushover. I know the best action at this point would have been to sit down with my wife and communicate my concerns effectively enough that we could come to a mutually agreed solution. But that's a large burden for me; a burden I didn't ask for, that I won't benefit from, and that could have been avoided if she listened in the first place. I did not accept that burden.

Instead I shrugged and said ""fine"" with zero intention of going through with it. I feel that if someone's strategy is 'Keep pushing until you get the answer you want' then that person isn't owed a goddamn thing: Not continuing to debate about it, not whatever you need to say so they'll STFU, and not the courtesy of notifying them later.

So the morning of their planned shopping trip, I waited until until half an hour before Christine was set to drop off her kids, and I went on a hike. A 15-mile hike interspersed with increasingly furious phone calls as my wife and Christine realized that their shopping trip wasn't going to happen unless they took the kids with them. Was that an asshole move? Absolutely. Was that an asshole move on par with them announcing that I'm going to be babysitting Christine's 3 children for god-knows-how-long and I have no say in the matter? Not even close, in my opinion.

I was going to finish with “could we please go together?” But before I had the chance he jumped in with “don’t you mean we drive you and you go into the store yourself?” I get he didn’t hear me finish, so it could have sounded demanding, but he didn’t let me. I tried to tell him that but he didn’t listen. 

My mom then started questioning if plain prosciutto sandwiches would even be good and started suggesting how to make them better. I tried to tell her they wouldn’t be plain, we already had stuff for them to be plain and that’s why I wanted to go the the store. She told me to stop being rude. 

There was something in their tones, I’m not sure what, that just set me on edge. So I told them,”I’m not sure if this is just how I’m interpreting things, because I really do value your help (I didn’t feel like they were helping, but again I was trying to be nice), but to me you sound kind of… I’m not sure, judgmental?” 

They exploded on me. My mom was calling me entitled, my dad was scoffing at me. I tried to apologize and explain it wasn’t meant to be rude, but they were so mad. I told them, “I don’t know what’s going on, but this doesn’t feel good.” To which my mom laughed and said, “No it doesn’t!”

I kept trying to defend myself, and they kept getting madder. Eventually, my dad just said “you know what? Do whatever you want! I’ll take you to the store!” Which made no sense, cause I thought we’d moved way past that.

So I (23M) have been moved out of the family house since I was 18 because it was a very toxic environment and I spent most of teen years dealing with shit at home. A few examples of what I mean by this:

\- When we (me and my younger step brother/sister) came back from school, it was our obligation to clean the house. Sure chores are normal but the issue is that my step mom (their mom) would get home from not working as she would just live off my dad and then act like she worked hard all day and we were disgraces for not cleaning the house before they got home. Anyways she would always threaten to get my dad mad at us if we didn't do everything she said and we didn't want to deal with him since he was a hothead and would always get loud and threaten our means of entertainment (game consoles/internet) so we just did it.

\- I spent multiple summers as my dads personal slave while others were doing teenager stuff. I spent my days at his business (garage) slaving away doing menial tasks like cleaning the yard, cleaning the garage, cleaning his truck. I was not allowed to do anything except that..

\- I only stopped being on the hook for all of this when my online business took off and got coerced into giving him loans to help save his business. That's when I learnt why people say not to mix family and business, those loans ended up being donations even tho I planned on getting those back. When I asked for it back for the next year or two, I was told that it was only fair he kept it because of ""everything he bought me since I was born"" ??

Anyways years down the line now and he has gotten better. He no longer screams or raises his voice at me, he offers to help me with stuff and seems to be trying to make amens. The odd thing is that when we speak about the past (because there's so much more drama), he seems to have forgotten most of it. I know there's some psychological concepts about this stuff like repressed memories and such but personally it alleviates my own consciousness to talk about that stuff openly with him now.

I try to be open when we talk about this stuff and sometimes I bring up past trauma when he says stuff like ""I never made you guys do anything"" or things like that and I can see that it makes him sad. He seems to have truly forgotten that it happened and I'm worried I'm just making him unhappy by bringing these up years after they have passed. Its not like I do on purpose to throw it in his face but it comes up as we talk about some of the events in our lives.

I do this in the hopes that he can understand where he went wrong in life and why nobody sticks with him. I want him to reflect and keep changing for the better but I'm scared that at some point I will cause too much sadness.

858,t3_ru2kts,AITA for ruining my friend's NYE,"I have a history of severe depression and anxiety. It gets worse around this time of year as most of my trauma happened around this time. From last 2 weeks I was feeling down but thought celebrating my NYE with my closest friend and his room mates will help me get better. That was my biggest mistake. 
I went there and when I got into the room it was full of smoke as they were smoking hookah. Smoke generally makes my head hurt bad and I relayed the same to my friend. In reply, he blew a puff of smoke in my direction. 
He apologized then took me to the bed room where air was better. There we entered a conversation and in between he said something like why I am always sad and why I can't be like his other friends by being happy. That made me cry. Like a lot. He left me in the room to greet the other guests who were coming.
Later he came and apologized. He asked me what will make me happy right there. I said if he could just understand that what's happening is not in my control. My feeling are not in place. He said he will try his best. They we went out for dinner at my favourite cafe. When we came back he asked me if I would like to join others. I refused because I didn't feel like meeting new people. I didn't have that mental energy. He left but then one of my other friends came. She asked me ""If I came all the way there to do this only?"". I think she meant if I came there to just sit inside a room but it again hit a trigger where i thought if I came here to just pout and cry the whole time. I started crying again. I realised what I am doing is wrong but I just couldn't muster enough strength to go outside. Then, my host friend returned and saw me crying again. He got very upset and told me how I am ruining his and my own life by being like this. That he has done so much for me but I couldn't get happy just for one night for him. He said I was ok with sharing stuff with strangers (reddit) but couldn't actually go outside and talk to strangers (his friends). He said he was done with me. He had done everything he could do to appease me but he can't anymore. Then our mutual 3 friends came and told me how he was so much a better friend than me. It was basically a rant about how I am not returning the favor of being a true friend. The whole time I kept crying. They left me there. 
I sat there on the cold floor and cried. I heard them screaming happy new year from rooftop at midnight but I just sat there. My friend came back and saw me sitting there. He had tears in his eyes. It broke my heart. I ruined a perfectly good night. He told me this is the last time he was talking to me and told me to go to sleep. He got into bed with me and I went to sleep. I woke up a couple of times in the night and he was awake the whole time.

859,t3_ru2ixx,WIBTA if I asked my friend to stop talking about how alone they are?,"My friend (she/they) has been spending the past two weeks at a girl’s house. They met once, were internet friends through lockdowns, and now these two weeks have been having a sort of friends with benefits thing going on. My friend is very happy and texts me multiple times daily about how things are going, how loved she makes them feel, etc. This was already hard for me to hear bc I have issues hearing about people’s relationships bc it reminds me of how alone I am (I have some trauma regarding being told I’m too much to love by my parents and I’ve never had a relationship before), but this is a me problem so I do my best to not let it interfere. I’m just saying this bc it is already a hard situation for me to navigate by virtue of this 

My friend is leaving the girl’s house in a few days and going back home (two separate European countries) and so now for the past couple days they have been texting me endlessly about how afraid they are to leave bc they don’t want to go back to being alone and miserable and have no one there to help them. But that’s the thing: I will be there. I’m moving to the same city my friend lives in in a couple weeks (not bc of them, just a happy coincidence that opportunity brought me there). I understand that I am not the same as the girl; I will not be sleeping with them, living with them, etc. but I am their friend and I will be there if anything goes wrong (they have a lot of chronic health issues so I could be there for them). My flat isn’t too far away at all so if they have a bad flare or need help at all I can be there so fast. 

I understand that my friend is likely very emotional and caught up in their own relationship, but it very much hurt me to hear this. Bc it wasn’t just once, it’s over and over and over again, just how miserable they’ll be once they leave and how alone and they’ll have nobody to care for them. I understand that I’m not ideal, but I’m something, and it hurts. I’m someone who will care.

860,t3_ru2ink,AITA for insulting my stepmother during family dinner,"My (27F) mother died of an illness when I was seven, and my father (52M) remarried when I was nine to my stepmother (42F). Prior to getting married, my father and stepmother did have an affair, while my mother was ill. Their affair resulted in ""Rose"" (20F), my half-sister. Growing up, I have always resented my father and stepmother. Rose and I have not had the best relationship, and my father has been openly biased towards her, while my stepmother would often pick my side in arguments. I am engaged to my college sweetheart ""Josh"" (27M) and we will be married in two months. We are also currently expecting our first child. I am on good terms with his entire family, and I am particularly closest to his sister ""Emily"" (25F). Last week, we had planned a double date movie night. Something came up, and Emily's date was unable to attend. It so turned out that Rose had heard my phone call with Emily, and she pleaded me that she wanted to attend the movie night event with the extra ticket. I didn't want Rose to join in, and so I told her that I was sorry and that I didn't want her to be there. She complained to our father, who yelled at me for being an ungrateful sister and useless like my late mother. I was hurt by this, and so I relented and allowed Rose to accompany us, after my stepmother begged me. The four of us ended up going to the movie theater together. During the middle of the movie, I felt incredibly nauseous and hence left to the women's restroom with Emily. Afterwards, I decided to take a walk to feel better, and Emily said she wanted to give me company. Although Josh asked me if I needed him to come, I told him he could enjoy the movie. After the movie was over, Josh pulled me aside and said that after Emily and I left, Rose had been flirting with him and tried to kiss him multiple times. He told me he was annoyed and uncomfortable and this only made me feel angry. The next day (I slept over at Josh's house), I yelled at Rose for behaving inappropriately towards my fiance to which she responded ""Maybe I'll be the one marrying him"". To which I responded ""What else can I expect from you, when you're the daughter of \[insert stepmother's name\]"". My father screamed at me for insulting his wife. My stepmother started crying and said that she loved me like her own daughter and would never expect this coming from me.

AITA? I think I could be the AH because I've rarely seen my stepmother cry during family dinner, and I think that I may have hurt her feelings. I've never liked her from since I was a child, but she's always treated me nicely. I feel that my hormones made me a bit more sensitive than usual and I snapped. I spoke about this matter to Josh, and he is furious that my stepmother and dad made a whole scene to make me feel bad. So, AITA?

861,t3_ru2h75,AITA for defending my sibling to our parents?,"Some context: For the holidays, me (21f) and my sibling (19) are staying with my parents. My parents live in another country so they fly us out to them for the holidays. My sibling is at uni and I graduated this year. I have a soso job and I'm renting a place in my city so for the most part I'm financially independent from my parents who are fairly wealthy. But when I stay with them, they pay for flights there and back and for any outings we go on. 

My sibling wanted to see some of their friends and my mum (50s) told them they have to be home before 9PM. My sibling wanted to stay out till 10PM. So I said, they're 19, why do they have a curfew? My mum told me to stay out of it but I pushed on because A) my sibling is pretty conflict avoidant so they rarely argue which can lead to my parents being stricter with them and B) I haven't had a curfew since 16 and it was like 2AM.

Then my mum said I should ask them why they have a curfew and my sibling explained that one time they came home late without telling anyone. Another time, I might have left it alone but just the summer before, this exact thing happened to me. I went out, my mum skied when I'd be back, I said I don't know and left. She was annoyed but there was no consequence beyond an agreement that'd I'd give her a better time frame than I don't know, but there was no curfew. I brought that up and my mum just continued to tell me to stay out of it and it wasn't my business.

Then my dad (50s) came out to tell me off as well. We'd already had 2 minor arguments that day already. My dad told me I should stop involving myself when it comes to my sibling and that I act like I'm trying to be an authority in the house that he pays for. I told him it's not about authority but that they are constantly talking down to them. Dad said he's allowed to talk down to them because he's their dad. I told him that they are 19, so no. He said that they didn't ask for my help. To be fair, my sibling didn't ask for help. But they have complained to me numerous times that our parents are extra strict and horrible to them to the point that they paid $150 of their own money to change their flight to an earlier date.

I told him he doesn't know what my sibling and I talk about and how our older siblings (30s) also talk to them about the way they treat us, He said this wasn't the right way to do it and that I should've taken them aside and brought it up later. This I'll admit probably would've been the better thing to do, but also we've tried this in other situations but it just ends up with my parents insulting my sibling and I get annoyed and yelling ensues.
 He told me to remember this the next time I thought about coming home for the holidays and I said if this is what it'll be like then I won't come. He told me not to come and that I should even just leave tomorrow, a week before my original flight. I said I will. Looked into it and there is no way to change my flight for less than $400 but that would be more than the original flight itself cost so I feel like it makes no sense to change it. Not to mention, even though I probably could afford it, I'd have a rough go of it.

So I'm definitely stuck here, so I want to know if I'm in the wrong and I should just apologise. But I really feel like I was just standing up for my sibling because my parents find them easy to control.

862,t3_ru2e0x,AITA for not putting family photos in my high school yearbook?,"I (18F) recently started college out of state in the fall 2021 semester. Back in high school, I lived in a toxic household. I was constantly belittled, sheltered, overprotected, and given no privacy. Therefore, I wanted to get out. My mother didn’t understand this and kept convincing me to attend community college in state because she didn’t want me far away from her. She also blamed me for wanting to leave the house at such a young age. I was tired of her. Sometimes, I wished she were gone. Before my senior year ended in high school, we were given an opportunity to input photos for the school yearbook for every high school graduate. I considered putting family photos, but I thought about the horrors and the toxicity of my mother. I grew resentment towards her, so I just inputted photos of me and my friends, while my friends inputted photos of their families. Moreover, I also didn’t have any family photos at the time and felt uncomfortable at the thought of my classmates seeing my younger self. Fast forward before Christmas, I received a text from my mother out of blue specifically telling me, “You’re shit.” She explained that it’s because I didn’t input family photos in the school yearbook and said that I’ll regret everything in the future. I told her that I did not have any family photos at the time and that I was uncomfortable to show my younger self, then she started assuming that it’s because I did not like her (This is true, honestly). The reason why I didn’t tell her about my resentment was because I didn’t want to stir up more problems. My brother tried talking to her about her toxicity, but she dismissed his feelings and called him dramatic and sensitive behind his back. It would be useless for me to do the same thing. She isn’t talking to me now; my dad is. 

Part of me feels that I should’ve put family photos because my mom still supports me financially in college (My dad makes the money, but my mother controls it). She also never physically abused me and still clothed me and fed me. So AITA, reddit?",3.0
863,t3_ru2clj,AITA for not wanting to go back to My Church Camp?,"

I (14f) have put a few other stories(?) On here and I thought this is one I really need guidance on.

When I was ten I started to go to an after school church thing, they had it for all grades and I just started going. It was from 4-5pm giving us 30 minutes on a play ground, I did that until I was eleven, I went to middle school and they didn't access it there.

But I did go to their church camp, and my last two years haven't exactly been.. all that good.

My first year it was mostly decent other than I was bunked with my bullies, I ended up getting into a fight on the last day. I was crying and said ""I should be used to it by now"" and an older Counselor laughed at me for saying that.

2020 year I was in the cabin with a girl I didn't get along with, at all. She practically threatened me multiple times and my Counselors only spoke to her once about it. 

2021 year was decent, my sister dropped me off with my nephew, everyone loved him, so on so on.

Well we have chapel after dinner and it's usually more of a lecture so I don't tend to pay attention to those parts of chapel.

But this one chapel was different. They knew my sister wasn't married, so they stared at me and told me that was a sin and *I* should never do it. They then looked at the younger kids who parents were never married and told them not to do so.

Then it moved on to divorce, my parents were divorced, and since I trust them they knew this. Once again they mostly looked in my direction, and then the younger kids.

And I'm a closeted something, ik I like girls but so on.

It's never been a secret I am queer, all my extended family insists they know but won't out right say it, and seem accepting.

Kids at school obviously have their thoughts and I've heard a few talk about it.

A kid from my school, someone I talk to, her mother is the Chapel person.

They gave us the 'Gay is a sin' and how we'll burn in hell and shit.

And her mom obviously knows. I saw her in public last weak and I feel like certain people understanding the 'Im judging you for who you are even though I care for you because I remember the old you' stare.

But now they want me to work for them, and My Friend (the one who's mom is the Chapel lady) is telling me not to do it because they have younger kids be the top of the chain and give their work to the others. Shes told me they treat them badly and it would be best to slowly back away from them in that topic.

But My Parents insist I do work for them since they have let me into the camp free of charge for four years, and they truly do care about me as I do them but they also obviously judge me.

And I love them all because they have helped with my bully problems but it just goes on the fact that I'm now currently trying to figure myself out without religion.

864,t3_ru2c8v,AITA for not fully supporting my bf joining the Air Force?,"So me F (20) and my bf M (29) have been dating for about a year, and seeing each other for two. Throughout the first year we knew each other he would sometimes spend time doing contract EMT work around our state, being gone for a few months at a time. We handled it okay, with our fair amount of arguments and such, as well as lots of good times spend in between his contracts. Over the last year, we have both been in school and such during covid, spending a lot more time together, and getting closer. He is my first relationship so I can see where I’m a little more emotionally involved than he is, since this is his third serious relationship. 

Anyways, after this last semester ended, he accepted a contract pretty far away, which was supposed to only be a month long. A week or two in he tells me that he’s being extended for another month, as well as what he has planned after this contract. This is where the problem is, he starts to tell me about a paramedic air force program which will have him joining the military to do medical work, it requires him to go through two years of school, basic training and deployment. This isn’t something we have talked about before, in fact his original plan was to go with me to university to finish school, so he could get his bachelor in nursing, while I got mine in art. Now he’s completely changed up the next few years of our lives without hardly asking how I feel about it, or if it’s something I could do. 

Recently we have been having a hard time over the phone almost every time we talk. On my part its about how this will be a lot of time apart for me, how suddenly he changed plans, as well as how I’ll be alone for those years he’s in the program. On his part, he says that he’s doing this so that we’ll be set for the future, and that I need to be more supportive of his calling to join. He says that he isn’t as emotionally dependent as I am, so I just need to deal with the time and distance if I love him, and want to stay together. He’s said before that if don’t start supporting him more that our relationship will fail, but I feel like I am trying my best to be supportive considering the limited time I’ve had to process the situation, and consider if this is really what I want.

865,t3_ru2908,AITA for making my sister cry over a bunch of packages?,"I 32(m) have a sister 26(f), let’s call her Jane. To give you some context, I have lived and worked in the US my entire adult life. Jane lived here (In the US) throughout college and went back to live with my parents overseas due to being unable to find a job a couple of years ago (she’s still unemployed) . I have a busy professional life and a toddler at home. I currently live in an apartment complex where any package delivered needs to be picked up at a separate building from a locker system. Anyway, over the last two years, my sister consistently orders all kinds of different items to my apartment. The vast majority are clothing items, but there’s also other things like books, art supplies, and even household items. The number of packages I’ve picked up over the last year for has been insane (over 100). The packages need to be picked up and stored for her. I store them in a garage I have where I store things that we currently don’t have space for in the apartment. My sister knows of the storage, so she takes advantage of this. 

She typically visits the US about twice a year. In the weeks before her arrival the packages start arriving daily, with multiple packages each day. She buys so much stuff that packages continue to arrive even after she’s gone. She ends up taking a considerable amount of her stuff away when she goes,but there’s usually a couple of boxes left due to a lack of luggage capacity.

As you can imagine, it takes a lot of time, not to mention space, to handle all of this for her. When she’s staying with me, she’s constantly asking me to take her to stores or delivery services to make returns. 

The last straw came yesterday for me, she has been away, but again packages started to arrive. Jane found out I will be going to my parents house overseas in March and ordered some stuff for me to take to her. This includes a lamp and multiple clothing items.I was mad and I yelled at her over the phone, telling her it’s not my job or responsibility to be provide her with storage and delivery services. She got extremely emotional and said that she “needs” all these things because she cannot find them or because they are too expensive in our home country. On top of this, my parents got on her side and tried to shame me for being selfish and lacking “good will” towards her and themselves by extension.

866,t3_ru270z,AITA for taking a DNA test behind my son's back?,"My son (21M) and his girlfriend (21F) have had a messy relationship. She has cheated on him numerous times and he still takes her back. I've tried telling him this is a bad idea but he won't listen and since he has his own apartment, I can't tell him what to do anymore.

Last year, after they had broken up again, his girlfriend announced she was pregnant. According to my son, the timeline added up to where the baby was his and I supported that. When the baby was born however, something seemed off. The baby didn't look anything like either of them and to this day, still does not. The girlfriend remained firm that she didn't cheat this time, that this is my son's daughter.

My son recently announced his plan to propose and I begged him to please get a DNA test. He refused. They went shopping for engagement rings and asked me to watch the baby. I used one of those home DNA tests and sent it off. A little later, I got confirmation that this is my granddaughter. I didn't tell either my son or his girlfriend what I did, I secretly accepted that I had been wrong. Everything would have been fine except my son found the paperwork when he went in my office to grab some insurance paperwork he had left behind at my house. Admittedly, I didn't hide it very well but I didn't think he'd be going in my office.

He blew up at me saying I should've believed his girlfriend and then said he had already taken a DNA test anyway before he put his name on the birth certificate.

The topic made it onto mental health (something I tend to avoid since usually it starts from them making fun of how sensitive this generation is), and it seemed like they were talking about it in a more positive light. My mom asked me if I had any mental health conditions that she didn’t know about. She genuinely does care, and I want her to know about how my mental health is going. Whenever I mention anything though, both my parents are quick to deny or trivialize it. Since the conversation felt positive, I thought now would be a good time to bring up that I might have OCD as suggested by my neurologist. I had mentioned it a few weeks ago, but she shot it down with a “I know you, I know what OCD is, and you don’t have that”. I left it at that and tried to forget the conversation ever happened.

She just nodded and my dad stayed silent. I could have left it at that, but that last interaction when I first mentioned OCD had been bugging me for weeks. I pressed on and asked them why they didn’t believe me the first time, to which they answered again that they know what OCD is and it’s not something I’ve ever shown. I asked them what they think OCD is and said that it’s when a person is overly organized and in need of order. I told them that that was outdated, and that today’s time uses a new definition from the DSM-5. They told me how they went to med school (not for neuro/psych) in the 90s and were more familiar with the DSM-3, and that it would make sense that the DSM would be updated in that time.

I finally said “if you weren’t sure what OCD was, why were you so quick to disregard the fact that I might have it?”. My dad told me how he would never have been able to talk to his parents like that and that I should be ashamed of myself. My mom said that my tone of voice was extremely disrespectful and that I was treating them like my friends rather than my parents. We emigrated from the Philippines, and there is a stark cultural line of respect between parent and child. My dad told me to apologize to my mom because I really hurt her with what I said. I told them it was an honest question and that they had in fact hurt me by being so adamant on denying I might have OCD. I told them I didn’t know how else to ask the question because that’s what I wanted to know. They told me that in any case, I shouldn’t talk to my parents like that and to apologize. I kept thinking about what I did wrong, but my dad cut my train of thoughts off by telling me to stop thinking and to just apologize because I had really hurt my mom.

Other times I ask him if he helps me clean the garden, to hold my tools and pass me the ones I need if I have to fix something and wanting to ""help"" me he does it himself but he does it so badly or deliberately mishandles some tools and when I try to correct him and show him the correct way he just tells me ""Thank you but I prefer my way is much better than yours""

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is that he has a bad habit of starting to bother me like slapping me hard on the back, grabbing my wrist and twisting it with how much force I can resist, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

They are things that he has been doing frequently lately and it is driving me crazy, even my mom who almost never says anything to him scold him because he was bothering me too much.

&amp;#x200B;

But in general, he behaves much better when my parents ask him to do something, it is with me that he usually does not listen to me although I ask him kindly if he could help me with something

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of that we usually get along well and since I was the only older sister figure that was with him longer than my older brother and sister, he is very sticky with me.

&amp;#x200B;

But lately it's these things that are already bothering me and I don't want to explode and yell at him to stop being so immature

So AITA for frustrating with his attitude or am I very exaggerated by his behavior?

PD:I'm thinking that maybe I'm exaggerating and this is the way boys his age behave today, since when I was his age I had a more strict upbringing and my stepfather is conservative about it, he raised me and me sister to be young ladies (although it does not work well with me since I love tools and do manual tasks such as repairing furniture and motors)",2.0
871,t3_ru20xj,AITA for not talking to my FIL?,"Me (24F) and my bf (30M) live with my FIL and SIL in my SIL's house. For Christmas, the company I work at sent me a Christmas goodies box. I was saving up the contents since they aren't cheap. So it's stuff I normally won't buy. However, when my BIL's family visited for Christmas, my FIL decided to give my BIL's daughter (7F) an item from my box. I wasn't consulted about this. I would have shared if I was asked. I do share with them a lot of what I buy, but this time, I was surprised to find out it was gone. This also wasn't the first time something like this happened. I realized this won't be the last time this would happen, so I was pretty upset about it. I know that I can just buy it for myself, but I'm upset that instead of being where I left it, it's gone without me knowing.

I know it isn't my BIL's daughter's fault, and I don't take it out on her. I still love her, and I express that to her. My FIL would never apologize for it though, and simply blames my BIL's daughter for eating all of it. I can't talk to him without feeling upset, so I only talked to him whenever he talks to me, and only gave short answers when asked.

I complained to my SIL about the incident, and she suggested that perhaps FIL thought the item was hers instead of mine. I know that's not the case, because I complained to him about it, and he blamed BIL's daughter. She also told me to keep stuff I like inside our bedroom, so this won't happen again, since FIL likes giving BIL's daughter whatever she likes. I agreed, and when New Year's came, I decided to talk to him like I normally would. 

This morning, he talked to me twice. I answered him the first time, but didn't hear him the second time. He got upset over this and complained to SIL. SIL asked my bf to tell me that she knows I'm upset over the incident, but that it was rude of me to not answer my FIL when he talks to me. I did say that was a misunderstanding, but I think SIL and FIL don't believe me, and now I feel guilty for how I reacted.

872,t3_ru20gb,AITA for expecting my family to handle the bugs that get in my room?,"For a little bit of context, I live in an apartment and my room is facing a poorly kept garden that is home to several types of animals. Another thing you should know is that I'm terrified of bugs. Any type of insect, crawler or flyer, I cry if I have to deal with it. When I was little it was way worse, now I can deal with them if they're small enough but the bigger ones still scare me.

The situation in question happened when a particularly large bug entered my room and first thing I did when I saw it was run out of my room and go get my father (yes I still live with my parents, I don't have to pay for housing for college) and he just ignored me, said that I had to deal with it alone, then I went to my brother, who, even though was complaining the whole time, managed to get it out of my room. The argument started when I complained that my father just left me to deal with the bug even though he knows im scared of them.

He says that I'm grown up enough (I'm 19) to learn how to deal with it on my own, that I should have grown out of that fear by now, that I'm too old to be terrified of something so small and shouldn't expect him to deal with it just because I can't be bothered to learn how deal with my fears.

In his defense, I do recognize that it is sort of childish to be afraid of something so small and (sometimes) harmless and one of his main points is that he's not going to be around to deal with all the bugs I encounter in my life so I should learn how to do it myself
I also think it's worth pointing out that the insect only entered because I forgot to close my window after dark, which I know is prime time for the insects to fly in. 

This wasn't the first time this situation has happened, but it was the first with an insect that big and my brother said he saw a sting, which is why I got mad my father refused to help in the first place, cause my brother could have gotten hurt and he was just ignoring the situation, granted I wouldn't be much help either cause I was locked in the bathroom trying not to cry.

TLDR: I'm terrified of bugs but my father thinks I'm too grown up to not learn how to deal with them so when my brother stepped in to deal with it and saw a sting, my father continued to ignore the situation and I got mad at him for that

873,t3_ru20cl,AITA for not helping my boss?,"I work as a medication courier and have a scheduled route but often make myself available to run stats (immediate emergency deliveries).  I live in a state where weather can be an issue aka heavy snow, tornadoes, ice.  In over a years time I've called out 3 times and only once due to weather.  I accepted said position knowing this is part of the deal.

Today was bad weather, winter advisory, snow, low visibility.  Not to mention a holiday but that's okay I had no problem with doing my route.  The route goes to another state and in normal circumstances takes around 2.5-3 hours to complete.

Yesterday my bosses sister who does the business end of everything texted and asked if I could do my bosses run along with my own, a neighboring city but none the less would add an additional 30 minutes in normal weather so with road conditions at least an extra 45.

I texted back and said no, I could not help out because my own route would already take much longer than usual.  Apparently my boss celebrates Christmas that day.  His sister texted back ""Thanks"" with some other stuff about hoping it ends up getting canceled which I found odd but assumed she meant thanks for doing your route since the weather will be awful.

Today I get a text that they have bumped my pickup time for an hour later.  As the day went on the weather was getting worse.  It was like a slap in the face, pretty much my safety doesn't matter we all don't want to come in early after having fun last night.  Whatever I show up an hour later.

Then I get a text from his sister saying my deliveries for my bosses route are in the system for me.  I've already been delayed an hour (ended up being an hour and a half).  I called her back and said I could not do the extra deliveries.  That I'm still waiting past my pickup time as it is.  She basically said she read my text as to say I WOULD do the run and that it shouldn't be a big deal to help out.  I said in normal circumstances I would (and have several times) but in this weather it will take me almost twice as long as it is (like I said in my text which I still have I clearly said no).  She got snippy said okay and that was the end of the call.

So AITA for not just doing the extra stops?  I like to be seen as a reliable worker and I don't like conflict.  I will admit I was definitely frustrated when I called to reiterate that I had said no.",4.0
874,t3_ru1yge,AITA for not joining my family for a holiday meal?,"I (19F) am home from college with my family for winter break. Most of our extended family lives overseas, but I have an aunt who lives a few states away, so she and her family usually visit once a year during the holidays, this year, for a couple days between Christmas and the New Year.

I started feeling under the weather the day before my aunt and family arrived. Not terrible, just that icky feeling when you're starting to get sick. Predictably, I ended up sick, waking up the next morning queasy and fatigued.

I told my mom I wasn't feeling well, but largely went about my morning as normally as possible. After having eaten a bit however, the nausea escalated and I spent the next while throwing up before taking a nap. Later on that day, to be polite, I came out of my room, and socialized with my aunt and cousins from a distance for a bit, which was all fine and well.

After a while, I went back to rest in my room. About thirty minutes before dinner was set to be served, I had another vomiting episode, so I did not wish to come out for the family meal. My mother was upset by this. She had spent hours preparing, and was already frustrated that I had not been helpful with the cooking throughout the day. She told me that I was being rude and ungrateful to be doing this while we had guests, especially ones we see so little. After I still didn't come join, she refused to speak with me for the next day.

In the moment, I was struggling to see the other side of the argument, possibly selfishly occupied by my own comfort. Truthfully, it wasn't as if I was gravely ill, working through illness is something that is sometimes necessary, depending on circumstances. Additionally, family meals are very important in my family, so special occasions where we have extended family is doubly so.

So now I'm not sure if my actions were appropriate, because whereas my comfort is important, so are family values. AITA?",2.0
875,t3_ru1u74,AITA for wanting to bring my bridesmaids wedding dress shopping?,"This might be ridiculous, but I’ve never been engaged before and I don’t know if I’ve broken some kind of social etiquette or something. My fiancé and I got engaged about two months ago, and recently set a date for 2023. 

My mom was excited when we got engaged, but hasn’t really cared about anything wedding-related with the exception of wedding dress shopping. Every few days she asks me when we’re going (not for a few months, I’ve got time) or if I’d like to wear her old dress (not really). 

However the last time it came up, my mom mentioned what a wonderful mother/daughter bonding experience it would be, just the two of us shopping for my wedding dress. I said that I wanted my bridesmaids there (not even all of them, since one is in another country and another is my brother who has no interest in dress shopping). My mom was offended though, and said it was weird to want to bring “random people” to such an important moment. I tried explaining that my *maid of honor* and *bridesmaids* aren’t just random people, but she blew me off and told me it would be inappropriate to invite them. I disagreed, and she’s been short with me ever since. Today she left me know she’s been expecting an apology for wanting to bring them. Did I do something wrong?

876,t3_ru1pqr,AITA for threatening to not be guardian to disabled sibling if my narcissistic dad doxes me?,"I (30f) have been the family scapegoat my entire life and finally had the courage to cut off/go NC with my emotionally abusive/narcissistic family last year. Tried low contact for almost a decade, my mental health was suffering with their constant gaslighting and scolding me for behaviors that they commit on the routine (there's a different set of rules for me and them), and I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't an easy decision but I did what I had to do to maintain my sanity. 

I am a high class call girl/escort, I love my job, I'm not on drugs, I've never had an STD in my life and I am not trafficked. I'm even in a relationship with a wonderful and supportive man who knew everything from day one, other than my family life has been good. I have kept this hidden from my family because they're religious wingnuts who don't follow alot of their own rules. 

Because I refused their xmas invite they decided to go snooping around on the internet and found out about my work. I received horrible verbal abuse as a result and my father even threatened to call the cops (I live in the US) and to call my apartment complex/management if I didn't quit immediately and move back in with them(I have moved out of state since going NC and didn't give him my new address but it could be found with enough digging), I will live under a bridge before I ever go back to them!

I told him if he pulls any such stunt that I will not do shit for my autistic sister after he and my mom pass and that I don't care if I go to jail for the rest of my life, I will live under a bridge before I ever go back to them, and  that she will become a ward of the state (my other non disabled sister who's the golden child was seriously coddled her whole life and is too irresponsible with money which is why they chose me as the guardian, plus she's the golden child so she's more entitled to a normal life than I am), or be at the mercy of GC sister (who will no doubt squander the money meant for autistic sister). Autistic sister is in a group home so I wouldn't have to do physical care, but they'd want me to be legal guardian, manage finances and make medical decisions etc. 

In actuality I will still be guardian no matter what (unless she passes before my parents do), but I wanted to put the fear of the devil into my narcissistic parents. I also may retire within the next couple years and start up my own business as my boyfriend is wealthy and would be able to comfortably support us both while business starts up (but I'm waiting because now is a terrible time to try and open a new business, waiting for better economic climate).

prefacing this by saying that no, i didnt see their text (which i remember being unimportant) because i dont look at my phone while on the bus because i have motion sickness.

878,t3_ru1l46,AITAH for making a big deal out of an apology,"I'm with a newer bf and I don't want to get into too many details just in case this gets popular enough to be found.

For context my current bf makes a lot of jokes in the pulling your leg department. I've been getting frustrated because he's so deadpan It's hard to know for sure he's not serious. I like to talk about the future a lot because I want to be completely up front with my potential partners. Stuff like what kind of place would we want to get together? Do we care about the piece of paper or do just want the ceremony? Do we want kids? Do we have any names we have our hearts set on? Stuff like that. I try to talk about this stuff so all my deal breakers are upfront and you know what I want upfront and don't waist time or money investing into me only to find out that I have a deal breaker for you.

Onto the story. I was trying to talk about the kid thing with my bf regarding ""Any names you have your heart set on?"" Question. He went into pulling my leg and said something about naming our kid to sound like a stripper. He's never talked about it seriously so I just say ""please don't do that"".  He continued his bit and it started to feel like he was making fun of me so I stopped him and said ""I feel like you're making fun of me"" his answer ""I'm sorry you feel that way, you need to lighten up it's just a joke."" Now this is the part I might be an ass for. That apology felt like he was trying to shift the blame onto me for feeling made fun of so I tried to explain why that wasn't the best phrasing. He kept sticking to the fact that he already apologized. I tried to explain I didn't want another apology I just wanted him to understand how his phrasing could be hurtful and feel like blame shifting, but he kept going determined he apologized and I need to lighten up. 

We tried to change the subject into other unrelated stuff and even trying to talk about it later it seems like all that matters is unrelated the stuff. He says I'm overreacting and beating a dead horse about it but I feel like it's important we both understand what happened and why we were wrong.

TLDR: My bf made a bit of a blameshift apology and I tried to explain it was bad and he says I'm overreacting.

Edit: I'm not upset about the joke or the name thing I'm upset about the non-apology. If you want more details about the things that have nothing to do with what I'm upset about I'm not really sure why but that's not what I'm upset about nor do I think he's an asshole for joking or that I'm not in any wrong considering the unrelated conversation.

880,t3_ru1h0e,AITA for not spending time with my best friend?,"I F(20) met my best friend M(30) on Xbox in December of last year. When we first met we instantly clicked and we talked for hours everyday up until I decided to join the military. 

He was previously in the military so he gave me pointers and what I should generally expect. I wrote him whenever I got a chance and he expressed through some of his letters that his mental health wasn’t doing so well since I had left (he had a panic attack on vacation from crowds of people and he felt alone), so I tried to assure him that once I was out of bmt I would contact him more and be available when I could. 

Once I got out of BMT it was back to normal for a bit, but I went into a six month long tech school that is very time demanding. I’m in school for 10 hours, afterwards we have physical training (about 30 mins), and then I have an hour to get things done before stores on base start to close. So I have roughly 4 hours of free time if I’m not doing curfew. 

I’ve been taking my free time for myself or I’ll call him/my family. After school and between PT I would always try to text him and ask how he was doing but he would always send back dry replies. I figured this was bound to happen of us slowly growing apart and I had started to accept it. On weekends I would set aside time while doing laundry or cleaning my dorm to talk or watch movies with him. 

One day he blew up on me in the middle of the night about how I didn’t actually care about him and how I never try to get down to the truth behind his feelings. I was stunned and I thought he was joking at first because we had just been hanging out the entire day watching anime. He said that he could always hear me talking while we were on the phone to my roommate-and how I care more about her than him. My roommate is going through her own struggles with her boyfriend so I always try to be supportive of her and make sure she’s doing okay. After that we stopped talking for a while but then I reached out to him to see how he was doing. He called me selfish and said that I should learn what the effects of my time spent with people does to others. I told him he needed to see a therapist from all the stress and problems he had in his life. I really don’t know what went wrong.

For context, we both have student debt, were not actively financially preparing for a baby, and we both recently had to purchase new cars. We live in a walk up apartment with our dog and cat. It’s a bit cramped, especially since I work from home, but we make it work and have been saving like crazy to buy a house. SIL (26f) lives at home with FIL and is lined up to take over their semi-lucrative family business. H has not always had the best relationship with FIL (due to his own mistakes), and was cut off financially long before we even met. FIL spoils our daughter rotten, but does not help us out with bills or anything finance related (which is NOT a problem- I would much rather be financially independent, just relevant for context). SIL, on the other hand, has no debt, brand new cars whenever she inevitably wrecks the one she has on the way home from the bar, and no rent or bills to pay. She and FIL also have their share of squabbles, so she ends up at our place quite a bit. 

Recently, SIL was over and not in a great mood, so I suggested we take my daughter and the dog for a walk. While we were taking the stroller, toddler, and dog down our narrow staircase, SIL started to whine about how it would be so much easier for everyone if we had our own house, which is something she has said several times before. I replied that we were working on it, but she kept going, saying that it would be so much better for the baby and the dog, and then we could host family gatherings, etc. at this point, I got a bit short with her and reminded her that we recently had to purchase two new cars, and it’s hard to save with a baby and student loans. She then commented that “those are all problems you two made yourselves.” This is where I think I may have been TA- I told her that since her brother wasn’t spoiled rotten like she was, we have to pay for things on our own. And that we had to purchase new cars because ours both had broken down, not because we got drunk and wrecked them. I then told her she sounded like a spoiled brat and that she had no clue what real life was like since she just runs back to daddy’s money every time. She looked hurt and left right away. 

When H came home from work, I told him about it, and he called her to talk it through. She told him that he had ruined his life by knocking me up and that I was ungrateful for his family and their help. This hurt me deeply, as she has often been my confidant and person to lean on for help with my daughter, her niece.

He hasn't gendered me correctly once since then (even though I told him my preferred pronouns) , and always refers to me as she and my deadname.

We all agreed as long as she found a dog that was cool with cats since me and the two other roommates each have a cat. Kate agreed and then one day she came home with Dude.

Dude is probably 60 pounds and is very handsome. He's a rescue and got along with the cats wonderfully, but apparently he also doesn't like men. Kate told me that the shelter workers said he was ""somewhat cautious"" of men. I was pretty confused because, um Kate ahem, I'm a man. A gay man, but a 6 ft man none the less. She figured Dude would warm up to me after a while.

He did not. Dude was not ""somewhat cautious"" of me. Dude considered me public enemy number one. He would growl and bark and I swear I couldn't walk anyway near any of my female roommate without him jumping to their ""defense"". It was very sad, but I kept my distance to let him slowly get used to me, and Kate swore she was working on it.

We both worked with him, but he still just could not stand me. I can't get into the extent of how much he disliked me because this would get flagged, but he could be scary. It was sad too, because I knew he didn't ""hate"" me, he is afraid of me because of things that happened to him in his past, and that isn't his fault.

Recently, however, there was a bit of an incident where Dude tried to physically come after me, and I narrowly avoided it. After this I decided I really didn't want to live like this anymore. I know 3 months isn't a lot of time for training a dog, but there really had been no change whatsoever. I really didn't want to move after 2 years and I love all my roommates, so I asked Kate if there was anyway Dude could be rehomed.

Kate doesn't want to re-home him, which is understandable, and asked for at least another 3 months. I considered it, but I really don't want another incident with Dude to occur. My other roommates back me up, and although we are all sad, they too agree that Dude may need to go.

Kate is pissed at all of us, and I understand why, but I also don't think I'm entirely in the wrong to ask this of her.

Edit: wanted to give some more context on why Kate is reluctant to re-home Dude. He was at the shelter for a very long time, and had trouble getting adopted. He's an old boy, estimated around 7, and she's worried he won't be able to find another forever home if she takes him back. She would have to take him back to the shelter because she is under contract to do so. Like I said, Dude is a great boy otherwise, gets along well with the girls and cats, but not with me unfortunately :(",148.0

Even as kids she was never huge on them, but I was and still am. She figured they’d get more love at my house than they would sitting in a box in storage at hers. Her mom had no issue with her giving them to me. But now she’s demanding them back so Grace’s future kids can have them. I’m willing to give 1/2 back. I’ve gotten extremely attached to the other one, I don’t want to give it back. Her mother bought these for her over 10 years ago now, and while yes she bought them, they were Grace’s possessions. Grace is an adult now, and was also an adult when she gave them to me. So I think it’s fair to say she knew giving someone something meant you don’t get it back, and that she was able to make that choice. I’m willing to give back the one that was her ‘look alike’ doll, and all the clothes and accessories she gave me. But I don’t want to give up the other one. It was my dream doll as a kid and I was always jealous of Grace for having it. I understand her mom wants the future kids to have these, but they were given to me instead.

He had proof she wasn't faithful and therefore he got the divorce on a fault ground granted, instead of a no fault one. My sister was awarded less then she would have been if it was a no fault one.

From what I am told everything she got awarded was to pay her lawyer, and even it wasn't enough because our parents assisted her with the rest. Her husband got the condominium in the divorce award and my parents offered my sister their guest room because she had nowhere else to stay (I'm in the military and don't have a place or I would have offered her to stay with me if she wanted). She also lost her job this year because the stepping out was with someone she managed and her work wasn't happy about it.

She's really had a rough year. At Christmas I was hoping to cheer her up. I fully realize and acknowledge she made mistakes but she's still my sister. Christmas was fine but at one point on Boxing day she got really upset about things and she told me it was my girlfriend's fault.

You see, when I first brought my girlfriend to introduce her to my parents and my sister my parents had just found out about what my sister had been up to (I have no idea how they found out. To me the whole thing is none of my business and I don't need to know details. I told everyone I didn't need to know. I know there is much about the divorce and fallout they didn't tell me). My sister at one point told our dad it wouldn't be a problem because divorce was ""no fault these days"" and also adultery doesn't count legally if it's with another woman, only with a man and a woman. She thought this. I remember my parents tried to tell her to reconsider her actions. My girlfriend asked my sister to confirm what she said because her civilian job is a family lawyer. My girlfriend said no because fault divorce existed in their stare and the sex of the other person didn’t matter for adultery. But she also told my sister she isn't her lawyer and my sister should seek legal consultations if she has questions.

I had honestly forgotten about this until my sister brought it up. But she got mad at my girlfriend for not ""hammering the point home"" better and emphasizing it more because she would have taken it more seriously back then and then her divorce and the fallout would be different. I countered that my girlfriend did tell her and she chose not to listen. My sister got more upset with me and later my parents said she was just venting, she's had a rough time and I should have just left it alone because my girlfriend wasn't even there and my  didn't mean it.

Does it make me the asshole? I just wanted to defend my girlfriend but I get my sister has had a rough time and might have been just venting.",109.0
886,t3_ru11ac,AITA for preferring to have one-on-one FaceTime conversations,"To start this off, I’d just like to say this is a very minor thing, and I feel a little silly even making this post. I’m just a little confused.

So my (M21) gf (F20) and I are both home on winter break from school. We don’t live close to each other, so we FaceTime regularly as a way to keep in touch. Recently, when we are in the middle of a one-on-one conversation, she has been leaving her room to work on a jigsaw puzzle with her parents without any warning. I get along with her parents very well and I don’t mind talking to them at all, but it is really hard to continue any kind of conversation while everyone is centered around a jigsaw puzzle I can’t even see. I asked her tonight to at least let me know before she leaves to do this again, and, although she agreed, she got pretty upset about it and made me feel like it was a ridiculous thing to ask of her. 

We are usually really good about communicating any issues we’re having, so I’m really confused as to what the disconnect is here. To me, it feels disrespectful to kind of place me on the sidelines like that when we are having a conversation, but AITA or needy for wanting her to stay more focused on our conversation while we’re FaceTiming?",8.0
887,t3_ru0zzn,AITA for refusing my Dad’s Christmas gifts?,"So a little background. My dad is a chronic over gifter. Historically, I can’t complain. I have usually been spoiled at Christmas, and I am incredibly grateful. 

Fast forward. I’m 32(F). I’m not a kid, I don’t need or want to be spoiled, but I know my dad, so usually every year when he asks what I want, I throw out some vague subject that I know he can go overboard on. It makes him happy. This year I said I wanted a turntable. He had a huge record collection that he meant to give to me and my brother, but it was stolen 10 or so years ago so I figured he’d latch onto that. 

My brother (29) and his wife bought a house last year and asked for some tools and a toolbox. (I should note, my dad owns a construction company and both my brother and I work for him). Christmas Eve rolls around and my brother and I open the same gifts. A Milwaukee circular saw, hackzall, oscillating multi tool &amp; large (like at least 3 ft tall) toolboxes to store them in. 

Now, I’m single, and rent an apartment with a roommate. Not only do I not need or want these tools, I have nowhere to put them. I said this to my dad as I opened them and he told me I could put them in my basement (which I share with 4 other tenants). I then said I don’t need them, I have a landlord (not to mention, we own a construction company, I have access to any tool I need if I need it), and he told me he wants his daughter to be set up for anything she needs.

I do not build things. I run the financials of our company and have never expressed any interest in DIY, or construction itself. Even if I did own a house, I would never use these tools. I would call him, or my brother, or hire someone before doing it myself.

I am a feminist in the every aspect and appreciate the sentiment behind it, but my version of feminism is knowing I could use these too, and respecting the fact that I don’t want to.

Long story short, I refused to put the gifts my car, claiming I didn’t have space &amp; haven’t seen my dad since Christmas. I’ll be seeing him Monday and will have to decide then what to do with the tools, so…AITA for refusing to accept them?",12.0
888,t3_ru0u9d,AITA for asking my mom to uninstall a tracking app on my phone?,"Alright, I (19F) am a freshman in college. I live around an hour and a half away from home and spend most of my time on campus.

I grew up with what some may call a helicopter mom. She was always very strict on me growing up, and to this day, she only let's me hang out with five people who she thinks are ""appropriate"" to hang out with, one of which she is iffy on because he is transgender and she doesn't want him ""corrupting me."" I can only spend the night at two friends' house even now and I must tell her exactly where I am going at all times and when I will be back (not a horrible demand, but this is where it gets messy).

Summer of 2020 was.....eventful for all of us. I (17 at the time) was entering my senior year of high school at the time and still lived at home. It was around this time that I started working with activists in our community in light of things going on in the United States, and I went to my first rally in June. I didn't tell my mom I was going, because she is against this particular movement and I knew she wouldn't let me go if I told her that's where I'd be.

Long story short, she found out. And as a result, she installed a tracking app on my phone so she knows where I am at all times. This has been the case since then.

I didn't do ""bad"" things growing up. I didn't get involved with drugs or alcohol or anything like that. If anything, I learned how to get around her rules so I could live life like a normal teenager. When I first went to college and found some sense of freedom, I went wild for sure. Parties, hookups, all the things most freshmen in college end up doing. And like most, after about a month, I calmed down and decided to focus on myself and my studies. Overall, I'd consider myself a decent kid. And the main reason why I have this app on my phone is because I broke her trust by going to a rally.

I'm going back to my university from winter break tomorrow morning and we were having issues with the app in question. I became frustrated and just asked her to delete it, telling her I was an adult and I didn't want her babying me anymore. She became very upset to the point of crying and went to her room. She hasn't come out since and it's been about an hour.

I feel bad for making her cry, but at the same time I feel like I needed to put my foot down. I'm an adult, I'm living my own life, and I feel like the least I deserve is some sense of privacy and independence. My dad asked me what was going on with my mom and I explained it to him, and he told me I was being very disrespectful. He said they do these things because they want to make sure I'm safe and that I should be grateful for having parents that care about my safety.

I'm not ungrateful by any means. I am blessed with parents who gave me a roof, food, and care throughout my life. But I just want to stop being babied.

AITA?

EDIT: Since a few people have mentioned that I could buy my own phone, I'm still financially dependent on my parents to an extent.

890,t3_ru0o3b,AITA if I never talk to my MIL again,"
For backstory I (29F) and has been dating my (27M) fiancé for 3 years and we share a 1 year old daughter. Both of our families are pretty close as I live in a small town and we live a few houses away from each other. The first year of our relationship was good his mom seemed nice to me despite all the stories I’ve heard about her from her other daughter in laws. I didn’t want their negative experiences to impact my relationship because I thought I could manage it differently…. Well boy was I wrong. Over the last two years my MIL has bad talked me to the neighbors and even my parents saying I have changed her son for the worse and becauSe of me he never does anything for her (which is a lie, he tends to his mother at some point every day at the time). All the neighbors know she’s lying and nobody likes her but they all keep the peace for the community. While I was pregnant she even sent my fiancé on an errand and came to confront me saying my fiancé won’t be with me long and that I’m getting in the way of him being there for her. This was the first time She visited me during my pregnancy and we only live a few houses away. The conversation got a little hostile and ended with me kicking her out because she was stressing me out. I ended up going into labor that same day. When we all had a sit down after she tried to deny any fault and we boiled it down to bad communication on my fiancé’s part. She assumed his bad attitude towards doing things for her was because of me when it was really because he is tired of his mother trying to demand all his time.

Fast forward my daughter is here and my MIL is back to spreading the same lies about me ruining her and her sons relationship and how I don’t let him do anything for her and even told my fiancé she’d be better off if she died because nobody cares about her. Meanwhile she has no issue asking me for things, which I usually do or get for her. When I confronted her about the negative comments she denied any of it even though once again she said it to my parents! I told my fiancé I am not comfortable with his mom being around my daughter because she is just so negative and toxic and I don’t want my child around anyone that will speak badly about their parents. 

Despite this I try to be cordial but recently she has been lying about things involving my fiancé to make him look bad like he doesn’t want to do things for her. now my fiancé is really seeing her manipulative ways and has been pulling back from her and standing up for himself.  I can see the things she does hurts him and I no longer want to engage with her. I truly believe she’s a disgusting person and I will keep her in my prayers but I do not want a relationship with her. Nor do I want her to have one with my child.",54.0

893,t3_ru0ctq,AITA for not allowing my friend to use my shower or laundry room after not talking for a few weeks,"Hi, I'm new to posting. On phone sorry for formatting issues.

I know this isn't more serious like most posts here but I'd like some confirmation.

Cast:

Op is me (18 at the time), Tosca is my sister, Mom is mom, Sam (M, 5 and Sun's kid), and Sun (F, mid 20s) for my friend.

So for context, Sun is Tosca's and my mom's ex friend and ex Co worker. I was introduced to her early of 2019 but never got close until 2021. My mom said that me and Sun are very similar in our mannerisms (I put my head on my mom's shoulder to reassure her)

My mom made several plans for us to meet and we saw each other a few times. Sun commissioned art from me and tried to get me into the Fairy Tale(?) anime.

One day, Sun came over with her son in August of 2021 and we hung out for a while, this is where we grew closer together. She isn't the best with finances and has a hard time to keep up with payments. She was a single mother and taking care of Sam by herself.

I started working with my aunt, soon to be uncle in law, and cousins at a family lodge up in the mountains. Sun needed a job and I helped her get one and we worked together until December of the same year as snow and ice built up and my car wouldn't be able to make it.

Over time, I would give her rides everywhere, take her kid to school, donate plasm, and get her to the store. I'd even drive her to work. This trip is 100 miles (50 to go up and down. All of this without anything in return other then a adapter for my car so I could play music (I have a 2008 jeep) that she left in my car. She never paid for my gas or buy me anything, I paid for myself. This was through early August to middle September.

I was starting to get frustrated with her as she did half ass her job and almost got me fired with her. She would also go out to buy katanas and knifes as she loves collecting them instead of focusing that money onto her car. When she left the lodge, things were nicer as my sister took her spot and Sun got another job as a prep cook for the college I'll soon be going to.

Now, a few weeks ago she texted and called me out of nowhere. It had been a few weeks of nothing except a random tik tok about anime. She wanted to come over to take a shower and do some laundry. No hi or how are you. Just straight to the point. At first I said yes but doubled down when my mom said no and to stop letting her use me. 

I felt and still feel kinda bad for saying no to her when she is having a hard time, but she isn't making the effort to do better other then to bounce jobs. My mom and sister went through the same thing, Sun half assing her job, asking for rides, and not paying anything. She used me like a rug but I don't know if letting her down when she is a struggling single mother who has gone through a lot of shit. 

However, I know my sister and my mom are trying to look out for me as my moral code is to give and love until I'm no longer needed anymore.

Almost every time we go on vacation I have to share a bed with my 10 year old sister because there's not enough beds for everyone to have their own bed and my siblings get their own beds because they're older.

I wouldn't really mind that much if I had to share with any of my other siblings but my 10 year old sister still has accidents at night. My parents said it's a medical thing (she has cancer so it might be that?) and she wears pull ups at night so it's not like it gets on me but it still grosses me out. She also sometimes gets sick at night and I have to get up and wake up my parents when that happens. 

My oldest sister usually takes my sister to her bed because apparently she doesn't mind sleeping next to my sister but she's not coming next time we go on vacation. I asked if I was gonna get my own bed this time and they said no and everyone but my brother is sharing. 

I told them that I hate sharing a bed with my sister and I asked them to put her on an air mattress instead. They said no but i I'm uncomfortable I can sleep on an air mattress. I got mad and asked why I would get kicked out of the bed when I'm older and when it's not my fault. They said it's not my sister's fault either and told me to think about how she would feel if she knew she got kicked out of the bed for something she can't control.

I've talked to several therapists, however as soon as they begin talking bad about my STBXH, or explaining which of his actions contributed to my feelings or digging into what his reasoning may have been I completely check out and dont make another appointment. 

I understand them asking questions, that makes total sense and I have no problem about it but I dont want to hear negative things about him. I dont want them guessing what his hormone levels or mental state was or being asked if he was a covert narcissist or to be told I was emotionally manipulated. I dont believe anything that could've had an impact was malicious, so I dont think it matters. 

I just want the focus on who I am now and how to change it. I dont want to spend time placing blame on past versions of myself and people I've known, giving a one sided picture of someone I love - that feels rude.

1. Ideally I should’ve spent NYE with my partner.
2. If I had to cancel, I should have given her more notice. The day before NYE didn’t give her enough time to plan something else.
3. My partner has a right to feel disappointed and express that as she will. There are better and worse ways to express disappointment, but this is hers.
4. I have already apologised to my partner. I will be there for her in the aftermath of this, we will work through this as much as possible, I will try and make amends, and I will do better next time.
5. There are obviously some other things me and my partner need to work through - we will do do over time.

As an aside, I’m not sure why this post and many of my comments are being downvoted. My comments aren’t inflammatory - I’m agreeing with people!

Hi all, long time asshole enthusiast, first time posting using throwaway account. I’m not sure how much to post, so if more info is needed I will roll with it. I don’t want to give too much info as our relationship may be identifiable.

Ok so I’m in a lesbian relationship of over 2 years, on and off with several breaks. We are both middle aged. She’s older than I am. When things go well it’s great. When they don’t it’s awful.

During the last Covid lockdown, I didn’t see my parents for 3 months, but I saw my partner every weekend and me and my partner talk almost every night. I talk to my parents often, but it is often strained though we love each other. My parents don’t like the fact I came out as a lesbian, amongst other things.

Anyway I found since the last lockdown ended that I wanted to be around my parents more. Things improved between us a lot. Which is great.

I spent 1.5 weeks over Christmas with them, and the plan had been to spend 3 or 4 days with my partner. She would stay over at my place. I would be pretty much entertaining her and organising food etc.

I just found the whole thing overwhelming and I wanted to stay with my parents longer. I was enjoying our family Christmas. And I just felt mentally exhausted. 

Lots of reasons for my exhaustion. WFH, dramas with relationship, some health dramas, just finished a huge work milestone.

I planned things with my partner 2 weeks before nye, but in hindsight I was too tired and should have cancelled earlier or not planned at all.

I cancelled with my partner day before nye and told her I wanted to celebrate with her next week instead.

She was the one who suggested cancelling over the past week when she saw how iffy I was. She is upset I eventually took her up on it though.

My partner feels I left her in the lurch. She didn’t speak to me all day nye and only late at night on nyd. She told me the last couple of days that my priority should have been her. That I ruined everything.

I did offer to talk to her nye and nyd, even count down the year over the phone. But she just ignored my messages.

I offered to bring in new year with her next week but she declined.

In a way, I feel she made her nye and nyd worse than they had to be, as she deliberately isolated herself. I also feel she to hurt me by ignoring me. 

I feel if the scripts were flipped, I would have been disappointed, but I would have understood how my partner felt, and how important family was to me at this time.

Tldr: I cancelled NYE plans with my partner and spent it with my parents instead. Now my partner is saying I ruined the night and is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel bad for cancelling.",5.0

We got in a huge fight in the fabric store because he picked out fabric with horses, then deer! I am not an animal person and he should have known better. I kept saying no and his choices got worse. I told him to forget it and we left store.

On Xmas eve….he mentions he has a gift for me (strange because I bought him nothing). I said ok show me. He went back to fabric store and bought material on his own to make me a blanket. This is after I told him specifically to drop it and not do that. Do I like what he bought  for fabric? Yes, It’s a cute pattern and he did a good job……However, I am furious about the initial run to the fabric store and don’t want it.

While I was in the kitchen my roommate let her dog out of her room. He started to run around excitedly and started running back and forth between the kitchen and the living room. After a minute I hear something fall and I got into the living room and my laptop is basically halfway across the living room and the screen is completely cracked.

My roommates dog had jumped from the couch to onto the coffee table and flung it off and broke it. I wasn't mad at the dog or anything. Sh*t happens, you know? Was I sad? Yes, it was $1200 and I have classes again soon.

I called my roommate out to show her and she was sympathetic but didn't say anything else otherwise. I asked if she was going to replace it since her dog was the one who broke it. She said no, because, yes while it sucks it broke, I should have known her dog would probably jump on the furniture and shouldn't have left it there.

Yes, the dog does sometimes jump up on the couch but he doesn't normally jump on everything, and the dog was out up originally when I got up. I personally think it's unfair that she isn't taking any responsibility for it. I can't afford to replace it, I'll have to get something way cheaper and so I told her she should at least meet the difference, which is $800. 

She said she'd talk to her parents about it. My parents agree with me. AITA?

Edit: the screen isn't just broken. It won't turn back on. I got it 2 years ago, and it was still in great condition before this. There was no other damage otherwise.

Edit: I'm planning to take the laptop to get assessed at a shop. I did send a photo to a friend who works at tech repair place and he said it doesn't look good due to what appears to be frame damage. 

I looked up the depreciated cost of my laptop, and it is $1050. It's roughly 2 years old, a little less.

If I have to move out over this, I will, I'm not close with my roommate, and her dog pees in the apartment so I'm not attached to either. Her parents got back to her and have agreed to replace it but I'll only ask for the depreciated cost, of course, and only after I have taken it into the shop to get assessed.",92.0

My family member (who i am staying with) suggested to my mum (her sister) that i temperarily stay here and start school here or do online school until my mum can get a house. My mum called her a selfish cow and called me shouting at me for not wanting to stay in the hotel with her and her boyfriend. The hotel is one room. I need privacy and time to myself and there is no telling how long i would be there.

904,t3_rtzoda,AITA for not wanting to visit my boyfriend’s family?,"Hello! Please bear with me as it’s the first time I am writing here and I am on my phone. (throwaway acc) 

So I 23F have been dating “Nick” 24M for 8 months now. I love being his girlfriend, he’s an amazing guy studying to become a pediatrician, we both work full time and go to school. 

Onto what I think it’s the problem and where I might be an asshole. 
Nick has a brother 19 with down syndrome and he’s the reason why he’s studying to become a doctor. When he first told me I thought it was an amazing thing to do. He’s paying for his own education because his parents are fully devoted to his brother. 
My family lives on the other side of the country so when Nick told me he wanted to introduce me to his family I was super excited. 
I went over for the first time on thanksgiving and I met his brother “Dave”. 

From the very first time we met, he was overly affectionate, he’d try to kiss me and hug me which at first I found it sweet but not anymore. 
I am the first girl Nick takes home to meet his family so Dave has never really been in the presence of another woman other than his mom.

We have been back more times and I’d try to be okay with his affection but it really does make me uncomfortable, one time he even try to put his hand inside my shirt and no one seem to notice. I’ve try to come up with excuses as to why I can’t visit them but he say his parents love to have me around and I do like visit them since my family is far away. 

I’ve talked to them once about it and they say he’s just happy to see me and it’s his way to show it. I’ve mentioned one more time to Nick and he said he sees nothing wrong, it’s normal for him to be curious and he’s a special person and I should be more understanding. I asked him if he’s the same way with his mother and he said “no, that would be weird”.  

Maybe he’s right since he’s in school to be a doctor and treat kids with down syndrome kids and I am just being ableist. 

I don’t have many excuses since we pretty much spend all the time together and I think I’ll be an AH if i break up with him over this but I do feel i’m being harassed or am I overreacting? 

AITA?

905,t3_rtzltl,"AITA for calling my parents selfish for giving me only $11,000 instead of $25,000?","So I'm (19M) currently upset with my parents (52M) (50F) because all of my other four siblings are going to college. My oldest brother blew his college money by failing all his classes, My older sister had failed some of her classes and she's now doing good and the rest have yet to start. (25M, 21F, 19Me, 17F, 16F). So now I've told my parents several times I don't want to go to college because it'll take me four years to get certified in something I can self teach myself (computer science). So I told them I wanted to go to a coding bootcamp at UM and the data science program there as well. 

They said that since I wasn't going to college that they were going to get a new car since my dad's car recently broke down, and give me $11,000 for the coding bootcamp and they said they weren't going to pay for any other nonsense and this is the best compromise I was going to get. So I lashed out on them calling them selfish and claiming favoritism. Out of all the siblings only I have to get money taken out of my college fund due to a car expense. It's not like my parents are suffering financially, my dad is a respiratory therapist and my mom is a respiratory therapist and and a nurse. So they both make well off of enough money, they recently paid almost everything off including our house. We're pretty well off, we have a nice house all drive nice cars etc..and I live by myself with my girlfriend(moved out in october). I have a job and all and I can't help but feel like this is out of spite because I moved out against their wishes.

I can't help but feel like it's favoritism because why would they not liquidate everyone's funds if they needed money badly, why mine in specific when I'm seeking education from a verified institute? I think that they don't want to go into debt for the car and they want to avoid that by placing me in college debt instead of just using the college money I was supposed to have. Im very grateful for the coding camp money but I just don't understand why I'm the only person who is being affected by this. I only mentioned my sisters grades and my brothers because the money was wasted and my parents are very reluctant to let anyone use college money now because of that. My parents are very very well off, house is very big. Just gave my brother $5,000 for another car, so they do not need to liquidate my college money (wanted me to go medical school in place) I just want the same opportunity as the rest of my siblings, and I feel like I'm lashing out because I want to know why it was me in specific that they decided to take the money from. They're currently paying for my sisters nursing school right now and my brothers and about to start my younger sisters. 

Background on the coding camp:
You get a certificate which is pretty valid as UM is a very known school in Florida, and I have such a deep passion for coding I'm sure that the knowledge I will get will take me far and that I'll really benefit from enrolling in these programs. It's 6 months for the coding bootcamp, and I think a year or the same for the Data science. It's much faster than college and I would benefit much more greatly then getting a degree in computer science. I'm straying away from a regular desk job and I want to freelance and do my own projects so I'm not interested in a degree to prove anything.

So 
I think I'm the asshole because I told my parents their selfish for not giving me the full 25,000 for my college money.

EDIT: I am not asking to pocket any money the programs I want to go to are 25,000 together, parents said I can only go to the cheapest one despite them both being recognized as formal education.",4.0

907,t3_rtzd5s,AITA for hanging with my friends for New Years and not my boyfriend.,"My boyfriend of 3 years (36M) and I (29F) usually hang out on New Years. In those 3 years, he's only met one of my friends, and it was only for 10 minutes. We don't live together, and anytime I've tried to get him to come over when I have my friends over (my friend group includes my bff (29F), my brother, (27M) and 2 of his friends (27Mx2) who are both male) he always refused and says he has no interest, or that they ""make him uncomfortable"" despite never meeting them. 

I have known my brothers 2 male friends for over 7 years, and there as absolutely never been anything even close to romantic between any of us. My boyfriend is my first and only relationship, and my brothers 2 friends have been excited to meet him and want to include him in our hangouts (my brother is also always here for these. I am not hanging out with the 2 friends on our own). 

This year for New Years, my bff asked if she could come over as her boyfriend had to work. My boyfriend said that was fine, and even agreed to having my brother over. On the day of NYE, my brother texted me and said he invited his 2 friends as well since they just found out they didn't have work that night. I texted my boyfriend and told him of the change of plans, and even offered to uninvite the 2 friends as I know he ""doesn't like them."" He responded and told me he would just stay home. I begged him to come, as I wanted to spend the holiday with him, but it was like the damage was already done. I offered to uninvite everyone, and have it just be us two, but he still refused. He accused me of keeping the friends a secret until last minute, and asked why I always choose the friends over him, and complained that he got ""pushed out"" of our plans. 

I ended up having everyone over without my boyfriend, and we had fun, but I was incredibly upset all night. I feel like I'm the bad guy for wanting my boyfriend and my friends to get along so I don't have to choose. Again, he has never met the 2 friends. This morning I woke up to him sending me an image that said ""don't make someone a priority when they make you an option.""

908,t3_rtzcl5,AITA ?? Family member is “renting a room” in our home....,"My wife and I are working adults. She’s an RN I deliver mail, we make a good living. We have a nice-ish house in CA with an ocean view. (For context) 

Her cousin is a college student whose relationship status was changing and asked if she could rent our extra room for a couple months. Of course we said  ok with a couple of ground rules, she agreed and said she could pay $350 per month. She had no job and was living off financial aid. 

Welp, she ended up getting a full time job and “taking a break” from school just a few weeks later when the semester ended. Our main issue is that she is 30 years old and a “gamer”. She goes to work then comes home and starts up her computer rig that looks like she’s driving a space ship. She has full use of the house and is very comfortable using all of our things. 

We want her to move on (she can’t afford to get her own place) or raise her rent. 

My issue is, I feel this was all planned. Her older sister is the type to pull out her “handbook” and state her sisters “rights”. This could cause a much larger family issue. If she was 20, things might be different but she is 30 and only 5-7 years younger than us. We don’t want to adopt an adult child.

909,t3_rtzbrv,AITA for snapping at a friend because her idea of masculinity is ridiculous?,"I recently went out with a friend for lunch, and we were discussing our home lives as you do. She was complaing that her partner is really messy and he never even does basic stuff around the house like putting his laundry in the hamper and asked is my hubby was the same. She's works part time and her partner full time for reference.

Hubby and I own a business together, though I am very much the key person in our business. The way we have our work/home life organized is I do 80% of the work in the business and pull super long hours and so he does 80% of the work in the home. I asked if she could do a percentage breakdown with her partner to see if he could see how much work being in charge of the home was. 

She was a bit confused and so I explained that it's been months since I've done any laundry, I cook maybe once a week, but I do groceries and dishes, and my hubby does the school runs with the kids etc, and he spends around the same amount of time doing these home orientated tasks that I work extra in the business so that's how we keep things fair. 

We both get a whole day off once a week when nothing is expected of us and having everything broken down has really helped us not become resentful of each other and that we appreciate the work we both do to run both our home and our business. We literally sat down and said ok, kid drop offs and pick ups take an hour each day, laundry takes 45 minutes, dishes take 20 minutes, grocery shopping takes an hour etc, then broke down the business stuff the same way and arranged our schedules so even though it's not 50% each of home/business stuff, it's 50% overall if that makes sense. I excell at work stuff, he's way better at home stuff so it works for us.

She got really quiet and asked if I was sure my partner wasn't gay. I laughed and told her that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. 

Probably not the best reaction. She said she wasn't trying to be mean but that I was emasculating my partner and chances are he was scared to come out of the closet because his family is religious. 

I told her that my partner isn't scared of having an ambitious and strong wife, and I'd rather have a partner act like a partner than an extra child to tend to. She got really teary and said I didn't have to be mean. Admittedly I was upset as I was pretty annoyed that she thought of my husband's contribution to our lives as less masculine or that he's gay for doing housework. I think of him as extremely masculine and he's very secure in himself. 

We left and she sent me a message later saying that just because she chooses to live differently than me doesn't make her any less than. I replied that I was actually encouraging her to make her partner see the value of her work but she's still very angry at me and isn't talking to me.

I told her this was unacceptable and if she was unable to check on them she should’ve told me because I would’ve asked someone else. It’s not a small thing like watering my plants, these are real life beings you can’t just decide you don’t feel like checking on them.

I told her that asking someone to check on them is being a responsible pet owner, I would never ever just leave them to fend for themselves.

She calls bio-dad by his first name.

She recently got engaged and invited her bio-dad and his wife to the party. I dislike her bio-dad for many reasons but all are based on how he treated my wife and my daughter. He was abusive to them both. The last straw for me was when he kidnapped my daughter at 7 years old (he had custody for a bit and then ran with her) We didn't know where she was for 2 weeks and it was the worst moment of my wife's and my life. We both struggled to let her out of our sight for years to follow and were in therapy because of the trauma. Her bio-dad faced consequences.

She wants to invite him to her engagement party and I told her I will not be around a man that hurt her. I told her its the worst thing for a parent when someone hurts their child.

915,t3_rtz1ku,AITA for walking out of my boyfriend’s celebratory dinner?,"So my boyfriend, Kyle (26M) recently got a promotion to general manager at the restaurant he works at. I (22F) work full time as a pediatric nurse and my hours are kinda all over the place right now because of the virus. Anyway, when he got home to tell me about his promotion I was ecstatic. He’s a hard worker and deserves it, 100%. But because it happened on a Tuesday, we decided we’ll go for a celebratory dinner with our mutual friends Saturday night. 

I was scheduled to work Saturday, but I figured that as long as I was able to get home, shower, and change all is well. I’ll just sleep late on Sunday. 

So fast forward to Saturday. I unfortunately lost a patient who had been fighting for her life since birth. I’ve been her nurse every time I was working in that department and her and her family were very important to me. I was absolutely devastated. 

When I got home the last thing on my mind was dinner. I told Kyle about what happened and he gave me a hug and said he’s sorry to hear that. About 10 minutes later he -softly- asked if I was going to go shower before we leave. I told him I really don’t feel like going out, but he insisted that I go since I promised and if he goes without me his friends will ask a lot of questions. 

I didn’t want to, but I agreed since I did promise. While I tried to keep a smile on my face, it was obvious I was upset. One of our friends asked if I was okay, and before I could just say I had a rough day at work, Kyle said “She’s been bitching about a patient she lost at work today” and scoffed. 

I was flabbergasted. He’s never said anything like that before. I replied saying “That patient was 3 months old.” 

He shrugged and said that it’s not my own child and it shouldn’t bother me this much. I was furious and embarrassed since this went down in front of our friends so I just put down enough money for my meal and went home. I put his stuff in a box (he wasn’t living with me but would stay with me 2-3 days a week). When he came back he flipped out and I just said I need space. 

That was 2 weeks ago. I have since changed the locks since he had a spare key. He says I’m overreacting and that I’m an AH for ruining his big night. That I, selfishly, made it all about me. He accused me of thinking higher of myself because I’m a nurse and he works at a restaurant (honestly idk where that came from). And he also said that he figured since it was a celebratory dinner for him, he thought I was going to pay and so walking out on him was very embarrassing cause he didn’t bring his wallet.

One of our mutual friends, Amy, called me and said that while what Kyle said was fucked up that me leaving like that was unnecessary and it made the whole night awkward. 

I feel bad for ruining the night for everyone else but I just couldn’t let him get away with that. I’m very proud to be a nurse and I don’t want anyone (especially my partner) to talk poorly about it. So do you guys think I’m TA for walking out on dinner?

EDIT: Wow thank you guys so much for all the kind comments ❤️ I’ve just now been able to read through most of the newer comments and I’ve got tears in my eyes 🥲. I’ve lost a handful of patients since I became a nurse (and one whilst in nursing school) and while it definitely hurt me, I’ve never been THIS impacted by it. It still hurts to think about and I’m sure it will for a long long time. But hearing your guys’ opinions and seeing your support honestly means the world. 

I wasn’t sure if I was overreacting by packing his stuff out since this was the first BIG issue I’ve had with him, but seeing your comments I realize that I wasn’t. Seeing how all of you, who are internet strangers that have absolutely no reason to leave such sweet, caring comments, have way more compassion and empathy for me (and the baby) than the man who’s supposed to be there for me, says quite a lot. So thank you all so much

EDIT 2: So I’ve been seeing some comments about the wallet thing. I honestly have no idea if he actually forgot it or if he just said that to get off the HUGE check, which my friend said was over $500. I wasn’t aware he wasn’t paying until after he was gone so I didn’t check the house to see if it was actually there.

EDIT 3: So it’s 10:20 AM and I can happily say Kyle is completely out of my life. His friend picked up the last of his stuff about an hour ago. I called Kyle and ‘officially’ (even thought it was kinda obvious) broke up with him and his number is blocked!! Time for a mimosa aha!!

I wanted to pick up some work that I could do and told my mom that I’m looking to get a car to work (I can’t work without one, suburban US) 

She said she would help me get one, and take a loan out since she has better credit than me (no credit). She said that if she does this not to expect anything for my
Birthday or Christmas this year. We looked at cars together and picked one out. She told me she should get the car in her name so she could add it to her insurance since if I tried to insure it myself that I’d have a higher rate. Of course I agreed to everything, telling her that I’ll pay her the insurance if she just tells me how much it will be a month. 


Well we got the car and she told me to be sure to tell my stepdad thank you since he helped pay for it too. 


Well a few days pass and my mom mentions to me, “yeah, the reason we got that car is because we really need another car. But we will let you use it some If you need to go to work.” 

And I’m really angry at this. I know for a fact that she told me that the car was mine, and the only reason that she needed her name on it was for insurance. 


I know on one hand that I’m not owed a gift. What I think happened was that she told my stepdad that it would be their car to get him to put in money for it and now she has to backtrack to avoid making him upset, which I’d be upset if I were him too. 

But on the other hand, she is not trying to gaslight me, telling me that she told me from the start it will be their car and I’m
Just allowed to use it for work. I know what she said to be but she is trying to convince me that I misunderstood. Let me be clear; there is no doubt in my mind that she told me from the start that she was getting the car for me for my birthday (which is also in December.) she also got my brother and sister presents- but not as big as a vehicle. 

I wouldn’t be as upset if she was just honest. If she said, “Hey, when I promised the car, it was a bit more than I expected and we can’t afford to give a gift that expensive.” I would completely understand.

918,t3_rtyice,AITA for being mad at my mom for choosing my stepfather’s kid’s Christmas party over telling me my grandma died?,"Me 21f, was studying in the Netherlands, and I came home on the 23th of December for the holidays. My grandma (on father side) died on the 22th and my parents decided not to tell me till I arrived. My parents are divorced, my mom remarried since, and her new husband has his own kids. They celebrate Christmas with their dad on the 23th and me and my sister with ours. 

When I arrived I chat a little with my mom, and then I went to my room to unpack. My dad and sister went to see a play, so we both knew he wouldn’t pick me up for hours. After 2 hours my stepdad’s kids came

After my dad picked me up, we arrived to my father’s, he told me the bad news about my grandma. I was devestated, I was really close to her, and I haven’t seen her in months. Moreover my father isn’t the most emotionally intelligent, he used clumsy, long sentences, he took big breaks and went into detail about her funeral. When I started crying, he pat me on the shoulder, and left me to “clear my mind”. My sister, whom my mother already spoke to, tried to console me, but she was heartbroken too, so I ended up calming her instead. 

I called up my mom, but she didn’t pick up. At last I phoned my boyfriend and we spoke for an hour. After two hours my mom called me back. I told her what had happened, she said, that she was sorry, she couldn’t pick up, but she could only call me after the stepkid Christmas ended. I got angry and accused her of neglecting me for her stepfamily. She said, that she just didn’t have time “to deal with me”, and she hoped, my father would “take care of me”. I told her that she knew him, she should have guessed, he will be terrible at delivering the news. She got angry too, and told me “it’s not my fault that your father is stupid”, and I should understand why she was having a Christmas party. I was upset and I hung up the phone. 

We came home on the 24th and I had an argument with my mom again. It was the same, she said that she was sorry, but she had to prepare for the stepkids Christmas and she didn’t have the time. I said she chose them over my wellbeing. 

This was hard on our relationship. I don’t get why she can’t, how it was unfair that she didn’t make time for me before the kids arrived or while they were there. They only visit their father twice a year even though they live 30 minutes away. So it’s not like they deserved a perfect party for their efforts. And it isn’t the first time she put them first over us. 

She says it’s my father’s fault, which is partly true, but I think she should’ve known he can’t handle this (they were married for 15 years). And my dad is really suffering, because he had a fight with grandma right before her death. He doesn’t know what to do with his own emotions not to mention mine. So AITA?",18.0
919,t3_rtyfkx,AITA For Driving Slow?,"So earlier today a car behind me got mad at me for driving slowly and tried to cut around me only to find themself in a ditch. 

It went like this, I was driving home from my sisters house and she lives a few miles outside of the suburbs so it’s mostly back roads. I’m driving like ten under the speed limit because the roads are wet, it’s pitch black, and the fog is so dense you can’t see ten feet in front of you. 

Out of nowhere this car comes flying up behind me and is riding my ass. At first I ignore it because we have shit drivers around here and I’m pretty used to it. After a minute or two of me not speeding up they start honking. 

Now here’s where I feel like I was an ass. 

There’s a straight stretch of road with woods on one side and fields on the other. I drive this road several times a week at this time so I know there are tons of deer who cross here. I slow down even more because honestly that’s my first instinct when coming up to that area but also I was getting annoyed by the car behind me. 

The car behind me blares it’s horn again and goes to drive around me but ends up skidding and stopping in a drainage ditch on the side of the road.

I immediately stop and get out to make sure they’re ok only to be met by yelling. So I spend the next half hour sitting there waiting for a cop to come out and all I can think is I’m such an ass because I caused this. 

Anyways, I’m not at fault but I still feel kind of bad.

Edit: Some people are suggesting I should have pulled over. Had there been anywhere to pull over I would have but it’s literally just miles of woods and fields with drainage ditches on both sides. The few driveways that are on that road have gates to prevent people from pulling in and turning around.

Edit 2: Thank you for the comments and concerns. It was dumb of me to pull over but I panicked and obviously do really stupid things when panicked.",67.0
920,t3_rtye7a,AITA for asking my husband to do his half of the chores even though I'm a Stay-At-Home-Mom?,"I (32f) asked my husband (32m) to do his half of the chores even though I'm a SAHM. 

For context, we had our first child a year ago and I had been dealing with Postpartum depression and anxiety. 

Originally, we had agreed to both be stay at home parents (we live off of his disability comp) when we decided to have a child. Things became harder to unexpected expenses &amp; a pandemic. One of us had to go back to work. 

My husband works graveyards 3 days a week, 12 hour shifts. And those days I usually have baby from 5pm to 2pm. Here is where issues began...

I asked my husband if he could wash at least the bottles so I had some for the night while he's at work. He never did them but instead played video games &amp; had his ""me time."" For 3 weeks he hasn't touched the dishes or washed bottles. I do the laundry, sweep, mop, dust, shop for groceries, cook and pay the bills (&amp; the dishes when he doesn't do them before work). I also run my small business.

At LEAST he could do the dishes, throw the trash, help hang laundry &amp; pick up after the dogs &amp; cats for me so I don't get overwhelmed. That's half of the chores, right? 

The night of our argument he told me he needs his me time &amp; it would be nice to have a wife that didn't need his help to do the dishes - he wants to come home to a clean house &amp; doesn't like when I nag him. He told me that I should stop my small business because he didn't like that I need time on his days off to complete orders from customers. I told him I need his help so my mental health doesn't plummet and I can be a better parent when he's at work.

She said the first name is a tribute to her late sister and the middle name is after her dad and her husband’s middle names, so she has refused. I have even asked my mom to get involved to talk to her mom to get them to change their kid’s name. They have more time to figure out different names, but my cousin won’t change it because she said she’s naming the baby after her dead sister and she’s been with her husband for three years and married for a year and a half, unlike me who just got pregnant by some random guy, which was a RUDE comment and made me even madder at me. Now, I have uninvited her and the rest of her family from my baby shower until she changes her baby’s name, especially because she is going to call it Alex, like we are.

922,t3_rty7o4,AITA for not letting my daughter(19) move back in after I gave her old room to her brother?,"When my(44f) daughter graduated I told her there were either 2 ways she was staying under my roof: 1. Going to school full time and not having to pay rent, or 2. Working and paying rent($350 a month) to stay in her old room.

The first year she went to school at our local community college and even though she worked, I didn't make her pay rent. This year, however, she decided to take a year off to save money and because she didn't like the online format. I was fine with that, but did inform her that she would need to start paying rent.

My daughter didn't take me seriously, and when first month came around and I asked for it she was shocked. We argued about it for days. She didn't think it was fair since she was still contributing towards groceries. I told her she was working full time and she needed to contribute. In response, she decided to move out last month and move in with her dad and stepmom and stopped talking to me.

I'm a single mom with 3 kids, and the house we live in is 3 bedrooms, so my daughter has her own room while her brothers share. When she left I left my oldest son(13) move into her bedroom, but now my daughter wants to move back home because my ex's wife told her she needed to leave. 

I told my daughter that unfortunately there is not longer room for her beecause her brother is staying in her old room and I'm not going to make him move back out just because she's done throwing her tantrum about it. 

My daughter has taken to living on a friend's couch for now, and won't talk to either me or my ex-husband. She didn't even see us for the holidays this year which really hurts my feelings. My parents have talked about letting her move in with them, but she is very adamant about moving back in with me but I still refuse to make my son move back. AITA?

Edit: She doesn't want to sleep on my couch, she wants her old room back. Even so, I don't want her sleeping on the couch either and taking up space in the living room.

She and her stepmom argued too much, and stepmom made her leave. I don't like stepmom and neither do my son's so I don't blame my daughter because her stepmom is very confrontational but my daughter also knew this when she decided to move in with them.

My daughter made 10$/ hour and worked at least 20-30 hours every week. She is still planning on going back to school, but took time off to save money and what for the pandemic to cool down

923,t3_rty4a0,AITA for asking my roommate to ask me before he throws parties?,"I'm a sophomore in college, and I room with two other guys. We'll call them Paul and Jake for the sake of this thread. We live in a high rise apartment downtown near our university. The apartment is a bit on the smaller side. This will be relevant later. 

Paul is a pretty extroverted guy. He's always having people over and he throws parties at least once every few weeks at our apartment. We've lived together for almost a year at this point, and this has been consistent. The thing is, Paul doesn't work, and right now he's only taking one class, so he has a lot of time on his hands. I work 15-20 hours a week at a retail store and am taking full time hours at our university. I also play on one of my school's esports teams. 

This context is needed to understand why I've felt the way I have recently. My issue is that Paul never asks me or Jake before he throws his parties. We find out after he's already invited everyone, and by then I would feel bad about asking him to cancel because everyone is already planning on coming. 

One night he threw a party, I had to work at 6 AM the next day, and I had a very difficult time falling asleep because there were so many people packed into our small apartment, and they were drunk and loud. I texted him and asked him if he could ask next time before throwing a party due to my work schedule which fluctuates from week to week. He said yes and apologized, so I figured that it would be fine. Unfortunately, this was not the case. 

He kept throwing parties without asking, and eventually this once again lined up with a morning shift, and this time I reminded him that I had asked him to ask me about throwing parties, and that he had agreed, and to my surprise, he was pissed. He said he didn't need my permission to invite his guests to his own apartment, that he paid his rent, and that I wasn't his parent. We ended up getting in a verbal fight (he was home to see his family at the time so nothing physical occurred). 

He told me he had problems with me as a roommate too, and basically called me gross to live with and that my room smelled bad. Granted, I admit that my room is a mess, but I asked Jake, and he said he couldn't smell anything and thought Paul was exaggerating. Regardless, I told Paul that if he had an issue with it, he should have told me sooner rather than just using it to win a ""who's the shittier roommate"" argument. I told him I would clean after myself more, but that he should try to understand that my schedule was much busier than his, and that he should be more considerate of my sleep, especially before days I work. 

Unfortunately, this still hasn't been fixed, and he's still throwing parties without asking me or Jake. But I'm not saying anything anymore because we only have a couple of months left, and I just don't want to cause anymore conflict before we move out.

My bf used to be in school while running a small business, and that small business covered his expenses. But due to covid, his business gradually died and I ended up having to cover his part of the rent and some other expenses. He paid me back some of them when he had income but borrowed more when he did not. His debt to me is now around 7.5k. 

Now. We both just graduated from school this year and started making good money, with him making 20k more than I do annually. I expect him to start paying me back monthly, but he also has medical debts due to a surgery he underwent, some high interest debts that is related to that surgery as well, and student loans, about 50k in total. He is asking me if it’s possible to postpone paying me back so that he can clear his debts that has interests first. 

I don’t have any debt myself (because of family support that I used to have). I don’t have any urgent reason for collecting this debt from him. I just don’t feel comfortable with him owing me that much money (my savings is lower than what he owes me).

Long story short, I came home from being out 8+ hours all day… to someone parked in the spot I pay $120 for every month. Our other two spots were already filled. One by snow, one by my roommates car. NOBODY from my household let me know who parked in it, and both of them knew. This is the third day in a row a non resident has parked in my assigned, paid parking. So what did I do? Have them towed. Its the third day in a row someone has decided “Oh hey? Assigned parking? Ima park here”. Mind you, there is literally a sign saying if you are a guest to park in guest parking. The guest parking had one small spot left, the size of the car currently parked in my spot. I have a full size sedan which couldn’t fit, otherwise I would have parked there. 

So, me being a resident, I called the towing our building is associated with to have the car towed. When I came inside, I was angry as hell and started shouting because I was annoyed and upset someone kept parking there. Mostly because this is a repeat offense of someone parking in my spot after I’ve been gone all day at work. So I was fed up.

I'm entirely happy with this. I've never been all that smart, so college...wasn't working out for me. When we met I was failing all my real classes and uncertain of what to do. Hayley saved me. Now I get to live in security and focus on making art, and in return I...do trophy wife things. I love her, I genuinely, truly do, but I do know how it looks.

I love my niece and I will never ever blame her for my sister's mistakes, but it unfortunately uprooted my life. It caused a significant side track in my career and I've had to turn down better job offers even because they wouldn't allow me to stay close enough to home. My parents love my niece, but cannot take on the responsibility of caring for her so I don't want to separate them.

I had never planned to have children. I even had a boyfriend before I took in my niece, but he also did not want to have children, and we made the decision to part when I took her in. 

We have never hid from my niece who her biological mother is, and even though the first few years of her life were hard, three's years ago my sister started being in our lives again. She told me that she wishes for me to keep raising my niece because I have the better job, and can afford it. My sister only has her ged, and can hardly afford to keep herself afloat.

My sister acts like a aunt to her daughter, not like a mother, and my niece still loves her mother greatly.

We are extremely close (met in uni) and talk on the phone for hours almost every day and fly to see each otherwise constantly or meet on vacations. It is not unusual for her to call me (via handsfree) from her car when running errands or things like that.

She is extremely type A. She plans everything, she is particular and stubborn but also smart, though sometimes the know it all. She has a high paying job, I am getting my graduate degree and teach. I am exact opposite of her. ADHD, flight risk, traveler, artist type. I think I am a smart individual, but I can also be an idiot when I am doing too much at once. We have taken on a relationship where she is always helping me. She writes my grocery list when I am rambling about things I need or while we’re on the phone and will text me it. If I’m having a bad week she will even doordash it to me. When I am overwhelmed she writes my to do lists for me. I am capable, but she just takes that role.
.
She has a bar down the street from her (5 min drive) that has become her spot since moving. She will drive there after work and get one drink or two and go home every Friday or two. That doesn’t bother me. My problem is when she will drive there to drink for a few hours and then drive home. She only does this twice a month or so on Saturdays, really she doesn’t drink more than once a weekend or less. On the way home she will call me to tell me about her night and I will always inquire how much she had to drink. She makes statements like “im buzzed but im not drunk”. in my mind why not just uber? Its a short distance and its readily available in her area. She claims its a short drive and she would “never actually drive drunk or be that irresponsible”. She has ubered too, when she plans on actually getting drunk, and that shes not and she knows the difference.

Heres where IMBTA: Last night she calls me, New Years Eve, she had gone out from 21-2. She was trying to get fast food because she said she was buzzed and wanted it. its just after midnight where I am. She said she drank 6-7 drinks over the course of the night. So I called her out for driving and she corrected herself saying she wasnt drunk and she was making a joke. She was offended by this and I said this in front of my family. They all heard and in the background were saying she wasnt thinking. She said “well look, I’m home, safe, like I said. Im going to bed. Goodnight” and hung up.

935,t3_rtx6r1,AITA for not wanting to replace my mom's air plants?,"Throwaway because my family uses Reddit

For reference, I am 17M and my parents are both divorced so I stay with each 50/50.

At my Dad's house, there are little to no rules and I can pretty much do as I please as long as I do my chores around the house and get my school work done. At my Mom's this is a different case. She and my stepdad can be nit-picky over small things such as where I take off my shoes and how I do my chores around the house. This often makes it difficult for me when transitioning to her place with the rules changing from house to house. 

She also has a habit of moving my things around while I'm at my Dad's without asking me first. Just this week she put a huge plant in my room that now takes up an entire corner. I have asked her nicely multiple times to not do this but she always shrugs it off and doesn't see how this would annoy me. 

She recently got a kitten around half a year ago. I was against the idea because we already have a dog, but she wanted one nonetheless. At around this time, she started to decorate our house with air plants. I had no problem with this but I asked her to please not put them in our upstairs bathroom (the one that I primarily use) because I did not want to have to be responsible for them. In response to this, she told me not to worry about them and that she would take care of them.

Now half a year later, our kitten has taken an interest in the plants. She recently began to target the ones that are in the upstairs bathroom and eats/plays with them. Seeing this, she got angry with me and asked me to make sure to keep my bathroom door shut. I've been trying my best to, but I sometimes forget.  So I suggested that she put the plants in her bathroom, but she was against it because ""they don't belong there.""

Now she wants me to pay for her expensive air plants because the cat keeps getting to them.

937,t3_rtx0d7,AITA for making my daughter re-home her kitten,"I have 2 kids (f17, f15), 2 dogs, a cat, and chickens. One of the dogs is a family dog and the other is my older daughter's emotional support dog. Our cat (let's call her Comet) is an indoor/outdoor cat and hunts the mice/rats that the chickens attract.

My younger daughter has been begging us to get her a kitten because Comet isn't the kind of cat that you can cuddle with or play with. We said no because we already had enough animals in and around the house. She got mad because we got my older daughter a dog and we eventually came to a compromise. She could get a cat but she had to sign a contract saying that she will get a job and pay for everything regarding the cat, she will take care of the cat by herself, the cat can't burden the rest of us, and that it's her responsibility to keep the cat protected from Comet (Comet is very territorial. She tolerates both of our dogs but is not cat friendly) by keeping her cat in a separate part of the house. Then at the bottom it said that if at any time the conditions are not met, her cat will be re-homed.

She signed the contract and she got a kitten (Tiger) a couple months ago. So far Comet has gotten to him 6 times (thankfully he had no/mild injuries), she goes a few days without cleaning the litter boxes and those areas start to smell, she tried giving Tiger Comet's food (Comet eats an expensive brand of food), and she puts Tiger in the bathroom that she shares with my older daughter at night because he wakes her up. The problem is Tiger jumps on my older daughter and it scares her, so she feels like she can't use that bathroom at night. She also yelled at all of us multiple times for not helping her with Tiger.

We've warned her that she has to get her shit together and take care of Tiger or else we have to re-home him. She yelled at us for helping take care of my other daughter's dog but not her cat and said that we were clearly playing favorites.

I told her she had 2 weeks to get her shit together or else Tiger has to be re-homed. Those 2 weeks have passed and nothing changed so I made her re-home Tiger.

She hasn't spoken to me since and has been lashing out at my older daughter because I still help take care of her dog so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",311.0

Now that she’s a bit older, I’ve been looking forward to getting her some special occasion outfits because she has tons of everyday clothes. My SIL is constantly buying her these outfits right before events and making it so we feel obligated to only use what she buys. She has 3 kids, one a daughter, but she is a bit obsessed with mine. Constantly wanting her to spend the night with her, buying things, posting just about her, commenting on every picture that she’s her favorite, wanting to do mother daughter things with her, etc. And for the most part it’s annoying but it’s brushed off as obsessive but not harmful. So WIBTA if I asked her to not buy her these special outfit clothes this year as we’re excited to do that ourselves?

939,t3_rtwuh8,AITA for no longer talking to my best friend’s ex even though we used to be friends?,"this is a complicated story but senior year of high school i had a very close knit friend group. my best friend and her now ex were a part of it and obviously started dating but broke up right before we all graduated. before she broke up, she came to me crying about how she was miserable in the relationship and how she felt he was condescending and dismissive of her, and never actually got to know her. she wanted to break up with him and i supported her. 

of course this posed an issue: drama in the friend group. my best friend is someone i have always supported and always want to support and he broke her heart, so automatically i kind of just picked her side. the break up blew the friend group apart, and most people ended up siding with my best friend. we still tried to talk to her ex, but every time he was around her she would begin to have a really bad panic attack and it was a mess so inevitably the friend group split up. 

now we all left for college, and i am going to college with my best friend who is also my roommate. i never reached out to her ex and i took him off of my private stories. i never personally had bad blood with him, but he broke my best friends heart and i wanted to protect her privacy as i was now spending a lot of time with her. 

some of our other friends tried and pretty successfully have kept in contact with both of them separately, and she has said that was fine to their face but then complained behind their back that it felt hurtful to her. 

now we’re back home for winter break, and one of my friends confronted me yesterday about not supporting him and cutting him off without giving him a chance and how that made me a shitty friend. she said that he didn’t understand what he did wrong, and that i was the only person she confided in. she said that everything she found out about my best friend’s feelings was through me, and she didn’t tell her ex anything. my best friend claims that she told everyone how she feels and she’s upset that they’re all still friends with him.

 he’s upset that everyone cut him off without giving him a chance. she’s pushing me to reach out to him.  but i kind of want to leave everything behind and start fresh. 

she also thinks my relationship with my best friend is unhealthy that i put 100% into her and it’s causing problems. in my other relationships. she told me that it looked unhealthy from the outside.

Note this happens often and she commonly just stops walking until she gets it out( normally a minute).  I’m just standing there until she gets it out.

941,t3_rtwez8,AITA for not autorise to play with my wheelchair ?,"\[Background\] I (F29) am ""different"" for number reasons. I'm a hight IQ, I'm autistic and in whellchair due to a very rare genetic disease which become more and more serious with the time. I haven't never been very accepted by my family. My mother had me at 16 and she's the eldest of her siblings. So all my siblings and cousins are very youngers than me. I'm closer in age of my uncles and aunts... Nobody learned my siblings / cousins to accept different people and when I was younger it was very difficult. I was bullied, they kept my crutchs (until 16 I was able to walk with crutchs, since I'm in wheelchair) hidden them when I was in a chair. They tried to push the buttons of my autism,... When I was 14, I asked to leave for a special boarding school (I'm VERY priviliged because my country is very aware of the needs of diseable people). Now (for 1 year only !) I'm a PhD in Biology (humane genetic) and I'm working as a young researcher around rare diseases... I have my live, I have care helpers every day at home, a flat where the furnitures are made for diseabled peole, a special car andfriends... So everything is OK.

\[Now\] My mother has a stade 4 cancer and I want to see her a little bit more. Many times, my cousins asked me to play with my wheelchair, I refused and explained it's not a game, I need it to live. I explained calmy 3/4 times but at the end I said something that ""it's unacceptable to want to play with it, it was done for me with my precise needs"" They began to cry, my uncles / aunts looked at me as a witch and cuddled their children saying ""they are selfish people even in family"" I kept quiet for my mum. Later I was on a sofa, talking lovely with my mum. I saw my wheelchair isn't more where I put it. I can't make a move without so I called every one to help. My step-dad found it in a bedroom... A wheel is broken, some material were cut, they wrote ""dumb autist it's a game"" on it... And I broke down  against them but also against their parents they never teached them respect. Really I was very angry against everyone. One aunt said ""if you have left them play a little with it, they didn't do that""

Two uncles carried me in a room and my stepdad take at my home my emergency wheelchair (it's not anymore adapted for my needs but I'll be able to survive until the other is repaired).

Now I'm alone in a room and I have texts of my family saying I broke down like a child, I'm unfair against them and I destroyed the last new year eve of my mother.So AITA to talk firmly against my little cousins and say to the parents they are responsible ? Really I'm in deep hole because of my mother

\[UPDATE\] First I never though to have so many and so nice answers. Really it's made me life to me.Thank you from all my heart.20 min before midnight my Mum texted me ""I know you'll be sad but for the relieve of all, it'll be very better if you come back to your home not saying anything, my sisters are very angry about you and children had tantrum so their parents'll give them a gift because they can't play as they wanted on a happy evening. Have a good night"" (the house is big and my car was very close the exit door but they had say, I can sleep here because I have one hour to drive (the new year eve with people drunk, the night etc..)I stayed stunned for a moment, then I left crying. Until the house was far, I stopped in a 24/7 shop to buy snacks and drinks for the road and to calm myself. Now I'm at home with my animals.

I never see them, I have my own life very different to them and I know they'll judge my friends, my values. This year it was for my mother, but she didn't even kiss me, or said she's sorry for me. NOTHING. I'm feeling broken. I don't like to make problems to others but now I'm really thinking of a legal action. If a fire would begin, I wasn't be able to leave the house for 2 hours (when my stepdad left to keep my emergency wheelchair) for exampleI'll try to sleep and I'll see after more accuracy.So many thanks for your answers.And many blessings for the new year

I'm from Scandinavia (little countries so I don't say more) English is only my third language, after my native and German. I only use it when I'm reading scientific articles or have talks online with other researchers. And when I'm front of Youtube !I'm sorry for mistakes and to mix American / English / ... expressions

\[UPDATE 2\] I'm sending blessings to all people who wrote PM, asked news, and were so supportive.The last hours were horrible.I blocked all my family in my RS after texts, pm, oral messages saying how I'm an horrible, selfish and immature person.I made a mistake because when my mother called me the morning, I said to her about maybe to do a legal action, she answered than if I do that, I must know that she's already died for me. I was upset trying to explain me and understand why.For the first time, she said to me she never made the choice to keep me when she was 16, she didn't make an abortion because it's was legally too late when she learnt she was pregnant and she'll never accept I do something against her family.I answered ""mum I'm very happy to see and kiss you yesterday. I'm hoping I'll be able to keep in mind the happy moment we shared on the sofa talking like normal mother / daughter and I hope someone will call me when the cancer win against you.""I stopped the call and I had an autistic meltdown.One of my life carers arrived later, she called a doctor. Now I'm better, I send messages saying, I'll not be present at my research lab tomorrow. I'll begin legal action.I'm feeling myself in pieces.Again thank you very very much for the support.I'm not thinking there will another update.",8.0
942,t3_rtwegv,AITA for not accepting my Grandparents Christmas Present?,"tl/dr: my grandparents who never showed interest or affection to me wanted to gift me something for Christmas after I cut contact to them. I don't want their present and it's still unopened on our table. AITA for not calling them to thank them? WIBTA if I took whatever is inside the present?

So, to make a long story short, I never had a good (if one at all) relationship with my grandparents, as they never showed interest in me or my sister. As kids we were just an annoying burden to them and they didn't want to have anything to do with us. Now that we are grown up they expect a caring relationship for each other. 

Two or three years ago they tried to bribe my sister and I into a relationship by gifting each of us a huge amount of money, which we both didn't want. We couldn't decline the money though, as they handed it to our parents when they visited them. When my sister and I payed our grandparents a visit to handle this issue, they bad mouthed both our parents and talked down on us while we were there. We told them that we don't want any presents from them.

The last time I spoke to them was about a year ago when I called them (I don't remember why I called in the first place). I talked to my grandma for (literally) a few seconds when all of a sudden she said

""I have to hang up, there is someone else on the line""

and immediately hung up, or so she thought. She didn't hung up properly and I could hear her say to my grandpa: 

""It's no use talking to him, he doesn't say anything anyways""

I was baffled. This just showed me again that she doesn't care about me at all. My parents were mad about this as well. I decided to cut contact to my grandparents for good.

Now we come to last Christmas. My parents payed them a visit on the 27th. When they returned home, they had two envelopes for my sister and me from my grandparents. I didn't even open it, threw it on the table and said ""I don't want this. Neither their money, nor their attention"". My parents weren't mad and even apologized for bringing the envelopes. They tried to deny them, but our grandparents insisted of giving them to us. My sister called them the next day and thanked them for whatever was in that envelope, but I didn't.

I'm not someone you can simply buy out with money when a closer relationship just happens to be convenient for someone. The envelope is still on the table and probably won't make it's way back to my grandparents, as my parents won't bring it back to them and sending it per mail isn't an option, as our post office often ""loses"" birthday or Christmas cards.

So, am I the asshole for denying this present and not calling them? Would I be the asshole if I would take whatever is inside the envelope?",9.0

944,t3_rtw6g9,AITA for contacting my bio father as an adult when he told me not to contact him when I was a teen?,"I (22ftm) grew up without a dad, seeing as my bio dad (BD) left before I was born.

When I was 13, after the only contact for that time being photos my mum would send him of me (no responses), I suddenly got a card in the mail. It was addressed to me specifically. It was from BD and his wife, announcing they'd had a daughter.

Before that point I had never had any real desire to contact him, but since he had contacted me first I thought it would be ok to write him a letter. I left my e-mail in the letter, and he sent me an e-mail. It became a back-and-forth, and eventually we met up. I got to meet my baby sister, etc.

The relationship between me and BD was pretty much strained for a year. Eventually our contact got less. I didn't see him for a long while. I still made efforts to e-mail him but his responses got fewer. He said he was having health issues.

I got a birth card announcing the birth of my brother, and I hadn't even known BD's wife was pregnant. That really hurt. I admittedly blew up (note: I was 14, almost 15). This was also around the time my mum and I finally got away from her ex, and I was doing terrible mentally at the time (I later got diagnosed with PTSD bc of some things ex did to me).

BD, when faced with my anger, informed me he no longer wanted to be in contact with me, blocked me on facebook and stopped responding to e-mails. I spoke to his wife on the phone one more time, and she said he would probably come back around eventually since I had by then apologized for getting mad, but he never did. I asked him for some medical background when I was in the hospital at age 16, and by the tone of writing I kind of think it was his wife who responded to that e-mail.

A few months ago I sent another e-mail. I wasn't really sure what I expected, but I'm 22 now and if nothing else I figured it would maybe be good for me, and hopefully him too, if we talked about what happened as two adults.

He never responded, but today my mum told me that he sent her an angry e-mail asking why ""she had let her \[daughter\] contact him again"" and basically accused her (mum) of conspiring to ruin his life.

Obviously BD thinks IATA, my mum says IATA for contacting someone who's made it pretty clear he doesn't want to be contacted.

The way I see it when he said that, I was a kid, and he was telling an angry, irrational-due-to-trauma kid not to contact him when he probably already had a lot of shit (a baby and a toddler) to deal with. I also feel like he's TA for dangling a possible relationship in front of a pre-teen's face, not trying very hard to get to know that teen, and then dropping the whole thing the second that teen wasn't 100% nice to him, which is common behaviour for teens.

I thought contacting him now would be different since I'm an adult. And I feel as if my siblings and I deserve a chance to get to know each other. I was also fully prepared for a no, but I was not prepared for this level of hostility.

AITA?

Edit: please stop referring to me as she. I am ftm transgender, aka a man. I get that that might have been unclear from the post before so I don't fault anyone, however being referred to as a woman gives me really bad dysphoria.

Also I'm not sure where people are getting that I reached out to him twice? I did not reach out to him, get ignored and then reach out again. I reached out once. The last time I'd reached out before that was a medical emergency.

He didn't respond when I reached out, but he did e-mail my mum angrily. After one e-mail from me, in which I wasn't demanding anything. I was fully ready to give up when he didn't respond, and even more so now.

Thanks everyone for the responses. You've all given me food for thought.",402.0
945,t3_rtw5q2,AITA for asking my husband to scale back his fancy cooking?,"My (31f) husband (32m) got into cooking about a year ago, during the lockdown part of the pandemic. He started small but has quickly come to love making elaborate, fancy dishes. 

At first, I was super excited about this. It gave him a hobby other than videogames/screentime and of course I loved getting to eat all the great dishes he cooked!

However, things have now gotten to a challenging place. I lost my job three months ago so our income has decreased somewhat. My husband hasn’t switched to cheaper ingredients or cooking fewer times per week. He will sometimes buy a large amount of ingredients only to use a few of them for the actual dish (since he can only buy some stuff in large quantities regardless of how much he actually needs). We are constantly drowning in leftovers. I get stressed trying to eat up everything before he cooks the next thing. We still have food waste, despite my efforts. 

I have tried to talk to him about this, plan out meals for the week, and encourage him to scale back on either the number of fancy meals cooked or the intensity of each meal (number of ingredients and amount of leftovers created). This hasn’t worked. He is still cooking in the exact same way. He says he doesn’t know how to spend less or buy fewer ingredients, since he’s not good enough at cooking yet to make adjustments to the recipes he uses. He also says he doesn’t want to cook fewer times per week because then he will get out of the habit and lose his skills. 

I finally put my foot down and told my husband that, for the good of our financial security and our household stress, I would really like him to cook only two fancy meals per week. He was upset and said I was being unsupportive and ungrateful. We haven’t come to a compromise yet.

952,t3_rtvp2b,AITA for not accepting responsibility when a young dog died of parvo?,"I know how the title sounds, but hear me out before showing me the tar and feathers.

For context, I work as a dog warden and the dog in question was one picked up as a stray. He wasn't chipped and didn't have any other forms of identification so was taken to kennels for holding.

Something to bear in mind which becomes important later is that a dog I'd picked up the week prior, (and was still sitting in the kennels) had been taken to the vet for having bloody poop. He was treated for giardia and after a round of antibiotics was absolutely fine. 

The pup in this story was picked up on a Sunday and was seemingly in good health. Energetic and happy when collected by the officer on call, (not myself) and fine in the kennels. At around 6.30pm Tuesday the kennels sent me a message saying they think he needs the vet as he'd started having bloody poop. Now I only work 9 - 5 weekdays so I didn't see the message. However, we have an on call service that runs until 9pm which they could have utilised if they thought it was an emergency.

The next day they contacted me again about the vet,  so I made a non emergency appointment for later that afternoon. At this point I didn't realise it was an emergency and had wrongly assumed it was giardia like the previous dog. Before my appointment they called me saying they'd had to rush him to the emergency vet as he'd become unresponsive. It was here that he tested positive for parvo virus. 

Once I realised the severity of his condition I jumped into action. I managed to secure funding for his treatment and transported him to a 24/7 vet who could better meet his needs. Despite a day and a half of treatment, his heart sadly gave out and we lost him. It was 11.30pm when I got the call that he'd passed, so I didn't think to contact the kennels as thought it would be unprofessional. Having said that, I did update our social media page to inform everyone of his passing. 

And really from there, shit just hits the fan. The kennels are blaming me saying that if I'd gotten him to a vets sooner he could have lived and that I wasn't taking animal welfare into account. I feel that's unfair since they initially contacted me at a time I wasn't working but did make an appointment the morning I was back. I don't work at the kennels so am not around the dogs much and feel they're just hitting out at me to blame someone.

It's such a shame because I really considered them friends as well as colleagues but now there's this black cloud hanging over the whole thing. They're making catty, unnecessary comments to myself and officers and really, the whole thing feels like a big powder keg. 

I hit back when they told me I'd pissed them off saying they had a duty as well and could have contacted the on call team but chose not to. In hindsight I should of stayed cool as I feel that stirred the pot more, but I'm not willing to take the blame for something I truly don't think is my fault. 

So, am I the asshole?",8.0
953,t3_rtvkp3,AITA for sending my 7 year old godson a good-bye/cry for help letter after his mother stopped speaking to me?,"My best friend (I'll refer to them as Michelle) during the beginning of the pandemic last year had a baby. He was born premature and it was touch and go for a long time. After a few months he was finally well enough to be taken home. During that time, she was dealing with a physically abusive partner addicted to alcohol that she had just kicked out of the house until they could pull themself together, leaving Michelle to take care of her baby and my 7 year old godson all alone. I of course could not visit due to her baby being immuno-compromised and because of COVID. During this especially difficult time, she made vague comments crying for help through private chat, and then would not respond to my messages. In the past this was due to her committing to a suicide attempt, so I became frantic: usually I could call her partner to check in on her but that was no longer possible. She wouldn't return my calls, and when she finally did (she had only stepped away to take care of the baby), I scolded her, telling her that she couldn't do that again or I'd have to do a wellness check on her (this had happened previously, where she made the same comments, her husband wouldn't wake up to answer the phone, and I had to call their super to check in). At this point Michelle blocked me and didn't respond to any messages at all.

At first I assumed the worst, but I could see that her messenger status was online. For days I couldn't get in touch with her, eventually weeks went by. During this time I became depressed, not knowing what was going on. I tried to come to terms with the idea that she was doing this on her own, but then I saw that she was commenting on her friends post. This sent me into an all time low, the idea that Michelle had just shut me out only and moved on, that I no longer had a godson. So in my time of crisis, I wrote my godson a good-bye letter, saying that no matter what happened I'd always be his godfather. At the time, I didn't know if it was just a cry for help letter, or a suicide letter. I just knew that it was vague enough that the only thing that would alarm him is that he most likely wouldn't see me again, and that if Michelle saw it, maybe she would finally reach out to me. This becomes important later, as she Michelle refers to it as a line that I crossed.

A month later I was doing better. After I sent the letter, my godson started appearing in the weekly zoom chat room that had been set up previously, meaning his mom had read it, but she still had not spoken to me and I still had not seen her. Michelle had let her partner back into her home after kicking their alcohol addiction. I felt like I was getting better, but then for unrelated reasons, I had a major depressive episode. It was so bad that when my friend eventually did reach out, completely unprompted I might add, she recognized the signs and took me to the ER to be admitted to the behavioral health hospital for suicidal ideation. Easily the darkest period of my life by far. I'll forever be grateful that she pushed me to admit myself voluntarily, it changed my life. I'm on medication now and I see a therapist once a week because of her. 

After I got out, the fighting began. Michelle told me that she felt like she was being forced to be my friend lest I kill myself. She refused to acknowledge this as punishing me for my condition. I argue with her about this, and it gets nowhere. For the next year and a half, I began walking on eggshells around her. When I'm having depressive episodes, I don't tell her about it, out of fear that I'm burdening her at a difficult point in her life (her baby is now having intermittent seizures). I began to have in-person contact with my godson again, which I take as a sign of her trusting me again. For the next year I'm doing everything I can to try and repair the friendship. I maintain regular weekly contact with my godson, taking him out on the weekends (which I do not do to please her, that is a relationship I intend to maintain no matter my relationship with Michelle). I give her space, and only engage in conversation when she initiates it; this is very infrequent, and chat conversations never last more than a few sentences (reminder, this was my best friend for over 4 years). I ask if I can come over, if I can play with the new baby now that he's doing better, and I always get no as an answer along with some excuse, but I don't push at all. I assume all of this time that it's because of concerns over COVID infection, and especially considering the baby, I really feel no desire to push her on this.

A month ago, she asks if I still want to be her friend despite treating me horribly all year. I assure her I do and my therapist and I rejoice as this validated my feelings and seems like a push in the right direction. Christmas Eve I get to watch a movie in her house with her family, although she scheduled it when her baby was taking a nap and I couldn't see him, I didn't mind. After a year of being patient and allowing her time to forgive me, things are finally turning around.

Then things take a turn for the worse. I tell her my new years resolution is to spend more time with my godson and her baby and that I only got to see the baby once last year (literally once for an hour), and that I hope I'll have more opportunities in the future. Then she says to me ""well the baby doesn't see people so that's an awkward resolution"". I ask why, she gives me no explanation, simply repeating that the baby doesn't see people, in a curt cold response. I ask her why she even admitted to me that she had been treating me horribly all year. She denies ever saying it, I screenshot the message she sent, which is when she says ""I wouldn't read too much into that. I was fairly intoxicated and had sent that same message to like 6 different people"". 

All hell breaks loose. I tell her all of the things above, that after a year and a half of walking on eggshells around her she finally validated my feelings and then turns around and completely breaks that hope. At which point she says the following (condensed for clarity):

""I haven't had intentions of getting back to being better friends with you. I felt you crossed a line and I didn't like it and had no desire to remedy that. I haven't been actively meant to you, despite what I might have said in a one off night. I've often commented that you have a hard time seeing things through other people's perspectives. I don't think that's changed and that's fine. I've set pretty fair boundaries with you, despite me not being comfortable with our situation. You complain about not seeing my children enough? I tried to set a boundary to not see them at all after you wrote my 7 year old a suicide letter, which I think about every time you take him out...why I even let you continue to take him out I have honestly have no idea.""

To argue that she was not using my depression as a weapon against me, she gives this example:

""For a real life example,  if someone is addicted to a drug and while in active addiction they steal from their family, take their jewelry and money from their purse one day when they came over. Then that person goes to rehab and gets better.  That person was the only one to do the rehab; the family didn't do rehab with them, they don't have the same perspective as that person once they finish rehab.  The family can help them through rehab and afterwards and everything.  They can see this person has definitely changed from who they were.  But once they come to their house, the family isn't just going to leave their jewelry out and around.  It isn't about weaponizing their previous addiction.  It isn't about being mean.  It's more of both parties went through something and have changed based on what they went through.  It's hard to comprehend.  It took me a while to understand both sides.  Putting away the jewelry when they come over isn't weaponizing or saying it's their fault they were in active addition, it's a logical protective response to their prior experiences.  It doesn't negate all the hard work that person has gone through to get better.  You think that family didn't go through anything? They say addiction is a family disease, not in the sense that multiple ppl in families become addicted to drugs, but because it effects each person.  And it effects them differently.  So if the person comes out of rehab and their family doesn't allow them to come to their home at first, that isn't saying you're bad because you're an addict and let me use that against you, it's a protective mechanism as they need to care about their wellbeing as well.""

At this point I'm speechless. On the one hand, I'm furious. This is not the first time I felt that she's weaponized my major depressive episode against me.  I just can't believe that someone who's gone through the same thing I have would ever talk to someone with depression like this. But on the other hand, I don't have any sense of if I'm in the right. I feel like I'm going crazy. I had sent my godson that letter as a good-bye, but was it a line I had crossed? Was involving him in my depression going too far, did I use him to get a message to her? Am I guilty of emotional manipulation and emotional abuse? Using my depression as an excuse to force her to be friends with me? She has often told me that I'm unable to see things from other people's perspective. But I honestly can't tell if that's true or not. Can I get some outside perspective on this? Am I the Asshole?",0.0
954,t3_rtvjn3,AITA for supporting my daughter not working for her dad?,"I married my husband 3 years ago. He has 3 kids (20, 17 &amp; 16) from a previous relationship, I have 2 from one as well (12 &amp; 16). My husband adopted my children. He owns a restaurant that does quite well. It's been in the family for generations. One rule he has with his kids is that they must work for the restaurant part-time once they turn 16. He's been working in the restaurant since he was 13 and feels it teaches responsibility. It's not something that I've agreed with. If they want to, sure, but he makes it as they have no choice. However, his ex supports this and I don't have much of a say when it comes to my step-kids. His eldest no longer works for him as they're in college, but his 17-year-old has for the past year, running takeout when we couldn't have dine-in and is now back to safely waiting tables.

My step-son and daughter turned 16 within two months of one another. My step-son started working for the restaurant a week after he turned 16. My husband had told my daughter that she'd have to as well and she said no. She babysits a few times a month and saves her money, but she likes controlling her schedule and getting to hang out with friends. My husband said it wouldn't be fair for her not to work when her siblings have to. I supported my daughter and said she should have a choice. My husband kept saying ""we'll see"". She turned 16 in November and the day after, her dad gave her a work shirt and told her when to come in for a shift. She said she had plans that day and would not be in, giving the shirt back. My husband told me to talk to her and I've refused.

At first my husband backed down but now my step-sons are complaining asking why they have to work when their sister doesn't. My husband has told me that my daughter should start working for the restaurant, at least once a week. I said no as she doesn't want to. He says I'm creating animosity between siblings. I pointed out I also won't force my 12 year old to work there when she turns 16.

955,t3_rtvj0v,AITA for not visiting my elderly friend for almost a year because life got in the way?,"I (25F) met “Sarah” (F, 75) who volunteered at my work a few years ago. She ended up leaving however I managed to keep in contact. I used to see her practically every day. When I didn’t have a car, my partner would drop me at her house every morning and I’d go to work later on in the day. She helped me through a lot and I’ve told her that many times. I’ve also helped her &amp;amp; been her support person as she doesn’t have family around. They live 10 hours away. 

I stopped seeing her because of multiple reasons: I had to work full time more often (covering my colleagues shifts), started University so I can actually work towards having a career, had multiple deaths in the family and pretty much struggled to fit in everything. I stopped seeing her for awhile because things were getting hectic. I tried seeing her every day but as the weeks went on I eventually had no time. I went a few months without going to her house. I messaged her a few times saying “Hi, hope you’re well and everything is okay”, those types of messages. I recently saw her as she had a birthday. I went over, gave her a present, said I was sorry I hadn’t seen her snd she explained that she was hurt I didn’t come over in a long time. I tried to explain to her why but I don’t think she really wanted to listen. 

The next time I went and saw her, which was a few days later, she seemed okay and was happy to talk to me but I still feel she resented me a little. I don’t know how to make this any better. I haven’t saw her since because my Aunty passed away mid November and I’ve been so focused on that. I feel like I’ve just neglected my friend. I put time and effort into it but it seems it wasn’t enough. 

I bought my friend a really nice birthday present and when I visited her for the second time, I noticed she hadn’t opened it. Even though she said she used it. This is making me feel sick. I also tried to wave her down one day in town to say hello. She was looking straight at me and ignored me. She hates my guts I can tell. I don’t know how to make this better.",2.0
956,t3_rtva13,"AITA I refuse to go to my grandma's funeral because of my mental health, my family hates me for it","Okay so little history on my family. I'm the youngest grandchild by 6 years (now 27) and therefor have always been the odd one out. My sister is 10 years older than me and has always been close with our family. My dad died when i was 10 and after he did my connection with my extended family (including my grandma was very limited). I went to my dad's funeral and it's a trauma i still struggle with to this day. I went to my grandpa's funeral a few years ago (because i felt like i had too) and had panic attacks for two weeks after it was over. 

My grandma died unexpectedly two days ago and i'm grieving, but i'm certain that i'm not going to another funeral because i know what will happen to me. The funeral is in the same church as where my dad and grandpa's services were and i know that will reinforce my trauma. I told my sister this after she sent me the invitation from the family and she got very angry with me. She called me disrespectful and ungrateful. I told her about the panic attacks i had after our grandpa's funeral and how i know it's going to happen again (which is a big deal for me because my sister and i are not close so telling her was a big hurdle for me). My sister is a social worker and i expected her to understand, but she didn't. 

I didn't know my grandma very well, but i know she cares about my well being and i don't think honoring her memory by going there and making it a traumatic experience is what she would have wanted. My sister didn't agree and told me going to her funeral is what is expected of me as her granddaughter. My older brother agrees with my sister, my mom is trying to keep the peace by not taking a side, but i feel like she is also judging me for not wanting to go. My sister keeps putting me on the spot asking very personal questions and asking how i would feel if my grand daugther wouldn't come to my funeral. I already had a panic attack after telling her about why i wouldn't go because even talking about my dad's funeral is a trigger for me, but she doesn't seem to care.

My trauma is about more than just the funeral. I never got the chance to truly process the grieve surrounding my fathers death and that's something i now as an adult am still struggling with. I am getting professional help with that, but it's a long road and i'm no where near ready to go back to the place where so much of it was caused.

Both my friend and I studied in Canada as international students and met in university, I am from Colombia and she is from Pakistan. In university I told her I will go to her wedding in Pakistan and we were both super excited and always talked about it. She got married about 1 year after graduation and her wedding was around Christmas and their weddings are like a week long and she wanted me to go for 2 weeks to explore the city. I am not religious but my family and I are big on Christmas, we get together every year no matter what and have a big celebration. I told her I can't make it because it's Christmas and I go home every year to spend it with them and I cannot ditch. She thought it was selfish of me to not skip this one year to be with her on such an important time in her life, because Christmas is an every year thing but her wedding is a once in a lifetime thing. Many of our mutual friends called me selfish too because I am not showing my support on such an important day for her. I sent her some gifts for her wedding (not sure if that helps).

959,t3_rtv255,AITA for not wanting my mom to bring her husband to my wedding?,"My mom's husband ""Eric"" came into the picture when I was 16 and my sister was 12. It was kind of awkward, and I wasn't thrilled about having some guy in the house. I'm going to be honest that he has never done anything to me, but I find his personality grating and I just really didn't like having to live with him.

It didn't help that he had a daughter who was 13 and her and my sister became like long lost twins, and it put pressure on me because I was the only one who didn't want to play instant family. Also my mom is pretty old school about marriage comes first and her husband is the most important person in the world and even said how lonely she was before she met him, which never sat right. To be honest I just don't like Eric. 

I am getting married to the love of my life ""Sarah"" and karma because my mom doesn't really like her. My mom isn't one of those crazy JustNoMILs and she doesn't do much, but when I asked her to be honest she told me she can't stand her and admitted she had probably been distancing herself. She doesn't have any concrete reasons, but I guess I don't have many for not liking Eric.

Sarah and I were talking about the wedding. It is going to be very small and we aren't doing plus ones. Everyone will have someone they know and we want it to be intimate. I mentioned that it sucks that my mom is married, so Eric isn't really a plus one. Sarah said that in her opinion it is our wedding and I shouldn't feel obligated to invite him and my needs and wants should come first for my wedding.

That really resonated and I brought it up to my mom. She immediately began attacking me about I'm disrespecting her marriage and she won't go without him. My sister is taking her side and my mom texted me after the fact that she suffered through Christmas dinner with Sarah and how dare I do this after she has forced herself to invite Sarah places. I didn't answer because that did hurt and give me something to think about.

Eric actually said that he thinks my mom should go. his feelings aren't hurt over some ""lame wedding"" and he gets I am her son. My mom told him no she isn't going and to drop it.

960,t3_rtv0v2,AITA for trying to make my Maid of Honour wear a dress to cover her arms against her wishes?,"I (29f) got engaged in late 2019. My fiancé (31m) and I had to wait out the pandemic for a number of reasons and as a result, we're getting married mid-2022. I'm adding this detail because my Maid of Honour, my sister (32f, we'll call her Anna) was asked to be a part of the wedding party almost 2 years ago, and has been privy to the wedding details for a while now. 

Anna is one of my best friends and I always knew she'd be in my bridal party. She's been a big help with the planning so far and made the process really enjoyable despite the Covid setbacks- until now. 

Recently, she's become an increasingly more active feminist, and has been doing some really great work to support women in her field. Nothing wrong with this per se, but it's caused her to do, say and push for some things which are making these last crucial months really stressful. Last week, Anna came to me with a suggestion for a dress change. I agreed because the alternative she presented is pretty and not too different from the style she decided on months ago (I chose a colour, length and fabric and the girls picked out dresses from a site which fit these criteria, and each one was able to choose a style which they were comfortable wearing). The main difference between the two is that the old dress was long sleeved and the new dress she wants is sleeveless. 

A few days ago, she posted on social about how she's rejecting unfair beauty standards for women and encouraging others to do the same. She even made tiktoks of herself grooming her pits in an outfit that was purposefully chosen to reveal her pit hair. When I saw them, I reached out and asked if she changed dresses specifically so her armpit hair would show, and she became incredibly defensive. I explained that I would prefer she choose a different dress if she doesn't want the old one, cause while I probably wouldn't even have noticed her pits in the strapless dress, I've definitely noticed now and I don't want my wedding to be about her pits. She was super offended, and the bridal party is divided, with a few people calling me a bridezilla for going back on my word to let them choose what they feel comfortable wearing, and for body-shaming my sister.

Please don't think that I'm trying to bash feminism. I identify as a feminist too, and I would never presume to tell another woman to shave even though it's my personal preference, but this genuinely feels like she's trying to use my wedding as an occasion to make herself the centre of attention.

About a year ago my mom met her current boyfriend and pretty soon after that we (my mom, teenage sister and I) moved into his house. (I 20F still live with my mom because I’m halfway through my bachelors). At some point after moving in I started doing him favors for his company. Some of these favors were sending emails in English, talking on the phone with clients, going to a convention to represent his company, physical labor, and archiving documents. I was honestly fine with doing these because they don’t take up much of my time, plus I live in his house rent-free so it’s whatever. The problems arise when my mom (who is now his secretary) and him go on vacation to DR. They always go on a trip every month but this time they’d be gone a bit longer, two weeks if I remember correctly.  My mom tells me I’ll have to take over the company while they’re gone and I remind her that it’ll be difficult for me as a full time student. She tells me that her boyfriend is willing to compensate me for my time, so as a poor college student I agree. They go on their trip and I juggle company business and schoolwork while they vacation. It’s not easy, but at least I’m getting paid, right? 
Wrong. 
It’s been 2months and I haven’t seen a dollar of what I worked for. Yeah COVIDs been tough on the company, but the companys not struggling. Over the course of the 2 months I gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued doing him favors. I thought maybe he planned to give it to me on Christmas. I found out today that he never intended on paying me, as he payed for my dog’s vet bill last month. 

Of course I’m grateful he covered the bill, but I wasn’t aware he was gonna be billing me for it, especially since it’s the family dog, not just mine. I’m annoyed because he’s been having me do all these things for him while my mom basically dangled the money in my face telling me he would eventually pay me when he never intended to. And in the meanwhile they’ve gone on 2 more vacations and are currently planning a 2 month long stay in Colombia. And of course they expect me to take over the company. 

At this point I don’t even care about the stupid $200, but I told them that I’ll no longer be doing them any favors, even while they’re gone. This means that he would either have to hire a secretary or they won’t be able to go on vacation. WIBTAif I didn’t let them go on vacation because I don’t wanna work for free?

I would have had no problem doing those favors for him if I hadn’t been promised a salary. But I truly feel taken advantage of and like my time and effort don’t matter to him at all. Plus I don’t remember agreeing to work for him when he begged my mom to move in with him because he could cover everything.",329.0
966,t3_rtuips,AITA for wanting wife to stay up until midnight on NYE?,"Hi Community,

My wife and I (29, 31) have two kids (3,1). Last night (NYE), they went to bed around 9pm after we had dinner, did some kids' fireworks and had some of her family with more kids their age over. When we put the kids to bed, my wife stayed in bed without saying anything, but just said she's tired. There was definitely not a fight or anything before this, and we all got to sleep in until 10am the morning before. 

This morning, she woke up, didn't say ""Happy New Year"", and when I asked her about it and told her I was sad to not spend the first minutes of the new year with her, and her not appreciating it, she just said ""there's nothing special at 12am"" and told me that I'm being ridiculous.

I got sad and mad at her, because she neither wanted to spend time with me nor thinks it deserves any thought that it's important for me. Am I the ass for trying to live up to some very basic traditions?",156.0
967,t3_rtuie1,AITA for being friends with someone my sibling hates?,"Okay, so ive been friends with this person for 5 years now. And in this five years my sibling has always hated them it seemed.   
Sibling claims Friend and someone else started randomly being rude and talked shit about them to their face. Friend claimed Sibling's ex was being emotionally abused by sibling so the group started to distant themselves from them. And while I love my sibling, they still purposefully misgender their ex and talk shit to everyone in the family and others that disagree with them. Friend isnt perfect either, but they at least grow and are trying to be a better person.

This all came at a head today after I left work after hanging out with Friend and other friends for new years eve. Sibling picked me up cause i dont drive and was automatically super aggressive (slamming car doors, yelling at me for walking in the rain and not seeing their text cause i was working). after a few minutes of tense silence they ask why i was still friends with Friend. I explained why and Sibling just calls them a complete liar, but does expand on it. Sibling then purposefully spends up and makes sharp turns in the rain, seemingly more mad at me???

Im not asking them to get along, i just want my sibling to not guilt me and get family to guilt me each time i see my friends. Friend moved out of state and i only saw them this once this past year. Am I in the wrong for being friends with them?",0.0
968,t3_rtuh2k,AITA for 'excluding' someone from a school play?,"So we have myself (17F), Maddison (18F), and J (17F). Some background on me nd J:

In year 11, J and Maddison were in the school play with me. Maddison and J were cast in the same main role. At the time (2020), J was a transfer student, and loved musicals.

Throughout rehearsals she would often bring up the idea of doing a musical next year, like AVPM or TTO. Her other suggestions were: most standard tumblr meme musicals (think BMC, DEH, the like), Heathers, and a fucking monty python musical. Unfortunately our theatre teacher (who had a soft spot for J bc they're from the same country), overheard and suggested that us three (me, Maddison, and J) direct the school production next year for our CAS project (ib tingz).

Here’s the thong tho - J is not good at theatre. Throughout rehearsals Maddison is experienced + good at acting. But J is rlly low-energy. Maddison insisted J was good, just tired (J mentioned she had some chronic fatigue issues but I think she's exaggerating) tho honestly she just seemed bad at acting. Now normally I would have just told her in person that I did not want to do the play with her next year because of these reasons but J is a massive crybaby.

She makes a big deal about being 'excluded'. Like sometimes in class, I'd make plans with my friends w/o really acknowledging her, which pissed her off bc she thought it was rude (I don't see why). So basically, she was still not picking up on my clues that I didn't want to be around her much, and even sent me a SPREADSHEET with her ideas for musicals so I tried to shut her up by telling her I'd found a full script for AVPM online and we could do that. Instead, Maddison and I spent summer break writing the script for next year's play. When we got back, in year 12, J was pissed about feeling left out and didn't audition for the play, tho she had another of her tantrums on the day of the play.

Now, in year 13, a few days before winter break, I'd been called in by the school counsellor asking me about the situation. Basically, J had accused me of disrupting lit class multiple times by going on discord calls, or just talking loudly while she was trying to work (I did do those things but not regularly, nd she could easily ignore it). Our counsellor (bless her) thought there was smth underlying so she probed and J basically said I had 'excluded' her from the school play and 'squandered' her last chance to perform (our school bans year 13s from performing bc of exams). I explained to the counsellor that J chose not to audition for the play so it wasn't my fault, but the counsellor said I might've been in the wrong without knowing it.

tldr; A girl at my school wanted to help direct a musical but she wasn't good at theatre, so I worked on a play over summer without her knowledge, and she got so pissed she decided not to audition. Now she's accusing me of disrupting class bc she's still mad over the play.",0.0
969,t3_rtugjy,AITA- For taking back a gift I got my MIL because she wanted to know how I could afford it,"So I was very fortunate to get a lot of money when my grandparents passed, my gf of a year and a half knows this but I haven't told her how much is was because I don't like to talk about it and when I was young my mother always said ' never talk about money ever'

Anyways Christmas came and I got gifts for everyone I spent quite a bit. I don't really get along with her so I just got some expensive bag.

I gave it to her and she took it and didn't even say thank you or anything. She saw the bag and laughed why did you get me a fake. I said it's not fake. Then all the questions came. 
 
How did you afford this? I said it doesn't matter just say thank you and leave it. She kept going on and on. Saying how can someone that works in a bar afford this.

Everyone else were very surprised when I gave them gifts and some said omg I can't take this. Her lil bro cried cuz I got him a ps5 I love that lil dude.

Anyways it came to a head when I just snapped I said enough if your going to wreck my head of how I could afford it and not even show any gratitude I'm taking it back. She looked shocked. I just took the box from the sofa and locked it in my car. It was quite awkward after that so I left shortly.

My gf said that I understand but would like for me to apologize to her mother for snapping at her but she agrees she doesn't deserve the present.

But my wife's little sister thought it would be OK when she was staying over one day to invite a ""friend"" she asked we said OK. Friend(17) comes over and it was very obvious from the first second we met what this was.
Ok sure, got to know her. To me it was blatant she was way too mature for my wife's sister as she held conversations with me. Fast forward couple hours my wife's big sister at the 🚪  knock knock. Little sister panics the girlfriend little confused I'm laughing. She asks her girlfriend to go to my upstairs spare and hide in the closet( the fucking irony) the girlfriend said OK until her big sister leaves. 
20 minutes later big sister leaves. Hour after that girlfriend leaves. I told my SIL and wife to pack her things because she's going home.
Took her home, wife asked me why I did that, I told her I'm not dealing with manipulation attempts nor am I hiding a relationship. If you're going to be ""mature"" enough to have one you need to be mature enough to not hide it and that it broke my heart for her friend to have to literally hide because her little sister is scared her mom would find out.
My wife says I'm an asshole because it's always something with her family yea it may be,  but they always go against my morals.

 Her mom is a fake Christian that follows and resites SOME parts of the Bible but won't believe the rest so I've had her leave my house too. I'm not religious but if you're gonna read scripture to me and I know some back that you don't follow fuck off.m",41.0
971,t3_rtueci,AITA for not changing my baby's name to appease my brother's girlfriend?,"I am 30 weeks pregnant. A litte over 2 months ago, we found out the sex of the baby (boy) and it took my husband and I a bit to agree on a name. Finally, we landed on one both of us liked. It's not insanely common but we know there will be other people with the name in the world.

Around the holidays, we met up with my family, including my brother's girlfriend. This is probably only my 3rd time being around her, they've been dating 6 months. I don't know her very well outside she was married previously and sadly, both her husband and son passed away in an accident. She's a very nice woman but even my brother has admitted (privately) that he's not sure how long their relationship will last as they want two different things in life. He thinks they may be able to work it out but isn't sure yet.

Anyway, my mom was asking if we had picked a name for the baby and I told everyone what it was. Looking back, my brother's girlfriend seemed weirded out but I didn't think much of it. Later on, she messaged me on Facebook saying the name I picked was her late son's name. She said it'd be hard to be around a baby that is called that. 

Now, if she were going to for sure be a part of our family forever, I'd agree. But since my brother admits he isn't even sure if they'll make it, I don't think I should change a name I really love. I didn't tell her that part, but did say that it was a name my husband and I really liked, so we wouldn't be changing it.

She isn't happy with me. My brother says that they could work out their problems and I should be considerate. I asked what would've happened if they met a year later and I already had a son with this name? She'd have to adjust, right? My brother says that's different.

She threatens to kick him out of the house (it's 2 am at this point) and he goes to where he would sleep.

973,t3_rtu96u,AITA for getting mad at my chronically ill friend for not helping me when I got sick?,"TLDR at bottom. 

Okay, so I have a friend who is also my coworker that struggles with chronic pain, and is always very vocal about her pain and recently has been very obsessed with setting boundaries and making sure people recognize her ‘invisible’ work. She’s been through a lot in the last few years, she lost her mother and then lost her brothers mother as well, in addition to many many surgeries. 

I feel really bad and always try to be there for her and check in on how she’s doing. I’ve given her money over the years and bought her a laptop even when hers broke and she didn’t have enough money. Shes never done that for me, or honestly really done much for me when I needed it. She’s also struggled with a terrible landlord. 

I get it that her life has been really hard, and I don’t want to not be a supportive friend - but it feels like all the support is one directional. She rarely calls me to check in on me, let alone actually try to do things for me when I need help. It was months of us not talking, and even when we do talk she comes off passive aggressive. 

Skip to recently when I got sick (I am vaccinated but immunocompromised.) She checks in on me to see how I’m doing and I started telling her how anxious I am that I won’t be able to complete the work that I needed to do for an event we had coming up (we work for a nonprofit helping families, not an option to cancel)

She texted me and said, “you can still text people from bed.” I asked her if she’d be able to reach out to a few people for me and she went off about her pain being too much and how she can’t do anything for me. I’ve actually only asked her for help once outside of this. 

Meanwhile, I’ve seen her bend over backwards for other friends while still struggling with the same pain. The way she worded it to me was like a text you send your boss when you refuse to come into work when you’re sick. 

I was so hurt because I’m scared of how sick I’ve gotten and I am anxious about this event which still needed to happen - and the way she refused to help me and told me that I can still work was just too much. Like she couldn’t even be bothered to say that it’s okay the work will just have to suffer and it’s not your fault or offer another coworker who could help. 

We got into a huge texting fight because I said she was being selfish by not helping me one of the few times I’m sick after everything I’ve done for her and that she has just been a bad friend. Am I the asshole for being angry and lashing out? I am worried that I am just projecting out my own guilt about not being able to complete my work. 

TLDR: I asked for help from my friend / coworker with chronic pain when I got very ill. She told me that I can still work from bed and refused to help me because she is in pain (which is constant for her.) This is after years of helping her and never asking for help in return. 

Am I the asshole for being mad that she couldn’t have been more supportive, even if she couldn’t actually help, to just say it’s okay please get better?",0.0
974,t3_rtu4mt,AITA for not trying to make my mom feel better when she seems angry?,"I'm in a family where love for my mom is about anticipating needs. She doesn't communicate when she is angry. Part of what makes her angry is that we don't intuitively know what we did to upset her. Or that we always forget to do things she asked us to do. So there's a lot of her saying she's fine or nothing is wrong while she is very obviously upset. 

The trouble is that sometimes me and my brother definitely do forget to do stuff around the house or are accidentally inconsiderate. But it's never on purpose. I think she takes it as us not caring about her. But we can't have a conversation about it because she doesn't communicate. And she will spend all day stewing about what made her angry. 

As a result, I think I'm hyper sensitive to when she becomes upset. For a while, my response was to launch into interrogative questions forcing her to communicate. Or desperately try different things to see what makes her less angry. Now, I don't try. I don't blame her for being angry at whatever it is she's angry at or being unable to communicate about it, but it's not my job to figure out what it is on my own. Nor should I be pushing her buttons like that. Basically, AITA for no longer actively trying to soothe my mom? 

Her being visibly irritated triggers me really hard and I become like a child trying to figure out what I did. Sometimes I realize it's not even about me but I always assume I did something. That being said, if it is something I did, then I probably was the ""asshole""... so I don't want me not trying to fix it or address it to be misconstrued as not caring. But I don't want to fish for it every time. I don't think I should have to do that. Is that wrong? Please be honest on what you think, esp if you're from a family system that's bad at communicating (should be most people hahahaha)",0.0
975,t3_rtu3xl,AITA for suddenly dropping a 10 year poly relationship on my family?,"Some background: My Dad and Stepmom were married for 20 years before she passed. While I was extremely close to my mother, I was also very close to her. Like a year after they married she took us to her family reunion. Eight sisters, 1 brother, various nieces and nephews, and we were immediately sucked in and treated like family. They would've done anything for us, and us for them. After my Stepmom passed they doubled down. They are my family and I love them more than words.  


I've been in a poly triad relationship for 7 years come March. The subject has been broached about us doing something if we hit 10 years. Some sort of nice celebration with friends and family. My Dad, his girlfriend, my brother and one aunt on my dad's side have known for a couple years. My sister has known from the beginning. A few of my aunts are more conservative so I was legit scared for the first couple years, so I didn't tell my stepmoms family. Over time I've realized that they would accept me no matter what.  They may have their own opinions but they would never say a bad thing and they might even expect me to drag along my significant others. As one of my partners recently came out as trans there might be a tiny bit more resistance (shock, speaking carefully, some blinking, maybe a few uncomfortable questions they don't know know are inappropriate), but even then I know the love would be unconditional.   


If we do a celebration, I would want my family to be there. The problem is I've outright lied to them. They've asked if I had anyone special in my life and I mentioned I have close friends and that's it. At first it was the fear, and after that, I just didn't want to deal with all the questions and explanations and work that would go into it. It would take massive amounts of energy to deal with that much family with something that big and it's always seemed overwhelming.  


I think inviting them to the celebration and explaining it then, as a ten year long stable relationship is a good way to come out into the open. But I've been told just shocking them with this huge secret I've been keeping for so long is kind of an asshole move, especially with how close we are.

I (26f) had plans with my bf J (27 m) of 6 months to spend New year's eve at his friend's home. It was a small party of about 10 people. I made spinach dip and a homemade ice cream cake for the party.  I made a breadbowl for the dip from scratch. Same with the ice cream qnd cake.for the ice cream cake. I did all of this over a few days. 
About 30 minutes before my bf was supposed to pick me up he calls me and says he ""just doesn't feel like going out tonight"". I was annoyed but tried to be understanding. I asked if he wasn't feeling well or if it was just the crowd. He said is wasn't either he just wasn't up for it. Ok. I'm noting going to beg anyone to spend time with me so I just let it go and hope he feels better and we can talk later in the night or the next day. He asked if I would meet up with my friends instead. I said they were going to bars and I wasn't comfortable in that kind of crowd right now and I'd probably watchthe twilight zone marathon and go to sleep.

977,t3_rtu0wt,WIBTA If I Asked My Upstairs Neighbor To Be Quieter,"I live in an apartment complex built in 1978 meaning it is older building materials, not well insulated, soundproofed etc. I have lived her for apprx 8 years and have had 3 upstairs neighbors above me. I have been lucky that all 3 prior neighbors have been pretty quiet and we got along great.  I should mention that I also have some fairly severe anxiety/CPTSD.

I have a new neighbor named ""Gary"" who moved in about 3 months ago.  I have met Gary and spoken cordially with him a few times. He seems very nice and has a small dog &amp; cat. Gary also has a girlfriend ""Greta"" who seems to be staying there more and more.  

Now to the ""noise"" issue.  Gary (and Greta I guess) seem to drop stuff or kick off their shoes and move stuff/furniture around quite a bit every day.  It sounds like bombs going off below and scares me and my cat a lot.  Yesterday Greta came home and almost immediately it sounded like she fell over something- there was a huge thud and things went dropping/rolling across the floor.  I seriously thought about going to see if she was okay because it was so loud. 

Also, and this is my main issue, Greta has a very shrill voice and, especially, laugh.  

I am a poor sleeper due to my PTSD/anxiety. Gary and Greta seem to stay up most of the night, talking, laughing, and doing other normal things. 

None of  my business normally, but Greta's shrill laughter wakes me up at least 2x per night. I have taken to wearing earplugs most of the time at night, but sometimes she laughs so loud and shrill that it still wakes me up. Sleeping with earplugs in triggers my PTSD and also prevents me from wearing a sleep mask which I often need because of PTSD.  It's hard for me to wear both at the same time.

I am having some pretty bad anxiety regarding this situation although I know that sounds silly.  My sleep is already an issue and having this added to it is kind of wrecking me.  

I feel like I'm being a jerk about some probably normal things.  It's just that none of my other neighbors ever made noise like this to this extent. And I know I'm not always a super quiet person either because I do laugh loudly and have a strong voice plus a bad cat who needs to be yelled at frequently. 

I don't want to be unreasonable and also don't want to ""shame"" this girl for her voice/laugh.  And I don't even know how to address the ""can you stop dropping things"" or if I should because that's mostly during the day. And it may be the animals, which isn't really something to complain about.

Would I be the asshole if I spoke with Gary and asked him to try not to drop things, move things, throw things, etc.?  And, most importantly, to also speak with Greta and ask her to try not to laugh so loudly after 11:00pm?

Would I be LESS of an asshole if I didn't single out Greta and her voice and just tell Gary that I can hear them frequently during the night and it's disruptive to my sleep?",8.0
978,t3_rttzoc,AITA for yelling at a grocery clerk for mistaking my identity?,"Hey, All. This incident happened last night before NYE. For context, I'm almost a year sober from drinking. Also, I'd describe my appearance as Generic Looking White Man #4,960,488.

Me (29M) and my partner (32M) went to the grocery store to grab some supplies for NYE, we decided to celebrate at home alone because cases spiking where we're at again. We decided to buy some Martinelli's sparking juice (for me) and one of those mini Prosecco bottles (for my partner) along with some snacks. We went to a check-out stand and I started to pull out my ID when the cashier (30s?) said, ""Oh, no need to show me your ID I remember you."" Of course I was confused, but I brushed it off. I chalked it up to ""I guess I'm starting to look old and they don't need to card me anymore"" (even though I always wear a mask).

Before we could finish the transaction, my partner asked the clerk how they knew I was over 21. The clerk then said it was because I had bought alcohol the week before, WHICH I HADN'T. I immediately jumped on that statement because it wasn't true, but it was too late and my partner started to accuse me of relapsing. I tried to calm him down but then the clerk INSISTED that I had come in the week before. My partner stormed off and that's when I exploded. I yelled at the clerk along the lines of: ""Why would you say that?!"", ""What is your problem?!"", etc. I even went so far as to pull my mask down to show my entire face to prove to them that they were wrong. The clerk asked me to leave, so I did.

Now, my partner isn't talking to me and thinks I've been lying this entire time. I keep trying to tell them that it wasn't me that the clerk was talking about, but he isn't having it. I understand that it could have been a huge misunderstanding on the clerk's part, but how they INSISTED that it was me when they saw how upset my partner felt so unwarranted. There is also no way that this clerk would know I was over 21 from when I was buying alcohol almost a year ago because we only moved to this area about six months ago and haven't bought alcohol from them in the past.

979,t3_rttu1v,AITA for saying I won't hang out with my husband's best friend anymore after they ditched us on NYE?,"Old throwaway account for something unrelated. 

My husband and I (27M,F) went out with a group of friends last night for NYE. We all had concert tickets so the plan was to get dinner and then hit a bar before heading to the show. We coordinated the whole thing. The group was us, my husband's childhood best friend ""Mark"" and his girlfriend, and another couple that are my husband's friends (all around same age). 

I've never liked my husbands best friend. I think he's kind of an AH and doesn't treat my husband well at all. My husband gives him infinite free passes because he is autistic and they both got bullied some as kids. I have several other friends that are on the spectrum and none of them treat us poorly so I've never bought that reasoning. 

We all planned to meet at a restaurant at a certain time and the day of Mark called us and asked if we want to go to a different restaurant an hour and a half earlier. That didn't work in our schedule so Mark says fine we'll keep the original reservation. Once we arrive we called them to see if they were close and we find out that Mark, gf, and other couple all went to the other restaurant without us. 

I was upset but didn't want to ruin the night so we just ate by ourselves and then met them at a bar. My husband asked Mark why they did that and Mark said he meant to text but forgot. Later in the evening we needed to walk to our car before the show, so we all agreed to meet at the venue soon. My husband and I got to the show and listened to the first opener before texting Mark to see where everyone is was, and we got no response. Second opener finished up and we checked instagram to see that they had gone bar hoping. They never showed up or sent a text. 

This morning I talked to my husband about how rude it was that they ditched us twice and he said it was fine and Mark was just being Mark (meaning the autism). I'm tired of that excuse so I said even if that was the case there were three other neurotypical people in the group who could have let us know. I told my husband he can keep hanging out with Mark and that group if he wants but I won't be anymore and I frankly don't think my husband should either since Mark treats him so poorly for a supposed best friend. My husband got really upset and said I was being too harsh and Mark can't help it. So Reddit, AITA for putting my foot down about my husband's best friend?",1589.0
980,t3_rttsg1,AITA for not wanting to be best friends anymore for snitching at work?,"For context, 
I work at a job my ex best friend got me. We see each other almost everyday and have some of the same friends, so I think that’s important to note. About a month ago I started a new medication and had to go into my shift that day, but towards the end of the shift as i’m closing out I start feeling a headache and pretty nauseous so I offered one of my coworkers money to finish up about 5 minutes of my work, considering I had been released early because it was pretty slow that day and I had been doing closing work for awhile, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal- I wasn’t feeling good. 
I leave work and I get a text from my coworker saying that my best friend got really mad and told everyone she was going to snitch on me to try to get me in trouble considering I have to go through them in order to leave. I had of course apologized and it was the first time I had ever left early without finishing up, but with the given circumstances I thought it was ok since I was already leaving early and did the majority of my duties. 
But the fact that my so called best friend was trying to get me in trouble makes me think they secretly don’t like me. I told them I just needed space because I go through phases where I like to be alone and avoid friend drama, and they took it as I don’t want to be friends anymore. Fast forward to now and we don’t talk anymore, they talk bad about me to mutual friends, and has even sent a subliminal mean text to me with no context. I didn’t think it would go this far over something so small considering we had been friends for years prior.  She also said that I’m playing the victim for being mad that she snitched.

981,t3_rttpdb,AITA for welding outside when my neighbor was trying to fix the fence?,"Two years ago, my neighbor across the street bought the house next door to me to rent out on AirBnb. 

Since then, it has been a right pain in my ass.

I've had strangers knock on my door to borrow things at all hours, block my driveway, have angry dogs bark and snarl at me when I try to use my own yard,  have late night yelling matches, wander around in my backyard and stare in my windows and even cut my roses!

I try to be a nice neighbor, so I've let them know multiple times if they gave me a heads up I would be more than happy to not weld when they have guests there. I've also politely let them know when guests have asked for certain things repeatedly and even bought some for them. I've told them about the trespassing and politely asked them to let the people know the property ends at the fence. 
They never even said sorry, and we still have people trying to wander around my yard.

The fence separating our yards is on their property, but is right on the boundary. Yesterday when I went outside to weld, there was a bunch of strange men in my backyard. They had saw horses and equipment set up all over my backyard. 

I asked my boyfriend if they had asked for permission to use our yard, when he said no I kinda snapped.

I decided since they couldn't do the bare minimum of politeness and ask our permission, I was not going to do the polite thing and wait to weld. 

Welding arc flashes are so bright you need special protective eyewear to be around them. Grinding metal also shoots sparks across my yard. Since they set up all their equipment in my backyard, the work crew had to wait around on the other side of the fence getting paid to nothing until I took my breaks (15 minute break after every hour of welding). I had little warnings go off before I started welding so they knew to leave.

Had my neighbor simply asked for my permission at any time, I would have stopped. But he just stood there glaring at me. 

My sister and boyfriend say I took it too far since they were just trying to fix the fences slight lean, but I'm just done with the disrespect for our property  and them thinking it's ok for strangers to just waltz on in our yard.",1455.0
982,t3_rtto7f,"AITA for my reaction to hearing my neighbors son was looking in my windows, from his parents?","I live alone in a house next to a family. A few weeks ago, my neighbors, a married couple, came to me and said they could see in my windows. 

I was a little confused why she'd say something like that.

Since I got pretty obsessed with houseplants during the pandemic, I like let in the natural light. So.. duh. 

My neighbor told me that their preteen son could see me in the window. I went ""okay?"" 

(Edit, the kid is about 14, he's in high school. So a teen rather than preteen. Maybe the mom misspoke, or maybe I misheard, or maybe there's a chance he skipped several grades ahead, but I thought I should clarify.) 

The father said that the boy was at that sort of age where he was becoming interested in looking at women.

I said ""Are you saying you've caught your son looking?""

His mom said yes, and I said ""Well, y'all oughtta correct that behavior fast. He better be learning damn well that that can't be tolerated.""

His mom said that they were ""gentle"" parents, 

I replied ""This is one thing you better not be 'gentle' about, if you don't correct that behavior hard and fast you're gonna be having a real problem on your hands.""

His dad told me not to threaten his family, 

I told him ""You're misunderstanding me, I'm saying your boy is a problem, not me. And you need to address that within your own home, it's inappropriate you're brought this to me."" 

The dad looked like he was about to have a temper with me, he started to say not to tell them how to parent, and his wife pulled him away home.

Yesterday, I had four female friends over last night for a NYE fire. It was socially distanced outside. 

We were having some drinks and one of my friends was gonna go use the bathroom. I remembered I oughta warn her and as she was entering the house I yelled ""Yo, there's a peeping tom over there, shut the bathroom curtains before you piss!"" I also pointed at the house. 

My friend who was going to pee was kinda drunk and yelled back ""OKAY, BUT ALSO WHAT THE FUCK? YOU GOTTA TELL ME HOW YOU CAUGHT THEM PERVING"" 

My other friends had questions and I retold the story of how the neighbors came around and told me about their creepy son, and how they got a temper when I said that behavior needed corrected. My friends thought that was super fucked up.

Since we were all sat 6 feet apart, and all drunk, and all trying to talk over each other, we became pretty loud. 

Some of my friends were saying stuff like ""What kinda fucked up parent won't punish that?"" And ""The parents are fucking creeps too if they don't see a problem"" 

Then we saw the neighbor family's dad come out and approach our group, and one of my friends who's kinda a firebrand called out ""You're being filmed, if you step foot over here you're trespassing"" and held up her phone. 

The guy went back to his house and we heard some arguments inside.

I feel like it was super inappropriate for that family to have brought this to me in the first place, but I also feel a little bad that my friends and I said all that in earshot of that family and maybe other neighbors.

AITA for how I handled the creppy neighbor situation?

Edit to address some common (and honestly creepy) questions

I am not a nudist, I wear clothes at home. And I get dressed in a walk in closet without windows. 

I do not use the toilet in front of an open window, I draw the curtains first

I'm not sure why so many people assumed I was a nudist without me ever saying anything along those lines, but I'm not.

I think that my casual clothes (gym shorts, tank tops or t-shirts) are things the family finds inappropriate regardless because they are very conservative Christians and the women and girls in the family have to be covered neck to knee and don't wear short sleeves or close fitted clothes. 

So while I find my outfits appropriate to hang around in, or even go to run errands or go to the gym in, I suspect they might see them as immodest by their values.",5505.0
983,t3_rttht5,AITA Am I the asshole for getting annoyed my sister in law invited herself on a venue tour for our wedding?,"So my husband (yes Covid wedding) and I never get to see his parents and we’ve been trying to involve them as much as possible because my husband moved across the world to live with me. We plan on having a wedding in his birth country. Since we’ve been here for Christmas, there have been some weird passive aggressive comments made to me by my now SIL - (my husbands brother’s wife) - “you got legally married first but WE got engaged first.” 
Like weird stuff. Stuff you’d think you’d hear in middle school. And so on.
Anyway, I haven’t responded to these any other way besides laughing it off. I just want to get along. We never see my husbands family anyway because we live across the world. But it seems clear to me that she doesn’t want to be best friends. 
So I was very surprised when I found out she told my MIL that she wants to tour the venue for our wedding. This was all completely unknown to myself or my husband. We thought this was going to be an opportunity to spend quality time with his parents and also talk about some more sensitive topics (ie budget and costs) which I wouldn’t be comfortable discussing in front of my SIL. Shes driving an hour and a half to come see the venue. She’s currently in the process of planning her own wedding as well. So I’m not sure if the motive is pure based on the previous comments. 
Anyway, I told my husband I was a little nervous about my SIL coming. I don’t really understand why she is coming. I guess I’m worried she’d judge how much we’d spend on our wedding or try and ruin this happy moment for us in some way. My husband actually got quite upset and said that I shouldn’t bring any negative emotions into this wedding as it’s supposed to be a happy event and that I should just be happy even though he agrees it’s a bit odd she’s coming. 

I really don’t know if I’m being over sensitive and I’m really starting to think about this a lot. Am I the asshole for being upset she invited herself to our wedding tour with the in laws I never see? Or is this naturally something she should be involved in and I should have invited her in the first place? Please advise! I’m losing my mind here trying to do the right thing.",23.0
