Why does his family have the same outfits in their Instagram posts for Christmas and New Years?! We can only SPECULATE!!!” 
We all know they love to speculate terribly, but this is misinformation. Where is big tech to protect the masses from this conspiracy theory? 

It’s never been more obvious that the left is hurting if THIS is their talking point. DeSantis is a man who values family, loves his wife, loves his children, and loves his country. His wife having cancer is not off limits to these people who supposedly value mental health, preach for employers to provide more mental health days, and are constantly preaching about the equality of women. This MAN is taking time to support his WOMAN who is certainly at risk for their favorite virus.

724,t3_rsvzmq,"How unions create monopolies, prevent competition, raise prices, and fuck up the market (at least in the trucking industry)","  So I recently became a truck driver and in the trucking community there's always talk about how much the pay has gone down and they always blame the deregulation of the 1980s. So I had always heard how terrible the deregulation was for truck drivers but I didn't know the specifics so I looked it up. It turns out deregulation was bad for unions but great for small companies and independent truck drivers. 

  **Regulations**

   The federal government began regulating prices and competition in interstate transportation when Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to oversee the railroad industry in 1887. The ICC began regulating interstate trucking after Congress passed the Motor Carrier Act (MCA) of 1935. Advocates for this legislation were the ICC (Commissioners and staff), state regulators and the railroads, which wanted trucking to be more regulated, because as the Great Depression deepened they had been losing more and more business to the trucking industry.



  **Regulation Became Strangulation**

   The MCA required new trucking companies to seek a “certificate of public convenience and necessity” from the ICC. The ICC was extraordinarily restrictive in interpreting “proof of service.” New trucking companies found it extremely difficult to get certificates. This led to an artificial restriction on the number of trucking companies. And that's why truckers earned so much, the unions (who favored this regulations) artificially restricted the number of trucking companies and truck drivers allowed in the market. That's not a free market, that's not fair competition.

  From 1940 to 1980, new or expanded authority to transport goods via truck was almost impossible to secure unless an application was completely unopposed. Competition was so restricted that even if no existing carriers were offering the proposed service, the ICC would rule that any already certified trucking company that expressed a desire to carry the goods should be allowed to do so. New carriers (or smaller carriers trying to expand) were stifled by ICC fiat.

  And this system was in place for more than 40 years! Very few new carriers came into being from 1940 to 1980 due to the ICC’s regulatory restrictions, which almost killed competition in interstate trucking.

  **Deregulation**


  President Carter signed the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, which severely limited the ICC’s authority over the industry. the Teamsters Union and the American Trucking Associations (ATA) had vehemently opposed deregulation of the trucking industry and helped defeat attempts to eliminate all economic controls.  The most dramatic change brought on by deregulation was the virtual explosion in the number of trucking firms. From 1980 to 1990, the number of licensed carriers doubled – from fewer than 20,000 to more than 40,000!   By 2017, it was estimated that there were over 500,000 trucking companies in the United States. About 80 percent of these trucking companies are regarded as small businesses, with six trucks or less. So while the industry is still regulated, the opportunities to enter the market have broadened dramatically. So yes union truckers are earning less than they used to because they no longer have a monopoly, the market is now fairer for small companies and independent truckers like myself",215.0
