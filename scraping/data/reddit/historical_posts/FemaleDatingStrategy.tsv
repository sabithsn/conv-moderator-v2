0,t3_rw1ic5,Anyone else feel the same way sometimes?,"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to publish this post, so Mods, feel free to remove it. I just want to know if anyone else feels the same way and has any advice.

Since 2020, I‚Äôve been on a serious level up journey. I‚Äôve cut out LV people from my life and my career is blossoming. I‚Äôve learned to set and stick to boundaries, and I‚Äôm feeling more accomplished, self-assured, and dare I say, sexier, than I‚Äôve ever felt.

I‚Äôve been able to achieve this in part because I became ruthless with dating, and the time I spent on things that don‚Äôt serve my goals. A whole confidence is competence mood.

However, sometimes I tire of my dry spell. I know there are ways to fix that ‚Äî but I miss romantic and physical affection. Looking into each other‚Äôs eyes. Holding hands. Soft kisses. Mutual respect and understanding. Things the most powerful tools can‚Äôt provide.

There isn‚Äôt anyone I want to date right now, and I‚Äôm happy to take my time. Most days this doesn‚Äôt bother me, but at times (like now), I wish I had a partner who gets me. Not in a please-complete-me way, but we get each other and share the load and take care of each other. I have really wonderful friends and family, but it‚Äôs a different sort of love. 

I don‚Äôt really know what sort of advice I‚Äôm looking for. I know it‚Äôs a big dangerous, world out there, I would 1000% prefer to get comfortable with this specific pang, than be in a bad relationship or lower my standards. But also‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt a girl have her cake and eat it? I guess the point I‚Äôm trying to reach in my own head is that I can have good romantic relationships, and there is someone out there who will be wonderful and right for me. What‚Äôs meant for me will not pass me by. In the meantime, my focus irregardless is to be the best person I can be, for myself and the time I have on this earth. And it‚Äôs ok to occasionally feel alone in your own level up journeys. We‚Äôre all human.

Thanks for listening to my stream of consciousness. I hope you have a good week and you find joy and pleasure on your own experiences :)",2.0

3,t3_rvztx6,Is this turning into a texting situationship?,"Good afternoon, Queens! Looking for FDS approved strategy on my current situation. 

The back story: About two months ago I ended my long term relationship due to us having different visions of the future. This sub helped a lot in recognizing my worth, my dreams, and my disinterest in settling for less. I am doing a lot better but currently still in the process of healing and leveling up. I am contemplating what is next for me and planning a solo trip this spring to clear my head a bit.

A few weeks after the breakup, which was right before the holidays, I wanted some harmless attention and flirtation so I joined bumble and matched with a couple men, then snoozed my profile, because at that point I wasn't super interested in being active on there. Needless to say, one of the two men I matched with ended up being being cool! We get along, we have common interests, he makes great money and owns a home, has hobbies and friends, and is attractive and smart! Still vetting of course. 

Which brings me here today. In the course of a month, I've seen this man 2x - dinner date and a concert. He knows I'm recently out of a relationship and we are on the same page about taking it slow. HOWEVER, it is turning into a ""every day texting all day"" situation. And I'm not into it! At first, as mentioned, I wanted to assuage my loneliness with some chatting, and it has been nice having someone to text with. But at this point, I am ready to move on or step it up with him.  This man would text all day if I let him. He has called a few times. He has initiated us getting together again but it was same day so I said no and that I'd prefer advanced notice, which he was receptive about.

But I am thinking this is a deal breaker. Last night he texted ""how was your night?"" and I just COULD NOT respond. I mean really.. Screw that.

4,t3_rvz082,"just realized I don't introject, can't be coerced, and am super strong... but at what a price","Reading FDS here for nearly a year (cake day 1/10), I've learned SO MUCH, so thank you all, queens! 

That said, I've realized that because I attach VERY slowly, and it takes a LONG time, I'm super hard to manipulate. I admit, the one way I can be manipulated is that I have a temper. There are things like gaslighting, outright lying when the truth is evident, that REALLY get me. But anything a man says about me, I don't take it to heart anymore (introject/self-blame). I know that nine times out of 10, he's projecting and telling on himself, and I'm happy to say so. I'm not Teflon, so it's not like nothing sticks to me. I'm able to take blame, but only when I'm actually in the wrong... and no more than my share of blame. 

But I cannot be coerced ever. Then it becomes a game to resist. Every time I resist, I win; every time a man attempts to apply pressure, he loses. It is absolutely a zero-sum game, where, honestly, no one truly wins, but you get my point. Holding out, not caving \*is\* a win. Exerting my will over a man's in a shitty, toxic game of dominance, power, control is an absolute win.

But the price! I was bullied since single digits due to growing up being a fat girl. It gave me a mouth and a backbone of steel, but I've endured well over 30, nearly 40 years of fatphobic slurs and abuse. Just once, mind you... I got to be where I was loaded for bear and ON BLAST with anyone who said anything awful to me. But all that takes a toll, and I have lifelong body image issues. It took well into my late 30s, early 40s to just like and accept my body, not to hate it. Now, for at least the past 10-20 years, nah, this is me, take it or leave it. What you see is NOT all you get. There are layers here, and you have to see past the rather regular, average exterior to find the real me. 

In some ways, I would think this strength would/will make dating a lot easier. I vet instantly first to see if I'm at all attracted to a man, thereby centering my own desire and attraction first, secondly to see if he likes/is attracted to me. After 50+ years, I can tell instantly if someone is attracted at all or just neutral. Thankfully it's been years since I've gotten the ""fat hate"" look, and 2022 is the year I'm getting back in the gym and working more on my body. I'm not comfortable going in the gym and never have been, but that's a remnant of my FFG (former fat girl) self, and I honor it. Anyway, I dare anyone to say anything at all; we're all there to better ourselves.

Anyone else realize the psychological price(s) they've had to pay to find their own strength? Hoping this was the right flair, too. I couldn't decide between ""level up"" or ""queen shit"". Mostly this post is on how I've shifted my thinking process from guilt that things didn't work out, to what MORE I could do, to trying to change men to be more like I wanted them to be, yada yada. If he wanted to, he would... and for that matter, if I wanted to, I would! One of the main things I've learned is, if it's meant to be, it'll just flow and be damn near effortless, and you'll just get on well, without struggle.",52.0

7,t3_rvt6rf,Book Report: The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene,"I read this and it was interesting. In my opinion none of the ""rules"" in Robert Greene's book should be used by men ( except for giving thoughtful gifts and active listening). Most will just piss the woman off.

 Firstly, we as women need to VET first, rather than ""seduce"". However, some of Greene's ideas do overlap with FDS. E.g. Greene suggests ""not throwing yourself"" at the person, but letting them come to you. 

He also touches on ""whatever is too easy to attain is generally not valued"" i.e. don't be a pickme. He writes of ""causing the man anxiety and never letting him take you for granted""....this aligns with the FDS idea of not making yourself too available or constantly at his disposal. 

He also defines various seductive ""personality types"" such as The Siren, The Dandy, The Natural...these are sort of attitudes that a person naturally has and can lean into. Interesting, and he gives diverse examples. I think if combined with FDS principles, there is no harm in expressing your style in these ways. There is also some weird Freudian psychobabble in there. 

I'd say it's an interesting read, but the rules of engagement for men and women definitely do NOT work the same.",73.0

9,t3_rvpg5l,"‚ö†Ô∏èIf you self-loathe and feel guilty as shit post break-up, it wasn't healthy. PICK YOURSELF UP, no matter how much it hurts. He wasn't there for you when you hit rock bottom, but YOU will be there for YOU!","Hi lovelies,  


I wanted to reiterate that if after the break-up AND it has been a long time of No Contact, and you STILL feel like shit either from his or your actions, the man was a LVM and the relationship was not good for your health. A man who really loved you would not pick stupid fights with you, bring you down, or even make you feel less of yourself.  


I had to learn this the hard way, 5 years after the breakup (and there was NC!):   


\[story time\]

In my early 20s, I was in a 1.5 year long relationship with a Pakistani-American guy. He was my first love, 2 years older than me, and he used me as emotional support. I was the only person he trusted, which I believed, but there were so many squabbles. He was to inherit the family business, and as his father used intimidation tactics to coerce him to dump me (I am not of the same faith nor am I from the same culture/racial background), the boyfriend suddenly said we were ""incompatible"" and that ""you put conditions on our relationship"" when we broke up. I knew in my heart that this was not the reason why he wanted to split. That day we split up felt like a machete stabbed into my chest, twisting clockwise and counterclockwise for the next 5 years. (At one point toward the end of the relationship, he said to me, ""You'll think I'll wait until 30 for you?"" in anger. I should've known this was his true character.) Oh yes, when he broke up with me, he revealed he still wanted to talk to me every now and then. I said no contact and he responded, ""Fine.""   


He is someone who will AVOID uncomfortable situations, he will try to avoid PAIN and SUFFERING. He used weed as a coping mechanism... he promised he wouldn't use it but when we were headed to split, he revealed he starting using again. (He blamed me for saying his use of weed as one of the causes for our breakup, hence the "" you put conditions on us"" reason.) 

He had ambitions and goals to leave his family and his culture because he hated the Pakistani culture (and the women from his own racial background)! He told me he would never get an arranged marriage, he refused to... He did not even want to marry a woman from his own culture but wait until later... Because he was so afraid of pain and suffering, he never took the steps to upgrade himself and separate himself from the family business/culture if he actually DID want no part in it. 

He was self-serving and self-oriented. He drove out an hour to see me when I was still in university, often without telling me, to talk to me about his personal problems with family/people in general. He would get mad when I wasn't in the house and didn't tell him - well honey, maybe I was in class or at a friend's or doing my own thing... Anyway, he talked shit about everyone, his family (his mom and dad especially), his friends, his associates, his former girlfriend, man, the list went on. He blamed everyone except himself; I doubt he was even able to self-reflect. I doubt he even has self-awareness.  


He started so many pointless, tit for tat spats that turned into full-on arguments. At first in the beginnings of such tiffs, you cry a little bit but then I got angry in a mode of self-defense and equally joined in the stupidity of yelling matches (ugh!).  I forgave him countless times, yet he allowed that resentment to bring old problems back into arguments.

Love requires complete total giving and willing sacrifice, without the expectation of return. It is to will the good of another person. The moment he felt like he lost something out of the act of sacrifice, he was quick to pin it back on me, asking, ""When have you sacrificed for me?"" He gave with the expectation of return. He kept score on the giving and the arguments. That man did not know the concept of love because he couldn't understand it. He never had it when he was young. Even if I loved him, regardless of his many faults and my many faults, he couldn't process or value this love. Nor did he have the patience to do so.

He didn't have the decency to tell me in person why he thought we were headed down a fruitless path. I remember that towards the end of the relationship, whenever he would visit me, I would cry before he left to go back home. I knew something was amiss, but he wouldn't tell me. Each time I cried when he came over, he told me everything was going to be OK then drove home. As he went back home, he got mad at me and tried to solve the issue through text. You know what was his reason to not explain in person? He had work the next morning at his father's and didn't have the time to explain or talk about what was going on and ""didn't have until 2 or 3 AM to solve our relationship issues,"" i.e. he didn't want to sacrifice his time for me.   


Throughout the relationship, he said some disparaging things to my face when we fought. He was really mean during fights, actually. Saying that I took forever to solve simple, little problems (hell, I was a naive 20-year-old in college, of course I ain't gonna know survival shit yet, damn); I had a massive ego; that I was needy (?? um... projecting much...?); didn't know how to communicate; that I'm not really good at giving him oral; and countless other things but luckily for my sanity, I forgot what the rest were - (deleting all texts and emails help!! Do it!) After fights, I felt like I was always walking on eggshells with him. But because I thought he agreed with my traditional and religious lifestyle and other reasons, I thought he was the one. I would not let go.  


Like the submissive woman I was trying/hoping to be, because I thought we could ""build together"" and work on our problems together/forgive each other/learn together, I cried like a little Asian Barbie doll, thinking I really was the problem. As a religious woman, I also thought that he didn't mean the words he said, he was only saying those words because he was stressed out and didn't know God. I made excuses for him. And I thought that this man could grow to know God more as I showed him more love and forgiveness... I also thought that because as a religious woman who believes in love and forgiveness, that after we fought, he would extend the same clean ""let's start over, let's turn the other cheek"" slate that I gave to him. Oh boy, was I wrong. 

Since the breakup, I sent him ""how are you"" and ""happy birthday"" emails sporadically, as a way to extend messages that I held nothing against him, that I forgave him, that the past is past, hopefully we could talk. I should've taken the note that he wasn't interested in speaking to me at all. But, because I had a poor view of myself, blamed myself for being egotistical and proud like what he said to me, and desperately wanted to become a better woman, I thought I could have another shot with this man. I blamed my na√Øvet√© and general inexperience with life that caused me to show this man my true colors as well (yes, for someone who would yell at me, I too shouted hurtful crap at him too. eh well). At one point in my post-breakup processing, I even put him on a pedestal! Fucking crazy given the way he treated me.

Fast forward to now, I took the bull by the horns and walked into his dad's workplace (technically his business now) to say hi, scope things out, ask him how he's been. (Again, this is 5 years since we've last spoken to each other.)

Boy, when he saw me, he had to excuse himself out the backdoor to catch a breather. He never knew I would find the location of his work, the business that he opened without telling me towards our end. When he came back to the front counter, he waved hi when I waved, and I walked up to him. I looked at his eyes the entire time. He could not look me in the eyes, he only looked away. He locked eyes with me once and very briefly. Suffice to say, the conversation was awkward but I was very friendly and cordial. Wow, you can kill someone with kindness. Ha!  


(shooting the shit with how he's been, then I ""shoot my shot"")

Me, smiling: If you're available, I'd love to catch up.  
Him (2-3 second pause, quietly, doesn't look at my eyes): I'm married.  
Me, barely heard him: You're not married?   
Him (looks away still): I am married.  
Me, walking away: Oh, congratulations.  


Afterwards, I waved goodbye. I felt a huge sense of relief because after so many years, it was obvious he could not confront the fact that I knew his soul, even more than his wife. I felt I was set free from the vines of self-hatred, guilt, inadequacy, sadness, denial, disappointment, anger, shame, and hurt. He was married now, and yes, he did keep to that promise of not waiting for me until 30 years old. He barely turned 28, and his parents shoved him a wife from back home. But surely he must've agreed to it.  
\--&gt; I did my research, and he got married to 1.) a woman from his mom's hometown in Pakistan, 2.) someone who's probably a cousin, 3.) the very specific physical traits he does not like in women. He looked absolutely miserable on his wedding day. Yes, I was able to find the wedding films after he told me! Definitely not the dreamgirl he had in mind. I could only feel pity for him. That marriage was done out of business, not love - love and freedom that he so desperately seeks.

\[end story\]  


**TL;DR**: You will experience a lot of pain and suffering after a breakup, especially if it was with a man you really loved and put a lot of hope in. Not only did I lose him (more like it wasn't much of a loss LOL!), I also lost 2 of my closest ""friends"" during this breakup processing time - both were set on leaving me for more ""successful"" friends because I seemed obsessive/lost/depressed. Hell, I was. That's trauma. Maybe it was even emotional abuse to some degree.  


You will be left to fend for yourself, to pick up those shattered pieces and glue them back together, even if you feel like total and complete utter shit. You'll wish that your former boyfriend will come back, support you in feeling whole again. Fuck that loser. He wasn't there for you when you needed him most. He only saw what emotional support he could get out of your sweet, encouraging, uplifting words. **You do the best shit you can do to be your own damn queen**. Find people you can really trust to help you process your emotions. I was lucky enough to have my mom help me identify, swallow some much needed to be digested reality. Every day felt like hell. But through this agonizing pain, I promise you will GROW. You will CHANGE. You will love those who deserve your love even MORE because you have experienced pain. Please, take off those rose-colored glasses. There will be gallons of tears that can fit an ocean, I know it hurts. But you are your own best investment.  


It will take you time. Sometimes twice as long as the amount you were together for.   
But I promise you, the moment you feel free, whole, and woman again is the day you realize the best thing you can do for yourself is to indulge yourself in the passions that fill you, and to share that love generously with those who RECIPROCATE and deserve you.

10,t3_rvosyp,"""I'm feeling blamed""","There was a post earlier today about how men weaponize therapy language/jargon and I‚Äôm wondering if my story is related? Was I being manipulated? Abused? Gaslit? Serious question. I‚Äôm trying to work through my last relationship and all my pick-me ü§° behavior (I don‚Äôt have insurance for therapy until the end of the month, but I will be talking to someone soon).

Here‚Äôs the short version of the story:

We were doing something at my ex‚Äôs place. He made a comment somewhere along the lines of me having ‚Äúnothing between my ears‚Äù or something like that, basically he alluded to me being dumb. It made me cry. I CRIED. His response? To say I drank too much (I didn‚Äôt, those kinds of comments are a trigger for me). The next morning he said something about how I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to fuck last night.‚Äù I was quick to tell him it‚Äôs because he MADE ME CRY, how what he said was a trigger, and that naturally causes women to‚Ä¶.. NOT WANT TO FUCK.  His response??? His response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling blamed.‚Äù When I think back on it, he has used that phrase a few times.

So what do you Queens think about that phrase? General scrote immaturity and incapability? Or was it some form of manipulation/abuse?",228.0

13,t3_rvjyqo,Another Breakup Survival Tip," Check my post history for the recent breakup post if you‚Äôd like.

I was feeling **so** depressed most of the day today. Heavy, sad, empty, wanting to cry but I couldn‚Äôt, most of ya‚Äôll know what I mean. But I‚Äôve found something else that *really* helped. Re-reading the handbook, Queens! I kid you not, I am feeling SO much better after just chillin‚Äô on the couch under a comfy blanket, watching a favorite streamer, and going back through the handbook! 

The part that really helped me the most today was from ‚Äú[The difference between LVM and HVM](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/e5jjb9/its_about_more_than_paying_for_dates_some_examples/)‚Äù A lot of my sadness has come from my thoughts along the lines of ‚Äú*He really did want to make me happy though. He wanted to keep a cleaner home, and do what was required to meet my standard. He just couldn‚Äôt do it without some help. I should have told him more clearly what to do and help him learn. What if I never find another man again who‚Äôs even willing to do these things? I blew my one and only chance.‚Äù*

Then I hit this part of the above post: 

&gt;A LVM will help around the house. He'll need you to tell him exactly what to do and when to do it, though, because he doesn't really care. When you do tell him, he'll get annoyed. He will probably forget, and when you point it out to him, he'll get pissed that you're ""nagging"". He'll do a bad job and when you ask him to do it better, he'll have a tantrum and proclaim that he's never doing it again. You'll do 80% of the housework but he'll claim you split it ""pretty evenly"". He will make fun of your standards and belittle you for being ""so uptight"". If you suggest hiring a cleaning service, he'll freak out at the cost and insinuate that you're lazy.

I realized I had told him the issues. He would come back with ‚Äúwell my ex‚Äôs were MeAn tO mE and told me I nEveR diD anYtHiNg RighT, so I just decided I wasn‚Äôt going to do it anymore.‚Äù

So ya, he was literally TELLING ME he was LVM and I missed it somehow lol. ü§°

I‚Äôve said it before. I‚Äôll say it again and again and again: there is nothing brag worthy about any woman having sex. I guarantee that the least conventionally attractive of us could walk into a bar, club, restaurant, gym, wherever, and find a hookup. Men are desperate. Some of them will take anyone.

16,t3_rvgvt3,Don't invest in online relationships with men,"TL;DR: Men with childish and perverted hobbies online are immature and disgusting in person. Don‚Äôt waste your time thinking you‚Äôve found someone who will be different if only you get the chance to ‚Äúfix him up.‚Äù

Until recently I was talking to a guy I knew online for a couple years. I know my experience won't apply to most of the ladies here, but as someone who is very introverted, I hope other women with whom any of this resonates will take a moment to think about how they spend their time online and who they give their time to. I ended up meeting my ""friend"", so I'll give a rundown on the red flags to look for online and in person.

I'll start with what it was like to have an online friendship with this person. My self-worth had been so low for so long that I ignored every red flag imaginable.

1. His only hobbies were hentai, MMOs, and anime. We met in a group for an MMO so it was fine at first. **I know now that none of these are a healthy way for a man to spend time in any quantity, especially hentai or porn.**
2. He would freely discuss his problems but not listen or try to be comforting when I wanted support. His problems were always related to his parents and loneliness. **I tempered my expectations and told myself to be patient, and that people open up at their own pace. WRONG, true friends do not use you like you‚Äôre their therapist.**
3. He had HUGE mommy issues. He didn‚Äôt want to shave to spite his mother, despite looking ridiculous with his mousy facial hair, because she told him to. He fetishized ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù characters. **Men who lack self awareness like this DO NOT deserve our friendship. They hate their mothers and they hate women.**
4. He ignored me any time I tried to show him something I liked, such as taking a picture on a hike, or when I tried to take an interest in his studies and learn about art and drawing. **This happened often and it hurt every time. Friendship should NOT HURT.**
5. His entire online persona was ‚Äúto be a pervert.‚Äù In private communication he would occasionally talk about normal things, but he also liked discussing hentai, and I was so lonely that I went along with it. **No matter how poorly you think of yourself, you are ALWAYS better than being the ‚Äúcool friend‚Äù disgusting men use to indulge their disgusting habits. If he mentions porn or hentai to you ever, throw him out immediately.**

I could go on about it, but at this point it‚Äôs clear I was being an online pickme, so I‚Äôll get to how these character traits translated in person. I did sleep with him and that was a lesson in itself.

1. He looked just like you would expect of a shut-in hentai addict. Poor posture, hunched shoulders, bloated belly. None of his clothes fit well. Everything he wore was musty.
2. His teeth were opaque yellow. He never smiled in pictures. I wondered why‚Äìmystery solved. Just like a child, he didn‚Äôt like flossing because it hurt. **He couldn't even take care of himself, it makes sense he was inept at everything else.**
3. He didn‚Äôt talk to waitstaff or service people. He never said please or thank you. He did not tip. **He didn't respect others. When we talked online, he would act surprised if I told him he seemed rude. His lack of socialization I perceived online was consistent in person.**
4. He complained constantly. We went to a park and the only thing he did the entire time was complain about the weather. He couldn‚Äôt keep up with me. **Men who cannot find joy in new things will drain you.**
5. He had the audacity to criticize that I made my bed. Not how I made it, but that I made it at all, because ‚Äúit would just get messed up later anyway.‚Äù!! **He had no appreciation for routine, orderliness or discipline; tied into his mommy issues as she did all of his cleaning for him.**
6. He was cheap despite having money, and expected me to pay when he ‚Äúforgot his credit card.‚Äù He never offered to pay for anything.

Finally, the sex was BAD. Of course. He was small and he couldn‚Äôt stay hard. He had to jerk himself to stay even partially erect. He had the nerve to say ""I guess I'm just hard to please."" No, he was just a compulsive masturbator, but I couldn't tell him that.... At the end, he asked if I would give him a blowjob and of course I said no. He still insisted because ‚Äúno‚Äù is never a complete sentence, but there was no way I was going to dislocate my jaw trying to suck off a flaccid porn addict. I was so glad when he left, and I stopped talking to him shortly afterward.

Men with childish and perverted hobbies online are immature and disgusting in person. Don‚Äôt waste your time thinking you‚Äôve found someone who will be different if only you get the chance to ‚Äúfix him up.‚Äù

If there‚Äôs even a single instance of doubt, throw him out. I gaslit myself into thinking that it was okay because everyone is struggling with their own demons. **I deserved better, and so do you.** Invest in your friendships with women online, and work on yourself.

20,t3_rvb8op,My emotionally abusive relationship is over. Signs to look out for when it‚Äôs not typically obvious! ‚ù§Ô∏è,"I started the new year out of an abusive relationship of a year and a half. I didn‚Äôt realize I was being emotionally abused until the end of the relationship. It was so insidious because he never love bombed or outright controlled me. The mask starts slipping slowly and slowly and they show their true colors. They slowly chip away at your self-esteem in ways that may not be obvious. Men abuse because they benefit from it. 

JUST BECAUSE THEY PAY FOR EVERYTHING AND DO THE BASIC THINGS A MAN SHOULD DO, IT DOES NOT MAKE THEM HV 
- My ex always paid for everything and never let me touch a door. He held the seat open for me and did many favors for me for my ‚Äúhappiness.‚Äù 
- On my birthday, I had a dinner with 7 of my girlfriends and him at a very expensive restaurant. He drove all of us there and I realized I forgot my mother‚Äôs card on the way there (my mom was supposed to cover everyone except him and me since he was going to pay for the two of us). He said we weren‚Äôt driving back to get it and he‚Äôd cover the whole thing (ended up being an $800 dinner). A few days later (toward the end of the relationship) when we got into an argument, he said ‚Äúwhat else do I have to do to show you I care and love for you? Another $800 dinner?!‚Äù Very self-motivated to make HIMSELF look and seem like a good boyfriend. 

GASLIGHTING &amp;amp; LIES
- Every argument we had, he would say it was because of me. Except every argument started whenever I brought up something that I felt uncomfortable about or bothered with and he gaslit me back. I learned from my previous relationship to never walk on eggshells. 
- For example, I was uncomfortable about him snapchatting other girls. He gaslit me by telling me I‚Äôm just insecure and that I never have trusted him. GO THROUGH HIS PHONE. I saw he had a girl on his Snapchat with a girl Bitmoji named ‚ÄúTyler.‚Äù I confronted him about it and he lied to my face and said her name was just Tyler. No. He changed the name because her real name was Emily on the username.
- Another prime example: On one vacation, he deleted messages from a girl he used to hook up with in college while he was there in town. When I caught him, he said who she was and that he deleted them so I wouldn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it since it doesn‚Äôt mean anything to him. He said he told her it‚Äôs inappropriate since he has a girlfriend. 

I asked, ‚ÄúHow am I supposed to trust you if you hide things from me?‚Äù And he said because I overreact and accuse him of cheating. This an example of him making me insecure. 

HOW HE CAN STRIP YOU OF CONFIDENCE IN COVERT WAYS 
- He never told me what to do: always encouraged me to go out with friends, never told me what to wear, and always hyped my body up (we met at the gym). However in other ways, he would tell me my face looked fat in photos and the camera doesn‚Äôt like me. 
- He never liked when I wore makeup because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it.‚Äù 
- The social media incident was also an example of stripping me of my security 
- When I was digging for questions about his ex, I asked if he loved her more than me and he said YES. (He tried backing it up saying because he put her at the center of his world and now he has a life outside of a relationship)

IF HE HAS EVEN A HISTORY OF ANGER PROBLEMS, RUN FAR

Thankfully, things ended before he got physical with me. He said his anger used to be so bad, he took himself to zen classes and it‚Äôs not as bad as it used to be. He would always tell me he‚Äôd never lay a hand on me. However, toward the end of the relationship he got in my face during an argument and after, said it was because I pushed him to that point. Then, as I held onto his arm to gently bring him back down to sit on the bed as he was getting up, he looked at his arm as if I was about to get harmfully physical as if he was the victim. He also would get upset at very minuscule things like when he kept making a mistake cutting an onion. 

However, he always told me stories about when he had to get physical for self-defense when someone tried to rob him at a gas station or when he smashed two men‚Äôs heads together at a bar since a guy was being disrespectful towards a woman (like he was such a hero). 

He also said he‚Äôs slapped two women back when they slapped him first because he ‚Äútreats everyone equal.‚Äù I tried explaining to him that women and men don‚Äôt have the same force of hit and they‚Äôre built different. 

PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR KNUCKLES. 
Throughout the whole relationship, I always asked him why his knuckles were so red and he said he didn‚Äôt know. Then my friend said her ex had the same and they‚Äôre from punching objects. I told my ex this and he said that sounded right and that he does punch the desk and headboard. 

WHAT IS HIS FAMILY DYNAMIC LIKE?
- His parents were cruise ship entertainers and the family was very good at putting up a face for others and seemed perfect. 
- His dad was about 15 years older than his wife (RED FLAG WITH AGE GAP) 
- He said he got his anger from his father and that he wasn‚Äôt sure if his mom slapped him if his dad wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to slap her back.  (RED FLAG)
- His parents seemed so happy and in love but he told me they almost got a divorce 11 years ago. You never what happens behind closed doors. 
- The family was very charming on the surface level. 

COMMON PHRASES &amp; TACTICS 
- ‚ÄúThat sounds like a you problem‚Äù
- ‚Äúyou‚Äôre insecure‚Äù
- ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt trust me‚Äù
- ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù
- silent treatment

All of this came to my realization in the last week of our relationship since most of these events occurred in the last week (other than the slowly stripping me of my confidence). He said he hated me in an argument and after I said I didn‚Äôt think I could recover from that, he goes ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find a way.‚Äù I was planning my escape until he discarded me and said he couldn‚Äôt be with me and couldn‚Äôt handle the arguments in relation with his mental health. His anger was getting worse and I can say that since I wasn‚Äôt bending 100% (I spoke up and defended myself and pointed out he was being abusive), his anger was triggered. He made me feel bullied and so small by the end. He was extremely condescending. 

Once we ended things, he told me he‚Äôd always be there for me and the door is open if I decide not to block him on everything. The next morning I left his message on open of him saying ‚ÄúI had a great relationship with you. I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù and I blocked him on Instagram ONLY so far. Then, after I didn‚Äôt show up at the gym when we usually see each other, and he realized I blocked him, he blocked me on every other social media platform. In addition, he unblocked and followed a girl who was a literal threat to our relationship a few months before who wanted to get with him (what a pig üêñ .) This showed me how ego driven he was and made me realize our whole relationship was a lie. He was mad I took my power back. 

This has showed me that ANYONE can be in an abusive relationship. I never thought I would be after seeing my friends go through it. There‚Äôs different abusers with different tactics.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he cheated on me at some point during the relationship since we were long distance for a few months. I‚Äôm getting therapy to recover from it and am already moved back to my college campus to graduate and move out to a city. I‚Äôm also listening to the FDS podcast and their Patreon episodes on repeat. Frankly, he can die mad üòÇ

For the uninitiated, Pretty Privilege, according to [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pretty%20Privilege), is ‚ÄúA person who has more opportunities, and becomes more [**successful**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=successful) [**in life**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=in%20life) because of how [**attractive**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=attractive) they are.‚Äù There are copious [Tik-Toks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B-1j2E5-4Y), and [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvHJHiIUbvA) made on this topic. Conversations on this topic often leave women feeling worse about themselves. You are either fortunate enough to have Pretty Privilege or not, and if you are a member of the latter, you have to spend an inordinate amount on beauty products, routines, and hair extensions to grasp on some semblance of beauty.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a completely different perspective when it comes to Pretty Privilege. I believe that Pretty Privilege is a **false sense of power relegated to women to keep us preoccupied and subjugated**. No, I am not some ultra-liberal, ivory tower educated woman who only speaks in -isms and supremacies. I am a regular woman who came to this realization after observing the world around me. To fully explore my opinion, we must first examine beauty. **What does it mean to be beautiful?**

&amp;#x200B;

Some 2,500 years ago, in ancient Greece, it was discovered that when a line is divided into two parts in a ratio of 1: 1.618, it creates an appealing proportion. This ratio is known as the golden ratio, the divine proportion or phi (named after Phidias, a Greek sculptor, and mathematician who used this ratio when designing sculptures). Since the Renaissance period, artists like Botticelli and Leonardo Da Vinci have used the golden ratio in the sketching of their paintings, such as Monalisa or Birth of Venus. During modern times, the golden ratio has been applied to facial beauty and adopted as a guideline for aesthetic treatments.

The unfortunate result of the golden ratio is that it confines women into these very narrow dimensions of what can be defined as beautiful. Knowing the dimensions and ratios that define ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù, we have essentially created an assembly line that churns out products that are meant to help women fit into those dimensions. As with all commodities, we have to make the consumer believe that they need it. So, we sell women's beauty products as an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù....

23,t3_rv9h01,It's official. This is the most HVM I've ever seen,"For those of you lamenting the lack of HVM in our media, I came across an absolute GEM of a movie last night called Far From The Madding Crowd (2015). The male love interest, Gabriel Oak, is as high value as they come and it was an absolute delight see him ticking all the FDS boxes as the story progressed.

\*Spoilers abound\*

\- He falls in love with the heroine Bathsheba and makes his intention to marry her clear very early on

\- When she turns him down (being willful and independent, she isn't sold on the idea of marriage, even though she likes him a lot) he takes the rejection gracefully and doesn't raise the issue again.

\- When he loses his fortune (through circumstances not his fault) instead of complaining and wallowing, he immediately sets out to work hard and make something of himself again.

\- Bathsheba (now a wealthy heiress) offers him a job, which he accepts without a trace of resentment. He's hardworking and never tries to mansplain the job of running a farm to her. Even though she's a woman in the 1800s with relatively little experience, he trusts and has complete faith that she can handle the responsibility.

\- He inspires Bathsheba to be her best self. When she sends a joke valentine to a lonely middle-aged bachelor (thus making him fall desperately in love with her) Gabriel (in private) quietly chides her, pointing out that toying with a respectable man's feelings is 'beneath her'.

\- Bathsheba loses her temper at this and demands that he leave her employ. He does so quietly and without a word of argument. When a crisis arrives the next day, leaving the farm in jeopardy, he comes back to help and doesn't hold it against her (although he does have the self-respect to insist that she ask for his help in person rather than sending a subordinate)

\- When Bathsheba ignores his misgivings and marries a total LVM degenerate, Gabriel continues to help make running the farm a success even while her husband is drinking and gambling away her inheritance. 

\- Bathsheba realizes pretty quickly she's made a terrible mistake marrying her husband. Gabriel listens and is compassionate but doesn't use the situation to his own advantage. 

\- Bathsheba increasingly starts to see him as a confidant, trusting him implicitly. When she is given the opportunity to marry a man she doesn't love for financial security, she asks Gabriel what she should do. He simply says: ""Do what is right.""

\- When he sees that Bathsheba has made a success of her life, Gabriel is prepared to leave forever, even while loving her, because knowing that she is prosperous and happy is enough for him. It is only when Bathsheba makes it clear she returns his love that he makes his interest known again.

**TLDR: Gabriel Oak throughout this movie is a quiet, calm presence of integrity, strength and devotion. He is hard-working, honest and kind without being a pushover and is the epitome of what a man should be.**

And to top it all off: **he is by far the hottest guy in the entire movie.** Gabriel Oak is tall, strong, muscular, and drop-dead gorgeous, so Bathsheba ends up with the 'good guy' at the end without having to compromise on looks.

28,t3_rv3juf,Having a baby via sperm donor,"Hi ladies, I'm going to be thirty this month. Being a mom has been a lifelong dream, I love kids and I'm a teacher so my career is convenient for parenting. I'm not saying it wouldn't be complicated to have a baby on my own but I think it would give me tremendous freedom from dating and allow me to achieve my dream without waiting for a man who isn't a baby himself. 

I wonder why this hasn't become more socially acceptable as women gain financial independence. I get all the reasons you would want a partner to raise a baby with but there are so many pitfalls with the wrong partner. My dad, for instance, is an addict and has schizophrenia which he doesn't manage. I'm certain he made my mom's life raising my brother and I at least 500% harder than if she did it alone. Sure we can all follow FDS to find a guy that isn't totally terrible but I don't know if freezing my eggs is the answer (do I really want to physically carry a baby at 40?) 

How can I find communities of women who do this? Do you guys know anyone who has done this personally and how it turned out? Books I can read on the subject? Thanks!

Edit: btw I realize adoption is a beautiful thing, maybe I'm selfish but I always wondered what it's like to grow a person. I'd consider adoption equally.",409.0

30,t3_rus2aw,Working on myself just makes me feel more isolated,"I‚Äôm new to Reddit and I hope I reach a few with some insight. It‚Äôs not easy for me to reach out, mostly because I was raised to be self-sufficient and I generally struggle matching words to emotions (ew‚Ä¶feelings). I‚Äôm 42/F, divorced, no kids, 2 degrees, a good job, and now own my own home. I \*should\* be in a great place but I waffle daily (even hourly) between being content in my singleness and wanting a good person in my life.

I was a hot mess in my 20s/ early 30s and got my ass to therapy. I lost a bunch of weight, had goals, looked and felt amazing. Then my foundation crumbled over a period of 6 or 7 years. My father is no longer in my life, I l moved a lot, my brother died last year, and my cat of 12 years. It‚Äôs just me and my mom now. All the weight is back even though I‚Äôm learning to enjoy running again (even in winter). I‚Äôm still in therapy and have done a lot of work on myself internally - like establishing boundaries and dealing with heartbreak and loss.

Ironically, the more I work on myself, the more disconnected I become. I dated this guy on and off for 5 years (amidst working on myself) until he proposed this last time and then broke it off a month later. I‚Äôm better off, I know that. Too much drama with a LVM who was used to the person he knew years prior and not supportive of change.

OLD is a complete joke. Horny scrotes, liars who want ‚Äúhonesty and communication,‚Äù or they have kids and want to debate why I don‚Äôt. (That‚Äôs always pleasant and leaves me feeling overwhelmed and like a complete shit of a woman). OR there‚Äôs just no chemistry. I work from home and don‚Äôt go out except for errands. I tried Meetup and that didn‚Äôt work either.

I should disclose that I have autism and while I‚Äôve mastered masking, social interaction is not easy for me. I was diagnosed very late in life which explained a few things, but also means I‚Äôm still learning how it defines me. I HATE thinking of it as a disability. And I rarely tell people because they don‚Äôt believe me anyway. I‚Äôm also extremely sensitive to EVERYTHING (mostly sound and smell). I limit being out in public just so it doesn‚Äôt suck the life out of me. Not complaining - only giving some context.

I‚Äôm in a specific kind of therapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). I can accept choices I‚Äôve made. The hardest part is accepting myself and committing to my boundaries and values at the risk of being alone (not in a relationship) the rest of my life. I want to believe there are decent, honest, supportive, kind men out there. And while I don‚Äôt expect him to land in my lap, how do I find this person without it being a complete waste of time and energy?

I also don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm the only one in this limbo of sorts. I appreciate you reading and for any thoughts. Take care everyone!",181.0
31,t3_rusbr3,Speaking my mind/Shameful Past/Trigger Warning!!!!,"I had very low self esteem and if you could watch a movie of my life you would understand. I didnt like/love myself properly. I hung around men (or boys to be clear we were in HS lol)  who didnt respect me and I had sex with all of them around the age of 16. I was always high, drunk, or both. Almost always coerced, guilted, forced, etc. OR i just felt so under pressure i said yes. Sometimes i enjoyed it but most of my partners at that age were one time things or ""friends"". (SPOILER: they were just pretending to be my friend to get yk what) basically, before i loved myself and respected myself i let others walk all over me like i deserved nothing more than the affection of a douche bag. I always feel low about those years of my life and have been celibate since 2020 (after i ended things with my partner). I literally traumatized myself and carry this shame of how i once treated myself so horribly. I will literally NEVER let a man or anyone in my life treat me like bimbo again. I deserve the world. I used to be a pick me not that i slut shamed or anything but i definitely was a man pleaser and craved so much male validation. Glad to know those years are over and done. I am still healing from the damage i caused myself and others have caused me. 

Honestly hypersexuality on social media pisses me off  because it really does prey on the younger generations glorifying hook up culture.

34,t3_ruqx4w,"The ""Happily Ever After"" marriage fairytale sold to women is a lie. The truth is most marriages are miserable FOR WOMEN because most men are NV/LV. Society gaslights and (in some parts of the world) even forces women into settling.","Society really underestimates the stress and trauma that LVM and NVM cause their wives/partners and children. The realisation that most women are utterly miserable in their marriages really hit me this holiday season. Literally almost every single friend and family member of mine are married to negative value men. Some female friends are in such terrible, abusive marriages, that this holiday season, a couple of them have admitted that their children are the only reason they have not unalived themselves. I found this absolutely terrifying and disturbing. All of these same friends have rejected FDS but that's a story for another post. 

 If you took one look at a certain sub, you'd see a multitude of gut wrenching holiday horror stories from wives with children. The common denominator of all their holiday misery was their NV husbands.This holiday season, I've truly come to realise that most men hate their wives. They don't see them as actual human beings with feelings. These women are just their slaves to clean up after them, feed them, ¬£*ck them and raise their children. I only saw one positive post where a husband was praised for doing the bare minimum. One woman said being around her husband gives her migraines. Whenever he's gone she's fine and has no migraines. She dreads spending time with him because it's like being around a large toddler/teenager who she would always has to manage. Another had a nasty indifferent old grump of a husband that made her cry herself to sleep for Christmas. Another woman went to multiple international stores just trying to get her husband a specific holiday gift that he was talking about since October. At midnight this twit of a husband goes to the dollar store and fills her stocking with cheap garbage that she doesn't even like in the first place. It seemed like he just picked the first assortment of junk he saw.  There were also lots of stories of husbands ruining Christmas for the children. 

Marriage is sold to women as the happiest thing in the world. It's the ultimate success to get married and breed as a woman. The white dress fantasy, beautiful wedding decor, happiness, diamond ring, spending the rest of your life with the love of your life, having 2 children and a white picket fence. This is society's way of telling  women that getting picked is the best thing that could ever happen to us, it's supposedly something that will make us incredibly happy. What a lie. Simultaneously boys are sold porn fantasies of degrading and dehumanising women. In fact, men are taught to fear and be repulsed by commitment and weddings. They're told to sleep with as many women as they can. The result is idealistic, love struck women loving men who actually hate them and only see women as objects to degrade for status and enjoyment instead of human beings with feelings. And the most devastating result of this lie sold to us, is that women project their love, emapthy, and morality onto men. It's probably why it's so hard to leave. They think that men actually have the same level of humanity and regard for them. They think that if they beg, communicate and explain till they're blue in the face, he will uDeRsTaND and see my humanity and pain ü§°

If marriage is so glorious why are the majority of married women so utterly miserable, hurt and exhausted? Why are there so many studies that show married women are the unhappiest demographic and don't live as long as single women?  The reverse is true for married men. I've only ever seen 2 happy marriages my entire life. I think most single women long for a relationship only because they are told that they can't be happy without marriage and kids. When in fact the opposite is true with how depraved the males of today are.  

From childhood, women are brainwashed to waste time fantasizing about relationships, marriage, and the fantasy of being rescued by a handsome Prince. It's literally all we're taught to think about. Boys are taught to seek adventure and thrills like racecars, mortocyles, etc. They're taught to seek exciting hobbies, financial knowledge success, self empowerment, etc.  Marriage is the last thing on their minds. 

Most marriages are miserable for women because most men are negative value. The marriage lie perpetuated by society reminds me of George Orwell's book, 1984. Or back when cigarettes were marketed as having no adverse effects on your health. It's a lie. Men and society need to lie because no sane women would ever marry men and trap themselves in a life of misery if they really knew the truth. The truth hurts for some time but ultimately sets you free. Applying FDS principles will save you a life wasted in misery centred around men. Decentre men from your lives. 

If you don't meet a HVM and want children, you have modern technology on your side. Get financially stable and plan for life as a single mother rather than settle. You and your child will be happier for it. VET forever and stay ready to leave at the drop of a hat.",1327.0
35,t3_rulv1u,Men's reactions to having their lies exposed,"Everytime a guy is exposed for lying about something important (their age, employment, children, marital status...), their reaction is almost always the same:

""But you wouldn't have given me a chance if I had told you that when we met!"". Yeah, that's exactly the point, GERALD!!! That's what a boundary/standard is for! To filter out the incompatible partners!

Story time: When I was 19 years old I had a short fling with a 32 year old NVM I met on tinder (I know, gross), but I matched with him because his age was set as 27, which was still a huge age gape, almost outside of my comfort zone even at the time, but I had a crush on him for while so I went for it (I know, crushes are bad). He kept his age a secret for about 2 months. 

I figured his age out totally on my own and I wasn't even investigating or suspecting anything. When he sent me his natal chart, I noticed his Pluto was in Libra, which meant he couldn't have been born after 1984, and this happened in 2014.

When I confronted him, he acted like a victim, and I will never forget that he said ""If I had put my real age we wouldn't even have matched!!"". Of course I wouldn't match with someone 13 years older than me! You're not a ""victim"" of my boundaries, I'm the victim of your manipulation. After we broke up I saw him on Tinder again, and his age was set as 30 even though he was 32. ü§°

Many friends have heard the exact same excuse when confronting a guy about their lies. A guy agreed to commit to my friend only to cheat shortly afterwards,  and then his actual argument was: ""you would never have given me a chance if I had told you beforehand that I'm polyamorous"" and ""you would have left me if I didn't commit"".

Men will lie about anything in order to get things their way, and when confronted, it's always ""but you wouldn't even give me a chance if I told you I'm old/unemployed/married/have kids/any deal breaker"". 

Not the brightest argument, to confirm you're bottom of the barrel male disguising as something else, but they expect sympathy and pity by saying that, and to make us sound judgy or mean.

That's also a reason not to disclose your standards clearly in the beginning to anyone, saying ""I would never date someone that has kids"", for example. This will be the cue for a guy that has kids to just lie, and hope they can get away with it when you're already too involved.",677.0
36,t3_rul2wn,Be careful ladies and especially young women,"Hi. I wanted to address this topic to start off the New Year right before more young women get coerced, assaulted, abused, and groomed like I did when I was 20.

Ladies, if you are 18-21 or anywhere in late teens to early 20s then please stay away from men in their 30s. I was sexually coerced, groomed and assaulted by a 32 year old at age 20.

Being 20, you are very naive and inexperienced. Our brains don‚Äôt stop developing until 25-28 for women so we are easier to manipulate. It‚Äôs not about infantilism. There is a big power dynamic between someone 18-21 and someone who is 30-33+

Please remember power dynamics and imbalances exist and these men are PREDATORS. Both ages are in two different stages of life as well. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of people defending this on Reddit because they‚Äôre both ‚Äúlegal adults.‚Äù No. A person in their 30s is a fully fleshed adult and a person in their late teens or early 20s is fresh out of high school. These men are sexual predators and they are grooming you 

Please remember it isn‚Äôt your fault if someone takes advantage of you at that age. The older man is definitely in the wrong. He isn‚Äôt dating women his own age for a reason 

Hope this helped. Stay safe out there ladies",866.0
37,t3_rukyak,Sort of warn out from my first sort of romantic interest after a year of being purposely single. I'm new to this and must be missing red flags.,"I'm so happy I can see these posts again . I was crying earlier today because of what happened to me. This was my first experience entertaining feelings for a guy since my last relationship with a narcissist thankfully came to an end. The city he is from is a very small town where people are generally kind.

I had been talking to this guy for like month and a half total... half of it was long distance. I saw it more as friendship initially but we did meet on a dating app. 

We had met on the apps when I had been in his small town (my family is from there but I was raised cross country). We developed a crush on each other after talking for a few weeks. He had something come up with family (a health scare) so he can't talk to anyone because he's overwhelmed .. And I go on with life because... I'm not too invested and figure he's just blowing me off. We said that if we were ever in each other's city, we would meet up.

A few weeks later, I went back to his city due to my own family emergency (health scare) and he saw that I was there on social media. He reached out and we were talking, decided just to meet up for the hell of it. We spent a couple of weeks talking while I was managing my family issues. Then we ended up meeting and hit it off romantically. We talk about continuing to see each other. He tells me about his mental health struggles that he's struggled with since he was a young child, on medication since he was like 8... How far behind in life he is (late twenties and only in college now, lives with his mom, works for his mom who is successful,, is doing coop hours full time for school, never had a gf, feels behind in life, struggles with mental health, trying to get his life together). These were red flags but I just thought he was so nice and some people have it rough. He was complimenting everything about me in a not sexual way (he went on about how intelligent I am, how genuine/real, attractive, etc). He was touching my hands in an affectionate way. He paid for food and drinks, brought me for a drive around the city then dropped me off. He didn't try to get me to sleep with him.  In my city, guys don't think to open a door for a woman go walk through.. he did. He has family who lives in my city and said he's going to make sure he comes out to see me even though covid may cancel his family plan.we were discussing how often I come to his town too. We texted after saying that we had a great time and wanted to see each other again. 

We talk for a couple more days and things are good. Covid exploded again last week... He lets me know that we need to follow play the next meet up by ear because of the covid numbers. I didn't respond right away because I was busy but totally agreed as I'm  staying with my grandmother. Then I get a text an hour later saying ""I'm not ready for a relationship, lists all the struggles he told me about during our meet up, says that he hopes that I understand and maybe in the new year, he'll feel differently"". I just said thanks for letting me know and that I understood. He was so genuine that I believed him. Apparently he told his mom about me and she switched cars with him so he could bring me out. 

Plot twist... a week later... I go to delete my OLD account...

It looks like he may still be on the dating app I met him on... 

What in the hahsjdndissos? 

I think all of the struggles he listed were the red flags. I just credited it to his bad mental health pushing him back a bit in life. I was open about what I do for work, salary, relationships I've had, etc because they came up in conversation. Im 27, have a perm government job, make 70K which isn't the best but comfortable for my circumstances and I plan to explore new roles, plan to buy a home with a relative in his city, lives on my own, etc. 

I worried that I threatened his ego. Or maybe .... He's just avoidant??? Late twenties in mom's basement still in college (not uni). I've been beating myself up over this. 

I clearly need to read the rules again. Taking this personally is so painful.. deep down I know he probably liked me and sabotaged it because he was insecure but... It's so difficult to not blame myself.

I unfollowed him on social media after seeing that he was looking at my stories. I leave his town on Friday but am staying on his street and his grandmother's building FML lol. We also go to the same gym. I'm trying to avoid but saw him today...


Also.. ""worn out"" oops spelling error.

39,t3_rujfgi,FDS wisdom prevents DISASTER,"At a NYE party I attended, someone brought a random scrote from an app over. He was 10+ years older than the average age there. This scrote chats along until he suddenly asked the group if anyone knew Queen. *""Why yes, she is my neighbour!""* I reacted. He immediately answered, quite casually: *""She's my ex. Where does she live nowadays anyway?""*

Had it not been for FDS, I probably would have answered his question and thought nothing of it (it is not uncommon where I'm at, to ask in which building or part of town people live as small-talk). But because of FDS, a voice in my head immediately screamed **RED FLAG!** üö©and I shut him down, quick as a flash: *""I don't think you need to know where your ex lives.""*

His mask dropped. He got angry and demanding to know where she lives, it's not a weird question to ask, how dare you be so rude, blah blah blah. I walked away and ignored his presence for the rest of the evening. Until eventually, I demanded him to be removed from the party. He tried to manipulate his way into staying for over half an hour and finally left, when it became clear EVERYONE wanted him out and things might escalate if he didn't go.

**Turns out he has been stalking Queen for the past four years.** He has also tracked down some people who attended the party through social media and threatened them (writing whole rambling essays the way only triggered scrotes can), **saying he knows their home address and has the means to enter their homes.** Along with proclaiming he'll *discipline* us if he runs into anyone of us in public, listing information he'd gathered on us during the evening, vague descriptions of our physical appearance, the names he remembered, going on and on about how we should be deeply ashamed for the way we treated him, we're neurotic fools showing unacceptable behaviour, we should be thankful of him because he brought a portable speaker, **we won't get rid of him anytime soon if we don't apologise for being rude to him**, etc.

Safe to say I will be filing a police report with my Queen friend tomorrow, and have removed any means for him to track me down online. I have also warned my social circles to never, ever give out personal information of others to anyone. Asked a  bar I frequent to deny him entry if he ever shows up there. I've contacted the person who brought this scrote along to block&amp;delete his ass without explanation, and to never bring a rando to a party ever again. I contacted the company that he claimed to have worked for, which 'give him acces to the keys of their appartments', to make sure this is either an empty threat or he is denied access immediately. I am also doing everything in my power to make sure my Queen friend stays safe.

Had it not been for FDS I might have given this scrote the benefit of the doubt. I would have been nice and answered his question about her living area. He would have abused this to harass my Queen friend further. Had it not been for FDS, I might not have pushed to file a police report and downplayed the whole thing. But my new iron boundaries will not stand for this threatening behaviour. I will have this scrote locked behind bars with a criminal record longer than the Bible before I let him come near my Queen friend or me.

This will be the first police report filed against him after four years of harassment from his part. Thank you for inspiring women to stand up for themselves nd tolerate zero abuse, FDS.",1311.0

During the first couple of months I‚Äôm aloof, and he‚Äôs just a member of the peanut gallery. We‚Äôre casually dating, so no real emotion has been invested thus far.

42,t3_rui8on,"""I WORK and pay ALL the bills"" and ""she agreed to it"" does not justify being a man-child","Scrotes are still using their trick of ""but she agreed to it like this (him working, her being a house wife /stay at home mom)"" with the justification ""I work and pay all the bills!"" And I'm glad more women are waking up. It's not a fair deal at all. 

Single men still have to get up and go to work, they still have to pay their bills AND they still have to then come home, feed themselves, pickup after themselves, and do their own errands. It doesn't matter of he's single living alone or has roomates - he still has to work AND do those chores. Sure there's some dudes that live in messy pig stys and live off fast food - but this would never fly with other roomates (they would say something at some point or he would get booted). 

So why do some scrotes still think it is ""fair"" and ""generous"" for him to continue on with his routine of working and paying bills and stop lifting a finger around the house, with the kids, with the errands, etc, AND have access to sex? He's continuing on with his normal responsibilities of work and bills AND gets a bang maid. 

More women are waking up to this bad deal as the woman ends up having way more work and stress: she's a maid, a secretary, a caregiver to pets and kids, a taxi, a chef, a decorator/gardener (it's almost always the woman making the house into a home), an entertainer (planning parties and dealing with his guests), and his sex doll.... let's not forget she is also a nurse any time he has the sniffles and overreacts! He has one job. She has about ten different jobs. Look at what it costs to hire a maid, look at what it costs to hire a cab, look what it costs to have a chef, etc.... and she gets basically her room and board for all of that. 

Many of the times the woman is tricked into this ""deal"" where she becomes trapped and it can quickly turn abusive. The man gets entitled and verbal / emotional abuse starts up (you're a nag! You were home all day, you just lounge around, here I'm done with dinner here's my plate wash it! Gaslighting, negging, etc)

I'm just ranting because I'm so sick of this narrative

43,t3_ruhmdd,Age Gap Gross Out,"I was recently at an event for my job where I met &amp; mingled with a lot of younger people.  There was this one guy who looked about my age (early 30‚Äôs). He was handsome &amp; we were chatting about the event. 5 minutes into the conversation we‚Äôre talking about high schools and he told me the year he graduated. Ladies, it was 2020. I felt grossed out that I was even attracted to a 19 year old guy for like 5 minutes. The second I learned his age, the attraction disappeared and that was that. The thought of being sexual with a near child just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me, now matter how ‚Äúmanly‚Äù he looked.

45,t3_rugays,"90 Day Allegation Against Syngin and Social Implications (Spoilers, CW)","Good evening, ladies! Thank you for helping us continue to grow strong in 2022. 


I recently stumbled upon some disturbing news about an actor on the 90 Day Fiance. A very brave woman called ""Valerie"" joined a well-known podcast to share some allegations. In the episode, Valerie said she endured multiple forms of abuse by Syngin Colchester. Although this seems it has yet to be resolved legally, I personally believe her. 


Why is this story relevant to FDS? Valerie's line of thinking is IMO a result of direct and indirect LibFem Pickme conditioning. If you can stomach a listen, I linked the podcast below: 


https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-86-trigger-warning-conversation-with-valerie/id1484406030?i=1000546452185


Let's deconstruct and discuss. For context, Syngin's character was consistently portrayed as LVM/NVM. In the beginning of his appearance on the show, he was portrayed sympathetically due to some nonsense lines and circumstances from his then-wife Tania. An example would be seeing his heart break when she said she loved him and wanted to marry him, but he was not her ""soulmate"" like her first love. The fan community piled on her, but there were some blazing red flags of alcohol issues and laziness in Syngin at the same time. I am not justifying Tania's actions. 


Later in the series, signs of his alcoholism, laziness, and lack of ambition continued. Tania was crying at times over his indecision about children, lack of career direction, and their overall compatibility. Syngin appeared to be the ""fun party guy"" and had a host of enablers including his friends and family. Syngin seemed to have the ""legend in his own mind"" syndrome seen in many unambitious ""nice guy"" LVM/NVM: ""maybe I'll be an opera singer or a fireman!"" Syngin pooh-poohed his wife's concerns and told her not to worry, as if his life would magically fall into place by the universe (with no work on his part).
As his marriage to Tania fell apart, verbal aggression was noted in this season of The Single Life, and he was observed to break a wine glass in anger. Again, this is all information as portrayed on the show, as I do not know him personally. 


Enter Valerie's allegations. The pain and genuineness in her story bypass the vocal-distorting mechanism for anonymity. She described love-bombing in a short period of time, a whirlwind romance, and being alone with Syngin in a different state. 


As she recounted her line of thinking during the interview, all I could think was she was an obvious product of libfem conditioning, wanting male approval, scarcity mindset, and simply wanting a warm human connection. She asserted she endured abuse (surprise surprise, he liked BDSM allegedly). He is 100% responsible if he did these things to her, 100% to blame for the pain he inflicted if indeed these things did happen.


As for Valerie, she was brainwashed to ignore her intuition, and well-meaning people she said warned her. Rumor has it even Tania reached out to her. Her mind was brainwashed by our society, maybe her home life, maybe her friends, maybe her exes, somehow to be a self-destructive pickme. She was taught to blindly trust a man and prize their connection over all else. To ""help"" him, to beg for humanity, to believe he was ""deeper"" and more respectful of her than he acted. She was pressuring herself (likely a result of useless therapists, professors subscribing to libfem acceptance of BDSM, and mainstream prnography) to accept the unacceptable. She offered herself up as a proverbial ""lamb to the slaughter"" for this man to (allegedly) use and abuse. She sacrificed her humanity as a person and was viewing herself through the male gaze IMO. It was heartbreaking hearing her story. 


To make things worse, Valerie has children. Self-destructive pickmeism can indirectly or indirectly affect children via modeling, ditching the kids for a trip with some man, valuing a man's opinion over her own, and generally walking into danger. I hope above and beyond her child(ren) are protected. 


Again, I do not blame Valerie for falling for this line of thinking. As Deb Cooper says, even religion can be misused to brainwash women into dating LVM/NVM they do not like/are not compatible with. In religion, the line of thinking is ""only God can judge, we are all sinners, and who am I to judge him?"" 



So many of us may have been in such a situation, if not already. Maybe those of us who avoided it could have been at risk if we did not have the home life/values promoting protective instincts over pleasing men. Some of us did have those home values growing up but become brainwashed out of them at libfem universities or with bad therapists. So many of us were almost her, if our NVM exes were just a little bit more sadistic. So many of us were in an almost a mirror image of her situation, experiencing verbal abuse and more. 


Valerie is so brave for sharing her story. We are her. She is us. We need to stick together and lift each other up. Ladies, we need FDS now more than ever. We have ""professionals,"" media, and friends pushing us to push through discomfort/pain to please men. 


Although this story is tragic, we have a few takeways for New FDSers and those in need of a reminder. 


1. Never date a man into BDSM


2. Never go on a trip alone with a man you barely know


3. Never fly out to see a man you barely know-- let him come to you (not to your actual house) 


4. Never believe love-bombing. It is impossible for your connection to be otherworldly, intergalatically ""special"" for you to throw caution to the wind


5. NEVER doubt your gut instinct


6. Take other womens' warnings into serious consideration


7. When a man tells/shows you negative things about him, believe him


8. When a man tells/shows you something positive about him, be skeptical and vet 


9. Anytime a man pushes a boundary or ""no,"" he is gone


10. Leave at the first sign of disrespect/red flag. It will not get better 


11. Value yourself more than male opinions. Male opinions of you, male attention toward you, male attraction to you, and sex from men is abundant and low value. It means nothing about your self worth 


12. Lift other women up (but ditch friendships with malignant pickmes)


Stay woke, ladies. Your mental and physical health depend on it.",77.0

50,t3_ru8uny,Single's Inferno on Netflix - what we can learn from the hit Korean dating show,"Hi everyone,

I've recently binged the Korean dating show 'Single's Inferno' on Netflix. The concept is simple: 5 guys and 4 girls are stranded on a desert island and can get to have dates at a luxury resort hotel if they choose each other at the end of each night through a vote. At the end of the show, they must choose which person they liked the most.

I usually don't really enjoy Western dating show because it's mostly about who slept with whom rather than each person trying to seduce the other. In Single's Inferno, due to Korea's conservative values, they're not sleeping with each other or kissing or cuddling. So to seduce each other, they have to rely on words and non-sexual actions. It's very refreshing for me but also very interesting to watch the strategies that they use.

I will not be super specific to not spoil anyone who wants to watch however I may spoil a few events from episode 1 to episode 4, so read at your own risk.

*What we can learn from the 4 girls on the show:*

* **Song Jia**

I think Song Jia is by far the contestant be it male or female that we should all learn from. She has the most suitors on the show due to 1) her pretty doll-like looks and high fashion. 2) her personality and how she handles people in general.

When Jia arrived on the island, she caught everyone's eyes by wearing luxurious clothes and being very put together. However, many men said they thought she was cold and aloof but were charmed when she started to smile and revealed unexpected charms. Later, they had to cook their own food and she was very helpful to everyone, showing a different side from the first impressions she gives. Even if she has the most suitors, she gets along with the other girls by being friendly and down-to-Earth with them. I think she would be less popular with the men and the women if she didn't have ***contrasting charms***.

What struck me the most was that she ALWAYS looked very good and very high maintenance. To the point that some of the other girls were asking each other if they should go back to their dorm to look more put together after seeing her arrive one morning. It shows that always looking your very best is vital and you shouldn't be afraid of 'dressing up'. She is also very confident which helps her carry her looks. The other thing that made her very popular with the men was that she was a smooth talker. She knew how to handle 3+ suitors at the same time by not committing to any of them yet still pacifying them. One guy complained that she's not paying enough attention to him, she answered with a sweet smile ""I'll take care more of you then"". She resolves conflict with sweetness and lightness.

Another thing to note is that you never ever see her chasing a man on this show. Instead, men chase her like crazy. It's always the men who come to her, try to steal her away from a talk etc. There are some men who aren't interested in her but she's ignoring them. She's not trying to change their mind and only entertain the men who come to her. Some men even joked that others call them ""puppies"" for following her around. Song Jia and her suitors are the proof of ""if he wanted to, he would"".

&amp;#x200B;

* **Kang Soyeon**

Kang Soyeon is the older, fit female contestant with a tan. She's not really abiding by Korea's beauty standards with her tan nonetheless she gets the attention of some men at first. She's very confident and has a lot of charisma. At first, I thought she would another female contestant to take notes from but she quickly turned into a pickme when the guy she was hanging with during the early episodes switched up on her and started to pursue another female contestant. I love her but she did everything wrong.

She's the living proof that 1) you should never chase men. The men she chased either fled from her or took her for granted and went on to explore their other options 2) if a man you're entertaining starts waving his options in your face, don't react. Instead go explore your options without chasing. She did explore her other options but ended up chasing another guy and it ended very terribly for her with that guy (won't go into details).

Her original desirability plummeted when she started chasing those two guys and after that she just clinged to one guy who's not committed to her only. That guy started off with no woman picking him on day 1 because he was aloof and didn't talk to them - despite this guy being very handsome. Then after sulking the whole night and being hurt by the rejection, the next day, he started pursuing Soyeon like crazy. Once he 'secured' her and knew she would pick him on day 2, he then started to pursue other women. There are many men like this in the wild - which shows that even if a guy is pursuing you aggressively, you should always explore your other options and not commit to him until he has proven that he's serious about you after time and efforts have been spent on his part. Now it's very sad to see how he's toying with her and have her at his beck and call.

* **Shin Jiyeon**

Shin Jiyeon started off as the second most popular girl on the show due to her meeting the Korean beauty standards. However, as time went on, her number of suitors slowly diminished. The Jiyeon/Jia parallel is very interesting to make. I personally think Jiyeon the archetype of the girl-next-door/nice girl while Jia is more similar to the 'bitch'. At first, most men picked her because she was the 'innocent' type, however some men switched to Jia even though she's not their 'type'. I feel like it's a case of men having a type they usually go for (and have success with) vs a type they don't usually go for because they know they're likely going to get rejected. Jiyeon is the safe choice, Jia is the risky gamble.

However she still had some suitors and I would say she handled them well at first. Then sadly after, when a new guy expressed interest in her, she started 'subtly-but-not-so-subtly' chasing him - which got her no result. I would say about her the same thing I would say about Soyeon: don't panic if a suitor no longer show interest and don't chase other men because you won't get good results and you might come off as desperate. Ironically, there's one guy who's into her but she's not into him. However, this guy chases her so so hard to the point where you wonder if he has some dark triad personality traits. While I think this guy is creepy AF, it also shows that not chasing a guy is what gets the best results. The guys she wants are not paying attention to her, but the guy she doesn't want won't leave her alone. The chase and male ego are real, fam.

&amp;#x200B;

* **An Yeawon**

An Yeawon is the least popular girl on the show, having no suitor. I actually like her and I think she has a funny personality. However, I believe that she's not getting attention due to being on the plainer side and coming off more like a 'buddy' than a 'girlfriend'. But I think it's more of a case of not being anyone's type on the show. However, despite not getting any attention, I like that she didn't start chasing men. Though there was one guy she kept choosing as her favorite until he chose her back (because no other girl liked him) so he could go to the luxury hotel. During their date, she did come off as 'trying too hard' by telling him she liked how similar they were, that she felt like he was a shining light in the middle of nowhere when the guy didn't praise her like that. She did let go of him after that day and moved on, which is the thing to do in this situation.

TL;DR: everything FDS talks about is verified on this show. It's very nice to study how the men and women move in a show about seduction. ***Never chase a man and if he wanted to, he would.***",347.0
51,t3_ru6gg1,I Met My Friend's LVM During The Holidays,"I moved to a new city and became friends with a woman that lives near me. We were friends for about 3 months and had fun talking/doing things together. It felt promising. All was good until she invites me to a get-together with her friend.

Since starting my growth journey, I've cut off women that have male ""friends"". But, I made an exception because she's known him for 6 years and swore he was a good guy.

Let's count the red flags:

üö©When I arrived he asked nothing about me. 

üö©He repeatedly asked what time I was leaving and joked that I should leave sooner. 

üö©He mentioned having a friend that lived in my hometown. I asked where - he responded - then I said that place was further north than I've been. He ""corrected"" me and said it was southü§î (which it's not). He also kept correcting my friend about miniscule details.

üö©He was rude to the waitress!! While she was tallying the check, he teased her about being ""horrible"". He claimed it was a joke only AFTER I apologized and said she was wonderful to usüôÑ

üö©Whenever I'd insert a comment, he'd roll his eyes, mock me, or tell me to listen because he wasn't finished talking. After a few attempts I stopped trying. He did the same thing if my friend tried having an aside conversation. If I spoke - he looked at her and made faces at me. 

üö©He was a self-proclaimed history buff. The entire conversation was one-sided. It consisted of him telling us everything we apparently didn't know about Rembrandt, Degas, and Western governments. He negged my friend with *you don't know about that, right* and *look it up on Google*. She gave up and said *yeah, you know more than me*.

üö©This guy complained about cooking for my friend (when he visits her houseü§¢) Ridiculed women for spending time on their appearance. He even made comments about white men using WOC prostitutes. Yes, he's white (she is too). And yes I'm a WOC. 

üö©üö©üö©üö©The real kicker is she's 28 and he's 45 ü§°ü§°. I shit you not. They work at the same company and met when she was hired.

TBH, I blocked her when I got home. Then I cried because it hurt to be treated that way. I felt so stupid. I was out of town, and even flew back in to see her. She didn't care that he was rude. All she did was half-heartedly tell him to stop when he mocked me. Like, wtf. This old fucker is hovering until she has sex with him. Or until he can coerce her. If he hasn't already.

Let this be a cautionary tale to ***never*** be friends with women that don't exhibit STRONG boundaries with men.",1097.0

I was wondering how I should proceed with dating this man when omicron is so prevalent and easily spreads.

He works in healthcare. We both live in a major U.S city. We went on a first date on Dec. 15, then the holidays came. During Christmas week he said he wanted to make plans with me and suggested a few date ideas I was interested in. Then omicron started surging and plans went awry. 

He recently expressed that he wanted to take me out on a second date, but thinks it‚Äôs safer for me to stay home for now because omicron is so bad considering he knows the situation in hospitals first-hand. To this I responded that we can reschedule, and to just let me know‚Äîhe agreed and said he will. This conversation was 5 days ago. 

(Side info: We‚Äôve had BRIEF on and off contact ever since that conversation, nothing crazy. I avoid over-texting because I prefer talking face-to-face. He did mention he likes communicating with people he cares about through text/fact-time and even asked my preference in getting to know each other‚Äîwhich is in-person for me). 

Should I wait for him to initiate the 2nd date? I feel omicron is a legit reason for people to not want to meet up, but it shouldn‚Äôt stop someone from at least trying to make plans for when it‚Äôs agreed to be safe to meet again.

But this is specifically and only about physical appearance, women in the west(not just white but black and hispanic as well) do not realize how awful looking men from non-western nations on a civilization level can become, you see men from my home country here are 100% guaranteed to find a virgin, submissive housewife, this guarantee basically means that men don't even bother 

They do not exercise(like there is no even concept of recreation exercise), they do not groom themselves, they do not bathe, they only sports they play do not burn any calories and they lay about mostly all day 


This isn't racial of course, its just a combination of high birth rates and extreme misogyny that views daughters as worthless that produces the ideal environment for arranged marriages 

If a similar set of cultural factors were in the west they'd be just as bad in terms of appearance

Just imagine 9/10 of the males you meet being skinny-fat i.e small pot belly's that wobble when they walk, spindly arms and legs and almost no muscle tone, most can't grow proper beards but they try anyway without proper grooming(so its appears as a mass of pubes) and 90% of them wear polo shirts will ill fitting pants,",429.0

56,t3_rszh8l,Remembering Valentina Grigoryeva: 1 Year Anniversary of Being Murdered by Youtuber Boyfriend,"December 2021 marks the 1 year anniversary of 28-year-old Muscovite Valentina Grigoryeva killed by her boyfriend on livestream. RIP Valentina.

Big Tech (YouTube, Google, Facebook etc.) routinely ignores video and disturbing images of violence against women and children: r@pe, revenge p0rn, p0rn etc. While Facebook, Twitter and Google executives have been called before the U.S. Senate on Section 230 hearings regarding their moderation policies, not much has been done to protect women and children on Big Tech platforms. Big Tech takes millions in American tax subsidies every year and its attitude towards vulnerable people remains one of hatred or at best, apathy.

One YouTube ""trashstream"" channel run by Russian Stansilav Reshetnikov contained videos of Stas pepper spraying his girlfriend Valentina in exchange for monetary requests / donations. ""Stas Reeflay"" would call Valentina a prostitute, smelly, yet his channel remained up and monetized. In early December 2020, one anonymous donor sent Stas $1000 USD to strip Valentina down, attack her and throw her outside, locking the door behind him. Stas accepted.

One of Valentina's female friends was also in Stas' apartment at the time. She personally watched as Stas ripped off Valentina's clothes, stripping her to her underwear. Valentina was then physically attacked by Stas to the point that Valentina grabbed a knife from the kitchen to defend herself. Stas grabbed Valentina, threw her onto the freezing cold balcony outside in Moscow's winter weather, and locked her there. Valentina was in the early stages of pregnancy (this has been both confirmed and denied). For two hours Valentina hammered on the door and asked to be let inside. Valentina's female friend did not assist her and left the apartment. After two hours, Stas opened the door and dragged Valentina's lifeless body inside. In the livestream, Valentina's body is visibly limp and pale. Stas cooed to her, calling her ""my bunny"", and asking her to wake up. Despite this, Stas beat her earlier that day. Multiple bruises on her head and body were found. A viewer (the livestream was still ongoing, apparently not violating any YouTube rules) called emergency services.

Valentina froze to death in the subzero temperatures. She also sustained blunt force trauma to her head and body. Stas is still awaiting sentencing in Russia, but his mother and sisters have attended trial and asserted he could not be violent to anyone (EYEROLL). YouTube, to my knowledge, never banned the anonymous donor who encouraged violence, nor made a statement on its policies after this multi-hour livestream.

To anyone reading this from outside the FDS platform --- this woman supported her boyfriend's channel with her own pain. She was young, beautiful and supportive. A man she trusted, relied on and loved destroyed her for money from a stranger. What more could she have done? What kind of sacrifices do you expect from women, when there are so many stories like Valentina's? Someone who calls themselves a man and then prioritizes money from a stranger over their own girlfriend is no man.

57,t3_rswsqr,"looking men in the eye, and being receptive vs naturally feeling defensive -- how do you navigate this?","From the parking lot stalking/predator thread, an FDS queen said this:

smm1892: ""I have realized that since FDS I rarely even look men in the eye when I‚Äôm walking or commuting (have lived in NYC, CDMX, etc.) because it has just led to such harassment when you accidentally smile or say good morning. Sad that you can only be friendly to other women and men you‚Äôve known for years!""

So much this. From growing up in a female body for the last 50+ years, having been married for 25 years, having endured way too damn many fatphobic slurs from childhood into my 30s, it's next to impossible to look a man in the eye anymore. There's just no reason to. I don't want to risk getting assaulted, raped, murdered, mostly; I also just don't want my time wasted. I want to go out, move at my own speed, do whatever I want to do, and just be invisible.

That said, instincts kick in, and I think we all can tell when we're being stared at, and at that point, I stare back pretty aggressively, and even though it's a risk, I'm ready to confront, and I hope men pick up on this energy. I'm always loaded for bear when I go outdoors anyway. It's been years and years since I've gotten the ""fat hate"" look or any comments, but my FFG (former fat girl) self is still very much with me, and always will be, partly as a way to be more compassionate to myself, and to be compassionate to other fat women.

My issue is this: I love to get out and walk either in a local park, or at the gym. How do you navigate being spoken to? I vaccilate between not wanting my attention jerked away from whatever I'm doing or listening to (READ THE SIGNALS), and just saying hello, acknowledging someone, and leaving it at that. And it's a case-by-case thing: I've finally decided that if I'm not looking at a man, and he says hello, I ignore. If I \*happen\* to be looking in his direction, and I feel like it, I'll say hi and just keep on walking. Most of the time I say ""hi"" in a flat voice, no smile, or give a sarcastic little wave like, yeah, okay hi whatever.

But then, how do you ever signal that it's okay to approach? A small smile, slightly extended eye contact is all I got. I've noticed as I've aged, married and been happy, I absolutely don't smile at any man unless I can tell in an instant that I'm attracted, and his energy feels good. Out in public, that for me equates to 99.99999% of the time, DO NOT APPROACH, do not talk to me. I also fully admit that I'm a short white woman, and I carry an aura of ""you don't bother me, I won't bother you"" in public. My attitude is, I see you, we don't \*have\* to interact, just be cool, pass on by.

More and more I'm convinced from everything I've read here on FDS, meeting men in the wild out in public just isn't a thing and if it does happen, it's vanishingly rare that it would ever result in an actual relationship. Meet men in social groups like church, community, a shared hobby first.

58,t3_rsvjbs,As funny as this sounds it's really hard to find men who actually like sex,"Men prefer masterbating (but with women's bodies instead of their own hand). 

""Good sex"" to men is about dOmInAtInG and degrading women. I.e: using a human sex toy. They want women to be vulnerable and to make the right porn faces and sounds. They claim this is because ""eNtHusSiAsM"" matters so much. But that's a lie. It doesn't matter at all. They just want a performance to masturbate to. For example if a woman's genuine pleasure is silent? A man will complain that she's too vanilla. Compare that to a pickme who fake screams (while secretly feeling nothing at all). He'll consider the fake squealing to be ""eNtHusiAsm"" and the quiet orgasm to be a ""dead bedroom"" üôÉ. So it's a lie. 

It's so hot when men can let go and be in the moment and be vulnerable (looking stupid, making weird noises, saying sweet things instead of porn things, being submissive). When I first met my bf I told him I was ""demisexual"" (it's a long story, I was confused) ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and he rightly thought that was ridiculous. Because it turns out I just like mutual pleasure, equal vulnerability and actual connection. Aka what sex IS. And I don't like to masterbated with. That's not ""demisexual"" though, that's sex.

As I'm sure you've already heard somewhere, Che and Miranda finally hooked up on last night's episode of And Just Like That. Now, I'm straight and a fan of early Grey's Anatomy-era Sara Ramirez, so I can't stand the Che character. It's a bunch of woke stereotypes mashed up to me. But I still loved the sex scene (minus Carrie's bit lol) because it was so unlike anything you ever see on tv. Two unconventionally attractive women, one 40-something, one close to 60, having sex which wasn't we traditionally think of as sex. The focus on consent and female pleasure was \*chef's kiss\*. Naturally, I was curious what other people thought. I'm relatively sexually conservative for a millennial and I figured I could appreciate the scene, it must be all hearts and roses for it online. WRONG. A couple of pundits gave it some woke points, but I saw every complaint possible leveled at this scene, including people saying it was disgusting, juvenile, and-get this- vulgar. Vulgar was the one  I saw most often. There were also lots of complaints that it glorified adultery since Miranda was cheating on Steve. Let's unpack all that, shall we?

Vulgar? What a ridiculous, specious complaint. The original show was called Sex and the City, for God's sake. Graphic sex scenes were par for the course. I mean, I've seen Kim Cattrall's boobs as often as my own, maybe more. You saw nothing here. Miranda stayed fully clothed, Che, too. All sex was suggested. Great acting. If they meant vulgar in terms of content, Samantha had multiple threesomes, Charlotte attempted a threesome, Carrie had a bf who wanted her to pee on him, I could go on all day. What's the problem now? As for cheating as a moral issue, Samantha slept with married men early and often and Carrie's affair with Big was a linch pin in the series. Not to mention that Steve cheated on Miranda in the first movie because they hadn‚Äôt had sex in six months and everyone, including her supposed best friends were basically telling her to get over it. What's the difference?

The difference was this was the only sex scene in the series a dick wasn't front and center. Even when Samantha was a lesbian for a hot minute, the writers had to introduce a strap-on into the mix-after Samantha complained about missing dick. But for as progressive as the show was on sex in many ways, it was still penis-centered. The sex scenes mostly focused on PIV with few exceptions and guys who liked it any other way were labelled freaks (like Mr. Pussy). And of course, even though this show is geared towards women, all the sex was geared toward men. We saw the women stars of the show half naked or more than half naked throughout the series. We barely saw the men's bodies. The women performed, showing off their flexibility and prowess. The men lay there. And the rare times there was no man on-screen, like with Samantha and Maria, the scene still catered to men. Two beautiful, conventionally attractive women in lingerie doing feminine things. The moment that wasn't the case, the sex scene was labelled aberrant. It‚Äôs amazing how what men consider sexually attractive is supposed to be universal. The funny thing is real women are living the sex scenes from the original series every day-going home with virtual strangers, having sex with next to no foreplay, and this sex is focused on jackhammer PIV. This is what is normalized, but I‚Äôm sure very very few women would say that it‚Äôs satisfying. But yesterday‚Äôs scene, full of sensual touch as well as sexual touch (AFTER permission was asked for and granted), kisses and alternatives to PIV, I‚Äôm sure was appealing to many women but has been dismissed by almost all men. Interesting how that works. Men would rather perform what they think is sexually attractive on women‚Äôs bodies, whether or not we get anything out of it, rather than actually please us. And if they have a scene like this which could be a kind of guide as to what women might find more helpful, they dismiss it.",180.0

I love that there's no gossip or drama, both of which are very prevalent in American work culture. 

Ever since I've started this new job I've had absolutely no interest in dating. I went from having little interest to ZERO interest.

I don't need one but it's nice to have an extra bit of money to throw into crypto and other investments every month. I think it's a combination of FDS and a good job that makes me feel fulfilled. At this point choosing to date might make me jeopardize my career. 

I do need to work on leveling up in other areas of my life. But I had to start by landing a well paying job with a healthy work environment. I found when I worked in an abusive environment, I was more likely to date. Perhaps it was unconsciously done to fill the void and have a distraction from the hell I was going through at work.

I had an unfortunately very shocking and scary interaction with a man tonight and I believe my instincts and quick-thinking saved me from a dangerous situation. I wanted to share my story in the hopes that some of my tips can help keep you all safe.

I went to the mall this evening and then out to pick up sushi takeout for dinner. When I pulled into the restaurant's parking lot, I had the strangest feeling. The restaurant is located right on the border of my town (upscale northeastern suburb) and our closest city which has severely deteriorated for a few years and even more due to pandemic crime. I am always conscious of people walking around, but I usually sit in my car and finish my song / browse on my phone before going in. Tonight, however, I felt very uneasy and kept looking out my window with the music off.

When I looked up again, there was suddenly a man outside of the driver's side window. He gestured wildly to the front of my car and without missing a beat, I hit the button to lock my doors and windows. I drive a nice SUV and as soon as you get into the car and turn it on, the doors and windows are already locked to the outside, so I was safe even without this. The point I want to make here is that my instincts told me that something was immediately off about the situation. I had no idea what the man had said, if he'd even said anything while gesturing, but my mind just identified the facts of the situation (dark parking lot, strange man, me alone), and I began thinking of ways to escape and keep myself safe.

He immediately began screaming at me for locking my doors and how I was a bitch and he wasn't trying to do anything to me. I stared straight ahead and did not turn my car off, prepared to reverse and flee the situation. He eventually walked away but slowly, continually looking back at my car to make sure that I was still sitting there, shellshocked and afraid. I wanted to cry and then I got so angry because I wished I could get out and scream back.

Instead of getting out immediately, I called the restaurant and explained what was going on before asking if my food was ready. I was prepared to ask them to come out to the car rather than me getting out if the man did not move sufficiently far away.

I continued watching the man cross into other parking lots, looking in car windows. When he came to another car with passengers in it, he waved his arms by the front bumper like he had done to me before approaching the driver's side window. **I knew then that I had absolutely been right in my instincts that something was off.**  This man had either been planning to rob people or to hurt them, but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the fear I felt in being approached by an unfamiliar man.

When I finally deemed him far enough away in another lot, I moved my car to the front door like two feet from the entrance and went in to pick up my food. Before I left, I stared out the doors to make sure nobody was there before I ran into my car, locked the doors, and drove quickly away.

As I drove home, I was so grateful that nothing worse had happened to me, but I was also so shocked because I have never experienced such violent aggression from a man before. I really wanted to share my story here to reaffirm what so many women in our community say: we must unfortunately always be cautious and trying to protect ourselves; there is no such thing anymore as an abundance of caution with the amount of dangerous men we are surrounded by.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Never respond to men's inquiries for directions and/or car issues. Men never ask women for directions (more frequently they will ask other men) and most people have smart phones with mapping capabilities, so please always be suspicious about this. You are under no obligation to help them, and the worst case scenario for them is having to wait for help/directions while our worst case scenario is that he might hurt us. Not comparable at all.
2. Similar to the above, absolutely never roll your car windows down when men approach. I'll never know what this particular man's plans were, but had I rolled my windows down presuming something was wrong with my car or he needed help, he could have struck me in the face or threatened me. Keep your windows up and be prepared to drive away.
3. Survey a potentially dangerous situation and think about entrances, exits, and potential hiding places. I moved my car closer to the restaurant because I wanted to be sure he could not be crouching down in front of it or something to surprise me and I wanted to be sure that if I needed to run, I would only have a short distance to my car.
4. Always trust your instincts. I have never suddenly ended up in a bad situation with no feelings of unease beforehand. Your instincts are designed to keep you safe and you cannot ignore these warning signs. 

All in all, I just want to thank all of you ladies in this community, and I hope that this serves as a reminder to trust yourself in all situations and put your safety and security above everything else. Much love, queens! ‚ù§Ô∏è",380.0

# ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a man of simple pleasures‚Äô: I live with my girlfriend, 59, who owns several homes and has saved $3 million. I pay utilities and cable, and do repairs. Is that enough?

**‚ÄòShe regularly complains about what certain things are costing her for the maintenance and repair of her properties.‚Äô**  


#### Dear Quentin,

I think I am being more than fair relative to sharing expenses while living in my girlfriend‚Äôs house, but I could use a little perspective.

My 59-year-old retired girlfriend is well-off. Her lakefront home with an extra buildable lot, her Florida condo, and her residential and commercial rental properties are all paid off, and she has over $3 million in cash and investments. She is also collecting alimony from her ex for a few more years.

I am 62 and employed, and have just under $1 million in cash and investments. I have no debt other than a car lease, I manage my finances prudently, and I‚Äôm a man of simple pleasures.

I moved in with her a few years ago, and believe in paying my fair share of the daily expenses and contributing to running the household. I pay all the utilities and cable, try to contribute an equal amount toward the groceries, and do a substantial amount of work around the house, namely various handyman activities (replace a faucet, fix the dryer, etc.) and landscape upkeep, as well as minor property improvements for which I willingly contribute to the cost.¬†

These improvements have added value to her home. I do a lot of minor repairs at her rental properties and coordinate contractor work on her behalf since I‚Äôm good at making sure things are done right and that she gets what she pays for. I spring for most meals and entertainment, and am happy to do so. We typically share the cost of travel.

*‚ÄòWhen there is an expensive repair or the tax bills come around, she stresses and then focuses on me, saying that I should contribute more financially since I don‚Äôt have separate home expenses.‚Äô*¬†

I realize that I am saving money by not having the expense of a separate home, and am grateful for the opportunity to live in her beautiful home and thereby further build my retirement nest egg.

Given our markedly different financial circumstances, I think it best to keep our estates separate, and she is in agreement. I do not expect anything from her estate should I outlive her and have made that clear to her.

Here‚Äôs the rub. She regularly complains about what certain things are costing her for the maintenance and repair of her properties and the things she owns (boat, vehicles, etc.), yet she spends freely and impulsively, with many of the things she buys falling by the wayside because they weren‚Äôt what she expected or really wanted.

I see this as simply wasteful spending and think that if she were really that concerned about her financial future, she would change her spending habits. Many of the property repairs are due to her bad choices in the past ‚Äî which she admits to ‚Äî in hiring friends or acquaintances who do poor work with no oversight.

When there is an expensive repair or the tax bills come around, she stresses and then focuses on me, saying that I should contribute more financially since I don‚Äôt have separate home expenses.

In my opinion, any maintenance or repair costs associated with things she owns are her responsibility, as they are for me. I would think the same if our circumstances were reversed ‚Äî if I own it, it‚Äôs my responsibility. I have several friends, both male and female, who live with their partners, and they manage things the same way as I think they should be managed. What do you think?

More from Me

 

#### Dear More,

Your letter and situation are both simple and complicated. They‚Äôre simple because you already have the answer in the palm of your hand, if you choose to see it. They‚Äôre complicated because you need to come to a solution that suits both parties. Currently, from what you say in your letter, your arrangement appears to suit you more than it suits your girlfriend.¬†

The simple part: She has told you what she wants. She thinks it would be fairer if you paid more toward your living expenses. Call it rent, although I understand that ‚Äúrent‚Äù seems like a dirty word in a relationship, particularly as it suggests an imbalance of power (landlord/tenant) and a temporary rather than permanent arrangement.¬†

She may tell you this when she is stressed out, but sometimes people only have the gumption to say what they really feel or what‚Äôs been preying on their mind during heated discussions. Is it a healthy way to communicate and talk about important issues? No. But does it mean that she does not wish you to contribute more? No, again.¬†

*‚ÄòIntentionally or not, you risk justifying your own wish to to shore up your retirement savings by telling yourself that your girlfriend has plenty of money, which she spends willfully.‚Äô*

The complicated part: how you contribute to the household, and the disparity in your economic statuses. As for the former, you ‚Äúearn your keep‚Äù by carrying out repairs, knowing that these handyman tasks have a monetary value. You are happy to help out and ‚Äî intentionally or not ‚Äî you are deducting those tasks from an imaginary rent.

Ask your girlfriend if you can give her advice about her purchases. (It‚Äôs always better to ask if you can open the door to unsolicited advice before weighing in.) As I told [the woman who wanted to buy the $30,000 bracelet](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/i-have-a-first-world-problem-i-earn-500k-and-have-1-million-in-assets-should-i-buy-a-30k-bracelet-during-a-global-pandemic-2021-05-05?mod=article_inline), we often buy stuff believing it will fill an emotional or spiritual vacuum in our lives. When it doesn‚Äôt, we buy more.¬†

But those two issues ‚Äî your contributions and your girlfriend‚Äôs spending habits ‚Äî are separate issues. It‚Äôs a mistake to conflate the two. Intentionally or not, you risk justifying your own wish to to shore up your retirement savings by telling yourself that your girlfriend has plenty of money, which she sometimes spends unwisely and willfully.

So what do you do now? You acknowledge that resolving financial dilemmas such as this will ‚Äî hopefully ‚Äî make your communication skills and relationship stronger. Ask your girlfriend what she believes would be a fair monthly contribution. If there is room for negotiation, you could come to an agreement on money and hiring capable repairpeople.

84,t3_rs1gt7,Criticism &amp; Men,"I keep seeing great FDS comments pointing out how criticizing a man earned them the title ""high maintenance"" or how criticizing a man sent him into a rage. Constructive criticism is KEY to leveling up. Every single person can benefit from a well-timed comment. I am not referring to constant commentary, judgmental remarks and mean-spirited jibes but a well-meaning observation. HVW and HVM are able to incorporate reasonable criticism into self-betterment and self-reflection. NVM/LVM will turn any well-meant observation against you. Criticism can be a good vetting strategy as NVM/ LVM and HVM will respond differently to it.

To recap:

* Criticizing LVM/NVM can cause meltdowns, tantrums, pouting, silent treatments, passive aggressive behavior. This can happen in any setting, professional or personal. Your male coworker who always ""forgets"" to make changes to a project after you pointed out his mistakes? Yeah. Your bf who pouts for days after you pointed out he never folds his clothes that are on the floor? These extreme responses to a normal part of humanity makes you feel like you can't be honest or expressive with these people. Because you are shut out from a basic tenet of civilized conversation, this can be the start to a communication breakdown. 
* Criticizing LVM/NVM can cause retaliation / vengeful remarks. Low value people are usually incapable of looking honestly and clearly at their own behavior and asking ""what did I do wrong?"" ""What could I do better?"" Instead they will lash out. 
* Criticizing LVM/NVM lands you in a world of hurt. All of a sudden, you're a ""nag"", you're ""too harsh"", you're ""mean"". He's ""walking on eggshells"", he's ""scared of you"", he hates that you're ""high maintenance"". If Don Draper or Leonardo diCaprio said it, it'd be ""king advice"". If you say it, you're a brutal nagging hag. 
* LVM/NVM will gang up to criticize *women* and not other men. Men ragging on each other has been shown to inspire bonding and self-growth. Men can get a lot out of criticizing other men. So why do LVM/NVM choose to criticize women, out of which they can gain nothing positive? It seems to stem from weakness, and not truly wanting to better themselves. 

I spent a lot of time learning how to criticize *better.* I figured I was the problem with LVM / NVM having meltdowns anytime I had something critical to say. I learned how to use ""I think"" or ""I feel"" instead of making accusatory remarks. I learned how to identify what was important enough for me to bring up and what wasn't. I learned how to organize my thoughts first before saying anything at all. I learned how to not send paragraphs of text. I learned how to LEAVE. And you know what? IT DID NOT MATTER. Men responded to whatever they felt like, which included when I would lose it and call them out. Again, we say, nice for what?!

85,t3_rs11ta,"Early warning signs to spot ""avoidants"" and... avoid them?","I just recently discovered the description of ""avoidant attatchment"" and while I understand attachment theory is to be taken with a grain of salt, I also understand that I want to be able to spot asap and avoid people who display those traits.

In hindsight, my most recent ex showed warning signs of this but I didn't recognise them and wasted way too much time on him.

For example, he was a bit of a hermit, living off the grid and needing lots of alone time. I didn't identify it as a red flag because I'm also very independent and need my alone time so I was too busy living my life when he pulled away to notice something was off.

I guess I could have spotted it as hot/cold behaviour instead of healthy independence if I'd paid more attention, due to it being paired with his mood swings and inconsistent affection levels. I might be busy and independent but my affection remains consistent.

A past history of short relationships should have been a glaring sign, too.

87,t3_rrut8f,The Dangers Pick Mes Pose to FDS Women,"\*This was originally a comment on the post about Ghislaine Maxwell I was encouraged to turn into a post. \* I disagree with the women who think pick me isn‚Äôt the right word to describe Maxwell. ‚ÄúPick me‚Äù is a starting place, not a destination. It‚Äôs a mindset and there‚Äôs no limit to it. That girl last year who helped her boyfriend r@pe and dispose of her Spelman roommate because she said no to a threesome with the LV boyfriend was a pick me. She started out being willing to facilitate a threesome because she thought it would keep the boyfriend interested in her longer, but she was willing to do anything for his attention and approval, including m@rdering an innocent young woman. It starts as attention seeking but it almost always ends as something worse. The other day a woman here on FDS talked about how she took nudes at 50 as just a self empowerment thing. Well, she had a friend of hers take the nudes, and asked her to delete them afterwards. Really her friend sent them to her husband and when the FDS woman confronted her about that she said she sends all of her friends‚Äô nudes to her husband! There‚Äôs not a doubt in my mind that one day this woman‚Äôs husband will not be satisfied with only nudes and she will be glad to serve up her friends to her husband by drugging them or manipulating them.

Deborrah Cooper talked about this phenomenon. She said to be careful who you share your personal information with because a lot of women will run back to their boyfriends or husbands and tell them every personal thing about you-what you like in bed, your personal traumas, if you‚Äôve had an abortion-anything these men can use to manipulate you or hold over your head to force you into doing things. Watch the news. You‚Äôll see in a lot of these tax schemes or ‚Äúrandom‚Äùrobberies, it was women‚Äôs supposed best friends who set them up. How many women had their so-called friends set them up to get r@ped or abused? This is absolutely the endpoint of Pick Me-ism.

Competition between women (or imagined competition between women) is rooted in misogyny. The other woman is most often jealous of some perceived male attention that her friend is getting. She‚Äôs envious that her friend is considered prettier or sexier or more conventionally attractive or some thing. So in order to undercut her friends perceived betterness and get that male attention back for herself she is willing to do anything. Sometimes that means she will perform an act, she‚Äôll be willing to be more sexually explicit or adventurous, take more abuse or have sex more often. But often it also means she‚Äôs willing to make her friend more vulnerable so that the man in question can take her down and she will no longer be seen as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. It is vital that FDS women understand this because you need to realize a woman in your life who is a pick me is not just a danger to herself, she‚Äôs a danger to YOU!

Yes, on the most basic, banal level this is the type of woman who will sabotage you by attempting to seduce your SO or somehow ruining your appearance but if she goes unchecked and she‚Äôs damaged enough, this woman will plot your r@pe or m@rder. There have been news stories in America of damaged pick mes carrying out acid attacks on their friends. Remember, men want what they can‚Äôt have and they‚Äôre obsessed with they can‚Äôt control. You don‚Äôt have to be doing anything, but if you‚Äôre carrying yourself like an FDS HV woman with self-control, self-esteem and not settling for less, you will automatically become a target for most of the LV or ZV men in your pick me friends‚Äô life. And trust me, she will be more than happy to give him insider information to help take you down a peg or two because she already feels you think you‚Äôre above her. Instead of parsing whether or not Maxwell is a pick me, women here need to be learning from the situation and cleansing their friend circle. Pretty much every major empire that ever fell was taken down from the inside. They may have fallen prey to a coup by up-and-comers, but someone on the inside gave them the keys to the kingdom. It‚Äôs highly unlikely that a woman here, trained in FDS ways is going to let an LV or abusive man into her life. But by keeping pick mes around, you‚Äôre doing just that! You are making yourself vulnerable and they will come into your life riding her coattails in the person of her brothers or her boyfriends. If these women will give these men their money, their time, their self worth, and their bodies not to be left alone, what makes you think they won‚Äôt offer up yours?!",459.0

90,t3_rrq9nw,Sons of single mothers = a huge red flag,"Before you jump down my throat, let me give some major disclaimers. I understand that no one can choose their parents. I understand that there's a global epidemic of deadbeat scrotes who refuse to properly father their children. I also understand that when marriages and relationships fail, women are often forced to take on the overwhelmingly responsibilities of solo childrearing AND being the sole breadwinner. *I don't hate single mothers or their children.*

That said, **if a man tells you that his father was absent during some or all of his childhood, I'd strongly advise you to run in the opposite direction**. Why?

* **Reason # 1: Emotional incest.** Many single mothers view their adult sons as pseudo-husbands. You're not her daughter-in-law, you're a love rival, and she's jealous. My ex's mom (yes, this is fully an ex-blasting post) was a giant pick-me who had an incestuously-charged relationship with my ex. She told him about her sex life in graphic detail and leaned on him for emotional support because she had no partner or friends her own age. This is a common, well-documented psychological phenomenon called *parent-child enmeshment*, and although it can happen in any family, single-parent households seem to be particularly vulnerable. Stay away, sis!
* **Reason # 2: Financial infidelity.** Adult sons of single mothers often feel enormous pressure to send money to their mom, and he'll do it sneakily if you don't approve. How much money? This varies, but my older sister's husband used to send his unemployed mother a secret ""allowance"" that was roughly 1/3 of his monthly paycheck. When my sister found out, she was furious, but it still took her years to convince him to stop sending money to his mom. This man truly saw no problem with taking food out of the mouths of his wife and young children to pay his mommy's mortgage.
* **Reason # 3: Anger issues.** Men from all walks of life can be (and often are) angry and violent, but sons of absent fathers are *angry at the world* in a way I find deeply unsettling. He also might resent the fact that you grew up in a stable, two-parent household (if you did) and treat you poorly because of it.
* **Reason # 4: He'll expect you to be supermommy.** Many of these men think it's a flex that their mom worked 60+ hours a week to make ends meet whilst taking care of small children.  They'll say things like, ""my mom sacrificed everything for me"" and ""my mom is a force of nature"", when in reality, their mothers were overworked, exploited, and exhausted. Do you really want to marry a man whose idea of love is simply labor exploitation??

Anything to add here, FDSers? Would love to hear your stories about dating the sons of absent fathers. I'd also love for single mothers of adult sons to jump into the comments and tell their side of the story.

Edit: Seeing some angry comments already. Let's keep things civil!

Edit # 2: Disappointed by the standard-shaming in the comments. This is against FDS Rule #9 in the sidebar. Remember that women are allowed to reject men for literally any reason, no matter how arbitrary :)

Edit # 3: Are there dating strategy subreddits explicitly for *childless* women? Think I may need to move there. Childless women are allowed to vet men ruthlessly. We are allowed to act in our own best interest, even if it hurts your feelings.

Edit #4: This post isn't about single mothers. It's about their angry, violent, maladjusted adult sons. If that doesn't describe your son, great, but please don't prevent women from sharing our experiences. Women are getting downvoted for detailing our abuse at the hands of these men.

What's maddening is the fact that there are idiots that admittedly want to protect him but if the shoe were on the other foot, these bottom-dwellers would definitely throw a woman under the bus simply because of her voice or what she wears.

What gets me is, 1)How are you 27 and can't tell the difference between a teenager and an adult? 2)You didn't bother to ask her age because you didn't CARE. 3)This is textbook peverted attraction to females that look like teens (in this case she actually was a teen). 

Also the comments are a cesspool in my opinion. They are basically saying that the age of consent there is 16, so he ""did nothing wrong."" Oh yea, let's conveniently forget the fact that he basically coerced a drunk female into his bed. That's wrong no matter what the age. They are also jumping immediately to ""it's a scam! she's scamming you!"" And also ""6 weeks? She could have had sex with anyone else in that time period, get a paternity test!"". Well, uneducated males, you don't know you are actually pregnant UNTIL 4-6 weeks pass, because you have to miss your period first to get a hunch that something ain't right.

The only one with sense in this is the father, who  wants to see him rot in prison. Which to that I agree. **The fact that he is conveniently forgetting that 17 is still not a legal adult,  and just because the aGe oF cOnSent is 16, it somehow absolves him of any crime; making this whole thing okay in his mind.** I truly find it all disgusting. Our young girls and young women truly are not safe in this culture. You are the adult man, you should have used better judgement. That's why I personally do not visit establishments like this (alone) because you never know what kind of mess you will run into. Wherever this girl is now, I hope she's okay and hope she gets justice.  (also, please forgive my struggle screenshots)

Ladies please be careful anywhere you go. Don't fall for any kind of slick talking, because when push comes to shove, they will just gaslight you into oblivion, and have their buddies stick up for them.

93,t3_rrlubb,Another post about Gold-digging/Sugar-babying,"Gold-digging/sugar-babying is a waste of your most valuable resource, ladies, which is your time &amp; attention. I admit that I'm coming from a place of privilege and never had debilitating debt or expenses that I felt I needed to grift my way thru or die trying. For the small number of cases where starvation is the alternative, go ahead and waste the money of foolish men if this is truly the best use of your time.

For the vast majority of us, dating or being in a relationship with a man for whom we have so little respect that we would scam him for money: please stop wasting your time. No trips, clothing and trinkets are worth wasting precious time that could be better spent enjoying the worthy company of a friend, family member, pet or HVM, or improving your situation yourself.

They say ""if you teach a man to fish, he'll eat for a day, but if you get in his will and poison his fish, you'll be set for a lifetime"". HAHAHAHAH, I jest... But in all seriousness, the time you spend to get educational certifications, teach yourself marketable job skills, budgeting and investing will pay off for you every day for the rest of your life. Not just the scant handful of years that Old Man Pennyworth is financing your nails and hair...

And I say hair and nails there deliberately, because the money a sugar daddy spends is intended to enhance HIS experience of YOU, not your own experience. He doesn't GAF if your dream is to go to Paris. That's not why he took you there. It's so he can brag to all his buddies how he fucked you in Paris. Anything he buys for you is so he can fuck you in/on/under/over/around it. Sisters, respect yourselves. These men think that because they pay for you time, they own you. You are worth more than that to us.

ETA: I made a response to a post that has since been deleted, but I wanted to clarify something: I am not, in any way, suggesting that a woman is wrong to date and vet men who are **HV to begin with** and decide that he needs to **also** be within a certain income/net worth range. Power to your standards.

I'm talking about a woman who, **at the expense of building herself up and personal safety/health,** pursues a relationship (or a child) with a wealthy LV man, with the express intention of securing a certain lifestyle for herself/her child, I have to be honest: I do not respect a decision like that. This theoretical woman would have:

\- intentionally sacrificed happiness with a HV man because she is now tied to this LV wealthy man; 

\- intentionally sacrificed an upbringing in a loving, HV household for her child; 

\- put herself at the financial mercy of an imbalanced power dynamic with a LV man, putting herself and her child at risk of abuse 

Many of our mothers and grandmothers have stories about the ""deals"" they had to make to support themselves and their children. Many of these are horror stories. As I said, if a woman is in dire straits, then sometimes we need to make short-term sacrifices. But to intentionally seek to put yourself in a position of service to a wealthy man, instead building your own wealth, is **fools gold**.",207.0

And really, most of my answers are either ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt know‚Äù or ‚ÄúF-cking great! Thanks for asking!‚Äù For example:

- How does it feel to be a f3m c3l?

I wouldn‚Äôt know. The term this attempt to spin off of involves two words in the English language: involuntary, and celibate. As a woman, all I need to do is exist to get a man in bed. Not only this, but I‚Äôm an Asian woman. I‚Äôm in high demand for that until scrotes realize I‚Äôm not submissive. Then I‚Äôm just left with the regular unwashed masses. In other words, there is nothing involuntary about my celibacy. 

This leads to another frequent question‚Ä¶

- How does it feel to be single and alone with your sTaNdArDs?

It feels f-cking great! Thanks for asking!

It also feels a lot better than being with someone who doesn‚Äôt engage in basic personal hygiene, creates messes that he thinks only I as a woman can clean, has no personal drive, and resents me for being better than he is.

I don‚Äôt have to be single. L/NVM are everywhere. Don‚Äôt act like you wouldn‚Äôt jump to be with me or any of my FDS sisters if we accidentally glanced your way. I‚Äôm not sorry for wanting what I deserve.

- I hope owning your own home and having savings is worth it!

Okay, so this isn‚Äôt a question, but I can‚Äôt believe that some scrotes try to weaponize financial security. Lol! Yes, being a homeowner with a nest egg is infinitely preferable to wasting my life with someone who either lacks ambition or expects me to find his dreams. Spoiler addendum for the latter half: either my money ends up being figuratively flushed down the toilet (most likely), or he‚Äôd leave once he succeeded (lol! Highly unlikely since he‚Äôd need my money that he criticizes when he can‚Äôt touch it)

- I hope you don‚Äôt mind this DM but how do I increase my chances of getting a partner?

This is the equivalent of fishing for compliments. These lurkers know the answer. Don‚Äôt expect us to soothe your egos and tell you you‚Äôre fine just the way you are. We‚Äôre not your mom. lol

- You know that no one is ever going to want to marry you, right?

LOL! I‚Äôve had many proposals and am the widow of a HVM. I‚Äôm going to be just fine.

97,t3_rrfm9x,I keep blaming myself.,"Hey ladies, I'm feeling a bit down in the dumps and I really need someone to talk too.

I've made a couple of posts about my previous relationship and I'm starting to feel like a broken record at this point. The first relationship I ever had (We were HS sweethearts) turned out to be an emotionally abusive relationship for 7 years, going on to 8 years but I ended it before we even made the 8 year mark. I found out he cheated on me twice, once through [ask.fm](https://ask.fm) where you have the option to have your comments to be anon and once through cat fishing MY OWN close friends for a month and God knows how long he truly did and how many more times he cheated on me. I stayed because I wanted to save the relationship. But....I had to pay the consequences and it lead to losing myself completely.

If I had a penny for the times I begged for reassurance, ended up apologizing for all the arguments we had so things could be okay again, begged to be called, cried myself to sleep, feeling paranoid 90% of the time, snapping at him verbally when I felt threatened, getting jealous, etc..I would probably own a couple islands by now. Last night I wasn't able to sleep and like they say...curiosity killed the cat. I ended up going on tik tok and checked to see the new girlfriend account to see if they were still together. they are. At that very moment, I felt like I was truly the problem in the relationship. When I broke up with him around February, at the time I had other social medias, I saw he was going to someone house middle of April, beginning of May and didn't think too much of it at the time and just assumed he was at a family party. July comes and I see he made it official with someone (Almost 2 years have passed since I broke up with him). I became obsessed and started hating myself for it. I asked ""Why is he taking her to those places when I was constantly begging to go on dates?"" ""We live less than 10 minutes away from each other and he barely came over...but she lives about an hour away and he practically lives in her house...why?"" ""He never did those things for me..."" Then I find out she's 3 years younger than us, so she's all about social media, showing off, and whatnot. Anyways he would tell me if I wanted to get phone calls or face time, I would have to act like myself (This was after he cheated on me for the second time), would forget to call me/face time because he was too busy playing video games, every time he came over he would complain how hot my house is and how little there is to do and his house his better, etc. in the beginning of our relationship, he would also ask me for nudes and I was NEVER comfortable with that but did it to make him happy, started doing it more and more and eventually he stopped asking and it made me feel like I was no longer attractive, wanted me to start wearing thongs so I did and then started getting annoyed when he saw how confident they ended up making me feel, asked me for anal every single damn time we had sex, wanted to have sex when we barely even made three months (We were only 15 and were virgins at the time), started fingering me in the back of his house when it was my first time there and my parents and his parents were introducing themselves and I also didn't feel comfortable with that at first but allowed him because I thought it was normal.

There are just so many things that happened.

I saw that her parents are a lot more financially stable than my parents are...hence, better home, better area, better things, and it makes me feel like because she has a much more comfortable lifestyle than me, it made me feel and still makes me feel like less because of it.I still feel like I like I deserved to be cheated on, and ever since I ended it with him, I felt like he finally was free from me and found real love. I find it unfair how he found someone so quickly and I couldn't, again making me feel like I was the issue all along. I saw how on social media, a majority of his family is following her and commenting on their posts and it also made me feel like they prefer and like her more over me.

&amp;#x200B;

I been working on myself for these past almost 2 years but out of no where there are moments where I just take 50 steps back and end up going back to square 1. it's frustrating because I have accomplished so many things ever since, my mental health has improved, getting accepted into a masters program, found a job related to my career, debt free, but then in the back of my mind I have this voice in my head telling me ""It was you. you were the problem.""",85.0
98,t3_rrdv01,Angry right now,"I had a recent conversation with a male acquaintance who was bragging about a recent exploit with a girl from tinder. ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt looking for sex, but I was able to change her mind.‚Äù I told him that sounds creepy af, and he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm not a rapist.‚Äù I just hate this fucking culture we live in.

They‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a rapist,‚Äù and pressure/nag a woman until she says yes.

They‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a rapist,‚Äù and get her drunk so her inhibitions are low.

They‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a rapist,‚Äù and manipulate her emotionally until she says yes.

Just because you don‚Äôt violently assault a woman and rip her clothes off doesn‚Äôt make you not a rapist. Rape isn‚Äôt always violent.

99,t3_rrdoqk,"Bizarre pickme post in another subreddit: woman so excited that the office ""hot guy"" flirts with her that she goes out to celebrate"," This is what pathological need for male validation looks like

# The ‚Äúhot guy‚Äù at work started flirting with me and my husband took me out to dinner to celebrate

üì∑ 

There‚Äôs  a new guy at work. As soon as he walked in, all the girls (and  literally some of the guys) fell head over heels for him, and admittedly  he‚Äôs one of the most universally attractive people I have ever met.

I‚Äôm married. Have been for 5 months now, to a man who I‚Äôve been with for 8 years, and he is the love of my life.

Today  I was at work, and this new guy got my previous clients. He came over  and asked me a bit about them, and so we got to talking and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm  going to have to apologize that I‚Äôm not as pretty as their previous  intern.‚Äù, winked at me, and walked away.

Like  I said, I‚Äôm married and I love my husband to the ends of the earth and  then some, but I still think it‚Äôs cool that the guy who everyone is  flirting with, is flirting with me. It‚Äôs honestly like a confidence  booster and I was so excited, I immediately texted my husband and told  him.

My husband has seen this guy  walking around (and even ranked him a 10/10 himself) so he knew exactly  who I was talking about, and he sent back ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs godd\*\*\* right, THAT‚ÄôS  MY WIFE!‚Äù

When I got home from  work, he gave me a huge hug and told me he is stoked he married me and  he made dinner reservations and took me out to celebrate and it was  awesome.

In all my previous  relationships, I never would have told them because his flirting would  have been met with anger. But my husband? I tell him and he is so  excited and proud that someone with this guy‚Äôs looks flirted with me,  that he bought me TWO slices of cheesecake for dessert.

He keeps saying he‚Äôs so lucky he married me.

But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm luckier &lt;3

EDIT:  First of all, I feel personally offended by people telling me to ‚Äúnot  let it go to my head‚Äù or to ‚Äúmake sure it doesn‚Äôt go too far‚Äù or to  ‚Äúmake sure I know our priorities‚Äù. Some of these comments have been left  here, others have been sent as PM‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt flirt back and I  immediately told my husband, and that combined with his reaction should  say enough to ease your already unnecessary (not to mention unkind)  concerns. Stop judging me and my marriage from a snippet of a moment  that made me smile, and just accept the oddity for what it is.

Secondly, maybe it is odd. But sometimes it‚Äôs the odd moments that make you go ‚ÄúWait- how lucky am I?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt add more story to this because I wanted to not be lengthy, but the reason I wanted to post this weird celebration and *get it off my chest*  is because before my husband, I was in an abusive relationship.  Controlling and manipulative to the point that another man smiled at me,  and my ex tried to beat him up before getting intervened. He had me *convinced*  that if I left, no one else would love me and I felt so trapped. But  then I left. And I found this man who loves me. And sometimes we have  these weird moments where I find myself comparing where I was then to  where I am now, and this was one. I never would have told my ex because  it would‚Äôve resulted in days of silence and broken objects. But here I  am, giddily telling my husband because I knew he‚Äôd have an equally giddy  response and it‚Äôs odd, yes, but it‚Äôs one of those moments where I  realize I found the love I never thought I‚Äôd have.

EDIT  2: I will not be posting pictures of any of us, beit me, my husband, or  the new guy. My husband and I are private people, and I think posting a  picture of the new guy without his permission would be an invasion of  privacy.

As for why I told my  husband, he loves when people flirt with me. He says it gives him a  ‚Äúsecond-hand high‚Äù knowing he is with ‚Äúsomeone so attractive‚Äù, and I  feel the same way when it happens with him. I always tell him when  someone flirts with me (regardless of manner or appearance) and he does  the same, and I was extra excited this time because he has commented on  the new guy before and would know who I was talking about.

Also,  after talking with my husband casually today, I believe a large portion  of him making dinner reservations was because he was genuinely craving  Italian food- though he did admit he still loves that this guy flirted  with me and wanted to celebrate, so that‚Äôs why he got me two  cheesecakes!",260.0

101,t3_rrdgzf,"Insecure has a lot of examples of LVM, HVM, and the women that love them. SPOILER HEAVY, read at your own risk.","Queens, a word of advice: Don't be like Issa Dee in Insecure. 

Each of the women characters in Insecure have done some sort of growth in Season 5. Tiffany takes on a more scaled-back role and is moving to Denver with her husband. Kelli has an epiphany in S5E1 and makes decisions to actively change her life. Molly goes through her growth in S5 after being an absolute mess in S4, and she and Taurean become an item. 

And then there's Issa. 

Issa couldn't ever figure out what she wanted with a man. She got sick of Lawrence being a LV scrub and cheated on him with...another LV scrub (Daniel). She always pined after having a man, and in the immortal words of Betty Wright, ""A piece of a man is better than no man at all."" She was never okay with having to be alone, so she was always bouncing from one man to another. Being in a relationship made her feel secure, despite her accomplishments and incredible friendships. Throughout the series, she was always obsessing over a man, and never spent any real period of time alone, be it because she had her 'hoetation' or because she was on the fence about being with Nathan. Issa then decided to be with Lawrence: the man that had no respect for her relationship with Nathan, wasn't about to hold up his life to wait on her and had a whole cycle of women, and then was reckless with his seed and decided to impregnate another woman and had no desire to responsibly co-parent until prompted. Issa would have done a damn sight better alone, and that would have signaled growth far more than her choosing to go back to her trash ex. 

Other than Taurean being an asshole, he doesn't particularly demonstrate any major LV traits. He's basically the equivalent of Molly, but it took for Molly to level up to see it. You see a lot of Molly's old traits (desperate to have a man) in Issa. Tiffany dealt with postpartum depression, and Derek went to look for her and comforted her when he realized what was going on with her. He knew that something wasn't right, and went to go look for his wife. Kelli was a complete person on her own, and her relationship with Desmond just came out of left field (aside - I really think that Kelli should have her own spinoff). 

A series that is otherwise empowering relies on the same ""struggle love will save the day"" trope that so many series suffer from, and relegates their main protagonist to it. You can have it all, but if you rely on having a man in order to feel like you're truly accomplished, you will end up losing it all. Don't let a man be what makes you feel secure in yourself.",107.0

107,t3_rr80se,Having a relationship start from a hook up is not the flex you think it is,"So many pickmes love to tout that hookup culture isn‚Äôt that bad because they hooked up with their boyfriend and it‚Äôs been X years of bliss since. As much as women have convinced themselves this is a flex, I refuse to see it as that. 

We all know how men love to yell that women who have indiscriminate sex are easy and hoes. While this comes from a place of misogyny and objectification in men, I have the same views for men who are willing to have sex with women they‚Äôve known for less than 24 hours. 

To me, it means a) he doesn‚Äôt mind sleeping with strangers so he‚Äôs not picky and b) he‚Äôs used to taking what he can get with women. I don‚Äôt know about you but if I committed to a man like this I would be wary for the rest of our relationship. 

Why? Because we all know men project so if they think women who sleep around are gross and evil what does that say about how we should view fuck boys or players in their perspective? Men tell on themselves all the time. And while this is a double standard I hold, I‚Äôll never trust a man that was community dick in the past or present. 

Getting them to commit doesn‚Äôt matter to me because I want a man different from the rest. I want a man who frequently practices due diligence and doesn‚Äôt let his dick rule his life. I want a man who is picky because I‚Äôll always know he chose me because I was always his first choice. I want a man who vets just like I do. 

And even though I don‚Äôt think a HVM would judge a woman for her sexual past, I do think he would see sex the same way as a HVW. I will never be impressed by relationships that start through hookups because I already disagree with the initial premises. A man even willing to initiate sex with me as a stranger is a man I‚Äôll never want.

Edit: I also want to add that a lot of men think they‚Äôre picky because they use porn standards to pick women they think are deserving of commitment. However, they don‚Äôt implement these standards at all. A lot will sleep with anyone because they are not patient and have no impulse control. Once again, these are qualities I wouldn‚Äôt want in a longterm partner.",647.0

However after the divorce he still stays on contact with the kids, takes them to practices, takes them to movies, all that stuff, and of course seeing the ex wife and then chatting with regularly ""about the kids"". It's not the first time I heard of this, but it is the first time a guy was telling me this is his situation. Other red flags popped up, she has a new man she's been with, she lives e or 4 hours away and he still drives out to see the kids, and of course he comes in the house and they ""hangout""

I just want to warn you all this is a major red flag. I expect coparenting like this when it is his biological kids, but not like this when he is trying to date seriously again and they were step kids. I am very suspect that he is only being so loving to the kids as a way to keep his options open and settle back down with the ex wife if he cannot find better options. It's Definitely rubbing me the wrong way and I would like to hear what others think or if they have encountered this as well.

Edit: not sure why yall are down voting. I am genuinely getting a red flag vibe from this scrote.

We all know about men and they tendencies toward competitiveness  - this works to our advantage with HVM! A seemingly difficult challenge? An exceptionally elaborate request? These are opportunities for men to rise to the occasion to prove themselves worthy. It's like giving a knight a quest, and he gains honor by completing the task, especially if daunting.

Make him work hard, ladies! Don't be afraid to make demands! An HVM loves this - he gets to win a challenge, and his reward is to see you happy. His life is greatly improved by the presence of a satisfied, supported woman, and he knows this. Also, you deserve to be spoiled and doted upon.

No more looking, waiting, wondering, planning, plotting and pining for a relationship. I am off the market emotionally and intellectually. I am taking 2022 off in terms of controlling my sometimes obsessvie thoughts about men and dating: I am not going there for a year. (If I accidentally meet someone, they'll just have to wait till 2023! Kind of a great screening process.)

119,t3_rqw9oy,Don‚Äôt waste your time or energy debating about sex work to men and libfems,"I am known to be quite a passionate person about ethics and perhaps it‚Äôs the Aquarius in me, but I‚Äôd like to make an impact and change the world for the better. 

However, as someone who used to debate until I had to excuse myself and cry in the bathroom, I now just save my energy. 

Every time someone brings up sex work in a positive light and I have brought up the negative side to it - exploitation of children and women, sex trafficking, ruins your dopamine receptors and leads to depression/seeking out more depraved content, women don‚Äôt receive benefits or nearly as much money as they would a stable ‚Äúboring‚Äù job etc. I get called sex negative, a swerf and my personal favourite, VICTIM BLAMING like last time I checked, saying ‚Äúhey, you know that the average OF income is $180 a month right and sex work revolves around abusing women and children‚Äù isn‚Äôt victim blaming. 

As someone who has previously worked in the sex industry, everything that FDS stands for about sex work is true. Sometimes I wish I could just shake these people and say ‚ÄúI USED TO BE A SEX WORKER‚Äù but then they would stigmatise me, refuse to hire me, refuse to date me, be my friend etc. 

The ones who claim to be sex positive and liberal are some of the most judgemental, insecure and demeaning people I have ever known. 

So ladies, don‚Äôt bother fighting with people who know nothing about the sex industry and want to keep shitting on other women for personal gain aka scrotes and pick me‚Äôs.

121,t3_rqockv,OLD profiles and effort,"Hi ladies! I am one of those who does enjoy OLD for finding dates. It is full of low-effort LVM but they are ridiculously easy to filter out! I always immediately swipe left on men who are:
-Negative 
-Lazy (one-word answers to prompts, didn't fill out the ""about me"")
-Have terrible pictures (blurry, face covered, etc)
-Mention their ex/recent relationship/""separated""



I also don't respond to men who send likes without comments (on Hinge) or who don't answer the question in my profile (on Bumble.) 

With these very simple rules, I filter out 90% of men. I have a few other rules personally (any mention of sarcasm, beer in every photo, mention being a college athlete in their 30s, etc.) but I realized today that Hinge has a whole information section where they tell you to avoid ALL of the other things I listed above.  The things that 90% of men on dating apps do wrong. In short, there is literally a guide on how to make a decent profile AND how to talk to women. It took me all of five minutes to read it and I agreed with all of it. 

I'm simply posting to say, for anyone using OLD who starts to think maybe these men are just clueless, NO. If they cared about making a decent profile or interacting with you in a respectful way, there are literally step-by-step instructions available to them IN the app. 

Stay firm with your boundaries, safe with your personal information, ruthless with your vetting, and have fun! Anyone who isn't putting effort into their profile likely won't put effort into dating.",308.0

Here's the story: I've been dating this guy for about a year now. I have been vetting constantly and am still on the alert for any red flags, but we've been good so far. He's charismatic, intelligent, we share the same interests, has expressed long-term interest in marriage and is well-off enough to be a good provider and definitely shows his affection. He's been living on his own for a while, is very clean and a good cook (like cleaner than me and a better cook than me). He invited me to move in with him. I've expressed that I don't want to get married for at least a few more years, but that is the direction I would like to go with him.

I would most certainly love to move in with him, not just because I like him and want to see how it goes but I also desperately want to escape the living situation I'm in now (parents). I asked for some time to think about it, because I wanted to say yes right away but realized that wasn't a good move. I think I will be moving in with him, and I want your advice for things I should look out for. Besides the obvious of him doing a 180 and trying to make me a Mommy McBangmaid, or trying to isolate me or financially manipulating me (we would keep our finances separate for sure), anything else I should be on the alert for? I've never lived with a boyfriend before, and am a little hesitant of the FDS view.",83.0

Hopefully you can translate this into your own language.

I'll give an explanation about the article here:

It's about a vulnerable woman (who are sadly always the target since these misogynistic pigs are always after vulnerable women), she was 5 months into this and he managed to make her tell about her whole life (see; he tried and sadly succeed to make an online ""romantic"" connection, that's why we keep it short, plan 10-15min pre-date videocalls etc.), he went so far that she believed they had a future together and so on. Poor woman. Long story short; he managed to make her transfer ten thousands of money to him and vanished shortly after it. 
These men will keep in touch for weeks, months.. to form a ""bond"" to make you transfer your money if they got you emotional invested enough **through the fucking internet**.

125,t3_rqm1t1,Why you shouldn‚Äôt live together before marriage: 2 real-life examples,"I recently had an eye opening discussion with a male coworker that opened my eyes even more as far as why cohabiting before marriage is a bad, bad idea: 

This male coworker has a friend who is currently living with his gf. According to the male coworker, this friend of his has known for a long time that he won‚Äôt ever marry the gf, but still asked her to move in with him! And she did! Meanwhile, she has *no idea* that he never plans on proposing. She‚Äôs wasting years of her life on a man who has not been honest about his intentions and who is basically using her.

Another example is my family friend. She was in a relationship a number of years, they lived together, we all thought he‚Äôd propose. What did he do instead? Demand that she move out because he wasn‚Äôt ready for marriage. She ended up being a forever gf who got dumped. 

Protect yourself! Do not move in to ‚Äúplay house‚Äù before marriage and commitment. And if someone dumps you because you won‚Äôt move in? Good riddance.

When men ask you to move in before marriage, they want to reap ‚Äúwife benefits‚Äù without doing *their part* to commit to you. They are getting a win-win situation, you are getting a lose-lose situation.",705.0

It puts the mental load of the gift on you. A HV partner doesn‚Äôt need a list because they will take the time to actually learn your interests and wants, put effort into planning and budgeting for a gift, with the ‚Äúpay-off‚Äù for them being the joy they bring to you with something surprising and thoughtful. Don‚Äôt let men gaslight you by saying ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôre so hard to shop for‚Äù or ‚Äúyou already have everything you want‚Äù or ‚Äúyou already buy the things you want for yourself.‚Äù 

And for the ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è reacts - this isn‚Äôt about money. The absolute best gift I ever received from a partner probably cost less than $20, but was a custom made curio box that he spent considerable time researching and making. Did I need it? No, not really, but I‚Äôd mentioned 6 months earlier that I‚Äôd like to have ‚Äúsomething cute‚Äù to store a few personal items that were very meaningful to me.

131,t3_rqamfj,Strategy: How to know if a man is only after YOUR money and success,"I wanted to create a post to provide guidance around male gold diggers. Yes, some men financially hang off women and think that shit is OK. Successful queens who have worked on themselves and succeeded in their career, achieved a undergraduate/masters/PhD degree, scored a well paying job, finished vocational skills and training, or completed an apprenticeship need to protect their success and their financial interests. There are men out there who are interested in successful lonely women and are ready to be your boyfriend at a financial cost to you.

This is the list of red flags I have come up with:

\- He has no job and has no interest in finding one

\- He is up to his eyeballs in debt. In particular he has debt for a tertiary qualification which WILL NOT PAY ITSELF OFF e.g. archaeology

\- He uses afterpay and other 'buy now pay later' payment methods for EVERYTHING. This is a dire financial situation here. Think about that - he is getting into debt for dinner, drinks, cinema tickets, and other lifestyle expenses which he cannot afford. This is unsustainable and he will eventually have an appalling credit score.

\- He asks questions about your financial background immediately (which side of town did you grow up in? / which school/university did you go to? / what your parents do for a living? / how many siblings do you have?). These questions sound genuine but he is sizing you up and working out what you are worth.

\- He moves in with you and does not contribute to the rent, food, utilities, and gas expenses

\- He has no ambition (e.g. games in parent's basement) and his parents are trying to palm him off on you because you have your financial shit together

\- He has decided that attaining a skill (tertiary qualification or apprenticeship) is too difficult and that he is just GoInG tO BeCoME a FaMOuS actor/singer/radio personality/youtuber/influencer but he does not realize that these people work very very hard to become successful. While he is fantasizing about becoming famous you will be feeding him and putting a roof over his head.

\- You find yourself paying for luxuries that you both participate in e.g. holidays, hotels, entertainment 

\- He has a history of dating women wealthier/more successful that himself

134,t3_rq4gax,Dating Strategies for Asian Women,"A long overdue post that I've been wanting to write for a while!

This one is for my fellow Asian FDSers &lt;3

**Part One: Vetting for Asian Fetishes Among Non-Asian Males**

Here are a few things to look out for:

\-Too much interest in anime, kpop, japanese videogames

\-Takes you to an Asian restaurant without you expressing your wanting to go to one

\-Asian decor or cookbooks at his place

\-Talks about his previous Asian gfs or wives

\-Has many Asian ex partners

\-Talks too much about Asian culture

\-Acts like an expert about Asian culture, acts like he knows more than you

**Part Two: You are NOT REQUIRED to date Asian men. Despite Libfem propaganda, they don't own you and you don't owe anything to them.**

You are not required to date Asian men out of guilt because they are stereotyped and have dating ""struggles"". Historically, Asian men, have abused, raped, and tortured Asian women. They forced us to be their concubines, literally cheating on us in public for years. But just because they can't get laid by a few ladies, now they are the victim? Do not allow them to manipulate you into sleeping with them out of guilt. 

Libfems will subtly try to convince you to give them an extra preference, but you should ignore them, and do what is best for you. Do not listen to libfems who try to defend Asian men and argue his side. Libfems are so sympathetic to Asian male racism when that problem is literally nothing compared to what we have to go through. No gaslighting about ""both sides"". 

Remember to dislike Asian men and White men equally.

Asian men do not own us, we can do whatever we want without guilt. PLEASE do not let libfems convince you that dating a HVM white man is bad, especially if it'll improve the condition of your life.

***A side note about the comparison between Asian men and Black women in terms of dating struggles.*** *This is a bad comparison. Black women are historically innocent. They have no blood on their hands and do not hurt anyone. This is not the case for Asian men obviously. Also a key difference is that Black women fight against racial fetish because they simply want to be cared about for who they are, not their race. Asian men like racial fetishes because it gets them laid (If you want an example of this, watch Jimmy Yang's interview with Joe Rogan).*

***A side note #2 about Non Asian women fetishizing Asian men.*** *Libfem culture says it's okay, it is actually harmful to Asian women because Asian women have endured centuries of abuse and rape from Asian men. Idealizing Asian men turns a blind eye to the pain Asian women have endured. Asian men are just as bad as white men. These non Asian women who fetishize Asian men are NOT your friends. I know this from past mistakes and experiences. They ALWAYS have a superiority complex. They will be negatively racist towards you, and oftentimes put you down out of feeling somewhat threatened.*

**Things to keep in mind when dating Asian men:**

\-A lot of them aren't rich and successful like you might think. Some are bums. MANY are bums.

\-Be wary of the nerdy engineer type Asian man as well. He is often extremely misogynistic due to the amount of video games he plays. I once noticed a nerdy engineer type liking porn accounts on Instagram. They may seem passive and harmless, but these men are not.

\-Even if he is studying neuroscience at a good university, he might not be as high achieving as you think. I cannot stress this enough.

\-Asian men in America are more likely to resort to pickup artistry due to girls not wanting to date them. They are more manipulative than you might think.

\-Some Asian men have non Asian women fetishes. The Asian man who has a friend group of mostly Asian people most likely does not have this fetish.

\-Asian American men and non diaspora Asian men are wildly different. They hold varying political views, young Asian American men are mostly liberal left leaning. Whether you can date non diaspora Asian men depends on your language capabilities (or his).

&amp;#x200B;

**And above all, always support your Asian sisters above any Asian man!**

Every man I know who ever initiated a break up or divorce had this in common: he gets in a new relationship right away. Usually because he has been cheating. But sometimes it's more like ..he had someone ""coincidentally"" appear in his life riiiiiight before he takes the leap into splitting (like an old ex who recently became single or there's a new woman at work who he's been becoming besties with etc).  

It seems like no matter how dire a man's relationship is, they do not leave without these backups. Men will stay in situations that they claim they hate (like dead bedrooms) but just complain and resign to hating their wives or gfs. Or they'll be openly disgusted with their wife's aging or weight gain, or whatever, and just be cruel about dragging it out. Even men who get cheated on seem to maybe emotionally check out but still stay unless there is someone on the backburner. 

The only time I've ever known men who are single and living life alone are living that way because their girlfriends or wives split up with THEM (i.e. not by choice lol). 

I personally can't think of any, but do any of you know men who have done this (initiated a break up for a reason - other than backup girl became available)? And if so, do they seem to be HV?

I'm asking because I feel like it could be a (small, LOW BAR) HV green flag if a man has spent time WILLINGLY being single, and left a relationship for an actual reason. And so it might be a good vetting question.

# If You Can‚Äôt Find a Spouse Who Supports Your Career, Stay Single

by [Avivah Wittenberg-Cox](https://hbr.org/search?term=avivah%20wittenberg-cox)

October 24, 2017

Despite advances in gender equity, many professionally ambitious women still struggle to find balance between their career and that of their partner. While these spouses are happy to have successful, high-earning wives,¬†they are often caught off guard by...more

I was at a dinner with eight highly successful professional women recently, ranging¬†in age from 35 to 74. Their stories were typical of research I have been conducting on dual-career couples. One had just been given a huge promotion opportunity in another country, but had struggled for several months to get her spouse to agree to join her. Another had decided that to save her marriage, she would take a yearlong sabbatical and go back to school, giving the family some balance and a breather from two high-powered jobs. A third had tried to work part-time for her law firm but quickly realized she was being professionally sidelined. She opted for a doctorate instead. Her husband continued his career.

This experience underlines the conclusion I‚Äôve drawn from years of research and experience: Professionally ambitious women really only have two options when it comes to their personal partners¬†‚Äî a super-supportive partner or no partner at all. Anything in between ends up being a morale- and career-sapping morass.

This is the reality of the half-baked transition we are in when it comes to women in the workplace. The 20th century saw the rise of women. The 21st century will see the adaptation (or not) of men to the consequences of that rise.¬†The reality is that the transition is not smooth and the backlashes will be regular, but the benefits are potentially huge.

So far, a small minority of men and companies are at the forefront of the shift. As Melinda Gates¬†[recently wrote](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/were-sending-our-daughters-workplace-designed-dads-melinda-gates/), we are still ‚Äúsending our daughters into companies designed for our dads.‚Äù And into marriages billed as equal, as long as the man‚Äôs career isn‚Äôt disturbed by his wife‚Äôs success.¬†(While I‚Äôve occasionally heard stories of¬†career-stifling spouses¬†from same-sex couples, the vast majority I‚Äôve heard are from heterosexual couples, and it‚Äôs almost always the woman whose career comes second.)

It‚Äôs not that these husbands aren‚Äôt progressive, supportive spouses. They certainly see themselves that way¬†‚Äî as do many of the CEOs and leaders of companies I work with. But they are often caught out by trade-offs they were not expecting. They are happy to have successful, high-earning wives. They applaud and support them¬†‚Äî until it starts to interfere with their own careers. A¬†[study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716204268552)¬†by Pamela Stone and Meg Lovejoy found that husbands were a key factor in two-thirds of women‚Äôs decisions to quit the workforce, often because the wives had to fill a so-called parenting vacuum. ‚ÄúWhile the women almost unanimously described their husbands as supportive,‚Äù¬†[writes Joan Williams](http://worklifelaw.org/pubs/OptOutPushedOut.pdf)¬†of the study, ‚Äúthey also told how those husbands refused to alter their own work schedule or increase their participation in caregiving.‚Äù As one woman put it, ‚ÄúHe has always said to me, ‚ÄòYou can do whatever you want to do.‚Äô But he‚Äôs not there to pick up any load.‚Äù

The women are left shocked and surprised. They had thought the rules of engagement were clear,¬†that well-educated couples would be mutually supportive and take turns, helping each other become all they can be. A survey of Harvard Business School graduates¬†[emphasizes the disconnect](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/11/18/harvard_business_school_study_it_s_not_kids_but_husbands_that_hold_women.html): More than half the men expected their careers to take precedence over their wives‚Äô careers, while most women expected egalitarian marriages. (Almost no women expected their own careers to come¬†first.) Millennial men are often portrayed as more enlightened, but data complicates this picture: Surveys¬†[have shown](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/opinion/sunday/do-millennial-men-want-stay-at-home-wives.html?_r=0)¬†that younger men may be even¬†*less*¬†committed to equality than their elders.

Even for couples who are committed to equality, it takes two exceptional people to navigate tricky dual-career waters. It‚Äôs easier to opt for the path of least resistance¬†‚Äî the historical norm of a career-focused man and a family-focused woman. Especially if,¬†[as is often the case](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/opinion/sunday/dating-age-gap.html), the man is a few years older, has a career head start, and so earns a higher salary. This leads to a cycle that‚Äôs hard to break:¬†[Men get more opportunities to earn more](https://hbr.org/2017/06/the-average-mid-forties-male-college-graduate-earns-55-more-than-his-female-counterparts), and it gets harder and harder for women to catch up.

The disillusionment is deep¬†‚Äî and lasting. The result is a delayed reaction, as I found in researching a¬†[book on the increasing divorce and marriage rates in people‚Äôs fifties and sixties](http://www.late-love.co/):¬†Talented women, forced by their husband‚Äôs attitudes to downgrade their aspirations, bide their time. After their children leave, often so do the wives. About 60% of late-life divorces are initiated by women, often to focus their energies on¬†[flourishing careers post-50](https://hbr.org/2016/04/what-work-looks-like-for-women-in-their-50s).

Now it‚Äôs the husband‚Äôs turn to be shocked. They had worked so hard, provided so well¬†‚Äî that was what they had understood their role to be! But that isn‚Äôt what modern couplehood is about in a more gender-balanced century. The dual-earner couple has huge advantages in turbulent economic times, as Eli Finkel of Northwestern University has written in his book¬†[*The All-or-Nothing Marriage*](https://www.amazon.com/All-Nothing-Marriage-Best-Marriages/dp/052595516X). The best marriages have never been happier, more balanced, or more mutually fulfilling. Gender balance at home has created far more resilient couples. But it takes mutual support and balance across the decades. Ignore your partner‚Äôs dreams at your peril.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know,‚Äù many of the men I interviewed told me after their wives left. To me, this sounds a lot like what corporate leaders tell me after their most senior female executives quit. They hadn‚Äôt expected them to leave, hadn‚Äôt quite understood how upset they were by the attitudes, the lack of recognition, or the promotion of the less competent man down the hall.

But in the end, underneath it all, it isn‚Äôt true that they didn‚Äôt know. The reality is they didn‚Äôt care. They didn‚Äôt listen¬†‚Äî because they didn‚Äôt think they had to. They nodded absently and ignored the rambling in their ear because they¬†thought it¬†didn‚Äôt matter and wouldn‚Äôt directly affect them. Several men admitted to me that they just thought their wives‚Äô frustrations were due to menopause and all they had to do was wait it out. It‚Äôs this kind of minimizing and discounting that drives women to distraction¬†‚Äî before it drives them out the door. Much to the surprise, and subsequent grief, of their husbands.

A lot of the things people learn about leadership and team building at work is directly transferable to managing better balance at home. Some of the strategies I outline in my upcoming book include:

* **Vision.**¬†Discuss long-term personal and professional goals early, and revise regularly. Lack of alignment and mutual support between couples can derail entire life strategies. Be clear about what support will be required and expected to achieve these goals and where it will come from.
* **Active listening.**¬†The most common complaint from women is that they don‚Äôt feel heard; from men, that they don‚Äôt feel appreciated. For the first, introduce regular sit-down listening sessions (monthly is good, quarterly a minimum). Dedicated, face-to-face, concentrated, unspeaking, listening to everything your partner needs to say. Then repeat back what you heard. Adjust as necessary. Then switch. Sound awkward? Only until it becomes relationship-saving.
* **Feedback (aka flattery).**¬†Everyone appreciates feedback, but it is increasingly rare, both at home and at work. The rule usually recommended is 5 to 1: Five positive comments for every ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù one. Turns out humans love to be admired, especially by their intimate partners. So dial up the volume and tell your spouse how gorgeous, brilliant, caring, and supportive they are. Reward the positive and watch it grow. Sound artificial? Only until you see the light ignite in their eyes.

If your partner is not willing to engage, uninterested in ‚Äúleaning in,‚Äù and resistant to seeking help, you should ask yourself why. Just like at work, it is interesting first to work on yourself. Understand your own issues, the impact you have on others, the degree to which you are creating the reaction you are struggling with. Consider working with a therapist or coach. In the end, after you‚Äôve figured yourself out, if the relationship hasn‚Äôt improved, the question remains: What is keeping you in this team? Are you staying out of love or fear?

Until recently, women had more fear than finances; a lack of love was bad, but not as bad as poverty. For many women, greater financial independence means they can hold their relationships to a higher standard. Women want love and recognition and support, at work and at home. Companies that don‚Äôt offer it find they struggle with retention of women¬†‚Äî many of whom will [start their own companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geristengel/2016/01/06/why-the-force-will-be-with-women-entrepreneurs-in-2016/#2ed163054f8b). Couples that don‚Äôt offer it struggle with the same thing: Women leave.

Retaining women, at home and at work, takes skill and self-awareness. It takes attention and an intentional¬†readjustment of yesterday‚Äôs rules to today‚Äôs realities. At work, it means adapting company cultures and systems. At home, it requires an equally strategic focus on enhancing *both* partners‚Äô potential, with a long-term family vision across lengthening lives, tons of attentive listening, and regular flattery for the journey.

I started dating a guy in July and we decided to be boyfriend/girlfriend in November. I don't want to waste my time (been there, done that.)

I'm not sure if this guy is ready for serious commitment and marriage and I don't know how to find out his true intentions. He knows I'm more traditional and that my goal is to get married, he says he wants something serious/marriage and children before 35 but he's very vague other than that. We've been taking it slow and he's told me he has feelings for me, likes me etc. But he hasn't told me that he loves me and hasn't introduced me to his family either (he's never introduced anyone to his family and said it's a big step for him, could be a red flag..?) We haven't discussed a future together either. We've lightly touched on the subject of engagement/marriage in general but it was very very vague. He seems a bit unsure about all of that and I'm not interested in staying with someone that might get cold feet or doesn't truly want me. At the same time the relationship is still fairly new so I'm not sure how to think I obviously need more time to vet him to know if he's right for me as well. He's 27 and we go to the same uni, he's a third year and I'm on my fourth year.

Initially, for the first half of their relationship my brother-in-law made significantly more while my sister was in school. My nephew has special needs and has been in and out of the hospital during the continuing pandemic because of his low immune system. My sister has been a rockstar taking care of my nephew, but the whole new family scene has been stressful and is just not for my brother-in-law supposedly because he wants to ‚Äúfocus on building his business and traveling while he‚Äôs still young‚Äù.

1. Romantic stories/movies or god forbid kdrama there a sane guy transforms into a monster but it‚Äôs ok, everyone is hot so it‚Äôs a good story!
2. Horror/thriller lists where full of women stalking. Statistically women are primordial victims of stalking, attacks, domestic abuse but movies depicting women stalking with high budgets and cult following are like 9 of 10 recommendations 
3. Most gross part are movies from 90s like poisson ivy, ofc young pretty teen girls are dying for 30-40+ men ü•∞üòçyour friend‚Äôs daughter is into you!

They all went along the lines of ""Merry Christmas. Hope you're doing well!"" Or ""Merry Christmas, how's *state I moved to* what's new?"" I also got a weird phone call right before Christmas eve. I answered thinking it maybe had to do with an application. When I answer odd numbers I always ask ""who is this?"" And will not say anything else until they answer the question. A males voice answered that ""it's john"". John was a name of an ex from THREE years ago. I quickly hung up and blocked before saying anything else. 

I have been following FDS for probably close to 2 years, and I have been deleting and blocking scrotes. I also rarely give out my number anymore. All of my friends, family, and coworkers are saved in my contacts list. 

This means that these were three scrotes from years ago trying to use the holidays as a way to slide back into my life and that they used New phone numbers to do so. Also shows men keep your number if you give it out. With new years coming, be on the lookout for odd numbers calling or texting you. 

Do not respond to these messages of a seeming good nature, usually they are old desperate scrotes trying to slide back in.

**IF at any point in time, the man you are with causes you to START nagging - LEAVE.**

Nagging is not natural - that stereotype that women are nags can go burn in the seventh hell.

You start to nag because he didn't listen when you tell him nicely the first few times.

You nag because he keeps doing the stupid ass bullshit you clearly tell him NOT to do.

You nag because his blatant disregard of your words and opinions and feelings is frustrating and insulting.

You nag because he deliberately causes you to stew in negative emotions and slowly driving you CRAZY.

You nag because you feel like a ball being thrown around and played with mercilessly - so you nag as a way to regain some control.

You nag because you can clearly see what the problem is and if only he can shut up and listen instead of ignoring and making fun if you - the problem can be solved immediately!

You nag because it is the only way to vent all the frustration you bottle up inside caused by the way he treats you.

It is a sign you are in a toxic - or worse covertly abusive relationship.

I have epilepsy and it‚Äôs hard finding someone to accept me and my health complications. She asked if my ex accepted the fact that I had epilepsy, why would I break up with him? It set me off because I knew that he didn‚Äôt really know what he was in for. To him, I was not long term, which was why he said those things. It was just to get into my pants. She made me doubt my decisions even though it was actually her that was there and witnessed the mess I became when I was with him. I don‚Äôt really understand her right now‚Ä¶ those words made her sound dumb and a pick-me.
I have been diagnosed with epilepsy since I was a child. Society has always told me to settle because of my shortcomings. People think I‚Äôll be a burden to them due to my illness. Men that I‚Äôve dated and disclosed this information to,  told me that they no longer see a future with me. One of them asked if I would accept a friends with benefits situation after pursuing me seriously for a few months. After being treated this way, I think it‚Äôs made me realize that instead of settling and being treated in this manner, I‚Äôm going to vet harder for the sake of my own happiness. 

I realize that if a man ever leaves me, it WILL be me and not him who will be burdened with the mess he leaves behind. I can only imagine what it will be like to raise his children alone, while having epilepsy. üò±

All of them are either looking for something casual, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know yet‚Äù, or are looking for a pickme to bench for years and split the bills with. Very few are actually serious about being in real, happy, long lasting relationships. 

Unfortunately a lot of women my age don‚Äôt realize how stubborn men are when it comes to their values and beliefs. Him saying he‚Äôs seeing where it goes is his uncommitted way of stringing you along. He won‚Äôt suddenly want commitment because that was never the plan. When he does ‚Äúcommit‚Äù it‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre so amazing and you‚Äôre suddenly everything he‚Äôs looking for. 

There‚Äôs usually three scenarios that explain his change of mind:

1. He‚Äôs tried and failed to sleep around like he dreams and gets humbled. Now he is deciding to commit because he feels he can‚Äôt do better and might as well ride this relationship until the wheels fall off. 

2. He‚Äôs decided to settle for you because he‚Äôs realized it takes much less effort to keep you around as a 50/50 bangmaid than going out and having to impress new women to get laid. 

3. He‚Äôs decided to settle for you because he never gets female attention, has low self esteem, and thinks this is best he can do in the least complimentary way possible. 

(Notice how all these scenarios are so similar and revolve around settling)

A lot of women delude themselves into believing that they were the exception and were just so amazing he couldn‚Äôt help committing. The truth is, if you were so amazing he wouldn‚Äôt have made you audition to begin with.  

Men settle everyday. They hate putting effort into things which is why they‚Äôre low value. You‚Äôre not winning a prize by getting the noncommittal guy to commit.

Eventually I stopped going out with my friends, I stopped wearing makeup (because he would give me disgusted looks and refuse to look at me when I did), I started wearing frumpy clothes, he tried his damndest to convince me to not dye my hair, and on and on.

I am a strong decision maker at work, I make a decision and I'm solid with it. But with this, I didn't know which way was up. I felt stuck with no support system.

I tried to leave 3 times. The 3rd is where we begin.

**The experience**

We had started sleeping separately in 2020 when both of us landed down with what we suspect may have been covid (before covid was officially a pandemic in north america). I did my best over the next year to just...exist. But it wasn't until earlier this year when I landed a great job, with a phenomenal pay raise that I thought now was the time. If I could make this be HIS idea, maybe this time it'd be easier.

Well in July he decided to have the breakup conversation - and I now know that this is because he had someone else on the sidelines he wanted to start dating. We agreed that we were in different places, neither of us were going to change, and it best that we move on.

The day after we broke up I messaged a friend of mine who is a realtor. We went to lunch the next day, discussed what I was looking for, she passed me some names of mortgage brokers. That week I filled out an application with my broker and she called me right away. I'd have no problem getting pre-approved but she recommended I wait until September, when my probation period was up, to make any offers.

The first week after we broke up he was on cloud 9, but then coming into the weekend, he barged into my room one evening and told me there was someone that wanted to ""spend time together"" and he was going to do so.

Then a few days after that he came in and he was wanting to know what he did wrong.

The next weekend it was ""I'll help you move when you're ready"". And so on and so forth.

I grey rocked him all summer. It was a hard fucking summer. I worked from home, and I got out with my pup as much as possible, and when he was home, I'd go into my bedroom and read or watch videos on my phone. I started selling off things I had that I no longer needed, donating what I couldn't sell. In September I got the green light from my broker and my realtor friend and I went all over hells half acre over the span of a week and a half to look at houses.

Eventually, I found one. 40 minutes away from where I wanted to be, but cute and just right. That whole process was ridiculously stressful, and I think I damn near died when she called me to say that my offer was accepted. The next few weeks were flurries of inspections, appointments and paperwork.  He had no clue.

Three weeks before my closing date, when everything was said and done I told him I found somewhere. I dreaded it. And he was, surprisingly fine with it. HE peppered me with questions, offered to help me move, and seemingly went to bed happy.

**The next three weeks**

What ensued was the biggest emotional rollercoaster I'd ever been on. I felt very batted around from day to day, and I don't know if I have the words to adequately express how jarring and hard this was.

* One week he was damn near giddy and offering to help me move and fix things in my new house
* He started texting me, asking me if I wanted anything picked up on the way home, did I want to do anything together
* Several days later I was ""making a huge mistake"" buying my house
* Then he'd be back around to ""do you want the lights? what about your OTR microwave? Do you want the fence?"" (I did say yes to a lot of this because I figured, well you're offering).
* He started sending me real estate listings closer to where he lived
* He offered to build an apartment over his garage that I could live in and pick out all the fixtures and flooring for
* Then he came in to my home office one morning and was in tears asking if I was never going to see him again and did I hate him
* The next morning he made me tell him I didn't love him anymore because he ""needed to hear it""
* The closer the date got the worse this got, he'd be fine one day, a mental disaster the next. His friends were worried he was having a nervous breakdown
* I decided I couldn't count on him to keep his promise to help move, so I made alternate plans

I felt HORRIBLE and so guilty a number of times. I cried at my desk several times. I referred to a mental list I had often of all the reasons why I was leaving. For good measure I snooped his phone and found his conversation with his new interest. They were sneaking up meeting together, he was telling her she was his priority, she was asking if it was ok to drop by his work - was anyone there. He told her I had no friends. I am not one bit ashamed that I snooped, that fucking conversation cemented my resolve right then and there. He never left his phone unattended again after that which said a lot.

The day of the move, he was nowhere to be found, my brothers and my best guy friend helped me move. The next day I had forgotten a few things and dropped by to pick them up and he was *begging* me to stay. I flat out told him that this was HIS idea, and while these feelings were new to him, that part of me had been dead and gone for a long time. Then he got mad. And then I did something I never did in the 13 years we'd been together. I walked away mid-conversation, got in my car, and left.

He loaded up a number of things and brought them to me a few days later, and told me he could help me fix the house up, we could do it together, and amongst all that he promised:

* He'd get the Covid vaccine
* He'd kiss me if I wore makeup
* He'd build me a barn (that he promised to build when we first got together) and I could have horses
* We could have wine with supper whenever I wanted it
* I could have more dogs
* I could have more cats
* We could start giving each other gifts again
* I could wear whatever I wanted
* He'd be home every night at a decent time

He thought he could win me back. And you know what I thought? I looked at him saying all these things and thought ""You knew. All along *you knew.* You knew these things were hurtful for me, *and you did them anyway*"".

Here we are two months later, and I am loving my new house. My pets are happy, I'm sleeping well. I'm enjoying doing whatever I want, whenever I want. I have super neighbors and it's a quiet rural area that's also a short trip to the nearby town if I need anything. I can't say I'm happy. My happy is broken. I don't really know what that feels like anymore and I haven't been excited for anything in so long. So I'm hoping I get that back over time.

I've had a lot of people ask why I didn't go after his house, that I'm entitled to money. And I tell them this, I don't care, my sanity and peace of mind is worth more. I just wanted this to be done and over with. I don't want to see him, I don't want to fight court battles for the next several years. I just wanted to walk away and have him leave me the fuck alone.

Men use this excuse when they neglect to be thoughtful enough to get you a gift for Christmas.

They're just empty words. Talking about planning to do something or going to do something and then not following through with that plan means he was just trying to get your hopes up and wasting your time.

Not once has a man who came to you empty handed during the holidays with this schtick actually come through with their ""plan"".

I know that the holiday's are commericalized and many people have lost sight of what they actually mean. But if Christmas and gift exchanges are important to you, and you've been dating someone for a considerable amount of time, having them neglect to do or get you anything thoughtful for Christmas is an absolute slap in the face.

They're hoping that you'll just end up saying ""that's ok, you don't need to get me anything anyways!"", when deep down, you know that's not true. 

They're trying to see how low your standards can drop to set you up for future disappointments with them if you continue to see them. I really see this as a form of future faking.

Also - I'm not going to say that any man who gets you a gift is automatically deemed HV. Anecotal experiences will tell you that the shadiest of men are the ones that lavish you with expensive gifts and lovebomb you so you get distracted and don't see his million red flags.

Planning or promising to do so something is not a Christmas gift. They're empty, cheap words.

Rumors are saying he was controlling of her and held her more wordly past over her head like she wasn‚Äôt good enough. They say she had to do intense therapy over feeling too inadequate to date him as a pastor because of her past and someone who listened to his book says he was constantly bringing up her past in a way that was a little too much for him to have a neutral view of it or not be holding it against her. 

Others have said the breakup mayve been caused by fertility issues or a difference in desire for children

Others say it‚Äôs over the racy scene in the new Amazon Prime shows she‚Äôs acting in- Harlem. One scene involves her being propositioned to eat a man‚Äôs a$$ on screen. She declines him but they get as far as him being completely naked on the bed with his legs in the air waiting for her to do it with her head a few feet from his bare bum looking before she kicks him out. So of course the still shot of that is circulating and possibly giving a poor impression, even though she actually declines. And there are also some lesbian scenes in the show filmed by other actresses, which mayve been problematic to him owing to wanting to upkeep his image as pastor of a mega church. But honestly people were already questioning if they were separate because they hadnt been spotted together long before that 

Others have claimed he came off controlling/ overbearing, barely letting her speak in interviews. And like he was trying to mold her into the type of woman he wanted her to be

But the one thing I‚Äôm hearing that concerns me most is that there have also been accusations of subtle negging of her and things said to cut her down and make her insecure or lower her self esteem.

A lot of fonts cited the video clip below where he‚Äôs pinching her stomach and telling her she needs to work on it even though there‚Äôs nothing at all to pinch.

I‚Äôm mean if he wanted to say something about someone getting fit why not use himself as the reference rather than making her the butt of the joke. He should‚Äôve grabbed his own gut and said ‚Äú*I‚Äôm* trying to get this together. Hahaha‚Äù

It‚Äôs actually uncomfortable and angering to me. To the point where I want to hang out due to his redeeming qualities but then want to leave quickly when his dependence arises.

186,t3_rn8hiy,On scrutinizing the men in your community,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I created this alt account as it is suggested in the pinned post. Thank you to the hard working mods who will hopefully see this eventually!

First off, I have been single pretty much my entire adult life. I've always had high expectations and zero tolerance for bullshit. I come from a big family and am the only one of my siblings not married or in a LTR, which earned me the label of the 'perpetually single one.' None of them have ever understood my philosophy on this so I was glad to find this space where people finally get it.

While it's been easy for me to scroll and agree wholeheartedly with just about all the posts here, there's one topic that I feel like doesn't get enough attention and it's something I'm struggling with right now - men in your general community (not just the ones you consider dating.)

This past year I joined a female-focused cycling club. I was excited because I have been an avid cyclist for years, but I found a lot of cycling groups to be male-dominated and problematic. The leader of this group (I'll call Jane) seemed really cool and determined to make this group a women-friendly space. The group met once a week, and one ride a month was designated as women-only (but inclusive.) I became pretty close with a bunch of people in the group over the course of a few months, including a man who I'll refer to as Adam. I initially overlooked a lot of red flags with Adam because 1. I was not considering dating him and 2. he belonged to a feminist cycling club, so how bad could he be? ü§°

Adam introduced me to one of his friends who I had not met before (I'll call him Steve) and we started dating. I'll skip over the details because it's the classic story of ""he seemed 100% HV but uh oh turns out he was cheating on me the entire time."" Boring. Of course I blocked/deleted/erased him the moment I found out and never looked back. I had no intention on dwelling on that unfortunate experience for another moment, but then I got thinking. There's no way Adam didn't know his friend was cheating on me. I'm pretty sure there were even times where he was covering up for his friend. 

That's not the worst part.

It turns out Steve did the exact same thing to Jane a few years ago. And many other women. And Jane continues to maintain a friendship with Adam.

Adam, someone who I thought was my friend, encouraged me to date a serial cheating narcissist. Jane and other women in my community watched me fall into that trap without saying a word. I came out of the experience more or less unscathed (because I have zero fucks for cheaters) but I could have been seriously hurt. 

I proceeded to unfollow/block Adam and others who were complicit in Steve's abuse. This has unfortunately caused tension in the community. I made it clear that I no longer wanted to attend any ride or event where Adam was present. I didn't ask Jane to abolish him or anyone else, I just told everyone that I would not be there. Another woman in the group got super fucking mad at me for ""making them pick sides."" I did convince a few other women to do what I did (disassociate from the scrotes) which has divided the community further.

This infuriates me on so many levels. Adam, Steve, and the rest of their friends are PREDATORS. Full stop. They will never grow up, evolve, or change, because they are incapable of that. They do not care one iota about anyone else besides themselves, and they will throw anyone under the bus with zero hesitation the moment it benefits them. It blows my mind that it's difficult at all to choose a side in this. 

The Takeaways:

* You NEED to heavily vet all of the men in your community, not just the ones you're considering dating
* You need to vet even the women around you. If they tolerate bullshit around them, they will tolerate bullshit around you
* If a man has any history of cheating, he is RADIOACTIVE and needs to be avoided at all costs.
* Anyone who tolerates predators is a predator
* ANYONE WHO TOLERATES MISOGYNISTS IS A MISOGYNIST
* There's no such thing as a completely safe space so don't ever let your guard down

In the end, I'm not heartbroken over a cheating scrote. But I am heartbroken over losing what I thought was a positive community. Adam has reached out to me in an attempt to mend things, but I have not responded. There is no way to mend this.",222.0

Enjoy being in your solitude, in your comfort.

I was understanding, as being a tradfem housewife appealed to me when I was younger. I liked her lifestyle and was interested watching about their relationship.....

...... until it was revealed that he goes out and has sex with other women. His ""wife"" knows and is ""fine with it.""

I'll be honest, I stopped watching after that part. That's not a marriage. That's him being community penis, spreading STDs, and having a woman to come home and fuck (and also expose to illness) when none of the others are messaging him back.

Anyway, from what I could stomach before then, she was beautiful and articulate and seemed like a genuine, loving (though not to herself) person. He came off as arrogant (which was odd considering his appearance), detached, and selfish; the epitome of ""dom"" cringe.

I'm just saddened by this. A woman cannot let her guard down, even for a minute, without someone exploiting her. Men whine about how independent women are in relationships now yet ignore how much they've fucked up and can't be trusted to be loyal of their own free will (not because they don't have any other options). Who would want to give their all to someone who only gives a fraction of that?? What self-respecting woman wants to be made a fool of?

I'd love to be in that kind of relationship with a non-cringe man leading most of the time. But I will be damned if I ever let loyalty make an idiot out of me. I will be damned if I ever let a man take something from me without getting the same in return. I will die before I ever consent to being seen as an item in someone's collection.

I say ""had to"" because if I didn't do this ""tradition"" he would pout and act like a jerk all day. The reason I dreaded it is because it was rancid. He wouldnt go clean up first (because it would ruin the tradition of ""surprising him"" üôÑ). It was basically forced on me in the name of tradition, but I was young and naive and didn't even realize I was being manipulated. Then throughout the day he'd pester me for more of them and ""challenge"" me to break the record for the previous year. He knew I hated it.

Anyway, as I was telling this story I was expecting the women I was with to be horrified. I was shocked and really sad by their nonchalant reaction because it turned out I wasn't alone, like at all.

One said she always gets at least one sex toy ""gift"" from her husband (which are never the kinds she wants, and totally more for his pleasure than hers) and no matter how busy or tired she is (she's a mom) she always has to use his ""gift"" otherwise he acts like a jerk.

I'm soooo happy to be past that and free from that (this Christmas season with my bf has been lovely). But I'm just so sad that it's a thing.

Almost forgot to say: the women with kids said their husbands don't even help with any of the Christmas work. Which I can't even wrap my head around. I feel like it would be so fun to play Santa together. Like I feel like that would be one of the joys of having kids?

Men resent household labor so much, they'd be OK if their wives/gfs did everything on their own and had no free time, but if they have to actually resolve the issue they'll just delegate it to another poor woman. 

BTW, my mom cleaned houses and there are many situations where hiring a cleaner is needed and understandable. I'm talking about the relationships where the woman does the lion's share, gets tired of it, cOmMuNiCaTeS that and the man instead of taking responsibility uses a considerable portion of the household budget to hire someone else to do it. 

If this happens to someone you know or yourself, I believe it's an orange/red flag.

EDIT: My problem is not people hiring help. You could be living alone, be able-bodied and have tons of free time and if you want and can afford to pay a cleaner well then go for it. It's that these men were perfectly ok with receiving a woman's free labor until she had enough, they'll be ready to spend HER money to avoid doing anything.",876.0

198,t3_rmv0pm,Beware of 'moody' men,"In my experience, 'moodiness' goes hand in hand with being wishy-washy, unreliable, unstable, and inconsistent in their feelings. I bring two examples:

**Ex #1:** social butterfly, swinging between manic activity/happiness, depression, and anger. (He was pretty extreme as he turned out to have bipolar, but regardless of that...)

**Good mood:** he was affectionate, 'loved' me, cheerful, full of initiative, etc.

**Bad mood:** he turned stone cold and indifferent, he lazied around, he hated everything and everyone, me included. He treated me like he couldn't stand me and got irritated by everything, annoyed by any of my 'needs' (e.g. simply speaking to him!). His affection evaporated.

Hand in hand with that, when he was **Bored**, it was a sign that the relationship was going bad and he didn't like me. It was like it was my fault because I wasn't 'entertaining' enough and didn't magically make his mood better. He would jump on any new girl around to chat because the novelty entertained him.

I call this the '**shiny new toy syndrome**'. I was the old boring toy he had no emotional attachment to, and he latched onto any shiny new toy that could bring him a bit of entertainment.

**Anger:** lastly, he turned to having rage outbursts too, where of course I was the main target. When I stood up for myself against his neglectful behavior, he exploded into screaming rage because I wanted to 'control' him and 'take away his freedom'.

That was when he started turning very abusive and spiralling out of control, so it's slightly beside the point as a) it's an extreme case and b) we should walk away at the first 'rage' anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ex #2:** a very different person - reflexive, sensitive, calm and slow, a bit of a hermit. But in hindsight, I notice similarities...

**Good mood:** he was sweet and affectionate, bringing me little gifts/flowers, cuddling, etc. The relationship was going well; I was a good partner. I honestly believed he had genuine feelings for me.

**Bad mood:** he shut down completely, spent days alone, barely spoke to me. I thought he was dealing with his own issues but his affection for me was constant: I was wrong. It turns out he felt that the relationship was going badly, that there was something wrong with me. He turned cold, unfeeling, indifferent. His affection evaporated.

Hand in hand with this, he was **Bored** and it seems like he also faulted me for this. It was a sign that the relationship had run its course. I felt the pressure to be 'entertaining' to keep him happy.

Enter the **shiny new toy syndrome**: if a new person/girl showed up that was interesting and entertaining, he suddenly would be spending all his time with them, happy and egaged again, while neglecting me, the old boring toy. (more moderately than Ex #1; but the dynamic was the same).

**Anger:** While he never had angry outbursts, he eventually told me that when I told him about a behavior of his I found hurtful, his reaction was one of anger as if I was 'controlling' and 'threatening his freedom'. He never acted on it and worked through it aware that it was a trigger of his, and not actually my fault, but the instinctive reaction was the same nonetheless.

**Conclusion:**

Let's set aside the differences, which were quite dramatic, and focus on the similarities.

In both cases, their affection for me and their perception of whether the relationship was good or bad went up and down like a yo-yo following their mood swings. They were not constant and independent from their mood like in 'normal' people.

Their dramatic mood swings completely altered their behavior, their outlook on life, their personality, their relationships, and their feelings.

Their feelings were fleeting and superficial, mostly about whether they felt happy and entertained in that exact moment. If they weren't, rather than deepening the existing connection, they latched on any 'shiny new toy' that offered a bit of novelty and entertainment.

They were able to offer affection and thoughtfulness when in a good mood, but it became a chore they resented and couldn't be bothered with when their mood changed. I wonder if it was an 'act' of how they felt they were 'supposed' to behave with a girlfriend, rather than genuine. They became neglectful and indifferent. If I needed moral support or was sick, they were indifferent.

They were extremely self-centered and self-absorbed by their internal turmoil and unable/unwilling to consider anyone else's emotional needs.

They were selfish: happy to enjoy relationship perks - me going out to buy food, give a massage, etc - but never willing to return them (except occasionally when in a good mood).

They were, ultimately, unable to form a deep, meaningful connection, unable to go beyond a superficial level of 'feeling good in the moment'.

They were both similarly distant from their family, didn't have long-term meaningful friendships, didn't get attached to any place they lived in (hard for me to spot this red flag as I'm also a traveller; but I do have attachments and emotions to people and places, even though our behavior looks similar).

**My mistake:** was believing that despite the mood swings, their underlying core of emotions was stable and consistent. It was not. And that they were capable of a deep, permanent connection: they were not. It all came and went fleetingly with their mood swings.",428.0

203,t3_rmrp8u,I just walked out of my dad's house,"This weekend I was sick and had to cancel tree decorating plans with my dad and other holiday plans of my own. I was disappointed, but that's life. Dad has been wanting me over, Christmas is a sentimental time for him. He's LV with rare HV moments. Very rare.

We finalized plans to have dinner at his place or a restaurant near. I drove over with a box of wine I told him I was leaving there because it wasn't my taste.

I get there. He's got no drinks. No eggnog or mixers. Nothing. I don't think he even opened the fridge until I got there. This man is so lazy. His gf, me and him got takeout that had a hair in the sauce so we just ate dry breaded chicken. I wanted him to say ""no, this is gross let's get pizza instead"" (I even suggested pizza instead of the shitty place they picked) but nope.

So we had shitty takeout and drank watered down whiskey. This was Christmas for us because he couldn't be bothered to go out and do a proper shop to make sure we were comfortable. I don't blame his gf, it's not her responsibility.

I just felt like shit the whole night, I was so upset and hurt. After dinner we were sitting and I mentioned I was going home to cook dinner. It just kinda poured outta me, I was nearly in tears. I said  it was disrespectful, rude and hurtful. He wasn't taking me seriously, I could read on his face he thought I was being silly. He asked ""because we don't have drinks?"" in kinda sarcastic tone. I answered ""no, because there's no effort. When I entertain, I prep because I care and want people to enjoy themselves. You knew I was coming over and have nothing to serve me.""  There was more along those lines, but I can't remember it all now. I didn't yell or go crazy. I think they were stunned by how upset I was out of nowhere. He made excuses (well I didn't put the hair in there!) and deflected. He never took responsibility or accountability for anything.

I feel bad for walking out on Christmas, but then I'm WHAT KINDA CHRISTMAS WAS THAT. I knew it was going to be shit, I just didn't know it would be this crappy. he even dropped the gift amount down and when I asked about it he just laughed it off.

Overall I'm proud I articulated my feelings and didn't play along. He's not a malicious mean guy, he's a very lazy and selfish boomer who had a stay at home wife then live in gf.

I know he's emotionally immature, I've read the book, and I was reminding myself of that on my way over. But I feel like this is a boundary and respect issue. You don't repeatedly invite someone over (esp after she had to postpone due to illness) then have nothing but potato chips and shitty takeout.

I've been doing a lot of work on myself to become HV but I'm also trying to remain realistic about the actual person. I think the HV thing to do would be to call him tomorrow to apologize for leaving, but then to stand firmly by what I said and hold his feet to the fire.

Would appreciate other perspectives.

So I work in an department with all ladies and since October we‚Äôve been doing a weight loss challenge among ourselves till the end of the year. Every one of us have lost some weight and the one leading the challenge has lost about a total of 5kg (about 11lbs). We‚Äôve seen some changes in her face where it looks slimmer. However I have this scrote of an older colleague from a different department who kept going around saying that he can‚Äôt see any changes and that she‚Äôs still the same size despite her best efforts in eating clean and hiring a personal trainer to achieve her goals. He even told another colleague that while she looks like she has lost some weight, he prefers it when she was heavier.

He tried to mansplain workouts to us, telling me there is no point in lifting weights and gave unwarranted tips on the types of exercises that can help with weight loss. 

I told him that it was a very rude thing to say considering we all put in effort to better ourselves. This scrote actually tried to justify his negging, saying that he needs to be mean so that the ladies will take it as a ‚Äúpositive remark‚Äù and will ‚Äúwork harder to lose more weight‚Äù.

212,t3_rmkh8f,Compartmentalize your empathy for male family members - their troubles simply aren't the same as yours and shouldn't consume you the same way.,"I had taken the time when I last visited one of my uncles to level with him about how unhappy he seemed to be overall. His marriage and job seemed to be really destroying him. He agreed. We discussed practical matters such as paperwork to have straight in a divorce, benefits of him staying in his current house/city/job, etc.

He bought a sports car his wife hates. He does all the cliche man in his 50s acting like a man in his 20s shit. Basically, actually depressed and resentful unless he's actively fulfilling every single one of his own whims money wise and trying to ""sow his wild oats"" sexually after decades of aging and 2 divorces. Because ""he never got to have fun"". Grow up, Peter Pan.

Now he's thirsting after girls on tiktok, commenting publicly and donating tons of money to them.

**I no longer care what happens in his marriage, or his divorce. I no longer care about why he's unhappy with life.** see how that works? I'm glad I helped give him the confidence to really lean into his scrotey self, because now I can grant myself the peace of no longer giving a fuck what he does.

I compartmentalize my empathy for men. Wonder why the ""man up"" cliche started? Probably because some whiney entitled scrote couldn't fuck the hottest person in the room and externalized those stupid woes and another individual actually present in reality told him exactly where the fuck to put that attitude.

Women are pressured to look at relationships in terms of lost opportunity rather than sunken cost, and to question what we could have done better rather than what the other person has done wrong. We shouldn't be questioning relationships based on what we are not doing right or lost opportunity with others, but we should be tallying the resources that we are putting in.

Time is our most valuable asset; we can always make more money, more friends, and find things to make us happy, healthy, and safe. If someone is wasting our time or affecting our health, then they are taking something from us that we can't get back. You may regret hurting a friend, quitting a job, or building debt, but these are all things that can be resolved with hard work and time.

I'm aware that most breakup songs are about scrotes, and I can't help but think about how much time we waste crying and being sad about them. But I find that women aren't used to seeing us thrive out and about. They used to tell us to smile more, but women who walk with confidence are negged until they lose their power, or they are so discouraged that they stop leaving the house. 

When I listen to empowering pop by female artists, I realize how original it is, how even I'm not used to hearing how a woman can pay her own rent, buy her own home, and live independently. I wait for the other shoe to drop, when she says she also has sex with however many men she pleases. Nowadays, to my relief, that's less common‚Äîwomen are generally fed up and starting to write a new narrative about how good life can be for us.

But I go online, and each day there is new suffering. In movies and shows, women experience trauma regularly.

218,t3_rmeat3,How Are You Treating Yourself this Holiday Season?,"This post is your annual reminder to treat yourself lavishly. I think it is especially important if you‚Äôre single to make sure you buy some gifts for yourself each holiday, though don‚Äôt bypass this tradition if you‚Äôre partnered either. If you attend to your own wants and desires, you‚Äôll be less resentful and thirsty for just any man or relationship and the next man that wants to date you will need to meet that high bar of respect and love you have set for yourself.

I usually buy myself some high end frivolous beauty products. This year I splurged on a luxe skincare set from Biossance and a complete kit to do dip powder nails from Revel. Then I try to get some items for self enrichment/learning/or hobbies. I bought three books off my wishlist, a subscription to a gorgeous lifestyle magazine called Enchanted Living, and an exquisite plant propagation station from an artist in Poland. Other ideas to buy for yourself might be a special piece of jewelry, tools or materials for a new hobby, high end kitchen tools, artisan made chocolates, a membership to a museum or conservatory‚Ä¶

I have also started to make some new traditions for myself surrounding food and parties. A couple weeks before Xmas I organize a cookie exchange with 12 of my friends. It‚Äôs so nice to have a big assortment of Christmas cookies. And every year I make a Christmas Day breakfast complete with mimosas and my favorite pricey espresso for cappuccinos, and later I make a lavish cheese fondue to graze on while I unwrap gifts. Before Covid I also started having a solstice party with friends. I think it is all about creating your own rich culture and traditions around the holidays, so that you don‚Äôt seek out an unfulfilling relationship with a ‚ÄúMr Right Now.‚Äù Valentine‚Äôs Day and your birthday are also important times to do this too.

Not dating related per se, but it is about young women and the impact of stalking. Plus, my sister just experienced having her purse stolen last night FROM INSIDE HER HOUSE. She was deeded this house, in a better neighborhood, by our late dad, who only died four months ago. Last night, she forgot to lock her back door, so hard lesson learned. She was relaxing in the back bedroom and dozed off, and I think we've all been there. We highly suspect next door neighbor's son with a drug problem.

222,t3_rmc23h,and another thing on not ever dating single fathers,"I'm vastly amused, first of all, that my post kept getting zero upvotes, even after a kind queen here said she upvoted -- and sure enough, the total stayed at zero. That just tells me I hit a nerve, so buckle in, I'm about to hit a lot more nerves, hopefully this time with a damn sledgehammer. Scrotes, you can damn well die mad for what I'm about to say here.

Besides my worst fear of having a man just dump his kids on me so he can work like a maniac and avoid spending time with his kids, that right there is the prime reason I will never marry a third time, nor ever live with a man again. Separate houses, separate finances for the win.

The other thing I'd always want to avoid is him ABANDONING his kids with the first female stranger he deems remotely responsible enough, and just high-tailing it off into the wild blue yonder to go live a kid-free life. That's a fear, too. However, I'm not nice or nurturing; I'd never get in that position anyway, and I'd have no compunction about turning said kids over to foster care. Not only do I not have the skills or temperament to be a mother in the first place, much less a step-mother, I have no desire, no vocation, no wish ever to be a foster parent. I lean hard into my selfishness: I'm not about to take on anyone else's child(ren) for days, weeks, months, years. Not what I signed up for at all. Your kids, your responsibility, not any of mine.

Most of the reason I wouldn't date a single father is the presumption that he's different, his kid(s) are different and special, and they'll take to you, you'll love them, gaslighting blah blah, again, so he has to do less work, and I and other women get roped into doing more and more and more and ultimately ALL the work. And I'm not just talking all the housework, shopping, bill paying, all the mundane practical chores, I'm also quite obviously talking about all the emotional labor too: all the remembering, the noticing, the picking up, putting away, keeping tidied that goes unnoticed. Oh, and let's not forget: the goal posts always keep moving, so I could easily imagine a situation turning abusive where if something is done well, it's never enough, and if something is enough, it's never good enough. No thanks, no appreciation, no collaboration, no mutuality, just unpaid domestic slavery. But hey, at least you got picked! You're LOVED... for being an intelligent pack mule. For being USEFUL.

Being a step-parent means shouldering the entire load of an immature, dependent child, yet getting no credit (maybe decades later, after the child grows up and their frontal lobe matures... maybe?). It means having no power to enforce discipline, either, other than the bare minimum of not taking any physical abuse. I'd even argue that a child who acts out and mouths off, there's not a lot you can do in that situation other than remove yourself and/or just stop interacting. I don't know about any of y'all, but in a close, tense situation like that, where the bio parent isn't around, I'd take precisely zero of that and nope the hell out. Come get your kid or tell me where I can drop them off, I'm getting my stuff and leaving, we're done. Your child hates me, and the stress is NOT AT ALL worth it.

I'll finish here by saying that keeping separate housing and separate money goes a long, long way toward preventing \*most\* abuse and manipulation. Taking things super slow also helps prevent abuse, and runs off most users, who can't fake interest over the long haul. There's a whole lot to be said for asking a man, too, why he would have primary custody of his children instead of the mother. Someone else said, and I'm magnifying: it would take a hell of a lot for a mother to walk off without her kids. I'll say that the first thing I'd suspect is alcohol and drugs. That's some shitshow drama I'd never want to be involved with long-term, so no wonder the single father can't find anyone to date or marry long-term, especially if the bio mother is messed up.",481.0

Let me also say that shame can and should be resisted. It is, after all, what people try to impose on other people, to change and/or manipulate behavior.

At which point, for us ladies do we even count and if we do, what even matters? Is it a person we do any kind of sexual activity with? Is it PIV only? It is a partner who we orgasm with?  I ask, because I was wondering if we would have different numbers depending on how we actually count?  

Also, if we follow the definition of PIV leading to orgasm, how many would have 0 and would many women be having immaculate conceptions?",346.0

232,t3_rlyb87,TW and Spoilers: Depictions of Male Violence/Serial Killers vs Cultural Porn Fantasies,"I had a terrifying realization about today's culture. We know p()rn is violent and depraved. We know anything in our worst nightmares is probably floating in the darkest corners of the web. 

But, the parallels of our p()rny expectations, plus a movie depiction of a serial predator/killer hit me deeply today.

Example: I was watching the movie Eye for an Eye (1996). The main character (MC) was played quite well. The (obvious) antagonist reminded me of the worst of pornsick men we see on this site, as an example. 

TW content below: 

In the movie, the MC's minor teenage daughter is raped then murdered by a very smug, violent man. The killer stalks, beats, rapes, then kills women as his MO, including an innocent housewife (for whom he delivered groceries).  The Killer threatens Main Character, including a threat of sexual violence toward MC's prepubescent daughter. 

I won't spoil the ending, but some things about the movie bothered me immensely: 

1. MC's daughter (17) was murdered, but she didn't tell her younger daughter (4?) why her sister died. Obviously she could have made it age appropriate with the help of a professional, but she made zero indication to the daughter her older sister's death was related to a dangerous man. The little girl was blaming herself and thought her sister died because it was her birthday, because she is a CHILD. The mother did not tell the little girl to run away/tell an adult if she saw a strange man. Nothing. Lamb to the slaughter. Thank goodness she was never harmed in the movie. I was taught about stranger danger as a child and dodged many creeps. I was lucky, and so many of our sisters were not. üòû 

 2. Meanwhile, the MC's younger daughter was being stalked by the killer. To mind-f___ MC and groom the daughter, the killer was hiding in the schoolyard playhouse with the daughter. He was pretending to be ""nice""  to her and play with the toy kitchen set during her recess. When she did not return to the building, one of the male students alerted a female teacher. The student pointed to the playhouse in concern, as the daughter was in the playhouse with the man while the other kids rushed back to the school building. The stupid smug teacher ignored him, ushered him inside, and forgot the daughter. I wanted the mother to rip into them, but it did not happen. How many times are little girls ignored by female figures and exposed to danger? More than I can think about. Negligence or pickmeism, it doesn't matter. Together with other incidents, this is part of how we fail to protect our girls and fail to encourage rheir self-protective instincts.  

3. The way the killer taunted MC, his depraved sexual  descriptions of her daughters (again, both underage) were eerily similar to what you would see on dark  corners of Reddit and other sites catering to pornsick men. 


Main Takeaways: 

1. PROTECT YOUR KIDS! Don't sit there like a fish with its mouth open when your gut tells you your child is in danger. Instill in your children the danger of strangers, kidnapping, and the existence of people who are capable of harming them/acting inappropriately. Look at Elizabeth Smart-- she was so very sheltered to the point of being primed into what a predator would see as an ""ideal"" target. She did not fight back when she was abducted out of her home...IIRC the predator threatened or lied about killing her family, and she believed the lie. She believed myths about sex she thought would protect her from being raped. The monsters who abducted her are responsible for their actions, but her parents could have given her age-appropriate information about dangerous people. Dangerous people are notorious for lying to children, using threats, and preying on naivete as a means to an end. Much like the p()rn industry grooming adults into acts with promises of ethicality and choice. 

2. I was deeply disturbed realizing, moreso than the usual, how many men are fantasizing about the precursors to Ted Bundy types of acts. Snvff films did exist decades ago, but mainstream sites like P()rnhub and Reddit show violent depravity flirting with it. 

3. Our society is literally conditioning men to act like serial rapists/killers. It is expected, aspirational, unavoidable, a way to ""fit in."" 

4. Younger women on FDS: Bd$m, str4ngling, an4l, roughness, anything other than ""vanilla"" was NOT normal in the Western world as recent as a decade or so ago. Maybe two decades. 

5. Be critical of the media you consume. If a female rapper/singer mentions ""ch0king"" in her media, realize it is performative libfem sex pozzy bullshit directed by men, to ultimately serve this cultural direction tonight toward ""lite"" versions of snvff films . Again, why would a woman, in a vacuum, want a man to do something serial killers/rapists/sex offenders/molesters do? 

6. Sex pozzy forces, bastardized ""feminism,"" and other aspects of the patriarchy will pressure you to lower standards, abandon gut instinct, and be naive. In another subreddit, a poster wrote about ""intellectual"" virginity, and how modern society encourages it. Like MC's little girl (her failure to warn her daughter about the killer/stranger danger), young women are especially lambs to the slaughter. Onlyfans, stripping, sugaring, and other depravity are being marketed to young women on tiktok. Older women in dating subreddits are pressured to be vulnerable, ""communicate,"" accept less, waste time etc, etc. I could not unsee this connection as a societal metaphor. 

Ladies, be careful out there. Know your worth and listen to your gut. If you feel like prey in the presence of a man, it is so for a reason.",95.0

&amp;#x200B;

This just happened like 2 hours ago. It is a mix of me overcoming **some** PickMeism, and some more proof that men know what they are **NOT** doing. If he wanted to, **he would**.

**TLDR;** I‚Äôd told him all this shit already before, he couldn‚Äôt figure it out; and suddenly when he‚Äôs going to be dumped he knows just what to do. I don‚Äôt feel too good about how long I stayed and what a pick me I still am. I don't feel too good at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Long Version**

So, I was dating another scrote for a good while. I really don‚Äôt want to admit how long tbh. Please be somewhat gentle with me, I am actively working on my fear of ‚Äúbeing mean‚Äù with a therapist. It takes steps and work to be HVW, I can‚Äôt do it overnight. Here‚Äôs what he did/didn‚Äôt do:

* Never took me on even ONE fucking date (I know)
* Interrupted me All‚Ä¶. The‚Ä¶ Time. Even sometimes telling me I could now continue talking, when he was done
* Mansplained my fucking career to me
   * He even once mansplained to me what oatmeal is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
* Always said aggressive kind of shitty things like ‚Äúwhat did you expect?‚Äù. (Do ya‚Äôll get what I mean by that?)
* He was broke (he was trying to improve this, but actually so clueless he just didn‚Äôt know how to)
* He was also another one of the million scrotes who can‚Äôt keep a clean home or dress himself properly
* He couldn‚Äôt adult very well at all in general
* I told him to clean his home. After he started cleaning.. He wanted a gold star or a cookie for keeping a clean home. Like it was something special. Why are they like this?

He came over tonight to pick his things up. He knew I was gonna dump him. He shows up with MULTIPLE Christmas presents and a card (I still haven‚Äôt opened them, I just can‚Äôt). And a big date planned out for Friday night.

I‚Äôve already told him I want gifts and dates. We‚Äôve been doing this for MONTHS. At first he claimed ‚Äúeverything goes wrong when I plan dates, I‚Äôm not good at it‚Äù, ‚ÄúI never know what to get for gifts, I wish women would just tElL mE.‚Äù WELL HE SUDDENLY KNEW WHAT TO BUY ME AND HOW TO TAKE ME ON A FREAKIN DATE DIDN‚ÄôT HE??? They know exactly what they are doing. **If they wanted to, they would**.

I truly hope that this time, I will actually take the time to heal and reflect on my own actions rather than jumping into the next relationship. So I can learn to enforce my boundaries and not be afraid to speak up for myself. No one can say I didn‚Äôt try, I tried so hard. I put up with things I hated, I tried to communicate, I was often hurt and sad, or unsatisfied. Why do men think that when I give and try to be a good kind human, that it is a pass to walk all the fuck over me. This isn‚Äôt right.",328.0
235,t3_rlw1s8,What does an involved father look like?,"I was at a cafe today when a man strolled in with his preschooler. The child was being annoying in a way that would have stopped if his dad put away the phone and interacted with his kid. If he had been a woman, I would have given the benefit of the doubt: we‚Äôre generally expected to do everything without complaint, much less act like we‚Äôre people with our own needs. I feel that some women might really be getting one of their few breaks in their day by checking their phones.

At some point, the boy decided he was hurt. If you‚Äôve spent a lot of time around kids, you know what this is like: maybe there was a sliver of crust on his sandwich, or the cheese didn‚Äôt taste like the Kraft singles they have at home. He wasn‚Äôt hurt-hurt, but upset-hurt.

Just as I was preparing for a whole lot of inattention, his dad asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Come here‚Äù and opened his arms. The child walked over, snuggled in, nestled against his dad‚Äôs chest, and started to tell him.

It seemed small and obvious, but most kids I know wouldn‚Äôt react that way to somebody they don‚Äôt feel bonded to. It made me think of this group, and that this is something to aim for if you want kids: somebody who will be a dad, get to know his kids and how to comfort them.

He calls me the next day to meet him for a date 'in the city'- an area with many stores, bars&amp; restaurants. I get off the train &amp; he is right there. We begin walking &amp; talking down a main street. After quite a bit of walking, I ask him how far the restaurant is or wherever we're going. He said he wasn't hungry &amp; hoped we could just get to know each other while walking. ü§ØSeriously? I told him, no we cannot &amp; I went to a cafe &amp; had a fine meal with a glass of wine.

244,t3_rlrukc,Let‚Äôs bring back shame! Society does not shame men enough!,"I strongly believe the issues we‚Äôre facing today with men is because we‚Äôve erased the necessity of shame. The level of problems with men experienced today are monumental and unprecedented. There used to be societal levels of pressure and shame against men that did not conform and serve a purpose in society. Get a job, join the military, raise a family, commit to a relationship, etc. Now, it‚Äôs unacceptable to think your partner should not be playing video games all day, jerking off, and never proposing. You should just be strung along throughout your 20s without hope of commitment, when our grandmothers would never dream of it. 

the social crises we are currently experiencing on the gender and sexual fronts are ones of normalization.
people no longer want to feel ashamed for anything shameful they are or do, and thus are demanding unprecedented levels of social acceptance. as little as 20 years ago, if you wanted to wear cat ears and go for walkies on a leash by a neckbeard you called daddy -- you'd keep that shit to your fucking self.

society would not be involved, let alone you trying to actively broadcast your ""kink"" as a personality trait. ... now, every deviant and their dog wants a ""community"" in which to feel ""validated"" and talk ad nauseam about their desires in an attempt to avoid the shame that is ORGANIC to such deviances. 

""normalization"" is the scourge to target. not the beliefs or actions themselves. Marshall McLuhan said ""the medium is the message,"" meaning broadly that the way content is delivered impacts the perception of the content, and thus the content itself.

Pornography's ""normalization"" is inherent to its mode of delivery. Porn used to be a physical thing which warranted hiding. It was tapes stashed behind the beaded curtains at the back of a video rental store, or lewd magazines carefully placed behind others at a 7-11. The mode of delivery communicated ""shame.""Now, porn is consumed on the same device you text your mother with, a tab away from the email you need to send to your boss, a swipe from tracking your dinner on UberEats.

It has become integrated to ""normality,"" and as such demands to be treated as such.",513.0

When their partner rightfully freaks out and is angry/sad/upset about it, he says ""but at least I was open and honest!"". This is an extremely manipulative tactic men use to escape accountability for what they have just admitted to AND to make you feel like you are overreacting.

 Being honest with your partner is the bare minimum. Men should not expect extra brownie points for being honest about doing something shitty. Men need to understand that being honest does not absolve them of responsibility for their actions, nor does it mean the person they are disclosing to has to take it on the chin and be all ""there, there Johnny, it wasn't that bad.""

251,t3_rlkumn,Weaponizing Communication and Trust,"Communication and trust are supposed to be foundational to healthy relationships. LVM/NVM know this, and they will attempt to weaponize these concepts to browbeat you into shouldering all the effort in a relationship. They will act as if cOmMuNiCaTiOn means you talk while they ignore you, and they talk while doing absolutely nothing constructive. They will act as if trust is just blindly believing someone who is acting like an ass, all because of magical Disney lOvE. 

This is a psychological torture method I've observed in my own past relationships and in the relationships of close friends with shitty boyfriends. 

Your trust is viewed as an entitlement, not something that must be earned. And any criticism or concern, no matter how gently worded, is viewed as an expression of distrust/lack of faith/personal attack. 

So if you have an issue with them, your options are (1) start a fight/provoke accusations and anger, (2), shut up and live with whatever consequences arise from your partner's action/inaction, or (3) deal with the problem yourself. 

Notice how this is designed to ensure that you cannot peacefully negotiate less work for yourself or more work for your partner. You can't even peacefully discuss things your partner doesn't want to discuss. The individual who has weaponized trust in the relationship is in complete control. If they don't want to do something, all they have to do is throw a tantrum that's disguised as hurt feelings over your lack of trust in them. They will claim that if you trusted and respected them, you wouldn't be worried about any of their behavior. You would just wait for them to do the things they need to do. 

If you bring up the fact that they never do anything without being asked, they will come up with stupid examples about that one time they cleaned a dish, changed a diaper, or filled out a job application without your direction. This argument will never go anywhere, regardless of how calm and rational you are in the face of their bullshit. They will get increasingly more angry and emotional, and they will eventually provoke you into being emotional as well, at which point they will ramp up their complaints that  *you're* being hurtful and irrational. 

This is especially effective if you've been shouldering more than your fair share for a long time. Your partner has a lot more free time and energy to dedicate to circular, emotional arguments. If they have to stay up all night fighting with you, no big deal. They can just sleep in the next morning while you're losing your mind with fatigue at work, caring for your child, etc. So you will be even more motivated to avoid option (1) in the future, and your partner gets to enjoy the fruits of your labor without hearing criticisms of their own slacking...at least for awhile. 

This cycle repeats indefinitely, until you either succumb entirely to the realization that you are just going to have to do everything or you leave the relationship, at which point your partner will act as if the deterioration of the relationship is your fault. ""Why didn't you CoMmUnIcAtE?,"" conveniently  glossing over the fact that you were righteously punished every time you tried to do that. 

For example, my ex-husband would not get a job. He would constantly talk about getting a job, he would promise to get a job after x weeks/months of trying some get-rich-quick scheme, but he would never actually sit down and look for one. Every time I brought it up, he would act hurt and offended that I didn't trust his judgement, I didn't respect him as a man, blah blah. ""Of course I'll get a job eventually, I just need to \[insert word salad excuse here\] first.""

Eventually, when this insane, infuriating behavior did not cause me to shut up about it, he started doing little token gestures shortly after I asked. Filling out an application. Taking some odd job that would never lead to anything permanent. Talking to some rando about ""opportunities."" 

Then when I brought up that, well look at that, it had been six months and he still didn't have a fucking job, he would whine about how he was working on it, why was I being so impatient? Why should he even try when I'm so unappreciative of his efforts? Blah blah. 

This is why you do. not. listen to this shit. You don't negotiate or discuss. You have to be ruthless in noting when he's not following through and cutting him off. I was obviously foolish to stay with him, but at the time I honestly did not even realize the crazy-making manipulation he was subjecting me to. I was too deep in fatigue and anxiety from the constant gaslighting. 

You cannot make a man be a good partner, no matter how much you sacrifice your own happiness and well being at the altar of trust and communication. Dealing with this shit is exhausting and confusing. The only way to win is not to play.",220.0

So let's begin. 

I met this guy through an online gaming platform. We had been playing together for hours. In game he was pretty cool and didn't give off any bad vibes. Still taking precautions, I added him on discord instead of a less private media such as instagram or snapchat. Through discord we continued chatting using the voice chat function after leaving the game (it was getting late). We're now sharing music and other common tastes. It's a great time. 

Suddenly he gets serious. 

""I have to tell you something."" 
He starts. I'm curious at the sudden change in tone and the overall vibe that we had going. Of course I engage this. ""What's going on?"" I reply. 

Nobody could have prepared me for what followed. 

After explaining his entire life story (he's been depressed, had no friends, attempted suicide, yada yada blah blah), he proceeded to explain how he's done ""bad"" things to other women. 

At this point I'm already SHOCKED. I stay silent. He continues and it goes a little something like this. 
""I've done some really bad things to YOUNGER women and I'm not proud of it....but I've changed!""

He's ""changed"" he claimed. 

I'm still silent up until this point. I chime in with a small ""uh huh."" I'm internally freaking out. What have I done?? How did we go from playing GAMES to talking about possible SERIOUS assault he has committed??? 

Apparently he ""doesn't tell this information to just anyone"". Oh no no. He's telling me because he has sooooo much trust in this stranger he met THAT DAY!

This guy proceeds to dig his own grave. 

Turns out not only has he manipulated and assaulted possible minors. He's also known for HACKING PHONES AND FINDING LOCATIONS!!! 

I'm scared shitless at this point. But I still inquire how he does it. At this point I was seeking out information to assure he hasn't had the chance to do it to me yet. He brags that it's super easy but not just anyone can do it. You have to have ties to legal information - which he apparently has through his dad. 

Oh, but I shouldn't worry because he'll ""never"" do it to me because I'm ""different"".

As I'm typing this I have him blocked on every place I had him added. For extra precautions I've also abandoned that discord account. He can have it. 

I'm unsure what to do with myself right now as I accidentally exposed myself to a literal demon. I always use false names online, so he doesn't have my legal name. Nor does he know my face. But he DOES know which country I'm from and a rough idea of where I'm located (through in game conversation) and it's slightly worrying. 

TLDR: Man I met for 12 hours confessed out of no where to being a possible rapist/pedophile while simultaneously telling me he's able to hack into phones and computers to find the locations/information of people through legal systems his dad operates.",393.0

Again at 15 minutes early.

I offered to stay after my appointment in the waiting room just to make sure he wasn‚Äôt going to murder her. She was super grateful and asked if I wouldn‚Äôt mind staying a little longer after he left too.

Men have no idea what it‚Äôs like to feel threatened like this. She also said that only men ask her if she will do the fully body scrub required prior to spray tanning.

257,t3_rlghjz,cringe Slate post on 50/50," **Feeling split:** When my girlfriend and I started dating, I noticed that she never reached for the check when at dinner, bars, etc. I found this unusual because in my previous relationships, my partner and I would split every check. When I asked my girlfriend why she didn‚Äôt pay, she said because of the damage men had done to the world (through rape culture, violence against women, the wage gap, ‚Äúboys clubs,‚Äù and the patriarchy in general), I should pay for her. She didn‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúreparations‚Äù but that is essentially what she was saying.

I understand her point at a macro level. However, from a day-to-day standpoint, though I earn more than her currently, she comes from a wealthy family who subsidizes her lifestyle, while I am actually sending money back home to my parents. She went to private school, I went to public school. It seems to me that from an ‚Äúintersectional‚Äù lens, we both have some sort of privilege.

I also don‚Äôt understand why this issue in particular is so salient. I asked her if she paid for her Black friends because of the structural racism Black people face and the corresponding wealth/wage gap, and she said that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel as personal to her.‚Äù

We are at an impasse here. How should this be addressed?

**A:** Dating is a time for noticing when you‚Äôre at an impasse and decide not to get more serious. It is not a time for insisting that every difference and personality conflict must be resolved. Here, you‚Äôve learned that you and your girlfriend don‚Äôt share values about who should pay on dates. But more than that, you now know that she‚Äôs not interested in being a team player when it comes to expenses‚Äîeven though she‚Äôs wealthier than you are‚Äîand either doesn‚Äôt care much about structural racism, or only cares about structural issues that provide a basis for her to do whatever she wants. Do these things make you like her a bit less and feel a bit less compatible with her? Ask yourself that, rather than trying to figure out how to change her.

1.OLD Isn't that bad, it is a safe way to meet menüò¥
2. OLD Helps you to set boundaries (uh?)
3. I know Kyle en Jane met up via Tinder they have a wonderful relationship (ok)
4. I don't do much with OLD, it's just for the attention ü§°
5.OLD Is the only way to meet men whilest in a pandemic, I mean where else can I meet tHe mAn oF mY dReAmS now?  *sis*..ü•¥ 

1. The dangers of dating online affects twice as much women then men. 33% Of women experienced offensive name-calling.. 11% Of women threats to phsycial harm. 
(I believe the percentage is **way** higher)
Each year, 100 abductions take place by online predators. People who use dating apps are twice more likely to experience sexual abuse. https://2date4love.com/dangers-of-online-dating-statistics/

2. No. Why? It is far more easy to assert boundaries through a screen, you can come of more assertive whilest it's nothing compared with placing a boundary in real life, with real human contact. If you're struggling with boundaries anyway; therapy, therapy, therapy (!!!). The only boundary you need online is: block and delete. You don't owe anyone an explanation why you don't want to be talked to in a certain way online, let alone a fucking stranger. To hell with that, bye.

4. Again: Therapy. If your life revolves about attention and validation only from men (or even from anyone outside you but to stay on topic) I really suggest therapy. Think about why do you need to be validated by a strange man from the internet?
As long as you don't validate yourself first and you continue to **only** search it outside of yourself, you are a bottomless pit in pickme-land. 

5. It's a fucking pandemic. The chances you'll meet a cult leader from TRP who's antivaxxed and stands in the shower doing the Wim Hoff method to make his non existing dingdong completely disappear even more is pretty high. You don't need that. No one needs that. Take care of yourself and your family and friends around you. **Especially** if the measurements are high in your area. I really don't need to explain this further. 

To conclude: to put yourself in a basically ""pickme-catalogue"" free to be swiped left or right while the man you're matched with has been shitting on the toilet whilest matching you, copies his lame boring messages to approximately 25 other women at the same time to fill a void and waste your precious time.. it's not recommended.
Precious time that you can invest in you, your hobbies, your career, your family, your friends, your kids (if you have them), going to the gym or doing some other fun activities. 
There. Is. So. Much. More. Then finding a man online. 

I do have to say that if you want to do it, you're free to do it (obviously) but PLEASE BE SAFE. Stay on guard and look at some OLD posts here how to properly vet online.

But even so, combining families, becoming a step-mother just sounds gruelling, arduous, uphill all the way. There just don't seem to be many, if any, good points to being a step-parent, specifically a step-mother.

What would any single woman get out of dating a single man, unless she can't have kids, and is willing to step into that role? My fear, especially as a childfree woman, is that a NVM wants a woman to just dump his kid on while he plays video games, or goes off and just lives his life while she's the angel in the house. He would then expect her to run the entire household and manage him too, as a manbaby and project.

I'm venting here because The Idiot With 10,000 Names contacted me yet again, with yet another new name, and tried to run roughshod over my clearly stated boundaries. It underscores just how much my wants, needs, standards, preferences don't count with this scrote and idiots like him, and just how much more I stick to those wants, needs, standards and preferences as a way to exert my will over his. If this is all about power, dominance, and control, which I highly suspect, then my will is the way things are. Any single father would bring no value whatsoever into my life, and would be a negative value.

278,t3_rkrptu,YOU alone get to determine your standards!,"
Your standards are YOURS. No one gets to tell you they are unfair, too rigid, or unrealistic because YOU have to live with what you accept. 

Lowering your standards can lead to being stuck in a situation that is very likely to steal your happiness, stability and sometimes even your safety.

Just a reminder: there are many women (even on this sub) that have found HVM. The men who are spending their time on this subreddit in order to criticize us having standards are triggered because deep down they know they are not up to par. I don't have the time (or care) to spend on a men's subreddit telling them they they have standards that aren't ""fair"". If they want to have specific standards, it does nothing to me. If they walk the talk, then they will probably be able to get someone who meets their standards, If they don't- then they won't. Simple as that and not my business. The interesting thing is that many of these Reddit men cannot control themselves when they see that a woman has standards and it irritates them so much that they try to send messages or post. 

When they cannot control their feelings of inadequacy, they offload them onto others by attempting to control and gaslight the other person into feeling inadequate.  

Apparently, it triggers Reddit men that I am a divorced woman over 30 with kids, that has standards regarding what I consider to be an acceptable partner. My standards are mine and I ask for nothing that I can't contribute myself. Why would I put up with less ? In real life, I have noticed no difference between my child free 20s and my divorced with children 30s. Men rise to the occasion and meet the standards. Men in my age bracket understand that many individuals have children in this age bracket and it does not deter them.

I can tell you what happens when you don't keep your standards high, because I've been in a horrible marriage. I made excuses for his behavior and thought I could save and love back to life what was a broken man. I've seen what it's like to be married to a man that is LV and I will never tolerate or make excuses for a man's behavior again. I hold myself to high standards and if he cannot do the same, then I'm not interested. 

Ladies, as many of us have already realized, being happy and single is much better than being saddled with a LVM/NVM. Do not accept less because of messages from men in their mother's basement trying to manipulate you into believing you don't deserve the basics of a respectful and loving relationship. Do not accept less because unhappy people in shit relationships in real life tell you that it's normal- because it's not.

I realised that I've been guilty of it in the past and it has affected my way of thinking. The more negative content I consume, the more internet serves me it and the vicious cycle continues. 

As women, we have a wide variety and large volume of online content that is anxiety and fear inducing. From anti abortion laws, to rapey politicians and celebrities, to scary headlines about misogynist criminals; we have a lot to be scared, anxious and vigilant about. But constantly consuming this sort of content also takes its toll on your mental health. 

So I started thinking of it this way- Just like 95% men out there are not suitable for you, 95% of the online content is trash and low value and not meant for you. While it's healthy for me to lurk once in a while and be aware of what's going on around me, indulging and diving into it head first will only harm me.

I don‚Äôt know how I feel about it. I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about this show from my friends. Especially how Carrie could have saved Big by calling 911. I admit that instead of hugging him and crying, she could have called 911.

The scene where Miranda said she stepped on her son‚Äôs used condom irked me. Carrie offers a silver lining that he was using protection.  Let me just clarify that this is not a silver lining, it‚Äôs a basic standard. I definitely think that Brady (an underaged minor) having sex with his girlfriend is beyond inappropriate and glorifies teen sex. I think the scene  was borderline pedophilic after discovering how old he was supposed to be in this series. This series tries to be sex positive by normalizing the idea that it‚Äôs okay to have sex in your parents home. In my perspective, it doesn‚Äôt sit well with me when my parents or his parents know that we‚Äôre having sex at any age in life. ü§Æ I don‚Äôt mind dating guys who live with their parents, but sex and staying over is off the table if it involves staying with either parent‚Äôs house.

So there were some good pictures and some starter flats, which I equally enjoyed. It wasn't until I got to the comments that I realized how disturbing this sub was.

There are some posts with super expensive apartments with great interior design (probably professionally done, but who knows). These I would say are HV flats. Oh my god the amount of man babies hating on the comments is ridiculous. And it wasn't pure hateraid going on too. These guys would legitimately STALK these posters. Through the photos and title (they often post city/neighborhood in title) they would find he EXACT ADDRESSES of some flats and the EXACT PRICE of flat or monthly rent. It was so disturbing.

Also, the mods wouldn't even take down the very clear STALKING and privacy violation that was happening.

296,t3_rjjrib,Was anyone else CONVINCED they were asexual?,"I want to be clear that I am NOT saying asexuality isn't real or valid. And I'm definitely not saying there is anything wrong with being ace. But I do suspect that it's way over diagnosed. I suspect a lot of women self diagnose because they just haven't met a higher value man in their lives and have no idea.

When I was with my ex I remember venting to some people in my life about our sex life and they told me I was asexual. 

Here's the context: my ex did this thing where he would pucker his lips and close his eyes waiting for me to kiss him. üëÄ  and he would sit there waiting like that until I kissed him. And it grossed me out so bad. I couldn't explain or rationalize why it bothered me, so for a while I ignored it and opted to give him a quick sympathy peck and keep my disgust to myself but ü§¢...eventually I finally snapped and told him I hated it. Asked him to please stop doing that. So he modified it. His new version was vocally asking/demanding (like ""come here and gimme a kiss""). It repulsed be even more. I would visibly wince and say no and he would pout afterwards, say he felt unloved and unattractive. And I felt horrible, of course. Over time it (obviously) turned into an actual problem in our relationship. Eventually I hated kissing all together. Never had the spontaneous urge to kiss him anymore. I also hated sex with him. More and more. But before being with him I had terrible sex with men anyway, so I dismissed it. ü§°

Anyway when I vented about all this, EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE (including my ex) told me I was asexual. they all acted shocked and horrified but insisted that I was the problem. That it wasn't normal to not be attracted to him and that he didn't deserve that ü•∫. So I believed it. I listened to those people. Started googling asexuality and convincing myself it applied to me. Started just doing what he wanted without caring about my own (lack of) desire because I thought I was ""asexual"" and that he was making this sacrifice being with me despite it all. 

What a joke. 

It was just the ick. It was LVM. They are sexually repulsive. So I was not sexually compatible with him. Mystery solved.

And I almost married that guy. He insisted he wanted to marry me even after we had these huge conversations about me being ""asexual"". 

If I would have married him, I would have never discovered my actual sexuality, which was laying dormant. And that blows my mind. I would have gone the rest of my life giving performative sex while suspecting that I was asexual all while feeling guilt and shame. 

When I found men I was compatible with emotionally, intellectually and spiritually it all clicked. I discovered an enormous desire and sexuality I never knew existed.

And looking back, not one person in my life was there to suggest that i had valid reasons to not be attracted to him (or other LVM). It was all shock and horror and lots of blaming and shaming me.

I wish fds had been around back then. üíî Or at least one fds-minded person. If you're reading this and you consider yourself to be asexual...just know that (even though you might be right) there is a chance that you're just surrounded by gross people and your lack of desire is traceable. My advice is: don't lean in TOO much to the label. Make sure it's not just your surroundings before you officially self diagnose yourself. And keep in mind sexuality can be confusing, it might take you a long time to unravel (I was 25/26 when I found mine) so don't get hung up on labels early in life.",1040.0
297,t3_rjj69a,Why do men act so nice to other people but seem to hate their own wife and children?,"This post is inspired by recent ones by [u/surfgreenbabe](https://www.reddit.com/user/surfgreenbabe/) and [u/alpinepunch2021](https://www.reddit.com/user/alpinepunch2021/) that both address different topics but with the underlying question: why do men act so nice to other people but seem to hate their own wife and children?

I started writing my own experience with this but honestly it got a little too personal. I'll just say that men being super great in public but bad behind the scenes seems waaaay too common based on lots of the posts I've seen here and women I've known irl. 

However, I've seen some different theories postulated as to why but don't know that I agree with all of them. I don't think men hate themselves generally--in fact they seem to think they're super awesome. Also I don't think they're all sociopaths and narcs (some totally are though); the worst is men who legitimately do good things and seem happy to do them for others, but intentionally avoid helping their families and seem to go out of their way to be cruel.

298,t3_rjfq6k,"It is NOT about ""Finally finding the perfect HVM so that I can have my happily ever after"" - It is about prioritizing YOUR HAPPINESS no matter what happens.","Many sisters come to FDS desperately hoping that you will unlock the ""secret"" to obtain that perfect HVM - so that you finally, *finally* can get that happily ever after.

In the meantime, you keep dealing with disappointment one after another and getting frustrated - because every time you feel like ""this is it!"" - you get burned, *again*.

You start feeling frustrated and losing hope altogether.

Now what's wrong with this scenario?

You treat happiness as a GOAL - at the core of it, it is not about the HVM exactly - it is about YOU wanting to be HAPPY, and you put finding HVM as a requirement to reach that GOAL.

But here's the thing - putting happiness as a goal is a surefire way to ensure that you will *never* be truly happy.

Happiness is a state - you either feel happy or you don't. And unlike anger and sadness where it is easy to feel sad and/or angry when things happen, it is actually harder to allow yourself to *feel* happy and also retain that happiness - especially as an adult.

Because somehow, during our growth - society has trained out our innate ability to feel happy and instead convince us that we have to achieve x, y, and z goals - only *then* will we be happy. Only when we find our ""prince charming"" that we can be ""happily ever after"".

Funny how that works considering as a toddler, we feel happy simply by playing in rain and watching the stars.

Society as we all know it by now - is full of patriarchy pandering, toxic-laden people who just want all of us, especially women, to be miserable, exhausted and crazy chasing after that ""happiness"" which in reality is a LIE.

**SO LET'S STOP THAT CYCLE OF LIE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.**

Focus on making YOURSELF happy.

Focus on improving every areas of your life and heal yourself from old traumas.

Stop feeling desperate and chasing after disappointments and lies.

Stop being so afraid of alone time and start discovering the things you want to do but never seem to find the time before. Or try something new, something out of your comfort zone.

Decenter yourself from men and thinking about ""the one"" - and start imagining what your future looks like with *you* doing whatever the hell you want, whenever the hell you want.

When FDS says dating and relationship are suppose to be fun - THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO BE FUN! No pressure to ""keep this one down"" and feeling yourself tied up on a chain.

If you aren't satisfied with him because of whatever reason - there's no stopping you from leaving, blocking and deleting.

Because you are PRIORITIZING YOURSELF and not some arbitrary goals and milestones you have to achieve to satisfy the society.

There is nothing ""cruel"" and ""selfish"" about prioritizing *your* happiness ladies - toxic society says it that way because they benefit from you having no boundaries and being perpetually unhappy.

So lets stop that stupid ass bullshit now and **BE HAPPY**.",1094.0

This kind of whataboutism is very normal in real life as well and it's crazy to witness. 

It made me think about the extent people will go to to normalise something. The moment your acceptance starts harming someone's quality of life, it becomes dangerous. Accepting psychopaths and abusers in the name of humanity harms everyone. The rise in BDSM related crimes is another example of that. You can't hand weapons to someone who gets off on abuse and then expect them to be responsible and ethical with it. The number of people who condone polyamory, open relationships and BDSM culture is astonishing and the moment a horror story comes up, they'll say, ""oh, they were not practicing it properly/ethically"".

We spoke of romantic plans and were going to meet again until something started feeling off and I just blocked him. He seems to be back with her and many signs point to the fact they never actually called it off like he said. The girl seems to have so much going for her and if I was in her position I would want to know. So after consulting a group of my closest friends- I messaged her on IG. Mentioning the guy's name and hinting that I don't have good news. She's smart, I'm sure she knew where this was going. Without any response, she blocked me. Didn't even want to hear. Hell, my nosy ass could never, I would demand all of the receipts before dumping (maybe that's why I'm still single?lol). But she chose to ignore the warning. She chose not to hear that her first boyfriend had me on his mind their whole relationship. That he was stalking my SM while in bed with her.

326,t3_ri28uf,Stop Oversharing and Be Secretive,"We have been so conditioned since we are little girls to be ""honest"" with our feelings and expectations - and we get so used to ""heart-to-heart talk"" between girls being the way of creating and enforcing bonds, and expect that that is also how it is with the man we are getting to know during dates.

Newsflash ladies - men go into dates the same way they go into strategy games - they are observing, testing the waters, watching your behavior. So the first one to reveal all weaknesses will be the one to lose. And we as a women get so much more to lose. Even him sharing a secret is a *strategy* \- he wants your sympathy and force a bond as soon as possible.

So stop oversharing and laid it all out, and start going into dates being the more private one of the two, and watch *him* instead. Because it is *his* job to impress *you* \- NOT the other way around. 

Him is the one asking you out on a date means he wants something from you - so HE is the *chaser* \- and YOU are the *chooser*. Always have, always will be.

That does not mean you become a literal rock and just shut down during the entire date - go on and be flirty, talk about topics, be fun. But also be mysterious and gracefully avoid any private topics or talking about things *you* aren't comfortable talking about.

And don't be afraid of offending him and turning him off by your lack of willingness to share anything private about yourself - that's a big ol' red flag anyway and you should be thankful you can see it on the first date.

And while we are on the topic - NEVER share any vulnerabilities, EVER. That means no sharing sexual histories, abuse, mental and psychological problems, financial vulnerabilities, insecurities - the lot. Why? Because any of those can be used against you down the line. 

If you got lucky and get on with a guy that never use your weakness against you? If not him, then somebody else. You never know what come out of ones mouth when they aren't thinking properly.

So if you are smart, you will never reveal your entire deck. Some secret is meant to stay secret till your deathbed - unless him knowing is an absolute need, a matter of life-or-death (like he needs to watch your prescription when you are out of your mind). Not a pillow talk heart-to-heart routines.

If you feel your heckles raised with this suggestion - ask yourself first why you so desperately *need* to share those secrets and vulnerabilities with a man?

Venting to your trusted one is one thing - you are just overwhelmed with the situation at the moment and need an outlet to let it go - I understand. But in those instances you aren't spilling a tightly guarded *secret* \- the trusted person is there in that moment of your life, so they lend their shoulder.

But I often enough found women that just can't seem to wait to spill their entire backstories to a stranger - and that kind of inclination is dangerous in the dating world.

If you have this inclination, this *need* to share every single little thing of you with a man, a stranger - and have an excruciatingly hard time staying secretive - than you need to stop dating and seek therapy. Or at least start doing a serious introspection with your self - if you don't tackle the root problem, you can never do all the FDS strategies effectively.

So keep your lips tight and your eyes open, ladies. Stay safe.",818.0

It is your husband's responsibility to buy presents and cards for his family members and to remember birthdays and remember events. Not yours. It is your husband's responsibility to maintain relationships with his family, not yours. IF MIL calls you complaining that husband doesn't call enough, forward her to your husband.  IF SIL calls complaining that husband didn't get MIL a card, then forward her to your husband.  It's husband's responsibility to deal with the ex wife, don't let him pawn that on you.

339,t3_rhtqf5,LibFem Lies: Western Women Didn't Enter the Workplace Until the 1960s,"One of the ways I was suckered into believing LibFem was gOoD foR mE was believing their chant that western women didn't even exist in the workplace until the 1960s. It took me years of noticing articles, movies, footnotes in books that this isn't true at all! This myth that LibFem brought women into the workplace in the 1960s disparages all of the career ladies throughout time AND all of the work women did outside of the workplace that was equally as difficult. So LibFem, here's a little list of remarkable pre-1960 ""career women"" you can look at the next time you want to spew your nonsense:

&amp;#x200B;

* Olive Ann Beech (1903-1993) - from a secretary and bookkeeper for the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita, Kansas in 1924 to the president of the Beech Aircraft Company in 1932, Beech's attention to detail and organization propelled her to First Lady of Aviation status in the United States. Beech knew her strengths which included finances and marketing, and created advertisement campaigns for woman pilots that helped spur interest in the activity. Her company's Twin Beech aircraft were sold to the U.S. Army in 1937 and eventually all over the world. 
* Madam C.J. Walker (1867-1919) - growing up picking cotton in Louisiana and Mississippi, Walker was orphaned at a young age. She worked her way up through domestic households and once she was married, connected with the St. Paul A.M.E. Church and National Association of Colored Women. Walker used these connections when she started experimenting on her own hair, noticing extensive hair loss. Walker discussed her issues with her brothers, and used a mix of store bought and home remedies to repair the damage. Her formulas were successful, and she called it ""Madam Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower"". She went door to door selling the product, speaking about it in churches throughout the South. In 1908 she settled in Pittsburgh and established a training school for other women to learn to be saleswomen. In 1910 she built another base in Indianapolis, with a manufacturing plant and additional training school. In 1913 she traveled around Central and South America on sales trips. Her remarkable townhouse in Harlem was built by African American architect Vertner Tandy in the 1910s. 
* Anne Hummert (1905-1996) was the leading creator of radio soap serials, creating over three dozen during the 1930s and 1940s. Radio was one of the leading venues for entertainment, and Hummert capitalized on this by working as a copywriter in an advertising agency in 1930. She partnered with her husband to create Air Features, a radio production house. Hummert was making six figures for herself in 1933, and her creation of the radio production house spawned jobs for other female writers and actresses in the industry.
* Audrey Lucas (1898 - 1980s) was a playwright in 1920s London, with her 1929 play ""Why Drag in Marriage?"" being highly reviewed. Lucas transitioned to writing for BBC Radio and then BBC television shows, sticking to the mystery genre for decades.
* Phyllis Wheatley (1753-1784) was born in West Africa and sold as a slave to a Boston merchant. Wheatley took to learning Latin and Greek immediately in the home, and could read those languages fluently at age 12. Wheatley's writing was remarkable, and soon she had patrons in both the United States and the United Kingdom. She accepted commissions for writing eulogies, which were published in the U.S. and the U.K. and she published a book of poetry in 1773, whereupon she attained her freedom.
* Community of St. John the Divine (1848 - present day) this order of nuns was popularized in the serial *Call the Midwife.* Running a midwifery and training school, generations of nuns trained British nurses in health and pastoral care. The nuns trained nurses both for hospital work and private clinics. This was the first systematic school for female nurses, and its nurse pipeline to hospitals saved dozens of lives during blitzes and the poverty of East End London.
* Ivy Close (1890-1968), this British actress established a movie production studio in 1914 ""Ivy Close Films"". Close sang, rode motorcycles and worked in silent film. With the advent of the talkies and the takeover of many small film studios by big banks, her business did not last. Close inspired a love of film in her family though, and one of her great-grandsons worked on Downton Abbey. He paid homage to her by including a clip of one of her films being watched by the Crawley family. 
* Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) managed and trained other nurses during the Crimean War. International Nurses' Day is celebrated on her birthday, and her knowledge of data analysis and statistics helped drive her points home. She helped establish nursing schools throughout London in the 1860s. Nightingale's emphasis on health being connected to the natural world, with sunlight and clean air / hygiene being of utmost importance in hospitals and clinics, continue to echo around the health world today. 

LibFem must be blind to the many many women who were working every day prior to the bra burning movement. Not on this list are the many mothers, outdoorswomen, hunters, seamstresses, nurses, laundresses, cooks, nannies, housekeepers, gardeners etc who had to understand their market, finances, and hone real world skills. Once again, the mainstream media pushes a narrative that women were helpless / invisible / useless until a certain magical point in time, and that just isn't true.",331.0

So a guy started a storytime about how his gf wanted to start an only fans account. 


In short what happened:

-Gf wanted to start an only fans account

-He accepts it (he said it was nice money to have)? 

-Out of his ""comfortability"" did he wanted to ask her a couple questions about it. They got in a fight cause he asked her questions which made her feel hurt. The questions made her actually feel disappointed. His tantrum is seen in the in the video.

People in the comments definitely not males called him insecure. Males in the comments were downgrading the girl etc. But I see a pattern, only fans can make males insecure. NVM/LVM will downgrade and not date women in this field. 

But why are women expected to accept porn? They call the women who disagree with porn insecure. But the male who doesn't let his gf work in this particular field is not insecure because ""He is just not okay with it and his partner should respect him?""

Why are many people accepting his frustrations but not when women express THEIR frustration on porn?

After searching for ways to come up with the time and energy to make love everyday, I stumbled across a blog dedicated to conceiving. One of the threads was about women trying to get their man in the mood because apparently it‚Äôs a turn off for men to know when their partner is ovulating and having sex because they are trying to conceive, like what? So the woman is tracking her cycle, will be carrying the baby for 9 months, birthing the baby, breastfeeding, not sleeping ect and all he needs to do is cum? But not if he knows it‚Äôs because THEY want a baby TOGETHER? So that mind fucked me but then I read this and it just sent me.

351,t3_rhb123,"If you have trouble thinking about continuously vetting after finding a man - try the ""Wing Mindset"".","It comes to my attention that some of the ladies here, especially newbies have trouble accepting the concept of continuously vetting even after finding a really great guy - or you have been with a really great guy for a few years maybe.

And just can't imagine continuously vetting him, it is too cold-hearted - because you want to be wholeheartedly in love with him and enjoy the relationship.

So let shift that perspective and try a new angle - lets try the ""Wing Mindset"".

Basically, imagine yourself having a pair of really beautiful wings that allow you to fly wherever you want at a moment's notice. It is big, it is strong, it is *gorgeous* \- it is yours and yours only, and it is your *freedom* wings.

It needs constant care, daily brushing, the whole work. When you are single, you allocated specific hours of the day just to care for your wings - and some more hours to just stare at it and fly around in the sky, marveling at its strength and beauty.

Then you meet a guy, and he is the most handsome, gorgeous, *ideal* man you have ever met.

Suddenly, you find yourself spending more and more time with this man and less and less time tending to your wings. You still care for it, but the hours is cut short because your man is calling.

The come the kids, and the family, and life. And before you know it, the wings become severely neglected - dirty, ragged, skeletal, weak. You can't even flap it properly, much less fly.

And then something BIG happens - doesn't even have to be betrayal from the man, but some things in life are imminent - tragedy, disaster, *death*. Or perhaps just something laughably simple like falling out of love - it happens.

And suddenly you are left alone with a broken wings and the inability to fly.

Won't it be better from the very beginning - you continue to tend to your wings, firmly allocate the compulsory hours of the day just to tend to the wings without him bothering you? Or better yet, he take the active role of *helping* you tend to your wings - and look forward to that chore everyday.

Even when the kids, the family, and life comes - you still firmly and ruthlessly tend to your wings and keep it beautiful, strong and gorgeous so that if anything happens, you can flap your wings at a moments notice, and fly away.

That pair of wings can be the symbolic to anything and everything - your standards, boundaries, personalities, financials, career, *yourself*. And the ability to continuously vet a man even when you are well in years of happy marriage is the thing that allows you to continuously keep those wings in pristine condition.

It isn't about being distant and aloof, untrusting of his every move 24/7 - it isn't about *him* at all.

It is about **YOU** and only you - you continuously vet in the sense that you do not forgive any slip, any mistreatment, any ""joke"". You let him know that you will never, ever tolerate any disrespect and will fly away *the moment* something change and you no longer want to stay.

So ladies, enjoy your relationship with the great man. Let him treat you to amazing dates, build a life with him, immerse yourself in all the happiness that life offers. 

But *never* neglect your wings. Continuously vet and keep the wings on ladies.",567.0

353,t3_rhad8w,Your thoughts on this guy?,"Okay so, let me start by saying that I'm not putting effort into getting with this guy and I won't, but I want to hear you queen's opinions. I'm confused.

We've been friends for about 8 years but we weren't always close. Sometimes we would talk regularly and later stop talking for 6 months no questions asked. So he wasn't a ""omg best guy frienddd"" or anything, he was sorta there.

This is actually something he said he likes, like how I never pressured him into talking to me everyday and we could speak like nothing happened after months passed. Yea, I didn't exactly give a shit about him. That was why lmao.

We didn't see each other face to face for years until that changed. There were some points he was practically worshipping me , talking about how great I am and how smart I am (he really is impressed by brains, it's not a lie or anything)

There were also times we were so blatantly flirting. So what happens? We keep going back and forth. One day I'm a queen, the next day I'm just a friend.

Here's an important detail: We live in a conservative culture. I refuse to have sex before marriage and he knows that. So I can't really say ""Oh he was just after sex"" because that would be fucking weird.

I haven't even mentioned that one time we were like ""Oh if we're single at 30 we will get married."" We were fucking planning our life lmao. And then he jokingly says ""We will go to a strip club together"" Like dude... Please go die.

One last detail I wanna mention is my father. He found out I was meeting him and forbid me from doing it. He doesn't believe men and women can be friends so... You get the point.

So I'm just trying to figure out his hot and cold behavior. It can't be for sex because I won't do it, it can't be for love because he's practically unavailable emotionally. He keeps bashing relationships and love saying it's too much stress.

There were times where I doubted if I was just someone on his rotation or something but he even showed me his messages with other girls without me fucking asking and he's sensitive about privacy. I was really surprised. It felt like he was trying to gain my trust that day. He always talks about his other girlfriends like they're just there and I know it's true because one of them literally gave an attitude cuz he didn't give a shit about her. His friend said this so I know it's %100 true.

Soo... Anyways, I just want to figure out what the fuck his deal is. Any opinions? Honestly I don't mind staying friends but this ambiguity stresses me out. These days we are very distant, I don't know if it's because of my dad or something I did. God, men are draining.",61.0
354,t3_rha2p3,Common arguments used to defend the sex/porn industry debunked,"* **""Sex work is empowering because I get to work for myself when I want!""**

The sex industry is not a lucrative career path for any woman, especially seeing as the average content creator on OnlyFans makes a [whopping $180 a month.](https://sea.mashable.com/culture/17130/top-onlyfans-creators-can-earn-nearly-27000-more-than-doctors-survey-finds) So women on that platform are risking doxxing, harassment, stalking, revenge porn and jepoardising their career prospects for less than minimum wage. Moreover, we all know that sex workers who can be choosy about which clients they see are in the minority. The vast majority of sex workers know that if they are too picky with their clients, they will not make rent that month. A client can be the difference between starving/homelessness and having somewhere to live. Sex work is not a guaranteed income and does not come with benefits traditional jobs have, such as a pension, paid time off, career progression, and professional development. And with the COVID, more and more companies are switching to remore/hybrid forms of flexible working. In short, there is no benefit to being in the sex trade that cannot be found elsewhere for much lower risk.

Just because some people may have enjoyed being a slave that does not mean it is okay to participate in the slave trade.  Women only began to obtain rights in the west in the 20th century. Do people really believe a prostitute in 1549 was living it up by making Johns pay loads of money to have sex when she was not even deemed a citizen and was seen as the property of another man (either her husband or her father?)? All this statement shows is that women have been commodified for thousands of years, which is NOT a good thing.

* **""If a married/partnered man pays for my services, that is not my problem.""**

You cannot claim that women should not criticise your choice to be a sex worker when you perpetuate behaviours that harm them. Infidelity in a relationship causes much more than emotional devastation - it can lead to contracting STIs and STDs which can have serious consequences for a woman, especially if she assumes her partner is also monogamous and does not get tested regularly.

* **""Sex work is work. It should be not stigmatized.""**

Stigma is not always a bad thing as it can act as a preventative tool to keep us from doing harmful activities. Sex work can never be seen as a legitimate form of work because it requires the worker to put herself in danger every single time she is alone with a John. All the screening in the world does not negate the fact that predatory men will still slip through the cracks. Moreover, screening is a tool only the most privileged sex workers can use. If a woman is a survival sex worker, is she really in a position to turn down a dangerous man if his money means she won't be homeless?

* **""Being against the sex industry means you must be against WOC and women with disabilities, since it is the only way some of them can make money and survive.""**

So rather than push for better outcomes for WOC and women with disabilities, you would rather encourage them to work in an industry that sees them as a fetish?  Or push the message that women with disabilities are only good for sexually servicing undesirable men? The sex industry is one of the most racist industries out there, and it is one of the few industries where it is perfectly acceptable to pay someone less based on the colour of their skin. This skin fetishisation does not only affect WOC who work in the industry. It also seeps into the lives of women outside the industry who have to deal with being racially fetishised because of what men have seen in porn. The sex industry will not liberate marginalised women in any meaningful way, and it's time white, privileged sex workers stopped using vulnerable women as a way to justify the existence of an industry that only (marginally) benefits them.

* **""If the sex industry did not exist, men would just rape women. So sex workers are doing women a favour!""**

Sex workers deserve more than being a receptacle for violent, abusive men. The answer to men who rape or desire to rape is not to give them women who will accept their abuse because they have no other option. The answer is to remove such men from society. Why is it acceptable to reward shitty men by giving them access to women if they pay a certain price?

Also, many, many women are sexually frustrated, especially since most men are hopeless lays. Yet women have not created an industry to make attractive men available to them on tap because of their sexual frustration. Being sexually frustrated does not mean you are entitled to women‚Äôs bodies. It‚Äôs not women‚Äôs responsibility to address male sexual frustration. 

* ""**If you are against the sex industry, then you are sex negative. You fuck men for free, at least I get paid for it""**

If sex work is so empowering and wonderful, why do sex workers ridicule women who are not in the sex industry for having sex for free? If a baker was to bake a cake for free, other bakers would not turn around and mock them for working for free, unless they deemed the job to be degrading. Putting a price on consent and what you would be willing to do sexually is the opposite of sex positivity and sexual liberation, because your sexuality is determined by a John and what he is willing to pay. Having a lot of sex is not the same as being sexually liberated if the sex being had is not 100% on your terms.

* **""Male sex workers exist too!""**

Yes, but their primary clientele is other men. Straight male escorts who refuse to see men do not make any money because women a) often do not need to pay for sex and b) women often do not feel entitled to act out their sexual fantasies on non-consenting men. The presence of male sex workers also does not negate that women make up the majority of victims within the sex industry.

* **""Your husbands and boyfriends are still fucking us, hahaha!""**

No self-respecting man pays for sex. The kind of man that pays for sex is a misogynist who feels entitled to women's bodies, which is why they pay for it. They know no woman would touch them otherwise. Bragging about fucking other women's husbands is really not the flex you think it is, especially when you expect those same women to campaign for your right to make it easier to fuck their husbands. Not to mention, these men still will not rate you. As the wonderful u/electroloop said so eloquently: being sexually desired is not the same as being respected.",333.0

356,t3_rh7uun,Being sexually desired ‚â† Being respected,"# Being sexually desired   ‚â†  being respected.

Please always remember this.

A man will happily pay for a woman's OnlyFans. A man will happily pay a woman to objectify her for a few hours. A man will happily string a woman along for days/months/years if that means getting access to her body.

Just because a man wants you sexually, does not mean he respects you. 99% of the time he doesn't.

Look at all the men who tell on themselves and proudly proclaim that they'd happily ""smash"" a SW'er, but would never dream of making her their girlfriend or ""wife her up.""

Social media and the media in general wants women to believe that the more you objectify yourself, the more attention you'll get from men.

They equate this ""attention"" to positive attention and desire. 

Sure, posting thirst traps on Instagram may get the attention of LVM who will use you for sex. You may gain ""popularity"" in those spheres. These men don't respect you, they actually think you're complete and utter trash.

Please don't fall into the trap of having to resort to objectifying yourself in order to get male attention. Men will literally jerk off and fuck anything. A quick Google search will prove my point.

So next time you feel the need to have to bend over backwards sexually in order to get attention from a man, please don't. This is exactly what they want you to do.

Pandering to men's depraved sexual desires is not empowerment, it's a lack of self awareness.",1292.0

This often happened when the guy's social status changed such as finding a prestigious job after graduating from uni, being promoted at work, or becoming rich or famous.

I've never dated, but I sometimes can't help but feel like most men are like that. Even if a guy acted in a HV manner around me, I would wonder if he would dump me for someone else if he suddenly became rich or famous. And yup, would we even be together if he was born with money and fame? Men who are wealthier and more attractive than me pretty much always ""ignored"" me, and I wonder if my future SO would have done the same had he had these traits.

362,t3_rgx8zz,I am responsible for allowing scrotes in my life,"As a recovering pickmeisha, feeling like the ultimate victim of scrotes, I delved into FDS just about 6 months ago and made it my almost nightly ritual to read the community posts and learn from the potent collective feminine wisdom of the Goddess manifested right here.

And, I can say that taking responsibility for allowing and tolerating scrotes in my life has been one of the most powerful mindset shifts lately. 

Responsibility for my part in relations with scrotes is helping me take my power back. 

It takes two to tango, after all.

Reading the handbook and the consistent advice of ‚Äúwalk away at the sign of the first red flag‚Äù, I had to acknowledge that I saw a parade of red flags with multiple exes and chose to ignore them. 

I put on my rose-coloured glasses and handed out my power on a silver platter for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

They said jump, I said how high. 

They laid the tracks for my life and I willingly rolled on them.

They demanded I be the version they want, and I molded myself into their idea of me.

It was me who ignored the red flag parade. 

They didn‚Äôt force me to stay, I stayed out of my own choice and decision. 

I thought I could fix them, help them, save them from themselves, accept their imperfections and please them harder. 

Yet, I blamed them all so hard. For doing scrotey BS, for being so harsh, for ‚Äúnot changing‚Äù, but at the end of the day - it was me who didn‚Äôt walk away quickly enough as there is no hope with grade-A players.

I had to admit, that the scrotey scrotes served a purpose in my life - they filled a void, they satisfied my desperation, my loneliness, they gave me attention, they shared a bed with me, they gave me false security of having a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù, any relationship.

I needed them to tell me what to do with my life. 

I wanted authority and leadership but I got scrote-played. 

And no, abuse wasn‚Äôt my fault, it was theirs, but I was the one responsible for continuing to swim in an ocean full of red scrotatious flags when I could have taken the chance to opt out of their rigged game at any time.

But, I wasn‚Äôt strong enough. 

I needed to get mad about being caught up playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes.

And mad I bloody got when I dumped my last ex over the phone and got my interim restraining order months later.

I stopped coming to the circus. 

Hell hath no fury like the woman scorned.

Thanks to my scorn for them, I was led to FDS, I discovered that my standards were in hell and that I needed to level up big-time. 

I was completely naive to the ways of the scrote, as I played my role of the pickmeisha like an Oscar-winning actress. 

But - no more. 

I‚Äôm a grown woman now, I‚Äôm FDS-pilled and it is time to say that I accepted and tolerated behaviors from the level of Satan. 

I resign from my role of the victim and a pickmeisha and I take responsibility instilled in me by the power of the Goddess to live my best life possible and to create myself as someone who I am deeply in love with.

364,t3_rgvahd,No more wishy-washy men,"Let me preface by saying that given my unusual lifestyle, I can't apply all the FDS principles and if you do, you might avoid finding yourself in this situation.

Anyway, after a 6 month relationship with a lovely guy, it's over. I planned this conversation for a while because he's a sweetheart and in many respects this is one of the healthiest, most pleasant and drama free relationships I've ever had.

But there's no future. Despite my unusual lifestyle and the instability it brings, I have two good careers + a PhD, I'm driven and emotionally stable and reliable.

This guy, sweet as he is, is objectively a mess. Broke, unemployed (though somehow self sufficient), floating around without a clue what to do in life, wrecked by depression and mood swings and often kind of a hermit to cope with his internal turmoil. He can't make plans so much as for next day's dinner as its too much commitment and anxiety and ""we'll see what happens"" is his only reply to any question. 

There is zero possibility of building a life with someone so messed up. 

He treated me lovingly and with respect and it's all been pleasant and comfy, but now circumstances have changed (we lived in the same place, now we don't) and it's time to make plans for the future and decide whether we want to make the effort to maintain the relationship by arranging to be in the same location... And like with everything else in his life, all he can say is I don't know, i don't know my plans, I don't know if I have enough feelings, he doesn't want to commit to anything so maybe we should just part ways and then ""see what happens"" yadda yadda.

And that, I calmly told him, is not good enough. I want and deserve better than that. I'm not taking it personally because this is how he approached literally every aspect of his life, and it shows (and the moment I clocked what was the deal I knew I'd have to walk away: but it was all so easy and pleasant, and I knew the end was coming in a couple of months, that I decided to stay till the inevitable end).

Time was i would have sobbed and insisted and tried to make it work because I enjoyed his company so much and wanted more, and couldn't understand why he didn't feel the same.

Now, while I do enjoy his company and would enjoy more, I also know it's not worth it if its not enthusiastically reciprocated. Believe me when I say, I know he cared for me the best he knew how and he treated me well. But it's just not enough. It felt good to experience after my past horrific experiences with narcissists and abusers, and it taught me something about what I do want in a relationship... but it's not enough, and it also taught me a lot about what I DON'T want.

I understand the temptation to stay because someone is way better than the previous garbage. But in truth that's the bare minimum, and alone is not enough.

I'm sad, as I knew I would be, but I also know this is the right choice.

Edit to clarify for the people writing to me that I used him and ditched him: he said the actual words that he doesn't want to continue a relationship and would rather break up since he's not sure of his feelings. I'm sure as hell not gonna point a gun to someone's head to force them to be with me.

Like Big, he was emotionally unavailable and would push me away every time we got ‚Äútoo close.‚Äù **Their unhealthy relationship ‚Äî and most of the others portrayed in** ***Sex And The City***\*\***, for that matter ‚Äî  led me to believe that the constant making up and breaking up cycle was just a standard part of being in love, and it took me a long time to learn that it wasn‚Äôt.**\*\*

""**From the beginning of their romance, we see Bradshaw continually being emotionally abused by Big, and yet, she still hangs on to the relationship**. When Big tells her  that he‚Äôs going to relocate to Paris and she offers to move there with  him, he just shrugs and says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to uproot your life and  expect anything.‚Äù He refuses to introduce Carrie to his mother, calling  her his ‚Äúfriend,‚Äù when she confronts them together.

Is it the fact that women refuse to accept being abused as sexual pleasure?

**Flip the script and ask yourself the following questions:**

Would you date someone you weren't attracted to physically/emotionally/mentally?

Would you be ok with getting sexually accosted by complete strangers?

Would you be ok with your partner constantly lying and cheating on you?

Would you be ok with dating a woman who isn't self sufficient and entirely dependent on you in every way?

Would you be ok with your partner physically abusing you, tying you up, spitting in your face, and forcefully ass-fucking you with a strap on? 

# Your answer to all of these questions would be a resounding NO. Don't kid yourself.

What FDS advocates for is literally the bare minimum any respectful human being can offer in a relationship. Only the lowest value of men go on tirades and whine about FDS is misandry because they expect women to drop their bare minimum standards and accept poor treatment from men. I have never heard of a mentally level headed man getting triggered about the message that FDS tries to send. Stop with your bullshit double standards and expectations. If women refuse to date you, look inward. You are the problem and you need to change your behaviors and treatment of women if you want to meet our standards.

They do have jobs but the rest is all about what I'm stating above.

For example:
- I didn't watch a lot of porn before I went anti-porn, now I'm 100% against it. When I said I didn't watch porn anymore my friend said 'boring', when I told my standards about sex, my friend said 'sometimes I think you're boring in the bedroom'.
Also they defend porn, 'bEcAuSe tHeYrE AcToRs' was one argument. 
- They smoke weed everyday. I don't. It's their choice but I would like to have a sober evening with real connection. I know they will argue with me that it's in fact their choice, so I'm not even trying that.

These are just a couple examples. They feel like the situation now (with the pandemic) is even more boring then ever whilest I find it relaxing since there are less social expectations of me. 

But now for example with New Years Eve, another friend throws a party with like 20 people, I don't know if they're vaccinated, there will be lots of alcohol and drugs and I just really don't feel like going but I notice that I criticize myself a lot for it 'Why I don't go with the flow' 'I am maybe boring' etc etc.
I also know my certain friends really want to go.

My parents are going to some family and I know that they will play board games and stuff and thinking about just joining them feels more relaxing, but I'm afraid of the (self)-judgment.

I don't want to lose my certain friends. But I don't know how I can find more women to connect with and build friendships with, in this pandemic it's certainly harder for sure.

Is this recognizable since you've leveled up, you don't feel like you ""fit"" anymore? And how did you deal with this?",244.0
385,t3_rg28uo,Update on kicking out an abusive Ex (Narcissist). **Law &amp; Order** episode,"I tried to remove a Narcissist from my home back in February and he broke my wrist. (Lots of details I‚Äôll skip regarding that, for now.)

I installed security cameras. Let him stay here while my wrists healed. Used him for lifting and other chores I couldn‚Äôt do with two broken wrists. (I only documented one. Long story for later.)

Wrists finally healed and I then kicked him out in front of two audio and video recording cameras.  This was successful. 

I filed *Domestic Assault charges by a Law Enforcement officer* with the State. 

They investigated, thoroughly I should add. Contacting my medical professionals, etc. 

**The DAY** the Criminal Investigator placed the final report on the Attorney General‚Äôs desk for review‚Äî the Ex filed stalking and harassment charges against **me!** üò≥

This is a common technique used by Abusers, used to discredit the victim and to DARVO themselves as the victim, creating a smokescreen of diversion/distraction. 

My little recovering-self ponied up a top-notch lawyer, and yesterday went to Court in defense of that Protective Order.  (Finding an attorney was a lesson in persistence. All the Domestic Violence Resources for my county were withdrawn from my use because he shares the same County ‚Äúemployer‚Äù as the DV Advocate and the Prosecuting Attorney!!!!). WTF comes to mind. That‚Äôll be my next battle, that they create an Alternate Plan for when this next happens. 

The case was dismissed!  The Judge dismissed the stalking charges against me. :)

I am still waiting on the case from the State for breaking my arm.

He got chewed out a little by the Judge for creating false drama where none existed.  And one of his coworkers, another deputy, was the bailiff so *everyone* will hear about our dirty laundry soon. (My attorney said he saw the Bailiff laughing at the Ex and his ridiculous allegations.)

His reputation has been dinged. His narcissistic ego has been dinged.

He represented himself, so that‚Äôs another blow to the ego.

Ladies:  Do NOT let shit slide just to avoid the confrontation ‚Äî and to be happy to have gotten away!  (Yes! Get yourself safe ‚Äî but don‚Äôt roll over and let them get away with abuse!)

Stand up for yourself. Value YOU. 

Stand üëè your üëè ground! üëè 

One day, there will be some woman somewhere who will be Googling this name, and my charges of assault and the dismissed charges of his attempt at *gaslighting* the Court, will show up.  (I already know of three other Abuse victims of his‚Ä¶)

390,t3_rfw4zt,Marriage is a financial contract. Many IRL examples are showing it does not protect us the way we think it does. If knowledgeable please advise. (CF),"My main question here is‚Ä¶ Does getting married legally compel a man to financially compensate for the financial hole he left in your life if you must get him out of it? (Under 10y marriage, middle class income)
Edit:USA

Please let‚Äôs discuss how this works WITHOUT children involved. Many of us are child free (CF) here and I want to know if marriage is even a good idea for us.
I know there is a HUGE difference when children are involved, financially, when considering divorce compensation.

Marriage is a financial contract with emotional undertones. I am quickly realizing that being married to someone does not help women in the way that I thought it did when divorced. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm a 36yo woman. When I‚Äôve been in a LTR relationship (5 or 10 + years) that is 50/50ü§°‚Ä¶ my lifestyle is double the comfort. Housing/savings/vacations/everything. Everything is more and better than if I were in it alone. I know it‚Äôs the same for the scrotes who benefit from the 50/50. 

Only, I was always the one to do all emotional labor, pet care, bill paying, outside labor organizing and general life management.

The male paid 50% of bills and did nothing to upkeep daily life as an adult within our unit. Plus received constant sex with a stunning woman. That was a constant with every man. My bad pickme picking at the time obviously. 

Never again, but the question still applies. Does it make financial sense to marry when CF? 

I have friends (no kids) who have divorced before the 10 year mark, from men who make over 1m yearly. They did not receive any spousal support or alimony. With kids I‚Äôm sure this would have been very different. 

Marriage seemed like a good idea, because if it ended (because the person was so horrible I just couldn‚Äôt go on) at least the man would have to chip in financially where he forced the hole in my life I‚Äôd hoped to be building with him. I couldn‚Äôt imagine trusting, saving, buying property, giving, and the court deciding he wouldn‚Äôt have to fill the financial hole he forced upon me. 

Well, that‚Äôs exactly what happens to a lot of women now. Getting married doesn‚Äôt (anymore?) mean that he will have to fill the financial hole he left. 

The courts currently don‚Äôt consider cheating in the way they did before. They also do not consider prenuptial agreements that have cheating clauses and other emotional regulations.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

All those bad decisions aside. When does marriage become a good idea financially, for a woman who is not going to have children? 

Things have changed. I know millionaires in their 70s who have to give the ex 50%. I also know millionaires in their 40s who are required to give nothing because no kids and they fd it up before the 10 year mark. Or! The woman actually works and makes her own money. Is marriage only protected for women if they don‚Äôt work? Only if they have kids? 

I just don‚Äôt understand well enough to make an informed decision. If you know, please help. 

Currently, it seems most women will be financially left in the dust, even if they do have kids with someone.

391,t3_rfvw9p,"The ""wired differently"" excuse...","I can not tell you now many times in the last two weeks that I've been hearing that ""men are just wired like that"" when it comes to them not doing the most basic ass things. No, men are not. They do not ""only focus on the bigger picture while women focus on all the details."" No. It did not begin even when we all were babies and toddlers. Gendered norms began being pushed on us then.

This men being wired differently idea is something that is an agreed upon statement by the women who decided that they will just do things themselves and put up with unacceptable situations because it's quicker and easier therefore enabling the lvm in their life to continue to weaponize their incompetence. Mothers do it to their sons and then girlfriends and wives continue that pickme legacy.

Men aren't wired differently effecting them whenever babies are crying and they stay sitting on their ass waiting for someone else to care for their child. They aren't wired differently whenever they hear their friends making sexist jokes and laugh along with them. They aren't wired differently whenever they see an attractive woman on the streets. They aren't wired differently whenever they make a mess and leave it for days. They aren't wired differently and HAVE to watch porn to curb desires. No. 

We are adult humans making decisions and having intentions. It's not our fault that you choose to stick with men that have you thinking they're wired differently. They are playing you. Please find and resonate with FDS.

392,t3_rfvbd1,Everyday I read multiple posts on Reddit about women being abuse by their SO or men in their life. Most of them don‚Äôt even realize they are being abused.,"I don‚Äôt even go looking for them. It‚Äôs on random AITA posts or The chromosome sub. Sometimes even on malicious compliance. Artemis knows, that I have even seen a ton on my puppy and dog training subreddits. It breaks my heart. So I wanted to create a resource we can use when we see these in the wild so I‚Äôm creating a list of common signs of abuse we can send to these women when we see it. Please add more in the comments if you think I missed any!

Name-calling. They‚Äôll blatantly call you ‚Äústupid,‚Äù ‚Äúa loser,‚Äù or words too awful to repeat here. Also can include derogatory pet names.

Character assassination. This usually involves the word ‚Äúalways.‚Äù You‚Äôre always late, wrong, screwing up, disagreeable, and so on. Basically, they say you‚Äôre not a good person.

Public embarrassment. They pick fights, expose your secrets, or make fun of your shortcomings in public.

Dismissiveness. You tell them about something that‚Äôs important to you and they say it‚Äôs nothing. Body language like eye-rolling, smirking, headshaking, and sighing help convey the same message.

‚ÄúJoking.‚Äù The jokes might have a grain of truth to them or be a complete fabrication. Either way, they make you look foolish. Goes in hand with sarcasm often just a dig in disguise. When you object, they claim to have been teasing and tell you to stop taking everything so seriously.

Insults of your appearance. They tell you, just before you go out, that your hair is ugly or your outfit is clownish.

Belittling your accomplishments. Your abuser might tell you that your achievements mean nothing, or they may even claim responsibility for your success.

Put-downs of your interests. They might tell you that your hobby is a childish waste of time or you‚Äôre out of your league when you play sports. Really, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôd rather you not participate in activities without them.

Threats. Telling you they‚Äôll take the kids and disappear, or saying ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no telling what I might do.‚Äù

Monitoring your whereabouts. They want to know where you are all the time and insist that you respond to calls or texts immediately. They might show up just to see if you‚Äôre where you‚Äôre supposed to be.

Digital spying. They might check your internet history, emails, texts, and call log. They might even demand your passwords.

Unilateral decision-making. They might close a joint bank account, cancel your doctor‚Äôs appointment, or speak with your boss without asking.

Lecturing. Belaboring your errors with long monologues makes it clear they think you‚Äôre beneath them.

Outbursts. You were told to cancel that outing with your friend or put the car in the garage, but didn‚Äôt, so now you have to put up with a red-faced tirade about how uncooperative you are.

Treating you like a child. They tell you what to wear, what and how much to eat, or which friends you can see.

Feigned helplessness. They may say they don‚Äôt know how to do something. Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to do it yourself than to explain it. They know this and take advantage of it.

Unpredictability. They‚Äôll explode with rage out of nowhere, suddenly shower you with affection, or become dark and moody at the drop of a hat to keep you walking on eggshells.

They walk out. In a social situation, stomping out of the room leaves you holding the bag. At home, it‚Äôs a tool to keep the problem unresolved.

Using others. Abusers may tell you that ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù thinks you‚Äôre crazy or ‚Äúthey all say‚Äù you‚Äôre wrong.

Jealousy. They accuse you of flirting or cheating on them.

Turning the tables. They say you cause their rage and control issues by being such a pain.

Denying something you know is true. An abuser will deny that an argument or even an agreement took place. This is called gaslighting. It‚Äôs meant to make you question your own memory and sanity.

Using guilt. They might say something like, ‚ÄúYou owe me this. Look at all I‚Äôve done for you,‚Äù in an attempt to get their way.

Goading then blaming. Abusers know just how to upset you. But once the trouble starts, it‚Äôs your fault for creating it.

Accusing you of abuse. They say you‚Äôre the one who has anger and control issues and they‚Äôre the helpless victim.

Trivializing. When you want to talk about your hurt feelings, they accuse you of overreacting and making mountains out of molehills.

Saying you have no sense of humor. Abusers make personal jokes about you. If you object, they‚Äôll tell you to lighten up.

Blaming you for their problems. Whatever‚Äôs wrong in their life is all your fault. You‚Äôre not supportive enough, didn‚Äôt do enough, or stuck your nose where it didn‚Äôt belong.

Destroying and denying. They might crack your cell phone screen or ‚Äúlose‚Äù your car keys, then deny it.

Shutting down communication. They‚Äôll ignore your attempts at conversation in person, by text, or by phone.

Keeping you from socializing. Whenever you have plans to go out, they come up with a distraction or beg you not to go.

Trying to come between you and your family. They‚Äôll tell family members that you don‚Äôt want to see them or make excuses why you can‚Äôt attend family functions.

Withholding affection. They won‚Äôt touch you, not even to hold your hand or pat you on the shoulder. They may refuse sexual relations to punish you or to get you to do something.

Tuning you out. They‚Äôll wave you off, change the subject, or just plain ignore you when you want to talk about your relationship.

Actively working to turn others against you. They‚Äôll tell co-workers, friends, and even your family that you‚Äôre unstable and prone to hysterics.

Calling you needy. When you‚Äôre really down and out and reach out for support, they‚Äôll tell you you‚Äôre too needy or the world can‚Äôt stop turning for your little problems.

Interrupting. You‚Äôre on the phone or texting and they get in your face to let you know your attention should be on them.

Indifference. They see you hurt or crying and do nothing.

Trying to control your use of or access to money you have earned or saved

Using your assets for their personal benefit without asking

Taking money or using credit cards without permission

Ruining your credit history by running up limits and then not paying bills

Claiming to make payments or pay bills in your name but not following through

Borrowing money or making charges without repaying it

Feeling entitled to your money or assets

Demanding that you turn over your paycheck, passwords, and credit cards

Expecting you to pay for their bills or their obligations

Using offers to help with your budget or financial decisions as a cover for gaining control over your finances

Requiring you to bail them out of difficult financial situations‚Äã

Confiscating your paycheck or other sources of income

Criticizing and minimizing your job or choice of career

Pressuring you to quit your job‚Äîsometimes even using children as an excuse

Telling you where you can and cannot work

Sabotaging your work responsibilities

Harassing you at work by calling, texting, or stopping by

393,t3_rfrxl0,"If he lavishes you with gifts sometimes, and penny pinches the rest of the time ‚Äì that is not generosity, that is manipulation","Obviously, we all know that a stingy man will never be a net positive in your life and cannot be said to love you if he'd rather let you work yourself to the bone than share what he has with you.

And we also know that a wealthy man who gives you gifts that are lavish for you, but are pennies for him, can't really be said to be truly generous either, because it's such a low cost to him. Generosity is proportional to what someone has, it is not objective. A Chanel bag is generous for someone on 50k, not 5mil.

However, the man who buys you lavish gifts in certain circumstances, but penny pinches in others, is also not a generous man. I was watching a documentary about the Roman emperor Caligula, and he was described as ""famously generous"", known to have gone to the top floor of the theatre and thrown money down at everyone else below. But that's not generosity ‚Äì Caligula was notoriously ruthless and psychopathic ‚Äì he wanted the narcissistic supply of having the power to make people crawl for what he could afford to throw away (also given the coins would have his face and propaganda on them so he benefitted from giving it away anyway), and the validation of being fawned over for giving away money in such a dramatic way. True generosity is about improving the life of the recipient, never about growing the ego of the giver.

On a smaller scale, two friends of mine who are sisters were talking about how their father would treat them to Loro Piana cashmere jumpers (which can cost THOUSANDS of ¬£/$), but only if he was there to buy the present. Yet if one of them asked for ¬£5 to go into town and get coffee with friends (when they were teens), he would refuse and penny pinch. Despite being a millionaire, neither have ever received any money to help buy themselves homes or pay off student debt, yet he will occasionally drop a cool few grand on a Caribbean holiday for them. 

This is not generosity, this is financial abuse. Do not allow cognitive dissonance and gaslighting tell you that they're just ""weird"" with money and ""sometimes generous"". They're not generous at all ‚Äì they're seeking to control you with unpredictable behaviour. The lavish gifts are either love-bombing to win you back, or addictive dopamine rewards like in gambling ‚Äì you'll never know which side of them you'll get.

True generosity is about giving with your heart, not your hand. A generous person is generous with all their resources, not just money. Generosity is consistent and it is selfless ‚Äì the motivation is to ease your life in some way, not to make THEM feel good about themselves.",565.0

395,t3_rfpvgh,Is violence towards women n general misogyny in literature acceptable under the thin veil of fiction and historical context?,"So I was gifted Berlin Noir by Philip Kerr by a friend. I'm really struggling with it, the character is such a misogynist and I find the whole tone of the book so far very degrading. Little pearls I've come across in the book include the main character comparing women to dogs, implying that he wanted to slap a woman (that he was very attracted to but he couldn't kiss), very demeaning descriptions of women, the whole women falsely accusing men of rape. 

I was discussing it with said friend (who considers themselves a fan of the character) and it turned into a full blown argument. I just don't understand how someone who seems to be all for equality and fairness can like the character at all. I understand the historical background of the book (Nazi Germany) but all of this adds nothing to the story! I find it completely gratuitous and upon reflection, I do have an issue with anybody who sympathises with the main character. 

I explained that if the story was about domestic abuse, etc it would have its place, but there are more tasteful and less upsetting ways to portray a troubled character. But even at that, it really adds nothing to the overarching narrative for this specific novel.
 I've asked if the story talked about children in the same disgusting manner (but in a country that condoned child marriage, for historical context üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) would they be as happy about it. Of course that didn't go down well.

It feels like no matter what you do, there's no way to come out on top in relationships with men. I'm only 24 and I'm completely turned off by men in general. It feels like all they want is sex and it's so off-putting. I'm not even participating in dating anymore, it's exhausting and a waste of time in my opinion. Why would I want to be with a man that just wants to take from me? 

Even in the workplace, it's so tiring being seen as automatically dumber than the men. For the most part, no one says anything outright, but you can feel it.

400,t3_rfmdhq,Men on saying they ‚Äúwant children someday‚Äù,"This ended up a two-parter on kids so apologies in advance.

We‚Äôve all seen it- 40+ yo heaps of trash presenting as men putting that they ‚Äúwant kids someday‚Äù on their OLD profile. The audacity itself is enough to warrant a good laugh (let's be real, their sperm quality had the same trendline as Blockbuster stock: died in 2010), but there's another angle to this that needs to be talked about:

**They don't actually want children.**

Think about the common traits we see most often on these accounts:

* They're usually 'not looking for anything serious' 
* They're usually seeking out much younger women
* More often than not they don't have any notable career achievements that would offer even a modicum of justification for waiting until later in life for marriage

They think that slapping that tag on their profile will attract every young woman. Why? Because they truly believe that every single woman has the nAtUraL DeSiRe tO Be A mOm and this taps into that. It's just another one of their shriveled up, rotten carrots they keep in their dumpster of 'tricks' to dangle in front of us, thinking we'll bite. Think of it like a Black Friday markdown- it draws you in because you think you're getting a deal but reality hits and it turns out it was a piece of junk from the get go. 

It's common to see old Rumpelstiltskins lurking around trying to use this, thinking they can land a young wife, but the same can be said for LVM that are age appropriate. Usually coupled with the marriage carrot, they'll string women along for years knowing that's what their partner wants even though that's not what they themselves want. 

If you're someone who wants children you should make sure you're taking the extra steps in vetting to make sure you and your partner are aligned. Having the tag in their profile is a shit way of knowing their true thoughts on them. If anything I'd go so far and say that's a yellow flag. 

So, what are some ways of vetting for this? The few I have are to NOT tell them you want kids early on. This can be used as leverage for manipulation. Go somewhere where there are a lot of children (zoos, museums) and see how they act. Are they friendly? Do they interact with the kids in an appropriate way or do they act annoyed? If you've introduced them to your family and you have nieces and nephews, pay attention to their interactions and ask for their opinions after. Kids can be brutally honest and callout things you may have missed. 

This is by no means an exhaustive list. I think it's important to open up a discussion on behavioral patterns that might indicate that a man does or does not want kids.",367.0

Over the past 7 years he has bought every big-boy toy he could want, and had a new home built. (Funny how he had this money when he wanted something...but didn't have it to help his kids.) So, what did I do? I downsized to a smaller home.  I learned how to make repairs myself.  I advanced my career and became a hero to my daughters. I have built up my credit and paid down my debts and started seriously saving for retirement. I also renewed my relationship with my family that had suffered during my marriage because we tended to always do things with his family and not mine. I found new hobbies and have learned to be my own favorite person. 

And next month I am closing on a fully restored home built in 1925.  It is the home of my dreams. (Fully updated and still all the charm of a historical home.)

I am extremely proud of myself today. 

I have been a people-pleaser for most of my life. It is only in the past couple of years that I have been working on intentionally changing this in different areas of my life.

I recently started seeing a guy who ticked a lot of my basic boxes - kind, caring, compassionate, funny, relatable.. a big change from the fuck boys I've been used to going out with and chasing for so many years. I wanted to give a nice guy a chance. 

I went to visit him this past weekend and got to see how HE lives and it was just a huge eye opener for me.

He's basically a man child. Smokes too much weed, he's obsessed with video games, his room is like a 19 year old's bedroom.. 

He drank 3% milk out of the carton with his breakfast... üíÄ

That's when I knew this was not gonna work out ü§£

The old people-pleasing me would've probably stuck it out for longer...

But what I did instead is put myself first. Intentionally.

I have never been the one to end a situationship first.

I mustered up the courage and told him in the kindest way possible that this is just not gonna work for me.

I was SO scared to do it but I truly feel empowered.

Just because he's the first guy who's actually been nice to me and wanted to be with me doesn't mean I should settle! I will not settle! I know what I want.

I would just like to say that this part is not her fault and I will not be assigning a pick me label for this aspect, but she‚Äôs pretty fucking annoying regarding everything else. She needs a fake date to her sister‚Äôs wedding and her sister‚Äôs groom is the brother of her professor ex. She‚Äôs one of those girls who think that being single and showing up alone would mean that she‚Äôs pathetic and unworthy. The author could have made her out to be a capable woman in STEM unafraid to stand on her own two feet and have her worth be beyond who she‚Äôs fucking, but the whole book reeks of the miserable single woman trope. The main guy, Adam Blackford, was cold to her initially and he threw her off, so instead of apologizing and willing himself to come correct, he allowed her to hate him for almost two years and we as the audience are supposed to find him pining her for that long as something romantic. He agrees to be her fake date, they go to Spain together and he showers her in upgrades to first class and all these gentlemanly manners that ultimately were bullshit to me really because he still wasted her time and was otherwise petty to her for the past two years. He also made no effort to properly court her, ask her out, or respect her enough to not hook up. Him driving her home in the rain, buying her tacos and making sure that she doesn‚Äôt faint from dieting for the wedding could have been concluded as things any decent person would do but they apparently made every Tik Tok girl hail him as the ultimate book boyfriend. The relationship went straight to hooking up right after the wedding and everything was made to fall right into place regarding their feelings and everything. He said I love you waaaaay too quick (without having taken her on any proper dates beyond the pretense of their fake dating ordeal btw!) and took advantage of her when she was drunk by kissing her up and down. The author could have also addressed the obvious abuse of power wielded by her professor ex who dated her when she was an undergrad, but chose to spotlight the single and miserable woman trope through to the end. This book rewards the bare minimum for men and gives women all these accolades only to make their relationship status the main focus. 

Book 2: The Love Hypothesis. This one is disgusting right off the bat with its student x professor dating trope. It starts off with the main character, a PHD student named Olive, randomly grabbing the main guy Adam Carlsen for a kiss to convince her best friend to date her ex because apparently they click so well together. Might I add that her best friend purposely flirted with her date during what was supposed to be their little outing. Despite her many accolades, Olive has no respect for herself and puts herself in so many stupid situations that she could have easily gotten out of. She then enters into a fake dating agreement with the guy, who surprise surprise was into her for almost two years and we‚Äôre supposed to find this romantic even though it‚Äôs gross as fuck because he‚Äôs a professor and she‚Äôs a student. Did I mention he‚Äôs almost a decade older too? Their dynamic follows a straight to hooking up trope with no proper courting or any effort made to let her know of his true intentions. The author also writes Olive as a whole 26 year old woman who barely knows anything about sex so the sex scene reeks of such an imbalance of experience between Olive and Adam. It was also awfully written. Save your time.

Book 3: The Hating Game. Rivalry between coworkers. She thinks he hates her but he‚Äôs been into her all along. Fake dating and straight to hooking up dynamic without any real effort to court the girl. You guys see where I‚Äôm getting at?

412,t3_reu39b,The Realities of Age Gap Relationships,"Obviously, this post is going to be about a younger woman/older man type of relationship. Young women may think it's cool and exciting to win the attention of an older man, particularly when you're feeling the restrictions of your teenage years and he's got a job and a car. But the reality of that relationship isn't so romantic and it may hurt you in the end.

First, let me tell you about my parents. They met when my mother was 17 and my father was 26. They had \*so much in common,\* were immediately physical, and eventually my mom got pregnant with me and married him in that order. They're still married to this day, have a nice house together, and went on to have two more kids and several dogs. Sounds great, right?

Except there is now no intimacy or romantic feelings in their relationship. He's more interested in porn and social media than in her. His porn addiction is longstanding and well established: I remember walking in on him watching it and finding his Playboy mags at the young age of nine. He cheated on her repeatedly. He also ruined his health with excessive smoking and drinking, and since he's been working manual labor jobs forever he can no longer work and provide for the family as he did before. My mother now is his ""nurse and a purse."" They are 49 and 58.

Reddit guys and other LVM will love to make the case that men ""naturally"" go for younger women because they're more attractive. But what happens when they get with younger women and those women age as people normally do? These types of men will get bored. You eventually find out they weren't with you because you're ""mature for your age,"" they liked you because you're 17 and think they're the shit. What happens when that changes? Well, they'll start looking for another young one who will idolize them. When my father couldn't manage that, he kept up the fantasy with porn and online romances.

If you're ""lucky,"" they'll realize they need someone to take care of them in the later stages of life. This goes especially for men whose health isn't great. My father would be absolutely *fucked* if my mom left him, and they both know that.

In my early twenties, I got into a long-term relationship with a guy ten years my senior. At the time I thought it was no big deal. My parents had an age gap, so surely it had to be normal. Turned out he had also ruined his health with excessive drinking, had serious mental health problems, and I saw a future where I too would turn into his nurse as our intimacy died out.

For high-profile examples, take a look at any male celebrity known for dating around. Eventually, they get to a certain age and marry quickly to lock down a woman. 

Who else dated an older man and saw this future?",792.0
413,t3_retx8o,Why I used to wear a ring on my ‚Äúwedding finger‚Äù and why I won‚Äôt do it again.,"I was once engaged to a LV scrote who got me an engagement ring. I felt wrong wearing the ring 99% of the time because I knew deep down I was miserable with him and I could do much better and be with someone who truly loved me instead of going through the motions. After the engagement was broke off and I gave the ring back to him, I did something stupid. 


I used to wear a ring on my ‚Äúwedding finger‚Äù. It‚Äôs a simple love ring from cartier. It was a gift to myself, and I absolutely love it.

My assumption is that men would be less inclined to approach me/bother me, if they took a look at the ring and concluded that I was probably married.

Oh I was wrong. Wearing a ring made men try EVEN HARDER! They thought since I was taken, it would be a better chase and I may be inclined to cheat. It attracted the lowest value of men.

I stopped wearing it for a while, but I wore it again when I got into a relationship. Out of respect for my partner, I thought this was the way to go.

Y‚Äôall, this was ultimate pickmeisha behaviour. Not only am I rewarding someone I‚Äôm dating making it seem like they committed to me by giving me a ring, I was attempting to take myself off the market to the ‚Äúnormal men‚Äù.

I was literally blocking myself from meeting someone who could treat me the way that I wanted to be treated.

I was giving off the false impression that my boyfriend bought me the ring and is committed to me.

I will never do that again. Until I‚Äôm legitimately engaged, I refuse to wear a ring. Single until I‚Äôm married is a term that comes to mind. I refuse to stay stagnant in dead end relationships and adorn myself with a ring just because I want people to think I have a caring, thoughtful partner.",461.0

419,t3_repk0m,"No matter what anyone says, sex work has nothing to do with respect","I know, no big shock to anyone reading here regularly, but I just wanted to talk from experience a bit (this turned out quite long). While I've never done anything approaching 'sex work' I worked as a web developer in a company for a few years that developed 'casual dating' websites ‚Äì at least that's what they officially called it. In fact it was the kind of websites you get to when you click on 'horny singles in your area' popups ‚Äì basically websites where you were supposed to find a woman to fuck.


Now, about 99.9% of the 'women' on those pages were fake. Fake women profiles were constantly created by various (female and male) people in the company. Our terms and conditions did declare that there are some fake profiles on the site (though it didn't say how many...) and there was even a mark on those profiles to distinguish them as fake. However, a loop hole was that whenever a real woman did sign up, which was exceedingly rare, the system would take her profile and copy it to all the other websites and even years after that woman had signed up her profile was still floating around as 'real', by that point with no real person behind it. Anyway, since horny scrotes aren't the brightest, men on those sites constantly kept chatting to very obvious bots with a limited amount of automatic answers, paying money to do so, and most never figured it out. There were also a few real women that however just used the page to advertise their own livecams or just straight up prostitutes. We would usually ban them since they took business away from us.


Most of these websites also included a section for live webcams. These were obviously done by real women. Employees regularly expressed disgust for them, insulting their looks for example and questioning why anyone would pay money to watch them. It was always two-fold: on one hand noone in the company had any respect for the male customers, since we saw them as stupid desperate creeps to exploit money from, but there was also disdain for the women. For example, one guy before my time (I was told about it) tried to blackmail one of the camgirls into sending him videos for free. He was fired, but still. If sex work was commonly seen as respectable why would anyone consider it blackmail material? The livecam women were looked down upon and seen as stupid and ugly and a nuisance, for example when they wrote to our support that their stream doesn't work anymore or needed anything. There was one woman in particular who was basically making the most money out of all the camgirls who was seen as 'bossy' and demanding just because she would understandably complain when a problem on our site made her stream not work. However, one thing that was definitely gross is that her daughter later also became a camgirl. I always wondered how that had become a thing. Had she groomed her daughter into it? Or did the daughter just see it as a normal, easy job based on her mother's experiences? Who knows.


The customers were about what you would expect. I'd say the most common type of customer was a 40something married man looking for a woman to cheat on his wife with since 'she doesn't want to have sex anymore' or she would not do something special (usually anal or 'rough' sex). Aside from rare exceptions they were ugly and fat and put zero effort into their pictures or trying to make themselves sound appealing at all. They also often had very narrow expectations of what kinda woman they wanted such as between 20-25, blond, slim etc. I kept thinking: why do these men think any woman would bite? Like what would be in it for her? These scrotes really think there's a heap of 20something hot models out there who are just dying to service some gross 40something married coomer for free. I guess I blame porn?


There was also a message/phone chat service. For the messaging, various people would be behind the messages that supposedly came from a specific woman. Again the profiles were 100% fake. Even male employees would sometimes write messages from these profiles. They would make notices about the customer's life so they could convincingly play a real woman that remembers stuff about her 'favorite customers'. Often these men would message with these 'women' on and off over years, paying hundreds to thousands. Since all devs could read all the messages exchanged, I would sometimes browse them if there was nothing else to do. The men would usually write messages complaining about their lives, the 'woman' would fake interest and pity them, and then send some sexting so the man could jizz off and say goodbye for now. They'd also try to keep the men messaging as long as possible by teasing and promising real life meetups that of course never happened. Again it was surprisingly easy to make men believe a real woman is on the other side. I know that some would find that sad or exploitative, but honestly after reading these messages I had to wonder why these men don't just find a real woman (of course again some of them were already married). Maybe because real women aren't content with being a therapist and sex worker that gets nothing in return? The customers would never fake interest in the 'womans' life. It was always the 'woman' asking about the customer's life and consoling him, they usually didn't even need good lies about their supposed life since the customers didn't ask anyway. They just want some woman who will never have any expectations of them or needs of her own to always be there.


Another huge issue is how the company handled privacy and the safety concerns of women. I don't really know where all the pictures for the fake women profiles came from. Some of them looked like from more or less professional porn shoots, some just looked like they might be grabbed from someone's Facebook. I heard that they would buy these pictures in huge bundles from somewhere, but idk the actual source. One time, a picture of Emma Watson somehow made it in there. 
It was also not too uncommon to have women contact us saying someone made a profile in their name and they want it deleted ASAP. Sometimes this seemed to be an attempt of revenge at some poor woman. The company was extremely uncaring about those and would only even attempt to delete some profile if the women had a lawyer write to them. Even then it was actually not easy to really delete a profile completely, as the system would already have copied it over to several more sites. It happened sometimes that we considered a profile deleted and weeks later it would again pop up somewhere as it was still stuck in the system somehow. One time we stumbled over a profile that seemed to be another attempt of trolling/revenge, the description was basically 'come to (address) and rape me, the door is unlocked'. We deleted it but.. wtf?


The darkest side of the whole thing is that the company was also in some way involved in real hardcore porn sites. I never knew the details, but basically it was somehow tied to other companies and they were all under one 'mother' company. And part of the whole portfolio was some really gross websites, some of which no longer existed. I did however at one point stumble over an old website they'd once had (now defunct) which was specifically for porn videos of men raping female teenage hitchhikers. And while I didn't watch any of the vids ofc, from the site you could tell that this wasn't even supposed to be some mild fantasy version of rape ‚Äì it was fully geared towards men who wanted to see women show fear and pain. Enough said. I think that was the first time my gut told me that I really didn't want to be working for this company anymore. I was unfortunately very desentizised to porn as I had started watching it on accident when I was about 11. It didn't really consciously bother me to see nudity and genitals on the job all day long, but at no time did I like working in that company. My mental health was pretty shitty for most of the 3 years I worked there anyways, and while the work hadn't triggered that, I believe it made it more difficult for me to recover. It was such a cynical and depressing workplace. I got tired of being a part of such a gross and useless industry. Thankfully I managed to find another job that fit me much better and that I love, and now those years just seem like a weird dream. I'd only even started there because I had quickly needed something new, and an ex-coworker of mine was already there and said she'd recommend the place. However when I started, I weirdly found out that she had been on sick leave for many months already without telling me, and even later she told me that she'd gotten bullied ‚Äì mainly by one particular male coworker ‚Äì so badly that she'd go home crying sometimes. So uhh.. that recommendation was I guess a lie. Maybe she had just badly wanted another woman in the team with her? Idk.


Not surprisingly, the overall work atmosphere was pretty bad. I was the only female developer in a team of men between 30-60. There was sexism, homophobia and just general assholery. While I wasn't regularly harassed myself (though there were occasions, like my gross 60something boss making a joke about me sitting on someone's lap after a seating plan change), some general misogyny was making the rounds, such as one guy calling his toddler daughter a 'bitch' or another saying that when his kids want something at night, he kicks his wife out of bed to do it since he makes more money than her. The same guy also expressed that one of his sons might be gay and that he likes 'a thermometer up his ass' too much and that he doesn't know what he'll do if said son ever brings a boyfriend home. Another time, we had a halloween party with costumes and a team lead said to another employee 'with that makeup you look like a faggot'. Aside from that, the atmosphere was just extremely... male? Just loud, unfriendly and competitive. Luckily there were two of the younger men who I really got along with and can't complain about at all, but the rest I didn't interact with more than necessary. Asking questions was extremely discouraged ‚Äì noone would ever show you how anything works, just leaving you to your own devices to figure it out ‚Äì the codebase was old and terrible and any change was rejected immediately ‚Äì several people in leading positions were unprofessional and kinda unhinged (such as one team lead who would sometimes leave work early to buy ammunition for his gun ‚Äì and threw passive agressive tantrums upon any criticism). Also, the boss of the whole company ‚Äì who I only really saw once, at a company party ‚Äì was a really cringy 50something man who acted like he was some cool rock star and made a really deluded speech. Of course, all higher-up leading positions were 100% filled by men.


Anyway. I would like to get a pro-sex work woman to tell me what part of this is respectful and empowering. Was it the fact that the average sex work buyer is a gross older man who wants a young model to cheat on his wife with? Is it the absolutely insane amounts of money they spend on fake women, keeping it secret from their wives of course? Or the fact that the camgirls are universally looked down upon? Or the fact that women don't actually sign up on these sites to meet men (I saw maybe 5 legit female profiles in 3 years across all out websites) because there's nothing in it for them?

I'm an immigrant, so they just assume that I had a poor life back in my home country.

423,t3_rel1bc,My mom is playing PickMe games and has plans to move in with her BF very soon and I am not coping well at all. Really struggling with boundaries and how to handle this.,"So my mom has always been kinda problematic but it got worse when my parents divorced when I was 12. She immediately moved on to a new guy who was a total chauvinistic pig, (extremely macho and controlling) and was with him for about 15 years. They could never seem to get along and always fighting and threatening to break up etc. She was quite neglectful towards me and put him first in all her decisions and was a pretty bad parent throughout my teenage years. Well, she finally broke up with him for good a couple of years ago and I thought we were in the clear and that things would improve. How wrong I was. Approximately two seconds later she had moved onto a new guy. 

I am really struggling with her being in this new relationship (feels like history repeating itself and reliving all my old traumas) but I tried to be ""mature"" and accepting. She has been talking about moving to the same town as him (also happens to be the same town I live in) for a while now and she talked about selling her house and buying a new one here etc. Well she has had some stuff happen at her job that has forced her hand in making this decision, and it seems like she will be moving into her BF's house and not buying her own place after all. 

When we initially discussed this earlier in the week, I thought I felt ok but it has finally hit me and I just feel absolutely gutted and I keep bursting into tears. The BF is ok but not great - he's got a really successful career and he seems like a decent person and treats her fairly well, and can cook and clean and manage a household. But he's doing that typical male thing where he won't ComMuniCatE with her whether he actually wants her to move in with him or not. I think in actuality he does want her to move in, but he's pulling a jerk move and making it all her decision so that if anything goes wrong no one can blame him. He won't openly invite and encourage her or actually help her to make a decision. 

I really don't want her to move in with him for a few reasons:

* Selfishly, I really just want her to have her own place so I can spend time with her without having to deal with having some man around all the time. 
* They haven't been together for that long (\~2 years) and they don't seem to be able to make plans or communicate properly. 
* His (adult) children are always coming and going, and random people are always visiting/sleeping over and I just don't think my mom would cope very well not having much control over that aspect.
* I think it's a bad idea for someone to move into another person's established household especially when children are involved, it's much less problematic to buy a new house together, have a fresh start and neutral territory.
* I don't know this guy and his family very well yet, and I really just think it's too soon to do this. 

I have also been convinced into doing Christmas as it his place with my mom, and all his family and friends are going to be there. I've only met his kids a few times and I've never met everyone else and I just cannot cope with the prospect of doing this new ""step family"" thing. I keep bursting into tears when I think about having to attend this party and pretending to be ok. I do have bad social anxiety but I can usually put it aside and just deal with things but I don't think I can do it this time. I haven't even got to experience a ""normal"" family Christmas with just my mom for so many years and I just can't do this new situation. 

I know that I need to put some boundaries in place but I'm really struggling. I know that I don't have the right to tell my mom what to do, and I've tried gently suggesting that she needs to buy her own house, but I feel like I need to cOmMuNiCaTe and tell her straight that if she moves into his house, I'm going to be very unhappy about it and the consequence will be that I won't feel comfortable coming over often and will probably refuse to visit. Not because I want to be rude or petty, but because I have so much PTSD around being inside a house with an older man who is not my father and having to pretend everything is ok. And selfishly, I just want be able to spend time with her without someone else who i barely even know hanging around. 

I need to work up the courage to tell her that I've changed my mind and won't be attending this big Christmas party, but I know it will uPsEt her and cause issues and everyone will wonder what the heck is wrong with me, why am I ""being like this"" etc. She is one of those self-centered people who thinks she's never done anything wrong in life, thinks that bad thing only magically happen to her for no reason and doesn't understand natural consequences of her choices.

431,t3_rdybiz,F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is one of the worst shows I've seen,"I don't know how this is going to go over, as I know Friends is a hugely popular show, but here goes.

I'm in my early twenties, so I was only young by the time the show stopped airing. My mother was a huge fan, but I never got around to watching it while growing up. As a european kid I couldn't speak english or read subtitles. I have had so many acquaintances say they love the show over the years, so I finally just threw myself in to give it a go. 

My. God. I will admit I am sensitive, and I am very careful about the media I consume, but this show.. not only does the humor generally not land with me, even when it does, it's completely overshadowed by the misogyny, homophobic jokes, porn-sickness, scrote men, fatphobia, even kinda racist tones at times.. The amount of times this show sexualises women is insane. If I had a euro for every time strippers, porn, or anything else is mentioned I would be rich. And the worst thing is these things are depicted as funny/normal/okay things. All three male main characters are unbearable to watch, especially Chandler. Rachel gets on my nerves. Phoebe is easily my favourite as I relate with her, but even she sometimes does questionable things.

I have only watched til season 4 and I don't think I can go on. I watched this far just to give it a fair shot but it only got worse by the episode. If you enjoy this show, I can't say that I understand why, but you certainly have nerves of steel compared to me. Sorry if this comes off as offensive, I just wanted to rant as I feel like a crazy person because everyone seems to love this show except for me. I also realize that the show was first aired when I wasn't even born and it was a different time, but the show is still loved today and that goes beyond my understanding. Thoughts?",766.0

435,t3_rds2yg,Weirdest experience I've ever had at the doctor,"So to give some context I'm 22F and this week I had to get a mammary ultrasound for a checkup. See, in 2011 I had breast cysts (yeah, I was pretty young) and since then I've been going from time to time to get ultrasounds and monitor their development. 
I haven't had any ultrasound since I was in HS (because last time they disappeared) when I'm supposed to be getting one yearly so I decided to visit a new Gyno to see what I could do. She was pretty nice, reccomends some blood tests, everything's fine and then the day of the ultrasound arrives...

The ultrasound doctor (Radiologist?) made me feel very uncomfortable ): And I don't mean physically thank God, but the conversation we were having turned out to be very weird? This is the first time I did this by myself, getting the mammary ultrasound I mean, since the other times I was young and my mom was with me at all times and I don't remember the doctors speaking a lot.

At first it all started with normal questions such as my family medical history (there's breast and prostate cancer background on my mother's side so I felt like this was important to say), and since I also had my very first ultrasound I told him about it so he could do a comparison in the report. 

He asked me about my age when the cysts appeared and I told him I was 12 and he said ""Oh wow really? Did you really had so much breast at that age to have cysts??"" I... what kind of... how can you say something like that to someone and think that's okay???üò≠ 

Then he starts talking to me about family planning and stuff as he's doing the ultrasound? He asked me if I wanted to have kids, and I told him that not really, then he proceeded to tell me like: Why not? C'mon, it's kidsss... and like pushing the idea onto me I feel? 

I didn't wanted to have a confrontation with the doctor or anything, so I tried to deflect it by saying the classic: oh you know, I'm still pretty young hahaha first I want to finish University and other studies before doing any of that stuff and then the doctor just... tells me: Oh but you know, I did the same thing. Wasted all of my youth studying and now that I'm older I can't get married hahaha its really terrible that I can't find anyone...

Like?? Are you telling me not to study or study less?? What do you mean sirüò≠??

I've never had this sort of negative experience before with a doctor and I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I feel like that wasn't a proper conversation to have with a patient and he made me feel reeeeaaallly awkward... I don't really feel like going to that hospital anymore for ultrasounds u_u

Do you girls think I'm overreacting? I felt really weirded out.

Ps: If anyone wants to know if I'm fine, yeah blood tests turned out to be normal and I don't have any cysts so that's cool at least.",400.0
436,t3_rdrfxr,Just Maintained a Boundary!,"I have nowhere else to post this and no one else will appreciate it like you ladies. I used to live and die off my family's approval and boy did they take advantage of it. Anyhow, I moved into a new apartment not long ago. Last night my sister calls because she's visiting her ex-bf in my city. I drive out to the airport to get her, let her spend the night at my place. Today, no warning she says he's coming by to pick her up, asks if he can come up to my place to help her with her stuff. Now, I was already pissed she gave that idiot my address without my permission. But I live in a secure building with a doorman. He couldn't come up without my say so. So I said no. She was pushing and pushing like she always does. In the past I would've either ignored my feelings to ""keep the peace"" or begged her to understand my POV. Today, I didn't explain, I didn't engage, I just said no. When people ask your reasons, they don't want your reasons anyway, they just want to shoot down your logic and get their way.

Anyway, I didn't want this guy knowing where I live because he's military and seems unhinged. When she gets through with this toxic relationship, she'll be safe enough as she lives across the country, but I live right here in town-who do you think Scrote McGee is going to target if things don't go his way? Luckily, this building has over 300 apartments. That anonymity  was my last protection. I was not going to hand him my apartment number and layout on a silver platter. No. Here's the kicker. She had been insisting he just had to come up to help her with her stuff she claimed she couldn't manage alone. Once she sees I'm absolutely not bending, she's huffing and puffing around collecting her bags. They looked heavy, so I offer to help her to the elevator and down to the lobby. She says, ""no thanks,"" and breezes out the door with everything in \*one\* hand. People just want to trample your boundaries, do not let them!

ETA: Aside from the safety issue, I felt really almost disproportionately anxious and angry about this whole situation. And then I realized, it was like someone wrote in a post earlier. Pick Mes mirror the toxic behavior of the men they are with. I was angry because she kept pushing my boundaries, trying to break them down, like he does hers. My sister literally has this idiot on Facetime allllllllll day long. He barely says anything, he just watches her.  And she started mirroring that to me today. First, when she says he's outside, I have to go downstairs for something else and move my car into my building's garage. She was insisting I stop the car, pick him up, and drive him into the garage, and then take him up to my apartment. First of fucking all, he's a grown man. Even if he was my visitor who I invited, I would have had him enter through the lobby like a proper guest. You can wait, you don't need to be tended to and handled gently like a precious babe. Second, I realize now, this was all about her. She can't be out of his sight for two seconds, so I'm supposed to participate by letting him trample my personal space now. Not in this life. Obviously, I cannot and would not cut off my sister. But we're going to have a nice chat at Christmas. She can cater to this fool all she wants but she won't be getting me to join her.",426.0

444,t3_rdfq56,He‚Äôs not happy if he doesn‚Äôt have a chokehold on your psyche,"I just remembered a conversation I had with an old flame that I had forgotten for a while. I guess I had convinced myself he lied to me the whole time and was never into me (because I haven‚Äôt thought about this guy in so long even though he‚Äôs the one I loved the most). 

Background: We were long distance, and met romantically a couple of times abroad. He was, I have since then realized, a misogynist, and a LVM. Probably a narcissist too. He came from a European country where sex-pozy leftist feminists let men run wild with their misogyny. So a lot of his lack of boundaries was cultural. He was a backpacker and so far beneath me, but I was dickmatized (even though I was the better one in bed, lol). 

The thing that stuck with me today, was how he acted before it ended. He would insist he never told a woman (not even his mom) that he loved her- he had only told her ‚ÄúTe quiero‚Äù not ‚Äúte amo‚Äù (girl, I know! The emotional baggage!! Dickmatized!! Ok?). And he told me te quiero, when I asked him if he loved me, and he kept gaslighting me about him caring about me even though I saw the dozens of women he was texting at the same time during what he kept calling our ‚Äúhoneymoon.‚Äù I went to that trip without expectations, mind you, but he kept showing me and telling me things that were super intimate, and getting way too emotionally close to me. He told me everything about himself. He was textbook prince charming, like he made random strangers laugh, and loved spreading joy. Birds would fly our and rest on his broad shoulders type.

I flipped a lid when I saw the texts. It‚Äôs one thing to have a fling, and it‚Äôs something else to have interrupted my phone call with my important family member and ask to be introduced as more than a friend, and then do all that mess. 

Be conüëèüèΩsisüëèüèΩtentüëèüèΩ

Ugh. I decided to continue the ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù (because I was on my pick me shit, and had a week left of my vacation and I liked the sex ü§°). But here‚Äôs the rub. At the end, I said that we wouldn‚Äôt continue texting, and would only communicate when we made plans to see each other. Girls, I know we talk about how women are the ones who get emotionally over-involved- but when I tell you that he freaked out. He got so silent and acted hurt and furious. Like I had stabbed him! Staring at the sky all ‚ÄúWhy me!!‚Äù The audacity. 

He was about to go on the equivalent of the Olympics- you all know how incestuous and orgy-like it gets in events like that. He had dreamed about this his whole life. In a sense, I had also travelled to satisfy my own Dionysian desires before and did my own messes at a rugby thing, so I thought I was fine with it (again ü§°shit). But he didn‚Äôt even respect my necessary emotional boundaries to cope with the whole thing. 

Men want your whole being to be dedicated to them. They can‚Äôt stand not having all these women fill their cup, because it never gets full. They are empty vessels. He was *furious* like a child. I did not give him access to all of me, which he clearly wanted and valued at some level- but he wasn‚Äôt even able to give me the satisfaction of saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù- even though he did love me in his own twisted way. This is why I love Taylor Swift‚Äôs All Too Well, and that part of ‚Äúyou never called it love‚Äù‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs so inherently misogynistic to not even recognize women mattered to them- they don‚Äôt even want us to have the most basic validation. 

I can recognize this now as the characteristics of an abuser like Armie Hammer. I thank the gods for putting all these oceans between us to protect me from that. But I guess this final puzzle piece came back to me, now that I have had my self-esteem back for some years. There was never anything inherently wrong with me, and it‚Äôs not true that I never meant anything to someone who mattered so much to me, or that I ‚Äúliked‚Äù to humiliate myself by giving my feelings to someone who walked all over them. I mattered to him. I meant something. He just never wanted me to have the power of knowing it. He deprived me of that satisfaction. It just wasn‚Äôt enough to have parts of me- he wanted to have a chokehold on my psyche and emotions. He wanted to *own* me, so he could discard me and feel more powerful doing so. No one would ever be enough to a person like that. I pity the therapist.

After that trip, we texted and talked a bit over the phone, but he was so disrespectful throughout I hung up and ghosted him in the middle of him yelling at me  ‚Äúwhat do you want from me woman!!‚Äù Because wait, you asked us to continue texting and me asking you why the fuck we are doing that if we‚Äôre not together and you don‚Äôt love me is *me* being needy?

446,t3_rd9xq2,"How do you know if he's ""the one""?","I wish there was a Wikihow or an instructable to answer this question, but there isn't a tried and true method to knowing if your partner is ""the one"". That's why we're big on vetting on FDS. Things like the honeymoon phase and mask drop are totally real, and your seemingly high value partner could switch up on you any second.

As women, we are blessed with intuition. It's that little voice in the back of your head that tells you when something is amiss. Sometimes, we love to ignore it because we want to give our partners the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, that backfires.

How many times did you go against your intuition and your gut feeling and get screwed over? I know in my late teens and early 20s, I did. I got screwed over bad because I really thought people were genuine and had my best interests at heart. *I truly thought men were genuine with their excuses when I was just a disposable object to them.*

Our outlook on life and relationships is based on our collective past experiences. However, my past experiences won't deter me from dating and ruthlessly vetting a man. You should see all of your ""failures"" in relationships as character building. Always remind yourself that you were your truest, most authentic self and a man who wasn't worthy of your presence didn't see how valuable you are.

Dating should feel effortless. There shouldn't be any lingering doubt. There shouldn't be any ""struggle love."" There should be any shady behavior that's overlooked.

A man who truly values and respects you will never want to leave you with that feeling of doubt. He will always be present for you. He *will* call you, he *will* text you. He will check up on at appropriate times. There's healthy boundaries. There's no shady behavior regarding his phone or internet usage. He incorporates you into his future plans. He's excited to be seen with you, excited to introduce you to his friends and family. He thinks of thoughtful things to get you that he knows you will love and surprises you with them randomly. He respects you and your successes, and is your voice of encouragement to help you reach your goals.

He understands that authentic love is built overtime, and not through a conquest of lovebombing behavior. He truly believes that you are the most beautiful woman in the world and it's not just words. You can see it in his eyes and his behaviors. Actions always speaker louder than words.

So with all that said, you truly never know if someone is ""the one"". For some men, this is all an act to them, a chase. For other few men, their actions are sincere and genuine. They won't switch up on you randomly one day and have you doubt his intentions and his relationship with you. The issue is, some men will keep this ""good boy"" act on for years. You truly never know.

The biggest takeaway from all of this? Never ignore your gut feeling. If something is amiss and you see a few signs that it's all a ruse on his end, never tough it out. *Always* remember that there's 3.97 billion men on the planet. It's better to end things sooner than later before you continue to waste time with someone who's indecisive about you, which is apparent from their actions.",336.0

I do have a few male friends I would catch up with via text every now and then, but then we had known each other since we were young and it's not like we would meet irl if we no longer have to see each other on a regular basis. For these male friends, I also had something in common with them (e.g. both of our parents know each other or we shared similar uncommon interests) so I guess that is one of the reasons why we kept in touch.

The idea of having male ""BFFs"" is very uncomfortable to me and I don't get why some women do that. Many men are perverts who only want female friends as they want sex or attention. Some scotes also want to have many female friends so that they can easily find someone else to date if they break up with their SOs. Even if the guy is HV, you'll probably have different hobbies and interests than due to his sex being different than yours and you can't talk about ""women stuff"" with him. Yup, you can't discuss makeup and fashion trends with a male friend.

The idea of hanging out with a guy I'm not dating one-on-one is just uncomfortable to me. Even if the guy is extremely HV, the whole thing seems wrong. I almost never meet up with a guy by myself unless if I have someone accompanying me or do it in a ""non-romantic"" setting (e.g. visiting the guy at his workplace).

Think about men who game for hours instead of facing their negative emotions or actively solving their problems.

Think of men who cheat because they *feel* neglected by their girlfriend or wife.

Think of men who smoke weed because they can‚Äôt handle stress from their job at all.

Think of men who threaten to kill themselves if you break up with them (in that case call the suicide hotline, leave and let them handle the rest, block him too)

Now maybe you don‚Äôt use the same outlets, but you still act out in the same way.

Maybe you engage in emotional eating to numb out negative, suffocating emotions.

Maybe you drain your sorrows in alcohol.

Maybe you smoke because it‚Äôs the only way you can cope with your neuroticism.

Maybe you post thirst traps on Instagram for LVM to lust over because you don‚Äôt feel attractive or loved enough.

Maybe you hook up with loads of men just to fill that void of loneliness inside of you.

452,t3_rd00g4,VET VET VET your male friends to the same standards you would a potential partner!,"Trigger warning: physical abuse

I know this is a dating strategy page, but I just wanted to say, please **VET VET VET your male friends to the same standards you would a potential partner!**

I had this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù I met in college. He was a funny, chill guy that I clicked with. I was at a point in my life where I was definitely NOT interested in any kind of romantic relationship (short or long term) with men so I usually steered clear from \*any and all\* of them since most seemed incapable of seeing me as a friend.¬†

Anyway this one man, I thought, was an exception. At first, we only hung out in groups as we had many mutual friends.¬†

Then one day, he asked me to have lunch with him. I hesitated. I didn‚Äôt want to give him the wrong impression about how I felt.¬†But he was so silly and chill and never flirted with me and it was just LUNCH so I thought, why not?

After that, we started hanging out more and more. It was at the library, cafeteria, walking to class, etc. I genuinely saw him as a friend and felt lucky to have a man in my life who truly cared about me and wasn‚Äôt trying to get something out of me.

Looking back now I see serious üö©üö©üö© that I ignored. For example, he would tease me and even push me around sometimes (one time he literally pushed me off my skateboard as a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù) If a man I was interested in romantically did anything like that I would run away even faster than I can skate.¬†

I brushed all these warning signs off as I thought it was the price I would have to pay for having a male ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù He treated me like one of the guys so that meant he wasn‚Äôt trying to fuck me- right?

Anyway, one day he asked me to help him as he was moving out of his dorm and into an apartment nearby campus. I felt unsure but at this point I had known him for three years and felt like we were close friends.¬†

Once inside, I started to help him put things in the back of his car. Finally we sat down on his couch to take a break. I was exhausted. We were sitting. Everything was fine.¬†

Then, it wasn‚Äôt.

He started choking me. I couldn‚Äôt even believe what was happening. I froze and once I registered what was happening pushed him away with all my force but it barely made him budge.¬†

I mustered enough strength to start screaming and that‚Äôs when he stopped.¬†

I ran out in complete shock and honestly denial about what had just happened.¬†

When I got home that day, I started getting texts from him, ‚Äúwhy did you leave so fast? I wanted to kiss you but I was scared.‚Äù¬†

Wait - so he was too scared to try and kiss me, but he wasn‚Äôt too scared to fucking choke me?!

The texts came streaming in again. This time, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help being attracted to you. You are so dramatic, punishing me for wanting you‚Äù¬†At this point I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and finally blocked him.¬†

Ladies, BEWARE YOUR MALE ‚ÄúFRIENDS!‚Äù I am sure it‚Äôs possible to have safe and platonic relationships with men but you must VET these men the same way as your dates.¬†It doesn‚Äôt matter how long you‚Äôve known him, or how chill or funny or friendly he usually is. Any red flags, WALK AWAY and of course, BLOCK &amp; DELETE.

I excused poor behavior, and saw it as a sign he definitely didn‚Äôt like me - cause what kind of man who liked a woman would treat me the way he did?

455,t3_rcveq3,Defining pickmeism: what it is vs what it isn't,"I wanted to have a discussion about defining behaviors that make someone a pickme, versus behaviors that don't.

We all know not to feed the trolls... and not to coddle pickmes. And I'm not.

But at the same time I feel like a LOT of women brutally put themselves down unnecessarily for falling for a man or putting up with his abuse and bullshit, calling themselves stupid, clowns, and pickmes. I get it, but not every mistake you make with a man makes you a pickme.

Like, if you hand-crafted something for your ex-BF/husband to use for one of his hobbies and he didn't say thank you or never used it, that doesn't mean you were a pickme. It just means that you did an act of love for a man you were committed to and he disrespected you. Obviously if he did that a second time and you didn't leave him then I'd be worried about your self-esteem, but I think what I'm trying to say is clear.

I think what makes someone a pickme is engaging in behavior that is attention-seeking and consistently male-pandering. It always originates from a place of desperation, insecurity, and inferiority. Basically, anything done by a Cool Girl/I'm Not Like The Other Girls (NLOG) girl. A pickme goes out of her way to do things for male attention wherever she can. She will do things to get literally any guy to pay her attention or date her. She is desperate, terribly lacking in self-awareness, and will humiliate herself without a second thought. She can't get along with other women and is always at the center of drama.

You being a loving human in a relationship and you humiliating/putting yourself down for a crumb of male attention are two different things.

I'd like to see everyone's thoughts about this.",344.0
456,t3_rcrbvu,Negotiation tactic: always be willing to walk away,"Never go into a negotiation you are not prepared to walk away from.

This was something my dad told me when I was buying my first used car. Since that time, I've gotten a lot of dating experience and I've found that it holds up even better for relationships. 

In the early stages of dating men I found this relatively easy to implement, my investment was minimal and it was easy to walk away from LVM who had bad qualities or didn't treat me with respect. 

But *after* I had invested for 6+ months this became a lot more difficult for the following reasons:

* Sunk cost fallacy: bias stemming from investment of time and effort. The longer I was in a relationship the easier it was to go against evidence that it was not in my best interest to continue because I had already spent effort on it. 
* Admitting I was wrong: I would ruthlessly vet people in the early stages, so how could I have gotten that wrong? I didn't want to admit to myself that I'd done a poor job of vetting men at the start.
* Giving the benefit of the doubt: if men were on their best behaviour for 6 months I erroneously thought I really knew their character, so when a large red flag appeared I chalked it up to a one-off, or an anomaly to their *true* behaviour.
* Ignoring little red flags: I brushed off small red flags at the beginning of the relationship and made excuses for their behaviour (he's nervous, he's a bit socially awkward, he's not emotionally intelligent, etc.), which set the stage for this kind of mental gymnastics to massive red flags later on. 

All of these things caused me to ignore my gut and allow LVM to try to negotiate them being ""good people"" despite their disrespectful behaviour. Not one single time where I ignored my gut and gave a man the benefit of the doubt did it turn out well for me. **Not once**. I just gave them a platform to gaslight me, emotionally abuse me, manipulate me, and lie to me. And the more I did that the more it compromised my ability to walk away.

And that's what I've learned from these relationships--always, **always** be willing to walk away. To drop a man like a stone and leave. To not entertain discussions or explanations or pleading, because none of those are sufficient to justify disrespectful behaviour. Like sexist remarks, objectification of women, negging, a callous lack of empathy, lying, entitled and manipulative behaviour, secretly prioritizing an ex, not caring about my consent, and violating my privacy.

People like that aren't worth a moment of my time. Now when I encounter any LVM/NVM behaviour I just say ""OK"" and leave. Men shouldn't have to explain to me that they're good people--it should be obvious from their actions. And actions don't lie. 

In summary:

1. Trust your gut.
2. Don't let men tell you who they are, judge who they are from their actions.
3. Vet ruthlessly *throughout the entire relationship*.
4. And **always** be willing to walk away.",471.0

462,t3_rcpyr1,The female body has sex first and foremost to achieve orgasm and secondly as a way to pro-create.,"Welcome to my TED talk. 

For countless hundreds of years, the male species of the human race has not only viciously denied the existence of the female orgasm well into the 19th century, they have also failed to acknowledge the primary function of female sexuality. 

Falsely claiming that the only reason females have sex is for pro-creation has been the cause for countless anguish and orgasm inequality for many years - Further to this historic mistreatment of the female sex they also refused to allow women to understand their bodies via education and religious indoctrination and also banned lesbianism to make sure women would never find out and tell each other that there orgasm's are much more intense than men's and they can be capable of multiple orgasms in one go/session without burn out. 

If your a young man pulling out your evolutionary biology book (google search) who is about to correct me, let me ask you these questions first:
 
1) If female sexuality is designed first and foremost for pro-creation then why can women only get pregnant a few days every month on an average cycle of 28 days? Why not a higher chance of pregnancy? 

2) Why is the female body capable of multiple orgasms, which in turn release chemicals that ease stress and tension throughout the body? What's the point? 

3) Why does the clitoris have more nerve ending's than an average penis if not for pleasure? 

4) Why did god make men blind/unable to find it, even when instructed? (Only joking) 

4) Why do only a small percent of women report orgasm via PIV sex? 

The answer to these questions it all goes back to the same conclusion - The primary point of female sexuality is for **PLEASURE** not procreation. When you frame a woman's sexuality as ""Just for pro-creation"" you allow the following: 

1) The denial of women to enjoy sex freely, as they wish too. 

2) The government to legislate against your anatomy by insisting the baby is the focal point of your sexual conquests and not your *right* to pleasure as a woman. 

3) You allow partner's to dismiss your *need* for an orgasm and to treat you as someone who *has things done to them* rather than someone who *actively participates in sexual relations in order to achieve orgasm. 

My last note is just about the spiritual side of this ""argument"" (It's not really an argument when my point has logically been proven) 
Basically, the world is a stressful place. Doesn't matter who you are or what time period you're living in, living is stressful. 

Now, nature is cool AF, there's still so much we dont know and understand but what we do know is what intelligent design is and what it looks like. 
The female orgasm is intelligent design at its best. Why? Because men are stressful. Men are so fucking stressful with their BS. Most men never even learn to please a woman consistently - because they're bullshit. Nature knew this and nature said *""Dont worry sis, I got you. So long as those knuckle dragger's dont ever have an opportunity to enforce patriarchy on everyone, you'll always be able to feel better""*

If you've read any of what I've written, I'm always harping on avoiding men who are all about power, control, dominance, because you will not gain a partner who is all about mutuality, reciprocity, sharing, and egalitarianism.

I've noticed that whenever I've called a man out in the past about something he did, named how it affected me, and asked him how he felt, and there was no immediate answer, this is a red flag. He felt nothing, or not much, and knew that saying that would get him in trouble with me, possibly make me break up with him and/or do significantly less. He used that time to come up with a more acceptable answer.

I've also noticed that just stating, wow, this sounds like some kind of power trip! and then stating precisely what they're doing, often men go very quiet. In one way, it can be a scary quiet, the kind of quiet right before violence erupts. I'm fortunate that's never happened, but I'm aware of that ""gathering storm clouds"" type of energy/darkening face that can happen. Their going quiet means you are onto their game and have sussed them out. The jig is up, and they realize they don't have power over you any more so they can't play that game with you any more. You have taken ""away"" some of their power by reclaiming your own.

When I met my husband he was tall, fit and ticked all the boxes. I had been married before to an absolute goat, but this guy was sweet and paid for our dates. Things went well for a year but then he started to gain weight, his house became messier, and he showed signs of insecurity. He had been married before but his story about why she left was ‚Äúshe never gave me a reason, she just packed her stuff up and left‚Äù. His mother stated she and her parents were gold digging immigrants (they were from Laos). Which looking back it‚Äôs apart of their customs to give gifts and money for the wedding and bride. (Lesson learned: always keep an eye on the mom of romantic interests)

I broke up with him after dating for 2 years. He had gained a ton of weight, was sluggish, and he was so depressing to be around. After a few months we got back together. He had lost all of the weight, had been to therapy etc. We got married a year later. He proceeded to put the weight back on after we married and I observed that he was addicted to food.For example he would eat all of the peanut butter in one sitting. (16 oz jar). 

Also turns out he had a very low sex drive. We had plenty when we were dating and he was very pleasurable to be with. No kinky shit requested, no signs of porn use etc. As soon as I was pregnant it dried the fuck up. This was only 3 months into our marriage. I suffered in silence because I thought he was genuinely concerned for the baby. Fast forward a few months after having this baby and he still won‚Äôt touch me unless I initiate. It does not help that I have a high sex drive.  

Two years go by and I pop out another baby. He doesn‚Äôt help with household chores, changing diapers, keeps eating and racks up a ton of debt. All the while I‚Äôm working full time and trying to find a way to loose the baby weight. 

We moved. We paid off 70,000$ in debt from proceeds from the sale. He gets deeper in his depression, keeps eating and continues to be a slob. Sex occurs once a month and only if I initiate. At this point I have twisted myself into a pretzel trying to please him and make him happier (pickmesha in full force). Two years ago I decided to join a Jiujitsu gym and drug the kids with me. It kept me sane, I made friends and I dropped 10 pounds. At this point I had started the process of giving up on trying to make my husband happy. He continued to get worse. In January ‚Äò21 I felt it in my bones this man was not going to last another year. He wouldn‚Äôt follow up with his doctors to renew his BP meds. He blamed it on me. I was too busy for him to make it to an appointment. He was low in testosterone and needed injections but refused them after the 4th shot. FYI: testosterone is not just for sex drive it‚Äôs also protective of blood vessels, stabilizes mood amongst other benefits for men. Side note: I‚Äôm a seasoned nurse. I can look at someone and see they aren‚Äôt doing well. The color of an individuals skin (paleness of a white person, grayish blue for a dark completed person) how much effort is needed to complete simple tasks, the type of sweat they produce can all be indicators of shit going sideways. He refused to see anyone. 

I started to prepare. I made sure he had life insurance. Made sure he had me listed as beneficiary on his accounts. I dug a little bit and found out he had racked up more debt. (He would never clarify) and I prayed. (Yes I have faith in God) 

Come July 19 and he is sick. High fever, body aches, loss of smell. I‚Äôm quite convinced it was the Delta variant of Covid. He confesses to me he stopped taking his BP meds two weeks ago. Unvaccinated. I watched him closely for vital signs changes over the first week and when he showed a drop in oxygen I got him admitted to the hospital. I stayed by his side the entire time as our hospital allowed visitors. During his stay we managed to keep him off the ventilator but he required a lot of oxygen and he developed the coagulation disorder associated with Covid. He died of a heart attack after 2 weeks in the hospital.

Do not wish me condolences. For the love of God I already struggle with not grieving him but with feeling relived from his passing. I found so much shit he was hiding when I was cleaning out his office. $65k in debt. Two prescriptions drugs that were not prescribed, Adderal and Klonzapam. Supplements that lower testosterone. He may have had a male lover. All this time I was gaslighting myself. Fortunately I‚Äôm savage enough that I retained a lawyer to figure out what I was responsible for and what my next steps should be. We will be okay financially. Mentally I‚Äôm pissed at him and I‚Äôm equally pissed off at myself. I‚Äôm pissed for my kids. They miss having a dad. But I‚Äôm the end we will be okay. But damn. How the fuck did I miss those red flags? It was because I flat out refused to see them. I‚Äôm a pickmesha. 

I‚Äôm in therapy, I found this subreddit (thank the gods), and I‚Äôm reading every book I can about codependency, why I choose the men I do and how to change my way of thinking and interacting with people. Even women because they will convince you that you should ignore your instincts. I‚Äôm competing in my first BJJ tournament in feb, I put an offer on a house, my kiddos are much improved in school, they are in therapy and doing well and excelling in their extracurricular activities. 

The old me would apologize for such a long post but the new me knows it‚Äôs good to talk about this shit and let women know it‚Äôs okay to be picky as fuck.

Edited to add: fuck the belief we should not speak poorly of the dead. That is an absolutely horrible practice foisted onto us by the male patriarchy. If someone who died was an asshole it should be said out loud and their funeral should be basic and with poor attendance. Maybe if we followed this standard people would think twice about muh legacy.

Write a Bitchy Profile,"Not my strategy, but this brilliant [article](https://betterhumans.pub/want-to-meet-decent-men-online-write-a-bitchy-profile-10de19d262d9) I just read on Medium was EPIC, written by Jennie Young. Shout out to this Queen!! Aligned with FDS principles üëèüëèüëè

[Edit: many people pointed out that this is not all aligned to FDS principles: she accepts a coffee date, the guy she likes negs her, she unmatches almost immediately without dating others, it could be argued that her profile gives away too much of her own strategy, it‚Äôs too early to tell if the man is HVM, so as you‚Äôre reading it, just be aware of this - I personally didn‚Äôt pick up on a lot when I read it, thanks for the feedback FDS community!]

In case you have a paywall, here it is:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a single woman. I also have a Ph. D. in rhetoric, so I understand how words work. I decided to put those things together in order to game online dating. Spoiler alert: It worked.

Here‚Äôs how I did it.

There are hundreds of sources out there telling you how to write your online dating profile. I took none of their advice, which includes fluffy tips such as ‚Äúwarmth is inviting,‚Äù and ‚Äúleave out the negative and snarky‚Äù (my profile was All Snark).

A Couple of Caveats

1. I knew full well that this profile would deter 99% of men, and that was fine with me. I didn‚Äôt want the 99%; I wanted the 1% that would ‚Äúget it.‚Äù There‚Äôs no shortage of men to date, but there‚Äôs a severe shortage of men you‚Äôd actually want to date (I‚Äôm sure this is true for men looking for women as well, but I can only report from my side of the experience).

2. I was okay with not meeting someone. I was already happy and content in my life, and I didn‚Äôt ever feel like I needed to find a partner. If finding a partner feels like a ‚Äúneed,‚Äù I would recommend that you run screaming in the other direction away from any and all dating apps. Take the time to be okay by yourself first, however long that might take.

Here‚Äôs My Profile

I‚Äôm a writer (humor writer, self-supporting, not a starving poet), and I‚Äôm going to write this from a different angle. Here‚Äôs my Top 10 List of what I *don‚Äôt* want:

1. Hookups

2. ‚ÄúHey‚Äù messages

3. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up‚Äù messages

4. ‚ÄúYou up?‚Äù messages

5. Anyone who‚Äôs ‚Äúliving life to the fullest‚Äù

6. A 55-year-old man who ‚Äúwants kids some day‚Äù

7. Anyone whose profile is written in ‚Äúsecond-person directive‚Äù voice that directs me how *I* should be. Here‚Äôs an example: ‚ÄúYou should be fun-loving, honest, easy-going, and fit.‚Äù

8. Anyone who‚Äôs easily offended by dark humor (or this list)

9. Texting maniacs. I use texting for logistics, not actual communication.

10. Party boys, in all iterations. I‚Äôm a family-oriented grownup with my life together, looking for same.

Last thing you should know: I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù (if you don‚Äôt know the reference, read this).

If you can get past all that, and if you‚Äôre still reading, this could work.

Less prickly section of profile: I‚Äôm a runner and cyclist (more recreational than competitive these days), and I love hiking. I‚Äôm a fan of books, coffee shops, small towns, lakes, and mountains. I haven‚Äôt traveled much internationally but want to. I‚Äôm funny. I know everyone on here claims this, but I‚Äôm pretty well-published (internet satire) and sometimes even financially compensated to be funny, so I feel like I can claim it accurately? I guess?

I can‚Äôt be attracted to anyone who doesn‚Äôt know their homonyms. I‚Äôm sorry.

I realize the last line is sort of elitist and snobby and maybe even unfair, but it‚Äôs also accurate. Additionally, I figured simply including the word homonyms would be a great weeder-outer.

NBC News, in an article that I clearly didn‚Äôt read, offers this advice: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine to say that you‚Äôre excited to meet someone who also wants to find a real and meaningful connection. That‚Äôs positive. But when you say ‚Äòno hook-ups‚Äô it simply reads like an angry person wrote it.‚Äù As you saw, saying ‚Äúno hook-ups‚Äù is literally the first line of my profile.

The Results

Posting this profile changed everything, and it changed everything immediately. When I tried online dating a couple of times in the past, I‚Äôd used a very typical profile. And I was regaled with ‚ÄúHey‚Äù messages, ‚ÄúYour (sic) hot‚Äù messages, men holding deer heads and dead fish, and grammar issues that made my lips curl.

When I posted this one, I got far fewer responses; that‚Äôs true. But the responses I did get were worth reading.

Dan*, for instance, wrote: ‚ÄúI get what you‚Äôre doing, thinning the herd, right?‚Äù

Yes, that‚Äôs exactly what I was doing.

Wayne wrote: ‚Äú ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt be attracted to anyone who doesn‚Äôt know their homonyms.‚Äô That might be the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever read on hear. ‚Äù

Nice, Wayne! An intentional homonym error to join in on the joke! This is what I‚Äôd been hoping would happen.

Todd wrote: ‚ÄúHi Jennie, I am going to assume that you likely scared off 90% of the Wisconsin men who enjoy their beer and brats. Hoping I am the last man standing. Great read, and I can tell you are way different than most out in this strange internet dating world.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure I did scare off 90% of Wisconsin men who enjoy beer and brats, but *I* don‚Äôt enjoy beer and brats, so I didn‚Äôt really care.

The messages continued to come in like this. For many of the matches, there were other factors that rendered the connection moot for me (they were separated but not divorced, there was something off-putting in their physical appearance, etc.).

And then I got a message from Scott, which began like this:

‚ÄúHey (sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist). This is hands-down the best profile I have ever read, which, if we‚Äôre being honest probably isn‚Äôt saying much considering the majority of the profiles out there, but it‚Äôs definitely something.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt say what exactly it was about Scott‚Äôs message that caught my attention over some of the others, but something did (there was more to it than this, but I‚Äôm only sharing opening lines here).

I wrote back, and then he wrote back, and then we engaged in a flurry of messaging, background-checked each other, admitted we‚Äôd background-checked each other, traded phone numbers, set up a date for that weekend, and met at a coffee shop where we talked for six hours straight.

We both disabled our Match profiles by the following day (that wasn‚Äôt an agreed-upon plan; we just both did it). We‚Äôve been together since (that‚Äôs us in the header).

There may have been other worthwhile matches or messages for me between the time that Scott and I met and the time I shut my profile down, but at that point, I no longer cared and wasn‚Äôt checking the app.

So, for the record, I spent a total of five days on Match.com. Part of this, of course, was luck. I wouldn‚Äôt try to make a claim that my method is any kind of guaranteed magic. What I do claim, though, is that it might be worth it to try something different ‚Äî something risky and unusual and honest. You might be pleasantly surprised.

*All names have been changed except Scott‚Äôs.‚Äù",1458.0

487,t3_rb71ed,Here are a few OLD phrases to look out for as a High Value Women:,"**‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a women who doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously.‚Äù**

AKA *I* won‚Äôt take you seriously. All of the things that you‚Äôre passionate about mean nothing to me. I don‚Äôt give a shit about your fulfilling career, exciting hobbies and all of the dreams and goals you have set for yourself, so don‚Äôt bother talking about them. Focus on *my* accomplishments and make me feel good about *myself*. 

**‚ÄùI‚Äôm only looking for something casual.‚Äù**

As a woman, I‚Äôve struggled with this one, since I am also looking for something ‚Äúcasual‚Äù. However, my definition of casual is not going on a date one time, having sex, and then never seeing each other again. In my experience, men who say they want something casual 99% of the time mean that they want sex without any responsibility of continuing the relationship or putting in a smidge of effort. Ghosting is acceptable and comes with the territory for this type. 

**‚ÄùI‚Äôm looking for a women that takes care of herself.‚Äù**

This is a big red flag, and I see it all of the time. This is a sneaky way of saying ‚Äúbe attractive and esthetically pleasing in a way that I deem appropriate.‚Äù They want a woman that wears makeup (but not too much), works out at the gym (but not too much), dresses nicely (but not too much), etc. 

**Anything that can be deemed as misogynistic. Some of my favorites include:**

‚ÄúI‚Äôm above 6‚Äô, because that matters nowadays.‚Äù *eye roll* Are you in middle school?

‚ÄúI have a house and a car, before anyone asks.‚Äù Oh, so you‚Äôre a basic and functioning adult. Is that supposed to impress me? 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too beautiful to be OLD. What‚Äôs the catch with you?‚Äù Yes, I‚Äôve gotten this one before. Yes, I blocked him in two seconds. Ew. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably hate you, but ask me anything.‚Äù *SWOON* Sign up right here, ladies! Prince Charming in the building!

488,t3_rb8j89,The reactions I received when I used to talk about being a sugar baby,"I was a sugar baby at 19 years old because I was desperate. I was previously homeless and had just gotten a roof over my head, though I wasn‚Äôt sure how long it would last. I was also attending school and had a full time minimum wage job at a soul sucking drug store.

A ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of mine seemed to have a much different reality. She was comfortable in her 1 bedroom apartment (in an incredibly expensive area) that was paid for by her sugar daddy. She spoke about her needs being taken care of (school if she decided to go to college, phone bill, car insurance, etc.) and allowance/gifts (flights, trips, jewelry). 

I thought, why not? I was young and I wanted to have new experiences. I couldn‚Äôt continue the burnout spiral I was dealing with and I didn‚Äôt have secure familial relationships or friendships at the time.

So, I created an account on Seeking. I don‚Äôt have to tell you all the details of the actual experience, I‚Äôm sure you can guess how awful it was. It was so completely demeaning that it made me sick to my stomach. I hated myself for putting myself in that position, not the sugar daddy that was pressuring me for sex and making me stroke his ego. 

It could‚Äôve been a lot worse, but I got out within 3 weeks. This was largely because of the new female friends I had come into my life and reacted in a way that didn‚Äôt blame me, but saw the situation as a negative one. They offered to help me with my housing situation and provided emotional and financial support that was crucial for my escape from the situation.

None of my male ‚Äúfriends‚Äù did shit to help, even though I‚Äôve known them longer. Not even a warning, not a single offer to drive me home after one of my dates ended at 10:30 pm in a dangerous part of the city. They knew I was struggling before I even made an account on Seeking - the only thing I got from them were inappropriate jokes about providing me stable housing if I slept with them (one of which I actually did have sex with because I felt like I owed him for temporary shelter that he gave me).

What were their reactions to me being a sugar baby? ‚ÄúGod, don‚Äôt I wish I could have a hot MILF pay me for sex and give me gifts,‚Äù and ‚Äúif I was a hot chick,I would have a sugar daddy, too.‚Äù They would frame it in a progressive and empowering light, ignoring all of the circumstances leading up to this situation. They would not even bother being fake sympathetic when I said that it wasn‚Äôt empowering to me at all. They would try to gaslight me into believing it was a positive experience.

Remember, ladies, a true friend will validate your feelings and recognize that this situation (comparatively OnlyFans and porn) is deeply misogynistic, cruel, and pedophilic. They would try their hardest to support you before you‚Äôd even resort to these means.

**Dear Amy:** My wife and I got married right after college and quickly welcomed our first child.

I knew that having kids would take all of my wife's attention, therefore, I did not want any more children.

But shortly after the first child came baby number two.

At that point I got a vasectomy.

Twenty years later, I have built a very successful career, while my wife chose to take jobs that would allow her more time with the kids.

She has taken the lead with the kid's activities, housework, cooking, etc., which I never asked her to do.

She has held various low-paying, ""do-good""-type positions in the community.

She has a lot of skills and did not have to compromise her career for the children.

There are a lot of successful women doing it all.

My wife has nothing to show for working year after year.

I am very resentful of her career choices and have expressed this many times.

I think she is lazy and used the kids and house as an excuse.

Our kids are both in college now, and I am paying for all of it.

My wife now has decided to pursue a second degree so she can increase her skills.

I told her that I would help her start a small business if she abandoned going back to school.

She declined.

I do not feel obligated to pay for her education, which I could easily do. She is taking out student loans, but she will never be able to catch up to my salary.

Am I being unreasonable for not helping and for feeling so resentful toward her?

**‚Äî Resentful Husband**

**Resentful:** Your anger over your wife‚Äôs choices seems to have affected your cognition.

She has maintained the household and has raised (your) children, and yet because she has been underemployed outside the home, she has ‚Äúnothing to show for it?‚Äù

How about healthy children and a husband who doesn‚Äôt have to iron his own shirts?

According to a report by [Salary.com](https://Salary.com), in 2021 a stay-at-home mother works over 100 hours a week and would earn an annual ‚Äúfair market salary equivalent of $184,820.‚Äù

The question is: Do you owe this amount to your ‚Äúlazy‚Äù wife, or do you two have a zero balance because she was living the life she chose? (From your account, you have done the same.)

You obviously feel trapped, stuck financially supporting a family that ‚Äî according to you ‚Äî takes your hard-earned assets and returns nothing.

Your wife should not be taking out student loans. These loans are the worst bet in the world and paying them back will deplete the gains she might see from her additional degree.

You two should immediately seek the help of a marriage counselor. Additionally, you could investigate a postnuptial agreement to outline the financial terms by which you quite obviously define the relative success of your marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

While the plot of the story is just so gripping, and I implore all you ladies to watch it if you have the time (it is 10 episodes, 48mins long). I want to draw some light on the character of Anne Montgomery, which I found was extremely fascinating. 

&amp;#x200B;

She embodies ""all men are like that"", to the most beautiful extreme, since an abusive childhood, this lady self made herself into the most powerful venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. 

She is extremely sexy, extremely attractive and she KNOWS how to use her charm to her advantage -- she sees men for that they are, **a means to her end**. She plays these scrotes so easily and elegantly because they are just so enslaved by their di\*cks. It is amazing how much she achieves by being ruthless and calculating over emotional and weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will just quote her monologue from the pilot,

*""* ***Everything happens for a reason. Think about that for a moment. All your efforts... personal, professional, carnal... utter and absolute slaves... to some cosmically predetermined set of outcomes. As if we have no say in, let alone culpability for, the defining moments in our lives. If you want a life of purpose... by inverting the notion... that everything happens for a reason.*** 

***Redefine it. Not as some future explanation for terrible tragedy, or glorious achievement, but as validation... of the deliberate choices that lead us to these critical junctures in the first place.*** 

***Assert authority over chance, fate, and destiny, because everything does happen for a reason. And that reason is you. To attain elite success, you must be willing to make the hard choices, do the unpleasant things, risk your most valuable assets, and do away with the shackles designed by society to limit us: love, marriage, children. And above all, the uninvited imposition of lesser people's moral agendas. Because nothing worthwhile is ever achieved without sacrifice. And true greatness... only comes to those... willing to pursue it... at... any cost.*** *""*

&amp;#x200B;

Assert authority ladies. It was absolutely true when Beyonce sang, ""Girls run the world"", because we do. Become acutely aware of your power and weild it to achieve incredible things. Do not let men stop you from acheiving greatness, rather use them as stepping-stones.

503,t3_ratmxy,I need advice about workplace sexual harassment,"Hey Queens, 

I need advice about workplace sexual harassment that I'm experiencing at the moment. I'm currently on shut down work in central Queensland with a 60+ year old male  colleague. 

I've never met this guy before last week. I've only been working for this new company for 2 months. The first incident happened where he constantly demanded I smile for him. The first time it happened it left me a bit reeled but I brushed it off. The second time it happened i told him no, I won't thank you. The third time it happened I was completing permits etc and he got right in my face and demanded I smile again. I asked him straight up with alot of attitude why should I? What have I got to smile about. The fourth time it happened I asked him to stop asking me to smile and looked quite pissed off and upset about it. He just kept on with this creepy grin and kept pushing. 

The last time it happened I was getting in the truck, and the first thing he says to me when I open the door is ""smile would you?"". I lost my shit. I raised my voice and told him to stop telling me to smile. He says ""why?"" I yelled ""because it's sexist!"". He got SUPER mad and said ""excuse me?!"".

I repeated that it was sexist to demand a woman to smile in the work place. He grumbled about how he ""says it to men too"" üôÑ

After we got onsite he rang management. He complained how he got offended by me calling him sexist. What he didn't know is he essentially dobbed himself in. Management rang me and asked me what happened. I said I've been putting up with him demanding me to smile for him for over a week and I snapped. Management said they have my back and it is never to happen again. They will give him a warning and if he does it again, he's out. True to their word he got spoken to. 

Now come to today. He's stepped up his game. My work is very physically demanding and often times requires help. Whilst performing work I started noticing that he was ""accidentally"" brushing my breasts. First time it happened I let it go because I was holding something near my chest and thought, hey it can happen... Maybe it wasn't intentional. But then it happened again...

I step outside the booth because my alarms where ringing and my gut was telling me to get out. I pick up some paper work and he comes out and starts talking work related stuff. All of a sudden, he says ""bug"" and puts his hand on my left breast and makes a sweeping motion across it to get whatever was on there, off. I look to the ground and I don't see anything... 

My inner waters are telling me to RUN from this fucking creep. I go over to the crib room and he leaves me be until lunch break. He pulls up beside me in the truck and yells "" I wondered where *MY* (OP name) was"" 

Ladies, I don't know what to do. If I raise this with management he can plausibly deny touching me and say it was an accident etc.
You all know what happens to us women who ""make a fuss"". I'm isolated in a small QLD town with no one here but me and him. He knows he has me cornered. How can I protect myself until next Wednesday. I'm documenting EVERYTHING. Do I wait to see if something else happens tomorrow and if it does call the office and tell them to pull me from the job? Do I make a preemptive strike and call now? 

Sincerely yours,
An isolated and scared Queen

*Edit update* Thank you guys so much for all your support! I've notified management of what's been happening. I spoke to my boss last night and didn't even get halfway through telling what happened before he cut me off and said, I'm sorry I need to ring Rob right now (our CEO) were pulling you out, that's not ok. Within a matter of 20 minutes they've booked me a private plane back to Brisbane so I don't have to drive the truck back. My boss said he supports me 100% and this should never have happened. They're getting me out this afternoon! In all honesty they did the right thing, but I'm now going to have to deal with the fallout from the other men because I've spoken up and potentially ruined a man's career. We all know how men think.

504,t3_rapug9,Relationships with men as a reflection of relationship with parents,"
Lately I‚Äôve been realizing how my experience with men is similar to my relationship with my parents. Mainly my mom. Even now, I am gaslit by parents in my 30s. They were emotionally, physically and mentally abusive. They believe I should never question them and as a kid I had to obey or I would get whooped. I now see why I let myself get treated so poorly in relationships. I was taught not to questions others‚Äô treatment of me or I would be abused and ostracized. If I was in a relationship with a man who treated me like my parents treat me, they would tell me to leave. But somehow, it‚Äôs okay for them to? Anyways, here are just a few of the commonalities between my relationship with parents and how I was treated in a past relationship. What‚Äôs crazy is how even some of the phrases my ex would say to me sounded like they could have come out of my moms own mouth.

- I‚Äôm not loved for simply being loved, but treated like I am hard to love and have to prove myself. 
- Infantilizing me, believing they know better than me about things they have no knowledge of or experience with, or trying to fix me
- Treating me like I have to explain my space on the planet
- Talking over me
- Appreciating me only when I‚Äôm gone and only telling me how valuable I am to them when I cut ties
- Comparing me to other people
- Gaslighting me
- Saying I‚Äôm negative when I try to confront issues. 
- One face in public and another in private
- Religious hypocrites

If you‚Äôve watched the news lately, you‚Äôve probably heard of the male nurse that raped and impregnated his brain-injured female patient. He was offered a plea bargain, and will only serve 10 years in prison.

As nauseating as this story is for me, what‚Äôs almost as disturbing is the number of male nurses that comment on these news articles. One male nurse even chimed in to lament that no one trusts him with his female patients when he needs to ‚Äúspread her pussy lips to place a Purewick.‚Äù (A Purewick is an external female catheter used to collect urine.) 

This is how your average man thinks about women and girls, even when they‚Äôre disabled and incontinent. Even when they‚Äôre elderly, even when they‚Äôre children. Unfortunately, even disgusting, predatory men can get a nursing license. It‚Äôs even easier for them to become techs, nurse‚Äôs aids, or therapists.

At my hospital, one of the most common requests we receive from the patient‚Äôs family is for female-only staff. We always honor this request, no questions asked. And would you like to guess who makes this request most often? That‚Äôs right - it‚Äôs men. It‚Äôs usually the patient‚Äôs father, husband, brother, etc. that will ask for female staff. Because they know. *They fucking know* exactly how male staff are thinking about their helpless loved one. 

I have many male coworkers, and I love working with most of them. But you can never know a man - and I mean really know his character and his moral fiber - until you‚Äôve seen how he treats a helpless woman when no one is looking. For this reason, I don‚Äôt bother vouching for any of my male colleagues, because by definition it‚Äôs impossible for me to know who they are when I‚Äôm not looking. 

I have male colleagues that I‚Äôve worked with closely for years, and I respect them as professionals. But if my daughter were to become a disabled patient in my hospital, I would still demand female-only staff to care for her. And if any of my male colleagues didn‚Äôt like it, they would instantly be pegged as a LVM creep.

507,t3_rajbzf,"Disgusted by BDSM ""community"".","**POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING**

*TLDR At the end.*

I feel totally disgusted and confused at the same time.

I'm near the end of therapy and I've grown so much in these past years of therapy.
I used to be a in the BDSM community from the age of 16 till 21-ish. (Terribly young, I know)

Today I remembered I still had an Fetlife account which I haven't checked for ages but I wanted to log in and see what I got myself into and how I would feel about it now. 
And I am literally shocked, I felt a knot in my stomach, I felt sad, disgusted and overall mind-blown, with what I saw. 
I felt dizzy and I just became speechless watching these horrible photos. 
I know there is heavy shit on there, fully aware but how my body responded and how I used to ignore all these NO responses, is extremely upsetting for me but I am so happy I left that all far behind.

The women on there exploiting themselves for free (even if they were paid for it, it is extremely sad) and I don't know for sure if this is a projection but I can almost see in their eyes that they do not want to do this or do not feel comfortable or anything.
I must say the women actually make an effort in looking good in a way, the men on there well, I could almost smell them in the worse way possible.

The images I saw in general but also from my country, in my area, were all so abusive, bruises, marks, blood, needles..
Also I feel that a lot of them are on drugs or some shit.
And the absurd part is, they all project it as some kind of romance. 

As if being half beaten to death is love and romance
As if being called (or written on your body) a 'pig' 'filthy' 'slut' and whatever horrible names I saw is love and romance
As if having bruises, rope marks, fear in your eyes, kneeling in ""obedience"", being fucking tortured is love and romance 

I. Am. Totally. Disgusted.

How the fuck did I used to like this? How in the actual fuck did I want this for my self at a point in my life? 

I thought hm maybe it isn't so bad but I can not ignore my intuition, the signs my body is given me anymore. I can not and will not like this ever again and I am actually wondering if I will ever meet a man who is not into this bdsm cult since it's so eMpOwEriNG. Fuck that.
(Not that I'm focusing on the male species right now but ok)

I also wonder if anybody recognizes this or maybe have some more insights about why I used to like this, what attracted me.
I already have some insights but I would like to read more perspectives.

516,t3_raeef6,Your Legal Name is a Commodity- Protect It!,"Hi Ladies,

Coming through with a reminder about staying safe in these treacherous times. Especially for those who are more established.

Your real name is a commodity. *Do not reveal it until you feel safe.* Why? A lvm can use it to find out a *lot* about you. I‚Äôm a lawyer and I use these powers for good, but I am constantly surprised how much I can find about people by knowing where to look in public records. 

A legal name enables you to find:
Professional licenses, business ownership or affiliations, voter registrations, property ownership, mortgages and deeds, legal records, and much more, online, in minutes. Importantly, these records will contain work and personal addresses, your birthdate, and other sensitive information. When I‚Äôm trying to figure out where someone lives and their date of birth, it‚Äôs traffic tickets that come in clutch most often. 

These being public records they can only be scrubbed in incredibly limited situations that most people won‚Äôt qualify for- so they‚Äôll always be there. You can avoid them being misused by giving men a nickname, not sharing your last name, etc. If you have a unique first or last name, treat that like gold, as the search engines that allow partial names will find you easily. 

Toy around with these systems on your own to see how they work and what‚Äôs already available on you. I, for example found that despite other attorneys having same/similar names, there is a specific portion of my name, that when searched in the Florida Bar registry pulls up my license (which also gives my work address, email, and phone number) immediately. That affects how much of my name and what nickname I would go by with someone I haven‚Äôt vetted yet. 

An interesting caveat is some states have laws surrounding use of this information. For example there may be a disclaimer before clicking to see results or making the search that affirm you‚Äôre not using it for an illegal or improper purpose. If you‚Äôre in one of those states, in theory someone looking you up to harass you or cause harm to you could be breaking the law. Unfortunately though that‚Äôs only going to help in retrospect.",255.0

First of all, it's been established for years that men who are dumped take it much harder than women who are dumped. Men cannot sleep as well without their partner, and have more suicidal thoughts after the end of a relationship compared to women:  [Why Breakups Are Actually Tougher on Men | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/it-s-man-s-and-woman-s-world/201412/why-breakups-are-actually-tougher-men)  So this idea that your ex is partying it up with other women? That he's living a high life without you somewhere? Throw those thoughts away! He is more than likely tossing and turning and getting back into the modern groove of alcohol, drugs and porn. 

Toxic thinking of ""what ifs"" can spoil your new connections and relationships. How can you see a window opening if you're fixated on a closed door? Think about your mental energy. Was your ex really worth all of that energy? Come on. Is he thinking about you on the same level? Is he wondering if he hurt your feelings? NO ! Why dedicate your valuable mental effort to some dude who couldn't even text back? Some dude who didn't bother to remember your birthday, or stand up for you socially? Please! 

Comparing a new man to an ex can be never ending. It's so important to recognize patterns, especially if they include red flags. However, I have seen all relationships, including friendships, strain because the woman was clearly not over her LVM / NVM ex. The woman lived in the misery of the past. This is not HVW behavior -- level up! Move on! Grown women move on.

Women seem to have forgotten the aspect of \*blamelessness\*. This features prominently in the Bible for starters. Many women have been led astray by LVM / NVM and then engage in FOMO thinking (""What if he gets better? What if he improves? He just needs me!""). But why do we even bother to think like this, if we are blameless? If our walk is blameless, if we speak with righteousness (Psalm 15), why do we still feel guilty? It seems like many women recognize there is blame somewhere, and being the responsible individuals we are, we shoulder this blame. NO! There is virtue in blamelessness. Take your fine blameless selves and LEAVE ! 

Aren't you excited about your future? Think about all of the things you can fill with your life, now that your dumb useless weak ex is gone. Flip through your calendar/ journal etc and focus on the blank spaces. Aren't you excited to fill those up? Focus on the FUTURE! Not the past.",285.0

524,t3_ra918a,Reframing Some Ideas,"Something I realised today was that up until now, I had been describing my dating preferences as a combination of traditional and modern. Traditional in the sense that I believe the men I date should take care of me and provide or contribute for me, and modern in the sense that I will not be a subservient trophy and I will have my own financial independence.

What I realised though was that wanting men to take care of me, which by the way, elicits so many negative responses from men afraid of losing money they don‚Äôt possess, is not traditional at all.

What it really is, is wanting the strong to protect the weak. Now, let me clarify. I am not calling women weak and I am not calling men strong, it‚Äôs a very tidy and general title. But it relates to this other personal belief I have that the strong (physically, mentally and in any other way‚Äî actually strong) should protect the actually weak, simply because they can. I believe that if someone *can* help someone, then they *should.*

So when I say men should protect women, I mean they should exert their positions in society as men (less hurdles, further ahead) to bring the women in their life to an equal *and* equitable level, and then more to compensate for the position that women hold (more hurdles, further back). This is what I mean by strong and weak. I believe that men should do this simply because it is within their ability to, therefore it is their responsibility to. The same way we extend compassion and decent for children, for pregnant women, for the impaired. 

When I call this concept traditional, what I get is men then interrogating me because none of my other values are traditional. They are angry because they don‚Äôt think I should pick and choose, that if I want to be traditional in one sense then I need to be the same in all other regards. So I have decided to stop calling it traditional. 

I go out of my way for others who lack the things I have, not to be some saint or for something in return or to feel better about myself but because I have the power to do so. It‚Äôs social, emotional, economic, historical and political awareness and intelligence. It‚Äôs basic empathy and the basic understanding that not everyone starts the race of life at the same starting point, some are further behind. 

So when I make it a standard of mine that the men I date take care of me and provide for me, it‚Äôs because they understand the nuances of my position. It wasn‚Äôt long ago that women were not allowed to work or open a bank account, and the wage gap still exists. Women have so much more to lose when dating, such as their LIVES (re: Grace Millane). 

It has also been a very common finding that the way men invest in you correlates to their interest in you. The man who makes you split the bill wants you to pay for the pleasure of being easily accessible to him, the man that pays $50 once or twice for your dinner expects you to sleep with him, but the man who consistently, without expecting anything in return, cares for you because he actually likes you and wants to impress you and understands the risks you are taking and efforts you are putting in will regularly prove his commitment and capabilities. 

They say that a man who is cheap with money is cheap with love, and the inverse can ring true. A man who cares for you in all aspects of life is also likely to be a generous lover.

I realised that it‚Äôs not about tradition or wanting a provider, it‚Äôs just down to awareness and intelligence. It isn‚Äôt always material either. Men rarely understand this, or they vehemently deny that women have it harder in so many ways. So even being with a man who understands and expresses this understanding in the form of validation and verbal affirmations is a sign of healthy commitment and contribution to your wellbeing.",89.0

526,t3_ra8uew,Erotica and Romance Books,"I used to read a lot of romance, I read a lot in general but at some point romance became my genre of choice. 
At some point romance became my genre of choice. But since finding FDS I've naturally gravitated away from it. I just slowly realised the role it had in encouraging me to put men on a pedestal, forming crushes and just expecting less from men. 

I also stopped reading erotica. Similarly because of the way it was subverting my view of sex and my desires. I've really looked and there's not a lot research out there on the impact of erotica, porn is only recently getting the critique it deserves so I'm not surprised.  I wouldn't put erotica on the same level as porn but most are increasingly disempowering for women. It's another matter I've been wanting to put towards this sub 

My real issue here is I miss books that sexually excite me. Reading is my main source of joy for all things and I have a great imagination but it doesn't replace the joy of reading. 
Reading  was really tied into my sexuality and now I feel a bit bored. I tried rereading a sexy romance a few days ago and I couldn't read it freely - it was so clear that this woman was recreating porn on paper and I was surprised I hadn't seen how nasty it was before. 

What do I do? Is it worth searching for erotica/romance that is empowering for women - is that even a thing? I'm starting to think maybe not. Is there a substitute?

530,t3_ra0vpr,Friend completely ignored me at her wedding. Should I block her?,"Hello fellow queens. I recently went to a wedding of a friend. We have been friends since college and we are both mid-twenties.
We live in the same city, and use to hang out pretty often but this year she barely initiated any plans to hang out and whenever I made plans she said yes but cancelled last minute. It happened like at least 5 times so I stopped initiating meet ups and thought may be she would plan something when she will have time. She actually got engaged last year to a guy via arrange marriage and I was pretty much vocal about my disapproval before she said yes to the engagement after wards I didn't say anything against it. The guy is the full package of low value qualities. He's super cheap. In my opinion if a guy is cheap with money he's cheap with love. It's not a good quality to have and I told her that she could do better. But she went ahead and said yes to the engagement anyway. After that she stopped initiating hang out plans and I didn't see her until the wedding which was last month. Now I wasn't planning on attending since I haven't seen her in a year. But she called like a 100 times so I went. It was a two day event and I didn't know anybody there. We had a few mutual friends but no one came. So I was alone the whole time. My friend was in the makeup room most of the time and apparently I wasn't allowed in there. I didn't see her until she came out of her room and barely talked with me. The next day was the same. So I was pretty frustrated with her. I felt very insulted. And now it's been a week since the wedding and she's been texting me and calling me but I ignored her and hasn't responded to any of her texts and calls. Now she's saying that she's having some kind of problem and really wants to talk to me but I'm thinking of blocking her and never wants to talk to her again. Am I being too harsh? Should I block her?

532,t3_r9vpp2,It doesn‚Äôt matter what type of p*rn it is‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs still p*rn.,"So some topics here about how bad porn can be for you made me think of a male friend I have that I have known for a long time.

I asked him casually, ‚ÄúDo you watch p\*rn?‚Äù

He told me ‚Äúregular porn doesn‚Äôt do anything for me at best and at worst grosses me out.‚Äù

I asked ‚Äúwell then what do you watch?‚Äù

He said ‚Äúsolo striptease and girl on girl. That‚Äôs it.‚Äù

Now, while he doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative that people who watch p\*rn need to watch more extreme variants over time (because he refuses to watch anything harder than girl on girl), even him watching girl on girl videos has an effect on him.

For starters, I had to tell him that real lesbians or even girls that are bi and in same-sex relationships don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. have‚Ä¶. Sex‚Ä¶. Like‚Ä¶. That. Ever. I personally know a lesbian and she states that men who fetishize them because of watching p\*rn have no clue on how they actually work.

Secondly, he makes it a point to go down to the local ‚Äúadult entertainment convention‚Äù they have down here every year to take pics with his favorite adult actresses. Now, I told him ‚Äúhey your personal life do what you want but for the love of all things holy don‚Äôt put them on Facebook.‚Äù He won‚Äôt listen because apparently ‚Äúp\*rn stars are people too.‚Äù Fine, but I can tell you that if a real-life woman he actually liked was to see those‚Ä¶. She‚Äôs not going to like it very much.

But the one thing that he fails to understand is that porn can still effect how you perceive women no matter if it‚Äôs a man and woman or two women. Case in point? We live in South Florida, and let‚Äôs just say that many of our local female newscasters are very attractive. He jokingly told me, ‚Äúsometimes when they are wearing a sleeveless dress with just the right cut showing skin it can make surprisingly good‚Ä¶. Fun time material.‚Äù I asked him, ‚ÄúDo you seriously DVR the news so you can beat it to the news ladies depending on what they are wearing?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúI can neither confirm nor deny.‚Äù üôÑ

He‚Äôs very technically savvy (Has to be for his job), and one day I asked him if there was an app to download images off instagram. He said ‚Äúthere sure is‚Ä¶. I use it all the time.‚Äù I asked, ‚Äúlet me guess you use it to download some girl‚Äôs images so you can get your rocks off?‚Äù He tried to brush it off, but later on he admitted that if there is, for example a singer he found on Youtube he would go on her instagram, check if she has any ‚Äúsexy‚Äù pictures (Even if it‚Äôs her just wearing regular clothes like a tank top and jeans, to him if she is showing any skin it qualifies) and use the program to download her pictures, delete the ‚Äúdull‚Äù stuff and get down with it afterwards. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The problem with both things I mentioned above is that I believe he would not look at women like they are masturbatory aids if he didn‚Äôt watch p\*rn every night, despite it being girl on girl. He says getting his release helps him sleep, says ‚Äúorgasms are mother nature‚Äôs ambien.‚Äù  I told him it‚Äôs going to wreck his brain if it hasn‚Äôt already.

The funny thing is that he has this ability to ‚Äúcompartmentalize‚Äù in what he consumes for entertainment. He said recently on social media, ‚Äúmodern music videos and overhyped tourist trappy restaurants have one thing in common. Much as how some restaurants overdo it with ambience to distract from the mediocre quality of the food, if you see that a music video dials up the sexiness to the point where it‚Äôs bordering on soft core p\*rn it‚Äôs to district from either the bad singing or lack of songwriting depth.‚Äù  (He‚Äôs a fan of classic rock and metal, but will listen to newer bands if he likes their content.)

I told him offline, ‚ÄúBut you like p\*rn!‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúIf I am going to watch a p\*rn scene I‚Äôll watch it.  When I watch a music video I‚Äôm there for the music‚Ä¶. Not to have my intelligence insulted while a record company tries to use my eyes to distract my ears from the crappy singing or lack of songwriting quality.‚Äù  No he‚Äôll just go on her instagram or Facebook and download her ‚Äúsexy‚Äù pics to beat it later. üôÑ

So there you have it.

I personally think that my friend really needs to lay off the porn‚Ä¶. And stop stealing regular womens‚Äô instagram pics. He recently said a well-known Youtube singer he really likes ‚Äì who I just know he downloaded her pictures to beat off to ‚Äì might be touring our part of the country soon and said ‚ÄúMan I am so getting a meet-and-greet pass when it‚Äôs available.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs hope he knows how to extend his compartmentalization to meeting her in real life that‚Äôs all I can say.",34.0
533,t3_r9uk2c,"If his friends are LV, then he‚Äôs a LVM","This one is obvious, but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to see if you don‚Äôt hold him responsible for his choices: An important part of vetting is to closely examine the people or environments he exposes you to. 

This is one of my lessons learned during my first LTR. I‚Äôll be the first to say that it sucks to cut important people out of your life due to how much pain they put you through, because it‚Äôs hard to prioritize your own well-being if they mean a lot to you. This is especially hard for those of us who come from difficult backgrounds. 

However, I no longer let people like that be around me. One of the reasons I made this decision is because I realized I was letting that energy affect my other relationships. My loved ones don‚Äôt deserve that. 

So now, I am able to leave a man if he exposes me to a bad vibe. I don‚Äôt care where it comes from- toxic potential in-laws, messy/incestuous friend groups, or a toxic workplace. These things that surround a relationship are called exosystems, and it‚Äôs scientifically guaranteed to affect you. 

One of the ways the insidious toxicity of these bad relationships manifested was in racist environments that my ex exposed me to. So many weddings with people from his fraternity (the recent post about frats drives my point home). We‚Äôd be doing random things with his friends, like playing board games, and I felt uncomfortable so many times. I would never date a man with low-key racist or homophobic friends again. Doesn‚Äôt matter if he goes to every protest with me and agrees with every point. He is his friends. He is his environment. 

Just thought I‚Äôd give some scientific credibility to this concept! Exosystems are important, and it is also his responsibility to manage them. I‚Äôm tired of this whole ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt choose your family‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs just his friend from college‚Äù narrative. Yes. He. Does. Choose.",649.0

535,t3_r9t23y,Men don‚Äôt *become* generous once they start earning money. They are attempting to buy you.,"I don‚Äôt have a flair but hopefully it‚Äôs still okay to post this.

So after over a year of lurking here (and learning + leveling up like crazy) I have finally decided to post something that I wrote up in my notes for myself and basically to just remind you guys (and myself) that generosity is part of someone‚Äôs personality and it doesn‚Äôt magically happen once they start earning more money.

That guy that never pays for anything? Can‚Äôt be bothered to buy you flowers on your birthday? Doesn‚Äôt treat you to dinner? He will never be a generous man that buys you things. Even if he ends up becoming a doctor etc because generosity has never appeared out of thin air. If you look behind what generosity is it is values like kindness, respect, ability to appreciate someone and wanting to make others happy. If someone has these values money does not make them appear or go away.
This is why you don‚Äôt chase potential! Because I‚Äôve seen men on low income (my friend who is still studying-he‚Äôs 21) save up every spare cent to make their girlfriend happy. When he makes more money in the future he will still have the same energy.

If you see a male become more ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù once he reaches a high income he is not actually being generous he is trying to buy what he wants (sex, bangmaid) with his money (taking her out for dinner) and it‚Äôs completely transactional and the focus is on getting what he wants rather than making her happy.

Avoid all men who aren‚Äôt generous-they do not change because generosity is character and money doesn‚Äôt change character-in fact money exacerbates the character. Elon musk is a good example of this. He buys women‚Äôs affection and then forces them to sign a prenup, knocks them up and then leaves them with nothing.",54.0
536,t3_r9spmu,Grace Millane - Murdered by her Tinder date - This is why we vet ruthlessly,"This was a 2018 case in New Zealand where Jesse Kempson murdered Grace Millane, his Tinder date.

As much as we don‚Äôt want to think about it, this stuff really does happen to normal people by seemingly normal-looking monsters and this is why FDS vetting principles are so important.

Grace died by asphyxiation and her murderer literally moved her body through suitcases out of his apartment. This case was proved by an insane amount of CCTV footage of him buying the suitcases, cleaning products, ordering a professional cleaner, renting a car, cleaning it, disposing of things into trash bins, all while coldly going about the business of coverup. 

Grace was filmed going into his apartment and coming out in a suitcase. She was found to have a high alcohol percentage in her body. He claimed the rough sex defense, except minutes after he killed her his phone internet search history showed he was looking for ways to dispose of her, thru fire or in the woods, he looked at p*rn and took 7 pictures of her lifeless body. A day or so later he went to another date. The next girl is shown on CCTV to put a decent amount space between herself and him, possibly trusting her instincts. She didn‚Äôt agree to go anywhere else with him further.

FDS advises against men who are into BDSM, casual sex, having drinks dates, OLD, and drinking too much on a date. Drinking can numb your intuition against these monsters.

Be ruthless in vetting. This will save your life.

‚Ä¢ **IDENTITY DISCLOSURE:** Never disclose your living address. Do not let them pick you up for a date or DoorDash you a cup of your favorite coffee. Be vague about where and what you do for work;

‚Ä¢ **TRAUMA DUMP:** Never share your vulnerabilities, traumas, or aspirations (‚ÄúI am ready to be treated well‚Äù/‚ÄúI am tired of wasting time‚Äù). Watch your language and what it conveys to a potential predator;

Yet the male characters are all depicted as heroic, misunderstood, treated badly by their ex-girlfriend or ex-wives or whatever - but will always be there for each other. Like they can ditch a date with no problem for their bro, will always put their bro first, is there every time their bro is in need - ready to lend his shoulder. Will move heaven and (literally) go to hell for their bro (anything come to mind ladies?)

All the main male characters are fleshed out and have arches, character development, backstories, conflicts, dramas, explanation - you name it. 

Annnddd they act surprised when the audiences just rather ship the male characters with each other? They blame the audience and act disgusted when we enjoy creating stories with *more depth* surrounding the fleshed out characters?

557,t3_r8ryox,"Don‚Äôt Panic, Have a Plan","Hi Ladies! 

I‚Äôm a lawyer and wanted to chime in on the abortion rights buzz. I am *not* a Constitutional lawyer and I‚Äôm *not* giving legal advice here, just my perspective. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs time to panic. First of all, the Supreme Court is deciding the legality of the Mississippi law specifically. The wrinkle is the lawyers have, rightfully, intermeshed the issues. If the Mississippi law is illegal then it must be because it violates Roe, meaning Roe is a valid holding. If the Mississippi law is legal then The question becomes, how does that work? It would violate Roe but maybe not other precedent. The Court shouldn‚Äôt uphold a law that violates their prior holding unless they find some logic to support both conclusions. *That* is why Roe is on the table here and why people fear its day is coming. It would be very hard to uphold the Mississippi law, as the Conservatives want to, without also nullifying Roe. 

What I think is also important to consider is this:

Supreme Court Justices don‚Äôt think, reason, and act the same way Conservative politicians do. That‚Äôs why they do unpredictable things sometimes. While they probably want to toss Roe, they also don‚Äôt want legal backlash. The reasoning it would take to overturn Roe could apply in other situations disfavored to a Conservative. If long standing precedent on abortion rights can be revisited- so too can the tangents of 2A rights, marriage, voter ID laws, etc. Whatever they decide they‚Äôre going to be careful because they will not want their own words and logic thrown in their faces in a subsequent case. 

If Roe is nullified, each state will make their own rules, which is where we were pre-Roe. History will repeat itself. Someone will bring the case again when the court has a liberal majority. That may or may not be in our lifetimes. But it *will* forever stain the legacy of the Justices who voted as they did. Overruling prior precedent is a *huge* deal, its not just Roe, its a litany of subsequent cases that would be affected. Again, I think the opportunity for that to return to the court is significant. And the Conservatives don‚Äôt want that. 

That said, my prediction is they either 1) strike the Mississippi law or 2) uphold it with a narrow and watered down version of Roe that gives all practical power to the states. I don‚Äôt think the Justices really wanted to take on this case because of all the minefields I described above but had to. 

SO- don‚Äôt panic, just have a plan. As other posters have said, maybe that‚Äôs celibacy or moving to a state with broader rights. Right now, *no one knows if Roe is done*. Even if that‚Äôs ultimately the case, abortions *will not automatically become illegal*, it will just be state by state. Become familiar with your state‚Äôs laws and those around you. Support and educate women and girls who don‚Äôt know their options. Most importantly- Stay strong and unbothered! We‚Äôre smarter than the people trying to outsmart us.",334.0
558,t3_r8rb5l,I finally really and truly do not care about finding a man!,"I was never boy crazy but I always felt like I should make an attempt to meet someone who meets my standards. I‚Äôve been single for the past two years after the worst breakup I‚Äôve experienced. I started following FDS last year and since then, I have gone on several dates.  I have also quickly blocked and deleted all of the scrotes I encountered. I eliminated pretty much all of the low value people in my life and these days I am in a lot of solitude. Despite this progress, in the back of my mind, I still hoped that I would find somebody esp the more into my 30s I got. I was using dating apps actively, although that never produced a quality prospect, especially since FDS. And I would develop a bit of fantasy thinking if I met a cute guy IRL without even knowing a thing about him. 

But there has been a shift recently. I no longer swipe on dating apps although I still have hinge on because my membership that I paid for had not expired. I do not care about what guys that check me out think about me, and I do not pay any guy much attention at all. I looked at my hinge this morning and usually I do not like the messages or profiles that like me, but there were actually about 10 guys that seemed intriguing based on initial screening..its rare to see 1.

I recently reconnected with an old acquaintance from 20 years ago. He lives close to me and we have FB friends in common. He wanted to take me to dinner and made it clear that this was just as friends, which is what I preferred. 

I already knew I couldn't date this guy due to him having some obvious deal breakers that I learned early on (lives with his parents, dead end job, bad financial decisions, no goals, and more).

After a month or so ""being friends"" it was clear to me that he wanted more, which was as so odd to me because he put in no effort. For instance, when we went to dinner he wore sandals, t-shirt and shorts, and unshaved (it's winter time). I figured the way he presented himself made it clear this was just a friendship because what guy would think it was OK to put literally no effort in his appearance for a date?

Skip ahead a month or so, I finally told him the amount of texting and time he wanted to spend with me is out of my comfort zone for people I am just friends with. I'm an introvert and live alone and enjoy my solitude. I'm also not interested in dating at the moment and certainly not interested in dating a grown man that doesn't have his life together. 

If more than a few hours passed, he would text me a sad emoji. He communicated a lot with emojis.

Needless to say that after I set clear boundaries for him as a friend, he no longer communicates with me.",18.0

562,t3_r8owy4,Normalize telling men they don‚Äôt turn you on anymore,"There‚Äôs a certain subreddit on here where moms in the midst of crisis post. It‚Äôs very sobering to read. Anyways, once in a while I‚Äôll see a woman talk about how her husband is only affectionate when he wants sex. 

I‚Äôm a very physical person and I‚Äôd say that one of my main love languages is physical touch. Not that I really place a lot of stock in the love language thing. For some reason, a lot of people seem to think the physical aspect just equates to sex and if you aren‚Äôt t sexually active enough with a partner you‚Äôre not speaking their love language.

In general, I tend to hug and kiss my family, nieces and nephews a lot and am the type of person that, for example, will stroke my nephews hair or face as I‚Äôm holding him, give someone a back rub if they are falling asleep or know they are stressed, etc. 

My porn addicted ex only ever offered to massage me to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù in the beginning of our relationship when he wanted sex. If my back actually hurt and I really needed a massage he wouldn‚Äôt offer. If i was crying or emotional after a long day and needed to cuddle, he expected sex after that because ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt help it‚Äù. The only time he put down his phone to pay direct attention to me was when he wanted sex. He knew all the right things to say and do to a girl and how to be romantic but acted platonic with me unless he wanted sex . No caresses or kisses or anything like that. So surprise surprise, I eventually wasn‚Äôt enthusiastic about sex with him. His response was to imply that I was frigid and he needed a girl who was more sexual. I LOVE sex you ü§°, but because of your incompetence I can give myself better orgasms than you give me.

Growing up, I always  heard on church and tv things like:

‚Äúthey stop giving you sex after marriage so enjoy it while it lasts‚Äù 

‚ÄúYour bodies belong to each other and the wife should submit to the husband‚Äù (churches enabling low effort men)

‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs not getting it at home he‚Äôll get it somewhere else‚Äù

Society says man can tell women they are unattractive and need to lose weight. Why isn‚Äôt it normalized to tell them we don‚Äôt get turned on by them anymore?

When a woman is tired from running after toddlers, doing all the emotional labor, working full time, not receiving affection unless he wants sex, cleaning his piss off the toilet and generally being his mommy, she isn‚Äôt going to get wet for him like she did when she felt she was with a masculine and affectionate man (SHOCKERüò±)! Why?

SHES NOT TURNED ON BY HIM ANYMORE. 

I‚Äôve been wracking my brain trying to understand why I‚Äôve never heard women saying this more often, if at all? The narrative around this topic is man centric.

Mens egos can‚Äôt handle it if you tell them you aren‚Äôt attracted to them. So ladies, if a man is whining about you not being in the mood and putting all the blame on you, tell him:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel turned on by you anymore‚Äù

Let him know he‚Äôs the problem, not you.

If you are in the habit of making excuses for men's bad behavior, or the stupid/hateful things they say, stop and ask yourself why. It's one thing to give someone the benefit of the doubt if you're never going to see him again. You can go through life in peace not taking idiots personally. But if you're going to invite someone in your life, it is prudent to make sure it's someone who respects women.

If he has disrespectful things to say about women he's never met, if he refers to us as ""b\*tches"" or even ""chicks"", if he talks rudely to his mama, don't walk‚Äîrun!

The lengths I used to go to to rationalize for him! Oh, his mother wasn't there for him, he just hasn't had a good example of women in his life yet, I'll show him what a good woman is like. Oh, he's just in a space where he's really exploring his masculinity, that's why he doesn't value the feminine right now. (Pssst. That wasn't masculinity. It was cluster B.)

A recent text from him after I refused to meet up in person again and said he could tell me whatever he needed to say over the phone, and he tried to guilt me because he's ""the father of our children,"" and then called me controlling for not wanting to see him in person: ""Trust me, the last thing I want to see if \[sic\] a middle aged women \[sic\] who is angry at the world.""

565,t3_r8gqis,The Adorned Woman is Adored,"Women are equated with beauty. A woman is known as beautiful and beauty is personified as a woman. From personal experience and from my research on current trends/currating my wardrobe is that: *to be adorned is to be adored.* 

Women who are well taken care of (by themselves or others) dress well, accessorize well, groom well, and adorn themselves with jewels. Diamonds are a girl's best friend for many reasons: namely that they keep LVM from thinking they can get close to you. The more expensive your taste and look appears the fewer LVM will attempt to access you- because you must have good friends and men around to treat you so well. This ties back to 'always tell men you've been treated well in the past'- dress like you've been given thoughtful gifts, adorn yourself with jewelry to sparkle and shine and reflect your light, and keep those LVM in the shadows where they belong.

The times I've experienced the most sexual assault and harrassment have been when I've played up my tomboy roots, or when I've been feeling down (and dressing and looking it to). When I dress well, confidently, and adorn myself with jewelry- men treat me better. And by treat me better- I mean they don't approach me. And the men who do are respectful and courteous- regardless of romantic intentions.

TLDR; dress and accessorize like you have a thoughtful boyfriend- and keep the scrotes scared off and afraid to ask. If you adorn yourself like you're adored- you'll avoid a lot of LV attention",533.0

I predict that men who are looking to cheat are going to utilize this tool to create fake Facebook profiles. 

The worst part of this is that they could easily create a profile for themselves as if they live in a city they frequently visit. 

If they block everyone on their personal profile it allows them to easily cover their tracks from people who know them personally.

568,t3_r8dhws,Green Flags - Holiday Edition,"Ladies, the Holidays are an excellent time for those of you who are in more serious or new  relationships to vet. I've noticed some posts on here recently of talking about ""HVM"" who are doing either the bare minimum or worse, are behaving terribly. So I think some examples are in order. 

The holidays can bring up a lot of stress for people, show how they interact with their family and are also a perfect time to assess someone's generosity, thoughtfulness, and care. I recently attended Thanksgiving with my boyfriends family, and I was able to see how the men in the rest of his family treat the women. 

Something I noticed across the board, from his uncles to his elderly grandfather, was the way they not only cooked, but cleaned after every meal. They also insisted on giving FULL credit to whichever woman was the head of the household, but quietly cleaned, served desserts, and cooked. 

Other GREEN FLAGS to watch out for. 

\-Wanting to contribute to gifts not just for you, but for your family. For example, ""I'd love to help you shop for/pitch in on a gift for your parents, siblings, etc."" this should be unprompted. If they care about you, they care about making a good connection/impression on your family. 

\-Asking about or considering gifts for you - I love gifts. My boyfriend knows this. His gift should reflect your tastes, and in my opinion, should be a significant investment if it is a serious relationship. 

\-Checking in as a couple - the holidays are stressful. If you're meeting his family, does he ignore you and leave you hanging ? Or does he make sure you have time to debrief, check in, and stand by your side throughout? I had to work while visiting his family, and he made sure I had a quiet room to work in, brought me coffee and lunch, and gave me space to decompress. 

\-Are you a priority? This speaks for itself. If a man truly cares for you, he will find a way to make you a part of his life throughout the holidays, and will want to be completely engaged in yours. No matter what stressors come up. 

I hope this helps. I don't want this post to sound like a \~bragging\~ scenario about my man, I am still vetting, especially since we have discussed getting engaged. I just thought this might help as some examples! Have a great, safe, healthy holiday season ladies! &lt;3",154.0

During early vetting on OLD or IRL, a quick way to dismiss any unsuitable candidates is checking for misogyny. Without fail, a man who has a poor opinion of women, in any circumstances, will NOT make a good romantic partner. Often they are bitter, resentful, spiteful, and only ""dating"" women, so they have access to a personal punching bag!

The test? Simple. Compliment a woman. That's it. Mention how smart, brave, strong, capable, funny, sharp, witty a woman is.....then wait. (I would avoid making physical compliments on appearance, as the results may be mixed. Further, I would avoid complimenting a random female stranger IRL, out of respect for our sisters)

If he's a misogynistic pig, he won't miss the opportunity to ""correct"" your observation with either a rebuttal, sarcasm, or plain disbelief.

Example: 

Woman: ""So yesterday I was helping my sister do XYZ, she didn't even need my help. She's so strong!""

Misogynistic Man: ""Really? That's not a big deal."" Or, ""Why'd she ask for your help if she was ""so strong?""

""Normal"" Man: ""Oh that's nice of you. She's lucky to have you."" 

This isn't exhaustive. But my general observation is misogynistic men, while they may feign interest in you since they want to bed you---they won't be as savvy as to be nice to other women though. That's when their mask slips.",804.0

But there was a small pickme part of myself that wondered, why am I not ever harassed? in fact, the more I thought about it, why am I not ever approached, or spoken to at all out in public? I mean, I get it: part of it is 50+ years of living in a female body, 25 being married. I've worked hard my entire life to be left and let alone by male randos out in public. I've cultivated RBF (resting Medusa face?) and give off an aura of ""don't even think of messing with me"". Part of it also is being older, and being overweight, although losing 170 lbs has helped. Less than 100 to go! Another part is dressing super basic, in order to avoid unwanted attention.

And although I obviously don't want to be harassed, it made me go a further step and wonder, is there any good, acceptable, rational, kind approach from a stranger out in public that wouldn't instantly set us as women on edge? I don't know. I'm so far out of the dating game by decades, it's unreal.

The only kind of attention that I can think of is chatting with a man in a group setting (which I may get to do this weekend at an out of town event! Society for Creative Anachronism, haven't been to an event since college, 1989. Had a generation-long case of the ""mundanes"".)

First of all let me say, when I'm in a group setting, I chat and talk with all kinds of people easily, especially since I usually find ways to help. This time, first place I'm heading is the kitchen, which is what I always did at an event. I always get spoken to/greeted, and asked functional/practical questions -- which way is the bathroom, pass me that please, etc. But I've honestly forgotten how to indicate openness to being approached. I mean, it's been a quarter century.

I'm interested to know how you FDS queens feel about being chatted up by a new guy out in the wild. What appeals? What's an instant turn off? Way more of the latter than the former, I'm sure. My personal ideal would be many small conversations over time, or just someone with whom I just fall into chat and it broadens and deepens. That's a real joy, but rare, super rare.

600,t3_r76wl5,"Inspired by the Anne Boleyn post, what other women in history were done dirty by men?","As an amateur history buff, the subject really lights a fire under my ass. I‚Äôll start:

Mary Stuart, queen of Scots got screwed by all the men in her life. After the death of her husband in France, she went to her home country of Scotland to begin her rule. She was met with a Protestant council who hated her as a Catholic, even though she *always* showed absolute tolerance towards their religion. They never wanted her to rule and did everything in their power to take her down. 

She met Darnley, and fell in love with him. After they were married, she saw what a LV loser he was. He was arrogant, reckless, and got in the way of politics, so much so that she had a stamp of his signature made so she could handle legislation without him there. The council persuaded him to act against Mary, his own wife, and he went along with it because he was spineless. He was even present for the murder of her closest friend, David Riccio. 

That was a whole brutal affair, wherein the men brutally stabbed David to death in her presence, *while she was heavily pregnant*. 

When Darnley was later killed and foul play was obvious, the blame was placed on Mary. Her involvement is hotly debated, so I‚Äôll say this: in my opinion, it would have been extremely uncharacteristic of her to have orchestrated it. The pros of the plan succeeding would have been far outweighed by the cons of its failure, and Mary was a smart woman. Keeping Darnley alive and refusing him the crown matrimonial was her best bet. 

I digress. After her husband‚Äôs death, she‚Äôs married against her will to Bothwell, a council member who raped her, besmirching her honor. Their wedding was a Protestant affair, which she never would have had if she had any choice. If I remember correctly, she had even asked one of the servants for a knife to kill herself around this time. 

She was later imprisoned and forced to abdicate the throne by the council. It was there at Loch Leven that she eventually divorced Bothwell, *after she miscarried his child*. The only reason she refused before was to protect the legitimacy of the child she was carrying. It was not a marriage of love as history likes to paint it as. She was an abused hostage of his. 

She fled to England, and in her absence, the council, including her half brother, turned her own son against her. They raised him as a protestant, probably lied to him about her, and his indifference towards his mother is likely the reason she spent the rest of her natural life in prison.

You know what, Jerry? Your ass is getting blocked and deleted, that's where things are going to go.

No man in the history of the universe has told a woman that he has genuine feelings for that he ""just wants to see where things go.""

This phrase is very popular with the LVM who love dangling the carrot of commitment in front of unsuspecting women. He really wants to make women believe that he's not in a rush for anything, and he wants to get to know her on a deeper level before getting into a committed, exclusive relationship.

""Let's see where things go"" is another phrase for ""Let's continue to have casual sex while I explore my other options.""

Men know *very* quickly what their intentions are with the women in their lives. They categorize us into dreamgirl category or the ""Woman I'm going to string along for a few months, fucking her up emotionally while using her like a human fleshlight.""

When a man tells you that he just ""wants to see where things go"" when you've already seen him frequently, don't waste your time anymore.

It's not right that even to this day Ann Boleyn is made out to be seductress and it's not common knowledge that she helped pass legislation that was supposed to help unemployed people. That is defiantly deliberate. 

https://time.com/5739697/anne-boleyn-biography-women-history/

As the second wife of King Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn was one of the most powerful women in the world in the 16th century. In fact, Henry‚Äôs desire to annul his first marriage to Katherine of Aragon so he could pursue Anne is widely credited as a key factor leading to England‚Äôs astounding break with the Roman Catholic Church in 1533. Even so, her peers at the Tudor court didn‚Äôt hold back when it came to their ideas about her. Contemporary descriptions of Boleyn painted her as a seductress, as power-hungry, and even as a witch with six fingers who enchanted the king.

And those descriptions stuck.

For hundreds of years, Anne Boleyn‚Äôs bad reputation has run throughout both conventional historical narratives and popular depictions of this time period. And there‚Äôs been no shortage of them: The story of the woman who had been Henry‚Äôs queen for only three years before he ordered her beheading in 1536, on charges of treason, has retained public interest ‚Äî look no further than the film The Other Boleyn Girl, in which Natalie Portman portrays Boleyn as a scheming temptress, or the television series Wolf Hall, featuring Claire Foy‚Äôs Anne as part of an ambitious and social-climbing family.

But for historian Hayley Nolan, those portrayals of Boleyn raised several unanswered questions.

‚ÄúI wanted to get to the truth of why and how Henry could do that to Anne,‚Äù says Nolan. ‚ÄúThen in researching him, I discovered that everything we‚Äôve been told about Anne is not the truth.‚Äù

Nolan‚Äôs new book, Anne Boleyn: 500 Years of Lies, is part biography and part historical expos√©, challenging the conventional sources often used to explore Boleyn‚Äôs life while highlighting the queen‚Äôs humanitarian, religious and political efforts.

Many popular histories paint Boleyn as setting her sights on Henry in pursuit of power, and the king making the ultimate sacrifice for love in choosing to break with Rome in order to wed her. Much has been made of the love letters Henry VIII wrote to her. Although undated, the surviving letters of their correspondence (only Henry‚Äôs remain; Boleyn‚Äôs have not survived) are thought to span almost three years.

As Nolan‚Äôs account makes clear, however, the king had been making inquiries in secret about divorcing Katherine of Aragon years before Boleyn came on the scene, and Boleyn actually resisted the king‚Äôs advances. She ran away from the royal court for a year starting in the summer of 1526 to escape, and those love letters appear to encompass the time when she was absent from court, distancing herself from his advances. ‚ÄúThe historians who do acknowledge this say it was a calculated tactic and sexual blackmail ‚Äî the ultimate example of ‚Äòwhen a girl says no, she really means yes,‚Äô‚Äù says the historian. ‚ÄúThere are historians who are calling Henry‚Äôs harassment love letters and claim that he sentenced the queen he loved to death. I‚Äôm sorry, but the manner in which a man kills a woman does not prove his love for her. If it can end in decapitation, it was never love.‚Äù

Nolan sees parallels with how some stories about women are told today. Earlier this fall, a New Zealand jury found a 27-year-old man guilty of the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane. His defense rested on the claim that Millane had died accidentally during consensual sex; several media headlines about the case were criticized for disproportionately focusing on Millane‚Äôs sexual history.

‚ÄúEven if people try and say [the Tudor period] was a different time, no it wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù says Nolan. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always trying to discredit the victim when actually we need to be defending the victim ‚Äî that‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt dismiss the romanticization of Anne‚Äôs story. It filters down and has an effect.‚Äù

No part of Boleyn‚Äôs story makes that clearer than the end.

Boleyn was arrested along with five men she was accused of committing adultery with ‚Äî one of whom was her own brother George ‚Äî in May of 1536. She was tried first and found guilty of adultery, incest and high treason, including the charge that she planned to kill the King so she could elope with a lover. But by this time, Henry was already deeply besotted with his own mistress Jane Seymour; he would be betrothed to her the day after Boleyn‚Äôs execution.

Nolan suspects there was more to the story than adultery, a contentious issue about which historians have disagreed for decades. Many historians suspect that the charges against Boleyn were at least exaggerated and at worst wholly fabricated by Thomas Cromwell, an adviser to Henry who was engaged in a power struggle with the Queen; Nolan argues that the Queen‚Äôs lack of privacy and her deeply held religious beliefs would have made it difficult to be unfaithful at all, much less with multiple men.

Two months before her execution, Boleyn was involved in passing nationwide legislation titled the Poor Law, which stated that local officials should find work for the unemployed. The law entailed creating a new governing council that rivaled the one headed up by Cromwell. ‚ÄúSuddenly we have a much more devastating reason as to why Cromwell would be immensely threatened by the Queen,‚Äù says Nolan. ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt a ruthless bully or seductress; she was actually a working politician who died for pushing this radical anti-poverty law through parliament.‚Äù While the law‚Äôs creation has long been attributed to Cromwell, Boleyn‚Äôs involvement was recognized as part of U.K. Parliament Week this November.

The traditional historical interpretation of Anne Boleyn has relied on sources that obscured that part of her story. For example, Nolan says, the Spanish Ambassador Eustace Chapuys is a source of much contemporary writing about her, but he was a supporter of Katherine of Aragon. And even beyond the ambassador, the people who kept the records in the 1500s and the people who interpreted them in the centuries that followed tended to be overwhelmingly male. To Nolan, they brought the perspective that women only achieve power by ‚Äútrickery.‚Äù

And, she argues, correcting Boleyn‚Äôs story has broader implications for the way women‚Äôs stories are told. ‚ÄúWe send out a dangerous message to the world when we tell readers and viewers that women only want power for selfish and frivolous reasons,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhen we tell readers that Anne was killed because she had a string of torrid affairs, it implies that women deserve their downfall.‚Äù

In Women and Power: A Manifesto, classicist Mary Beard traces the roots of misogyny all the way back to the Ancient Greeks, finding the image of the poisonous Medusa transposed onto contemporary female leaders, including Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton. In the U.K., this year several female politicians have announced they will not run in the upcoming December general election, citing increasing abuse in the form of death and rape threats. It was this climate that left Nolan determined to make Boleyn‚Äôs story heard.

‚ÄúHer story is more relevant now than ever before, because she was a politician who was taken down,‚Äù says Nolan. ‚ÄúThis is still happening, and this is why we need to learn what really happened in order to make sure that history never repeats itself ever again.‚Äù",427.0

If that happens, we can expect almost half of all states to immediately ban abortions, which will cascade into access in other states. Our very foundation of reproductive justice IS likely going to end soon. The only thing left is to protect your womb. 

Birth control is never 100%, and while my hope is that none of you are having sex with scrotes, this changes things. It makes sexual vetting so much more important. 

For those dating, the choice to terminate may be stripped away from you. The decisions you make today about whether to give that supposed HVM sexual access could result in a no choice baby in 9 months. Remember this. 

For those in relationships, is a baby in the plan? What happens if your baby has severe disabilities - those that often don‚Äôt get detected until after 15 weeks? Even a HVM will turn heel and drop you if something like that happened. Talk about it with your partners - vet the reaction. Remember this. 

For all of you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry. We tried. I tried. Older millennials like myself have watched this coming for years. We‚Äôve voted. We protested. It didn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm so sorry that we couldn‚Äôt stop this. I‚Äôm weeping writing this; I know it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù yet but let‚Äôs be realistic here - the tide has changed. Remember this.

625,t3_r65y1f,"Found a page online where the author listed several red flags to look for, while dating and in a relationship. It would be beneficial to us, so I'm going to list them down. Once again, credit's not mine.","The author lists three kinds of intertwined behaviours.

1) Abusive Behavior - Includes actions that engender fear and intimidation, or undermine the other person's self-determination. Many controlling behaviors may also be abusive within the context of physical or psychological abuse. 


2) Controlling Behavior - Includes abusive behaviors but also actions that are undermining of the other person's self-determination or self-esteem. This includes unilateral complaints, controlling the agenda, freedom from accountability to the other person (e.g., coming and going as one pleases).


3) Insensitive and/or Alienating Behavior - Includes all abusive and controlling behaviors listed below, but also actions that are 
self-centered, inconsiderate, selfish, and isolating or withdrawing.



GLARING RED FLAGS


1) Quick involvement. A large number of abused women dated or knew their abuser for less than six months before they were engaged, married, or living together. He comes in like a tornado, claiming, ""You're the only one who understands"", or ""the only one I can talk to"", ""the only one I've loved this much"". He will pressure the woman to commit to the relationship in such a way that the woman may feel guilty or that she's ‚Äòletting him down‚Äô if she wants to slow down the involvement or break off the relationship.



2) Obsessed with their ex. Always makes the ex, the topic of the conversations. Claims to be friends with the ex and talk to them excessively.



3) You dont feel like you can be fully yourself. As a relationship progresses, you should feel more comfortable with your partner and share more of yourself. It's a red flag if you either dont feel increasingly safe to share your experiences, interests, thoughts, and feelings or you feel judged or criticized when you do and begin to hide or suffocate parts of yourself that your partner disapproves of.



4) Increased symptoms of mental or physical health problems. Your body, mind, and spirit are all interconnected, which is why symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety show up in our bodies as well as in our thoughts and feelings. Be sure to notice new or worsening health problems, increasing feelings of anger, resentment, fear, and stress and consider whether they may be related to your relationship.



5) Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. He keeps you confused by sudden changes in his mood. You may believe he has some sort of mental problem because one minute he's loving, and the next he's exploding. Explosiveness and moodiness are typical of men who beat their partners.



6) Hypersensitivity. He is easily insulted, claiming his feelings are ""hurt', when in actuality he is angry or taking the slightest setback as a personal attack. He will ""rant and rave"" about the injustice of things that have happened, things that are just a part of living (for example, being asked to work late, getting a traffic ticket, or being told about annoying behavior).



7) You have to justify their bad behaviour. If your partner is rude to your friends, you shouldn't have to tell them, ""Oh, they're rude if they don't know you, but they're nice, once you get to know them.""



8) A tendency to run away from difficult discussions. If your partner lacks the emotional or behavioral skills needed to cope with problems and runs away from them instead, this can have a negative effect on your relationship.



9) Playful use of force in sex. He may enjoy throwing you down or holding you down during sex. He may want to act out fantasies during sex where you're helpless. He is letting you know that the idea of rape is exciting. He may show little concern about whether you want to have sex and uses sulking or anger to manipulate you into compliance. He may begin having sex with you while you're sleeping or demand sex when you're ill or tired.",452.0

We know not to meet people from the sub, because the depravity of bitter men knows no bounds. We know not to message them back, if we have messages turned on at all. We know to change details in our storys to keep things unidentifiable. We know not to share personal information or anything even remotely identifiable.

636,t3_r5smy6,My Level Up Journey: You have to make space for blessings.,"Today, I wanted to share my story with those of you who are currently going through heartbreak and other hardships. 

Remember: once you break away from the LV people in your life, you will set a start to a healthy lifestyle. It will only get better from there, albeit it does not guarantee that the transition will be free of its own challenges. 

Earlier this year, I was experiencing:

‚Ä¢ An acute episode of severe, disordered eating that was triggered by a breakup. Due to nausea and my body‚Äôs response to stress, I could not manage a sip of a soup. 

‚Ä¢ A severe weight loss. It affected my immune and reproductive system, as well as my skin and hair health. I looked sickly, was extremely weak. At some point, I could hardly make the walk from my bed to my closet. I was out of breath. 

‚Ä¢ I had to relocate to another country for employment (search) as a fresh college graduate. The search was stressful: thousands of applications, interviews, rejections. I was desperate for medical coverage, as my health continued to decline. 

‚Ä¢ Upon relocation, I had to undergo more trauma. I found out about my ex‚Äôs continuous cheating. I added all the odd pieces together: my ex was also plating my former ‚Äúfriend‚Äù ‚Äî he used me to make her jealous, and she played along &amp; vice versa. 

‚Ä¢ As I studied and worked on improving my mental health, I realized that my ex was mentally, verbally, and emotionally abusing me (for that, I thank the book called ‚ÄúThe Verbally Abusive Relationship‚Äù by Patricia Evans). He tried to crush my self-esteem, my sense of self. 

All of the aforementioned happened in a span of a couple of months. It has now been almost half a year since my breakup. 

**With tremendous support of this wonderful community, my family, and loyal friends, I am doing much better:**

‚Ä¢ I secured a high-earning position in a competitive field. It is in-line with my studies, career goals, and more. 

‚Ä¢ I am working for one of the most successful companies in the technology industry, nation-wide and globally. 

‚Ä¢ The graduate studies that I will pursue in the next two years will be financed by my employer. They will advance my expertise and increase my earning potential. 

‚Ä¢ I have great medical coverage. Now, I can afford to improve my health. I will be working with a good nutritionist, physical therapist, and other medical professionals to ensure that I am feeling strong and well. 

‚Ä¢ I will soon be relocating to a very nice, safe city in my state. It is beautiful, relatively affordable, and safe. It is home to one of the top-ranking technology schools in the country. 

‚Ä¢ I now have the finances necessary to afford a stress-free lifestyle and other hobbies. I will continue to invest in stock, retirement plan, and save money for down payment on a house. I will help my family financially, if need arises. 

‚Ä¢ I am investing in new skincare, hair care, wardrobe, and jewelry. I plant to soft and hardmaxx in the future. 

Slowly, but surely, I am making progress towards a better, brighter future. My NVX is enjoying his leftovers ‚Äî the product of his abusive, assaultive, and depraved actions. His failed career. Addictions. Dysfunction. 

I sleep peacefully knowing that all of the people in my former friend group are rotten, low-value people. Life will likely never get better for them, given that they will never be satisfied with what they have. 

Leaving that relationship, as hard as it was, enabled my continuous growth. Never again will I hesitate to enforce my boundaries, leave, or demand more.

I will get back into dating once I am healthy and feel ready. However, for now? My career and family take precedence. 

My lesson should be of guidance to you.

The hair towel story on AITA was truly ridiculous in SO many ways -  I won't unpack all parts here because it was already discussed on the previous post -

HOWEVER, one of the first things that struck me about it (apart from the fact that a grown man was jealous of a towel) and something that reminded me of my own time with a complete scrote was as follows:

* the guy's COMPLETE and unwavering belief in an opinion he totally made up himself, out of no experience or knowledge of hair:

(*""it's a bit weird because I don't know anyone else who has a towel just for hair"")*  


&amp;#x200B;

* despite his girlfriend's obvious (or at least, implied) knowledge of the subject:  
 *(it's a special towel, it's an only-for-hair towel, she can't use a regular towel,* he must know she, at MINIMUM, believes in this opinion and feels as though she knows SOMETHING about hair care because *she gets mad about him rubbing his gross body on her hair towel)*

So this guy puts in so much effort to go completely out of his way to not only disregard her apparent knowledge, in place of his complete lack of knowledge - i.e. he ""doesn't know anyone with a hair towel"" . to the point where he's actually acting on his own lack of knowledge.   


It reminded me of SO many examples when I was with my ex whereby he was absolutely adamant that even with NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT, he was still, definitely, more of an expert on whatever subject, than the woman in front of him. I'd share a few of mine to kick us off, but please share!   


my ex boyfriend:

&amp;#x200B;

1. thought you had to pay the bill for the mini bar in a hotel room via the cleaning ladies, because ""they come to the room anyway"". I told him, no, you pay up at the end with the concierge, why would cleaning ladies have tonnes of cash on their person/trolley to do this with? it would be a huge security risk? I explained that even if they leave a receipt (which they had), it's just to show you what you're expected to pay, and to give you an idea of the bill you're amassing. He vehemently denied this after saying even though he'd *never paid a hotel mini bar tab before hand,* what he was saying was ""obvious!"". I told him that regardless of what he thought made sense, that was not my experience in a number of hotel rooms. He argued with me continually, and then to prove a point, he left 20 euros next to the mini bar receipt and we went out for the day.  
He clearly didn't think of it again, but low and behold, he went bright red in the face and started kicking off, five days later upon checkout, when the man at the desk presented him with the hotel mini bar bill and asked him to settle up. Ex boyfriend nearly exploded in a rage when the concierge explained that the cleaning ladies had thought his cleaning tips were incredibly generous :D   




2. Not long after buying our house together, we were going to order fish and chips as a treat. My ex boyfriend had never lived alone before and as such had certainly never organised his own mealtimes - even if he had fish and chips he was probably served it by his creepy-ass mother, and I doubt he ever went and got it. I explained that actually, now I'd realised the day and time, we wouldn't be able to get fish and chips because most chip shops in the UK don't open on a Sunday night. He scoffed and said  how could I *possibly know that?* I told him, I'm not sure WHY it's a thing, but it is, and that,  although I have occasionally seen a chip shop open past 10pm on a Sunday night whilst travelling, none of the local chip shops to us were open on a Sunday past 10pm. He snorted so hard that is tiny brain nearly fell out of his nose, and he near as damnit bundled me in to the car to prove me wrong..... one hour driving and a mcdonalds later, he knew I was right and was so angry about it, that we went to sleep in silence.

640,t3_r5qcgk,Hot Take: Why I demand a beautiful proposal and an EXPENSIVE ring.,"I don't give two shits if this post offends you. I don't care if you think I'm a golddigger, or ridiculous for demanding what every woman deserves. 

I refuse to accept anything less than an expensive conflict free diamond ring. Those are my standards; I don't care about yours.

I refuse to accept any less because of the following:

\- If a ring is a piece of jewellery I'll be wearing for the rest of my life, a minimum 10k investment isn't insane in the grand scheme of things.

\- If a man is expecting me to carry his child and go through the painful process of pregnancy, the least he can do is show me how much he truly values me.

\- If a man is expecting me to do emotional labor for him and spend the rest of my life with him being his support system, a beautiful ring is a small ask.

\- Men know that diamond rings are also a way to posture to other men on the fact they can take care of their partners by providing an expensive ring. When he sees other men looking at my ring, he wants the other men to know that I'm well taken care of and that he truly loves me. 

\- If a man can afford a gaming system, expensive trips, and nights out ""with the boys"", he can afford a piece of jewellery that I would wear for the rest of my life.

\- A ring has little resale value, I know that. But if things were to go south, having a piece of jewellery that I would be able to sell for some money would be useful, especially if I was the mother of his children.

I refuse to accept a moissanite without prior consultation from my partner first. Yes, I know that moissanites are quite beautiful and are the fraction of the cost of a real diamond but getting me a moissanite and then explicitly telling me that it's in fact, a real diamond, is laughable.

I see lots of women posturing to other women about their fake wealth and their ""3 carat"" diamonds, when in fact, its a moissanite. A lot of these women truly believe that their partner got them a diamond, because that's what he told them it was. Not only did their partners lie to them, but they're making their future wives look like laughing stocks in front of other women with false knowledge of what the stone truly is, its value, and a poor attempt at appearing wealthy. Some other subreddits are filled with women like this. Their proposal was based on a lie. 

With this ring, I expect a beautiful proposal. Something thoughtful and meaningful and was prepared for months. Asking someone to marry you is a massive deal, so if a man puts little thought into this and doesn't really care about what the woman answers with, then he is truly LV.

I also know that lots of LV men will propose with expensive, over the top rings in order to trap you and keep you in the cycle of narcissistic abuse. This post applies to the man I decide to be with forever who I've vetted ruthlessly for a long period of time.

I know I'll get a lot of flack from broke af scrotes in the comments and pickme's who think the bare minimum ($100 ring) from Walmart is enough. IDGAF if your LV partner proposed to you with a $100 ring from Walmart. Personally, I want to be with someone who truly values me and values the relationship. Remember that we always value the things we pay for/buy. I'm not down for struggle love.

641,t3_r5p8l1,Normalize spending energy on loving yourself.,"You know these acts of love we all do for someone we love, only to be brushed aside and told them that it's wrong, or too little, or just used for sex before left to get ourselves off?

How about, instead of catering to someone who treat us in a way we would never treat them, we skip this and go straight to caring for ourselves.

You like home cooked meals? Great, invest in a cooking class or 2, get some tools and start having fun for yourself first and foremost. Use the classes to socialize outside of the norm and learn fun reciand tips.

You like to hear words of encouragement? Grab your friends and go out have fun, share your accomplishments, and every day, write yourself a good thing you did today.

I‚Äôve had some pretty horrible dates in the past. In my pickme days I picked a guy I met online from the airport just for a horrible coffee date that I payed half of. He wasn‚Äôt even there for me, he was visiting his brother. He also looked nothing like his pictures which I suspect were heavily photoshopped. After dropping him off I texted him that I wasn‚Äôt interested. He proceeded to whine and complained that my waist wasn‚Äôt small enough anyway and I should have cleared the front seat for him before he got on. Prick...

After: 

I met someone online who actually fit my criteria. I vetted. I listened for green and red flags. And we had a pleasant FaceTime where his home looked clean and and put together. He planned the day. He reserved a corner table at an Italian restaurant. He remembered that I love Italian AND corner tables. He opened the first door and then rushed to the second to open it as well. He got me flowers and perfume. He made sure I felt comfortable and asked if I was okay with the place and that he had a backup in case I didn‚Äôt. I liked so many things on the menu and he urged me to order everything I wanted to taste. My virgin mojito was so good and he ordered me another one without prompting. He excused himself and payed so the check didn‚Äôt even make it‚Äôs was to our table. I was wearing heels and he offered his arm for me to hold on to. He walked at my pace. When we got to my car he didn‚Äôt peer inside or give my car the once over (something I hate and consider rude). 

This was an amazing date for me, the best I‚Äôve had. I have to admit though that out of thousands of profiles he is the only one that passed the vetting to the point of scoring a date with me. I‚Äôm hopeful but still vetting.",575.0

he basically forms shallow relationships with women, nothing beyond sex. All casual sex and honestly he gets turned down by women a lot too. 

So I finally asked him, why do you do this? Why do you form exclusively sexual relationships and you do not seem to pursue a deeper connection?

His answer shocked me. He said that he is looking for a deeper connection but none of the women that sleep with him align with his moral expectations of a woman. 

He expects a woman to not sleep with him so easily, to not smoke (like he does) and to basically uphold a very conservative image of a wife when he does not even fit BOYFRIEND criteria much less a husband. 

So I pointed out the hypocrisy to him, and he said that he wants a woman to ‚Äúsave‚Äù him from his degenerate ways. He is fully aware his behaviour is problematic. He is fully aware he does not live out his own moral expectations. He smokes, drinks, steals, lies. It makes sense why he turned down by women a lot. 

I am writing this not just to generally shit on LVMs but I do want to highlight something here. Many pickmes, or even women who have codependency issues want to save a broken, problematic man. And LVMs like these DELIBERATELY look for women like these to save them. They choose to continue with their toxic ways until someone can do the emotional labour of reparenting them. I am sure you have seen it. A high value woman with a good career dragging along a dead weight LVM who can‚Äôt stop drinking, smoking weed etc. So if you have a pattern of dating men like this, PLEASE KNOW it‚Äôs not cuz you ‚Äúattract this energy‚Äù. This is absolute horseshit. Men like these deliberately seek women who they identify as those who would want to ‚Äúsave‚Äù and ‚Äúfix‚Äù broken men.  stay away.  

It was only after that conversation with this LVM did I realise not only was he aware he had a double standard for himself and his partner, he is wants to benefit from her ‚Äúmore moral‚Äù lifestyle and expects a woman to clean up his mess, the mess being his chosen lifestyle. This is in line with the whole patriarchal messaging of ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù and the unhealthy expectation that women are on this high moral pedestal, expected to save men from themselves.",440.0

Recently a man (we have been acqunatices for 2.5 years) told me the location of the date (on the same day as the date! He claimed it was a ""suprise"") and I asked him, ""Are you picking me up or are we meeting there?"" He replied, ""I'm going to go new-school and say I'll meet you there.""

I was considering just cancelling altogether since he had already postponed the date by a day and was not working that day so I didn't see why he couldn't have time to fetch me, the only thing was I was unsure if he had a car or would be taking an Uber since he is moving back here from another city and doesn't have his car with him yet. However it turns out he drove his parents car (note: he owns his own car but it is temporarily in another city) so as far as I can tell the only reason he didn't pick me up was laziness. The only other ""excuse"" would be that he wanted the beach picnic to be a suprise since I arrived with it all already set up, but I would have much preferred to have been fetched and it would not have taken him long to set it up. How would you ladies have handled the situation? Do you cancel? Do you tell him he must pick you up? If he does not offer I usually prefer to ask in order to test him.

There is also more context to this date story and why he postponed it but it's not very relevant to whether or not he fetched me. He made a nice beach picnic, did not try to touch me and gave me a bunch of expensive roses but I still can't look past him not picking me up, especially since it was a bit of a drive and I was tired after work and he hadn't worked that day.

Aisha is 22, beautiful, smart, stylish, kind, and a modestly successful actress. Unfortunately, she also has strong pickme tendencies when it comes to men. 

Up until recently, she was engaged to a her first real boyfriend, a total NVM who, when they were younger, got issued a restraining order protecting her from him by the police (because he essentially punched a wall during an argument, in public). I was very happy for her when she broke it off, but I recently found out the only reason why she broke that engagement was to pursue another LVM. 

This one is a player with a girlfriend. He flirted with Aisha when she was engaged, and turned her head with the usual cliches (‚Äúmy girlfriend doesn‚Äôt understand me,
not like you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving her anyway, the relationship is basically over,‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre destined to be together,‚Äù etc etc ad nauseam) They made a plan: they would both leave their SOs and be with each other‚Äîonly he promptly reconciled with his girlfriend as soon as she broke her engagement off.

Aisha and I are friendly but not close, and I have no idea how to communicate my utter horror and disappointment at this development without overstepping the bounds of our relationship.

Because once you stop being friends and become romantic partners, everything resets to zero. Those things that made him a great friend DO NOT NECESSARILY transfer over to you now that you are in a relationship. 

I made this mistake in my 2nd marriage. We were friends as much as a man and woman can be without any ulterior motives (I generally dont think men and women can really be friends).  We were also professional colleagues and I had a lot of respect for him as a colleague. 

I get divorced and we get together. I unconsciously ASSUMED (clowned myself) that those traits that made him  good friend and excellent colleague (trustworthiness, diligence, etc) would also be present in our marriage. Ergo, I did very little vetting because i had already ""known"" him for 4 years. 

Turns out he had gambling addiction, and even worse, a closet drinking problem that he went to the ends of the earth to hide until it got so bad it spilled out of the closet when he damn near overdosed. He was able to put down the gambling fairly easily but his response to my anger about the gambling was that he was gambling with ""his money"" (we did not combine finances) and he paid his agreed upon share of stuff. Of course, it didn't occur to him that he could take the money he blew on gambling to make OUR lives better. Instant low value shit there. Should have left him at that moment.

664,t3_r4zolv,Anyone Else Tired Of Sexism In The Gym/Fitness Culture?,"I've been dancing since I was little (ballet and some hip-hop). I also got into lifting weights and going to the gym a few years ago. Although there's definitely a lot of sexism in the ballet world too, the amount of oversexualisation and whatnot in the ""gym environment"" and on fitness Instagrams annoys me. It's so different to what I experience in the dance world (my classes are admittedly mostly only girls and one gay man) that I'm tempted to just give up going to the gym, or else pay more for (and commute to) one of the few womens' only gyms around.

The amount of leering (to the point I have to stop exercising sometimes and stare back - downright dangerous if I'm handling heavy weights), ""what's your name?"", gaslighting when confronted, and harassment (even by PTs - I have already have to make a complaint after joining the gym after just a few months) in the gym is disgusting. I've read numerous articles detailing how this is a problem for most girls in the gym. Unless I change to a womens' only gym, I am almost undoubtedly going to experience this wherever I go. Even when I was in the gym of our apartment block as a kid, a disgusting old creep called me a ""tart"" (I was too young to know what it meant but my mom was FURIOUS).

I'm also tired of the constant narrative that ""girls should lift,"" not because there aren't some benefits to women lifting weights (there obviously are) but the REASONS usually given why girls should lift. It's always posed as for the benefit of men - ""Do squats! Get thick legs! Get a booty! Men think girls who lift are cool!"" Additionally, I follow a lot of female ""fitness influencers"" on Instagram (lots of who DO actually post good advice), but more of more of them are posing like soft porn models to the point it's a massive turnoff even for me, who loves fitness. I'm always encouraged to ""lift very heavy"" by even female personal trainers I know (tl;dr - it can hurt my dance if I bulk up too much), and, when I question them as to why, it always comes down to the same thing: ""Men like girls who lift. Don't you want to build a booty and curves? Why not?"" (Because I dance ballet, I am very slim - by my choice). It's like the whole ""Men like strong mommy bangmaids who go 50/50 and never ask anything of them"" nonsense. Ironically, one of the more ""feminist"" and less sexualised Instagram fitness accounts I follow is by a Victoria's Secret model.

However, I am going to post the steps of the DENNIS system here, just to reiterate them because that is basically the whole point of my post!

There's a whole lot of talk how only religious ""puritans"" and ""fundies"" are against porn. And because those type of groups also condemn masturbation, pre-marital sex etc. as sinful activities, it means you must be against masturbating too if you are anti-porn.

I often interact with teenage girls and so many times it has come up where I desperately want to send them a copy of the Handbook. I hesitate because I can't be sure if it is age appropriate... especially for girls as young as 12 or 13.

If we truly want to create change for the next generation of woman, helping them in their formative years **needs** to happen.

It is imperative that we develop an FDS Handbook that is made specifically for young girls. Something that addresses the current culture around sex. Something that will train them how to deal with situations they will experience in middle school and high school in today's modern world.

This is how we shift the next generation of women, guide them to prevent experiencing sexual trauma early on, and safeguard them from the sex posy liberal feminist bullshit that's been so prominent in the last 10 years.

**Let start a discourse on this concept.**

* What lessons would you share specifically with young girls?
* What have you learned in boundaries, dating, confidence, self-esteem, etc.
* Share stories from your youth, first time sexual experiences, what went well, what went wrong, etc.

684,t3_r3zk8g,Look whose reaction he wants,"I was at a wedding with my boyfriend on Friday where I was his plus one so while I‚Äôd met the groom once, I knew nobody else. On our table were three men my boyfriend knows plus their wives. It‚Äôs one of the couples I want to talk about. Let‚Äôs call them Chad and Sarah.

After the first dance we all joined them on the dance floor. Afterwards we all returned to our table. My boyfriend kissed my cheek and went to get us a drink. Chad immediately tells me he thought his best move was how quickly he managed to get off the dance floor.

Every time my boyfriend left my side it was always brief and when he got back he‚Äôd check on me (if I was mid conversation, he‚Äôd just put a hand on my lower back rather than interrupt). Chad wandered off a few times and when he returned, would insert himself into the prime position in the group and not acknowledge Sarah. As the evening wore on I gave up trying to talk to Sarah, she was deep in a pick me dance of trying to keep Chad‚Äôs attention.

Clearly Chad identified me and another man as being the ones whose reaction he cared about. On the surface he was fairly charming so I guess this tactic often makes people feel important but after finding FDS in lockdown it was so bizarre to experience. Obviously I didn‚Äôt like them (one of the few things Sarah did say to me was a comparison between my boyfriend and her husband which made out Chad was the better catch) but it really made me think about couples in group settings. So often the men want to charm and amuse the other men or women they decide are HV. 

Just by looking at whose reaction they want is so telling. Pre-FDS I‚Äôd have found Chad a bit obnoxious but wouldn‚Äôt have called him LV as he did dance with his wife, didn‚Äôt actually flirt with any other women etc. But the wedding was an opportunity for him to boost his ego by getting attention. He doesn‚Äôt like my boyfriend as he‚Äôs very funny (but never at anyone‚Äôs expense) so sees him as the competition. He was clearly annoyed when my boyfriend missed a joke because he‚Äôd turned to tell me something or was checking whether my drink needed a refill. It was nice to see that the other couples followed more of the pattern of checking back with each other and once when Chad did say something actually funny I caught one man turn to check his wife‚Äôs reaction and smiled to see her laughing.

They will see that they were able to get you, and think they can upgrade. They won‚Äôt treat you better because you‚Äôre a higher quality woman. I decided to date down earlier this year (I make twice his salary, graduated from a top school and have a very stable family and home life with a great group of friends).

Yes, they might be higher than those of an average woman, unequipped with FDS knowledge.

The rest, however? Lacks depth. Lacks a touch of something that would suit your personality, interests, tastes. He does *just enough* of what he knows you would want, but not more. 

**Something that is small enough to be thoughtful, but not big enough to be of inconvenience/sacrifice to him.**

For instance: 

**Context**: You have been X for almost a year now. You have been to each other‚Äôs places. He does not show any red flags. So far, his treatment is good and satisfactory. You keep vetting. Let‚Äôs say the following happens:

‚Ä¢ **Bare minimum**: He orders you a door-dash delivery of your favorite, seasonal coffee drink when you tell him that you are sick, bed-ridden, and feverish. He calls you later that night to check-in. In the morning, he texts again to ask how you are feeling. 

‚Ä¢ **Bare minimum + more**: He orders you a door-dash delivery of your favorite, seasonal coffee drink to the door when you tell him that you are sick, bed-ridden, and feverish. He takes an hour and a half off of work to come as soon as he can. Once you open the door, he comes in with groceries to make you your favorite, hearty soup that will last you a couple of days. He ensures to clean the kitchen, help tidy up your room ‚Äî so that you feel better. Once he ensures that you are well and have everything you need, he proceeds to leave. He calls you later that night to check-in. He assures you that, if you need him again, no matter the time, he will be at your place to take care of you. In the morning, he stops by before work to see how you are feeling. 

In the first example, a man simply does more than nothing. Yet, being thoughtful and attentive is bare minimum ‚Äî he did just that, no more. It is almost as if he is going through the motions of earning you.

In the second example, a man makes a sacrifice (taking time off work, spending time to care for you). He goes above and beyond to be there for you. 

If the vibe that you are getting from him is similar to the first example, do not rush into dropping all the other suitors. Re-consider. Your version of bare minimum is still bare minimum. Would that be enough for long?

689,t3_r3o54k,"Situational awareness, defensive communication skills and domestic self-defence.","This is the only time I will advocate for communication! I am not a self defence expert, but I do have some experience in successfully handling unsavoury situations.

I am concerned at discussions relating to self defence weapons/tools.

Never pull out a weapon that you aren't 10000% confident in using. There is a huge risk of injury to yourself. Men are stronger than women and you may be easily overpowered.

Not only that, but many people do not have the mental capacity to harm another person. It's extremely likely that by the time you pull the weapon, you will freeze. The other person may not.

There is also a huge risk of law enforcement action against you. You must understand proportionate action: if a man yells in your face and you pull out a gun and shoot him in the face, that is a disproportionate response. If a man tries to grab your bag and run away and you pull out a knife and slash him as he runs away, that is a disproportionate response. You will probably be prosecuted.

If you must carry a weapon, please ensure you practice, practice, practice! Know how to handle that particular weapon. Understand what grip is effective. Have an idea what it will feel like to use against a human. Figure out if the weapon has weaknesses, or is flimsy, or can bounce back and hit you. Always remember the goal is to defend and go! Never keep attacking!

Not many people will go to these lengths to understand how to inflict damage onto another person and escape. Most people will buy the self defence tool with very little practice and move through the world with misplaced confidence.

We all know there are genuine stranger-danger risks. However the risk of attack is much greater in established relationships with partners, family members, colleagues, neighbours. Realistically, are you going to pull out your self defence tool against these people in a domestic setting? Probably not. This is what inspired me to write this post.


SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

Women have very good situational awareness. If you haven't already read ""The Gift of Fear"", please do so. The FDS Handbook is particularly helpful for situational awareness in relationship scenarios. Trust your instincts.

Cooper's Colour Code of Awareness:

This is a helpful chart to understand appropriate levels of situational awareness.

WHITE - You are completely relaxed and unprepared.

YELLOW - You are relaxed but alert.

ORANGE - You have identified a potential threat.

RED - You have identified an actual threat.

At levels YELLOW, ORANGE and RED, you will be able to use your instinctive fight or flight to your advantage. This is because you are prepared.

At level WHITE, there is a possibility of your instinctive freeze response preventing you from taking appropriate action. This is a risk to your safety.

Ideally, we mostly want to be in YELLOW. Chances are you are at YELLOW when out in public. You may be at level ORANGE when alone in public at night. Realistically when you are at home, you will be at level WHITE. This is important to think about in domestic situations, particularly in relationships. When you are at level WHITE and something happens, you are less likely to be prepared for an assertive response.

Practice, practice, practice! Try to think about what level you are at as you go about your daily life. Become confident with it. 


COMMUNICATION SKILLS

The words you choose to say have very little impact. The most impactful communication means the tone you use, the volume of your voice, how long you talk for, your facial expressions and your body language.

Confidence and assertiveness is key here.

Let's think about a scenario where you may have moved to level ORANGE - you've identified a potential threat.

You want to be calm, confident and assertive, never aggressive. Hold yourself with confidence. Don't walk too quickly or too slowly and move with purpose and focus. Speak clearly, loudly and calmly. You want to make yourself less of a target and knock a bit of common sense into the other person who may be a threat.


CRISIS CALLS

Let's say the scenario moves to level RED - an actual threat. A person approaches you aggressively.

Practice, practice, practice this!! 
Short, sharp and loud commands:

""NO!!""

""GET BACK!!""

""STAY AWAY!""

""FUCK OFF!!""

""DON'T TOUCH ME!""


I have to emphasise SHORT, SHARP and LOUD commands. You need to SCREECH these commands. This is to startle your attacker either to their senses, or to give you enough time to escape. This will also alert passerby's that someone needs help.

Facial expressions: Screech the crisis calls with the purest anger on your face. I'm talking the meanest, fiercest, most lionness face you can pull! Be a scary mofo!

Men are more used to women being passive. This technique is likely to startle a man because he may not expect it.


DOMESTIC SELF DEFENCE 

As I said earlier, there are genuine and real risks of stranger danger attacks and self defence tactics commonly focus on those scenarios. Statistically, you are more likely to require self defence tactics in domestic scenarios and unfortunately self defence classes rarely, if ever, focus on these situations.

At home you are likely to be at level WHITE. This makes it hard to defend yourself if someone suddenly does something. I can give an example which I'm sure you can all relate to: I was sitting at home with my boyfriend at the time. I started to fall asleep (awareness level WHITE) when he roughly shook me awake and shouted at me for falling asleep in his presence. Suddenly I was level RED - I was confused, disorientated, frozen - and I APOLOGISED.

These situations are harder to defend due to the insidious way it can creep up, so alway be on your guard. FDS vetting strategies are your friend here.

What may be helpful is having an idea how you can quickly move from different levels of awareness.

The best form of self defence in these circumstances are boundaries, assertiveness and confidence. In short: communication skills. Follow FDS. Know yourself, your boundaries, your values and never lose sight.

I was wondering if other people had experienced this, and what tips you may have on coping/getting past it.

I am used to men ogling at me in public, and it gets particularly disturbing when said men are with their gfs/wives. I actively ignore them and turn away from them but they will keep ogling.

The worst is when the woman blames ME and takes it out on me as if I somehow did something to come onto her low value man, when all I did was simply exist in a public space (and I don't want their man and do not ever make contact with him). Or, they'll do some weird shit in front of me to get my attention.

There's been three instances just this past couple of weeks alone of couples (usually the woman initiates it) talking about me (right in front of me) - whether to comment in a backhanded way on my outfit (I like to dress up), or snidely commenting on me taking a picture, or me simply daring to sit down before the theater show in an assigned seat next to them. And they know very well I can hear them...like they can't even wait to get home to ""gossip"" about me, which I find SO weird. 

I think also because I am often alone, I become a vulnerable target to pick on for these disgusting insecure couples to take out whatever misery/insecurity/projection they have onto me even though all I do is mind my own business and never say anything to strangers. The women are often PickMe and retaliate because of some perceived competition which doesn't even exist because I have shown no interest whatsoever in their man, and the  men are clearly LVM, regardless of whether they're handsome or well put together because their behavior at ogling other women communicates that (although sometimes they haven't even looked at me yet and the woman anticipates that they will, so they engage in some weird behavior and stare at me like a hawk right before they do - which all it does is call attention to me).

Ignoring them is what I do, but I am getting increasingly irritated at this type of behavior. I did not do anything to these people yet they will target me, and I am sure I am not alone in this, since I've seen comments before noting similar behaviors from couples toward single women on this subreddit.

696,t3_r3bv2b,My husband told me to choose between him and my business,"I've been with my husband for 7 years, married for 2. When we met, I was 19 and working in a restaurant. I always dreamt of owning my own business. I started a catering company a few years ago as a side hustle, and when covid hit, I turned it into a delivery service. The delivery service took off, and last week I signed the lease on my own space. It was a huge accomplishment for me.

My husband had slowly stopped supporting my business, saying I wasn't home enough and asking why I had to want so many things, why I couldn't just be happy with existing at home with him. He couldn't understand my drive. He claimed I was ""obsessed with money"" every time I celebrated new growth in the business. The day I signed the lease, I called him to come see my new place and he said no.

For reference, he has very wealthy parents that pay him to take care of all their needs- yard work, grocery shopping, driving them places. They pay him $30/hr and he works about 10 hours/week, just enough to make his half of the bills, plus beer, cigarettes and occasionally going out for breakfast with me or his brother. He always asked why I couldn't get a job ""like his"" so that we could spend more time together. Up until signing the lease, I was working about 35 hours /week.

Now that I have the new space, I'm working hard to get the place ready for opening while still running my delivery service. It's a lot of work, but it's what I've been preparing for. He's grown more and more resentful of my business over time, and today he finally snapped and told me to choose between him and my business. 

It was 8am and I was having a cup of green tea and working on some paperwork when he got up and started slamming doors. He saw me working and yelled ""oh you're WORKING? Doing your FAVORITE THING? Are you having SO MUCH FUN?"" This time I chose to ignore him. He went on to rudely explain to me that he worked the bare minimum just so he could be home with me, and couldn't understand why I couldn't do the same for him.

Usually this is the part where I get apologetic and tell him that I'm just trying to build a future, and I know he sacrifices for us, but today the fog cleared and I just stared at him. He told me that I needed to choose between him and my business. I put down my green tea and told him I was done.

698,t3_r3iz30,Men who want to be there for you won't let excuses stop them.,"Hey ladies.

I just wanted to give you your daily reminder that if they wanted to, they would.

I've (23)been seeing my boyfriend(28) for roughly six months, so I acknowledge that the ""good behavior"" stage is still present, but I'm generally comfortable in the notion that he would do just about anything for me. The list of evidence is not short, but I don't need to get into that right now. 

He's been out of town with family and I've been experiencing a UTI for the last few days, but had mostly kept the symptoms at bay until I could get antibiotics. This morning, however, I woke up in some of the worst pain that I have ever felt, and all I could do is wait it out. I spent about 2 hours curled up on my bathroom floor before I felt well enough to go get my phone. I texted him and mentioned how my morning had gone, and he immediately put in a doordash order for cranberry juice and other necessities to be sent to my home. 

Maybe this seems like a small thing, but to me it speaks volumes. He didn't need to do that. I never asked him to do that. But he saw that I was alone and struggling and used the tools available to him to do what he could to make my day better. He never holds these little things over my head, never asks for anything in return. He's just got my back, like I've got his. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that men who really want to won't let excuses stop them, they will find a way around them.

Edit: I have been replying but my comments do not automatically post because I haven't had my account long enough to get a flair. Thanks for all of the input everyone!

Edit 2: I have sought medical treatment, for whatever that is worth! I've got antibiotics to pick up tomorrow. The rest of the delivery was just random snacks that I like. I definitely won't wait around for cranberry juice to get rid of it",458.0

701,t3_r3csu9,Think twice before you get into a long distance relationship,"It's one thing to end up in a long distance relationship because your spouse had to move away for some time or you live in the middle of nowhere with no compatible HVM in your area. It's another thing to date a guy you've met via OLD who lives in another region when there are many other single men in your area. It's really hard to vet a guy when the two of you don't live in the same region. This especially applies to sexual chemistry and you can't figure out if someone is sexually compatible based on text messages and video chats.

Also, bear in mind that most men are uninterested in long distance relationships especially an internationalone. A HVM living in a place with a large population will probably not be trying to find love in another region as he is probably popular among ladies in his area. Some women from developing countries may hope to find an SO from a developed country, but honestly, most men who do this are creeps or extremely undesirable in their own country.",322.0
702,t3_r3cg1f,Psychology - Marcia's Identity Status Theory. Some idle musings,"So, I just learnt about this theory: Marcia suggests the development psychological identity can fall into 1 of 4 states - identity achievement, identity moratorium, identity foreclosure and identity diffusion. 

This work is aimed at adolescents, but it struck me at how much the following 2 seem to apply to men these days. 

* **Identity Foreclosure** ‚Äì the status in which the adolescent seems willing to commit to some relevant roles, values, or goals for the future. Adolescents in this stage have not experienced an identity crisis. They tend to conform to the expectations of others regarding their future (e. g. allowing a parent to determine a career direction) As such, these individuals have not explored a range of options. 
* **Identity Diffusion** ‚Äì the status in which the adolescent does no have a sense of having choices; he or she has not yet made (nor is attempting/willing to make) a commitment.

They seem to be wishy-washy, no drive or ability to commit to anything. Or if they do commit it is only to short-term goals which benefit them, as per so many stories of women being used for sex and then either strung along or discarded.

Any values or morals again only benefit them and are subject to being twisted or dropped if it no longer benefits, rather than being a firm principle to be held.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet these 2 seem to apply to women, I would argue even the libfems and pickmes.

* **Identity Moratorium** ‚Äì the status in which the adolescent is currently in a crisis, exploring various commitments and is ready to make choices, but has not made a commitment to these choices yet.
* **Identity Achievement** ‚Äì the status in which adolescent has gone through a identity crisis and has made a commitment to a sense of identity (i.e. certain role or value) that he or she has chosen.

A lot of them, and ladies here, have a sense of identity in regards to being married and having children,  they would like to have a romantic and or sexual relationship with a partner. How many times have we all circled around identity moratorium when a partner treats or treated us unfairly and we didn't have the FDS lens to understand what was going on. To give us that solid understanding so we could achieve high standards, boundaries and values which allow us firmly hold our principles instead of shifting them when facing a crisis about the relationship and identity surrounding being in a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, none of these are set in stone and we can easily move around all 4 of these identity stage, yet it still feels like the patriarchy enables men to mostly remain in the first 2 stages described. Learning about this makes me feel there really is a strong gendered socialisation divide between us and men, leading them to have become weaker in both mind and body with the advancement of technology and women's rights. Or maybe those things are finally revealing what has always been there about men - they are lazy opportunists and will avoid accountability where possible.

703,t3_r3byto,"IMO, there's no fixed way to determine whether a man you're dating is actually good.","I've come across a lot of comments which say that if a man treats animals well, he's empathetic in general and won't tend to mistreat women. 


It's an extreme theory IMO. A man who loves his pets doesn't mean that he's in the green flag territory or that he's empathetic, especially when we haven't taken into account how he treats other people and things in life. 


I've seen and been with men, who are often ""dog-lover"" or ""cat-lover"" and the likes but still abuse their partners. 
To them, cheating, verbal, physical and emotional abuse, come naturally. They even go to the extent of murdering their partners but remember to take the pets away. 


I can't think of any term to label such a behaviour, but it's definitely not empathetic. I'm not saying that one shouldn't look after animals, most importantly stray ones but what I'm trying to say is, men don't consider us as humans. We don't even belong to their idea of a hierarchy, let alone expect compassion, love and respect like they give to animals. It's extremely dehumanising.

Understand that today's pursuit of hypergamy is basically eugenics. It is using judicious sexual selection as a means to secure the best future for you and your family from what is available the gene pool. This is how evolution works. Unfortunately, for women, the gene pool is a cess pool as men lack the same discriminating tastes nor a willingness to better themselves.

What we are left with is a morton's fork. We are having to choose between equally bad choices, and dating apps that profit from information asymmetry. Sadly, the limiting factor in ""choosing better"",  has always been men. The amount of high value men to high value women is depressing and this leads to the current dysgenics free fall into idiocracy-esque society. **Just remember low quality social interactions are infinitely inferior to high quality solitude.** 

While I'm sure some scrotes would point the finger at pesky first wave feminists (as they always do when we ask them to do better), something tells me women finding inferior suitors, predates feminism. It just so happens that allowing women to become educated and first wave feminism occurring simultaneously confounds the issue. **Apparently according to a finding, single men over 35 are generally mental defectives ladies**.

708,t3_r2wjll,Never feel bad about enforcing boundaries,"FDS is often criticized for refusing to entertain men who violate our boundaries, and we are often shamed for having boundaries in the first place. As a former people pleaser, I used to feel bad for setting and enforcing boundaries, especially with men. I used to feel like I was being mean or selfish for not wanting to work to their programme even if it inconvenienced me and put me at a disadvantage. I got over these feelings of guilt by realising that even low/negative value men have boundaries, and they are not afraid to enforce them if it means you are kept in a box.

Them refusing to take you out on a decent date is a boundary.

Them stringing you along in a situationship is a boundary.

Them refusing to spend money on you or buy you thoughtful gifts is a boundary.

Them refusing to wash or practice basic hygiene is a boundary.

Them ghosting you for refusing to sleep with them on the second date is a boundary.

Them refusing to stop watching porn even though they know the negative impact it has on women is a boundary.

Men never need to justify their boundaries in the same way women are expected to. Oftentimes when I tell a man 'no', the first question that comes out of his mouth is ""why not?"" even though ""no"" is a complete sentence. This reminds me of a quote from Gavin de Becker: *""When a man says no, it's the end of the discussion. When a woman says no, it's the start of a negotiation.""*

Having boundaries will only make you unpopular with people who mean you no good, because most people, including those who are low value, have boundaries so they can live their life the way they want to. You owe it to yourself to be ruthless when it comes to enforcing your boundaries, so you too can live authentically and in a way that makes YOU happy.",607.0
709,t3_r2usv5,Is FDS a new take on dating or just the pendulum swinging back?,"Is FDS a new take on dating or just the pendulum swinging back? I‚Äôm 63 years old and I‚Äôm fascinated with the emergence of FDS Reddit forum and website as a sociological immune system response to the ethos of liberal feminism, and the complaints of some men not overly successful in dating who blame women for their woes. My generation has ridden the train from the 1960‚Äôs to the 2020‚Äôs and the changes in expectations and attitudes on both sides of the gender divide have been remarkable over time. My mother was not a timid woman, but she understood there is a time to lead, and a time to follow in the dating dance without it being some exploitative gender war.

It has always been my belief, based on the observation of various couples coupling, that in a practical sense, women are largely in charge of how males behave in dating relationships based primarily on what they will accept and tolerate. I think one main dysfunction that crept in over time since the 70‚Äôs forward, is the notion that if women are legally and economically equal to males (which is slowly becoming the de facto state of society) that they should model male dating behavior, on the assumption that it must be the preferred ‚Äúpower‚Äù position.

And the truth is that for women, it‚Äôs really not. In nature, males are generally the supplicants seeking female favor with gifts and displays of physical prowess. This is a very practical behavioral construct given the difference in resources that will be expended to bear offspring for most animals. Yes, people are (mostly) not rutting animals, but the same physical risk calculation for the female still applies. Ie ‚ÄúAre you worth mating with? What resources are you bringing to the table?‚Äù.

FDS asks that exact question, which has largely been ignored for some time because it was not politically or socially polite to put it front and center. In times past it would largely have been the only question. However, the reality of modern dating is that children are often an option and not a requirement of a relationship. If you are not bringing your womb to the table what are men supposed to be saluting? Your earning power? Your sharp intellect? Your professional achievements?

In the same fashion as women are making practical judgments, so are men, and these things are not front and center in their mate choice calculations. Most well-intended, non-pathological men primarily want sex and an emotionally stable, confident woman who is nice to them. Obviously, there must be an intellectual and emotional fit between people for successful relationships, but those things are the primary front-end drivers for men.

For women, it‚Äôs more complicated. They are not just pushing their sperm and some resources to the center of the poker table, they are pushing a big pile of chips in terms of their reproductive capacity and time investment in child care, so if the bet is going to be big they need to understand who they are playing with. This can be a practical determination based on a man‚Äôs demonstrated generosity, overall character, and good behavior, but if kids are off the table, you will be playing the man‚Äôs game, which does not put women at an advantage. FDS as a front-end dating strategy is not the worst solution in the world for women seeking to filter out males who are unwilling to do some basic meal paying, door opening, and polite hoop-jumping for access to their favor.

Interestingly, there is an article that came out a few years ago that caused a big buzz that quickly faded under the pressure of it going against the tide of liberal feminism. It‚Äôs not completely on board with *all* the precepts of FDS, but it contains several of them. To this day, it‚Äôs still one of the most practical dating strategy pieces of advice I have ever read if you are serious about wanting to get married.

Yet these same men will curl up their lips in sheer disgust if there's even one rumor about a local woman having a ""high body count"". They'll call her all the degrading names in the book. One thing common on the dating apps is guys saying ""I won't buy your OF!"" In their profiles. Other guys will like a woman so much and then watch how their opinion of her flips like a switch if they find out she worked for a strip club or has an OF.

711,t3_r2myzz,Stepping into my power with FDS style dating,"Hi ladies! I've been following FDS for almost two years now, and have made a few posts and comments on past accounts. The purpose of this post is to share my new experiences after taking a year off from dating to focus on myself and truly embrace being my own soulmate. After two abusive relationships it's taken a lot of therapy and work, but I finally felt confident and secure enough in my abilities to vet that I decided to enter the dating pool again this month. I feel validated in my bullshit sensing abilities, abundance mindset, and practicing a lot of the ideas that FDS spreads to help women love and protect themselves! This is a success story not in the sense that I'm married to a HVM or anything, but that I've gained the skills and confidence to rely on my intuition and put myself first.

I felt pretty excited about the first man who took me out this month. We went on a nice dinner date, he paid and gave a generous tip without batting an eye in my direction or pausing, meets all of my physical standards, and asked me a lot of genuine questions about my life and who I am as a person. He has a nice job and drove over an hour each way to take me out to dinner without one word of complaint or hesitation, and started planning the second date while on the first. Opened doors and everything. The date was short and sweet with nice conversation; he was generous and the date ended at a reasonable hour. I've already had to block him before the second date, though. Me from a year ago would've never been able to do that. However, I know that men are not hard to come by and there's someone else out there who will be happy to treat me even better without doing this:

When I got home from our date, I decided to check his Bumble profile on a whim. I hadn't checked it since since yesterday (I'm not a fan of OLD but I wanted to try to it and see about my vetting skills). So the day we had gone on our date, he changed it to ""travel mode"" for a location he told me he'd be visiting next month. He also changed his bio to say that he is going to be there on a short trip a month from now, goes there ""often,"" etc. So, he lied to me about looking for a relationship. Maybe he wanted one with me, but only to sneak around on the side, obviously, and that's if he didn't dump me after sex down the road. It felt... not great that he was thinking about hooking up with women somewhere else a whole month from now while I was excitedly getting ready to see him that night.

After I saw this, I started reflecting on things he had told me that had stood out at the time while on the date. I made a mental note of each of them to think about later, and I'm definitely glad I did. I brought them to a trusted friend who's aligned with FDS values and she says ""oh yeah, he's a ho."" I blocked him without a word. My only regret is I didn't block him sooner! However, that was my first date after a year and I feel much less hesitant blocking even faster from now on.

I was also supposed to have a date with another man last night, but I cancelled it and blocked him because he hadn't confirmed plans with me by the day of. I also have a date planned for tomorrow.

After years of abuse and spending so much time taking back my power, it actually feels very healing, validating, and empowering to have this much control over my dating life and what men have access to me. It doesn't matter how nice or cute they are. They can be gone just like that, because I am worthy of the best and I only want someone who adds to my life and is honest.

712,t3_r2ubjc,Your Standards,"I was recalling the times where I made it clear that I will not date men who patronize the porn industry. It is just not something I want in my life. (it is the same for sex prior to emotional investment). Had there been a ‚Äúdealbreaker‚Äù category on apps for this metric, I would have paid for it.

What there *is* a dealbreaker category on is smoking, drinking, and drugs. As for myself, I am an occasional drinker and occasionally take edibles- this is once every one or two weeks- but still, it would be disingenuous to put myself in the ‚Äúnever‚Äù category, or not answer, as that creates compatibility issues.

Somehow a man *fully* committed to sobriety ended up matching with me (guess he didn‚Äôt want to pay for the dealbreaker filter lol). Anyone who partook in alcohol or weed even occasionally would not work for him and he said he was sorry, but we would not work. For him, it was to the point where he no longer drank caffeine (I drink it daily), and I believe that while that one wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, he would prefer someone that didn‚Äôt drink it either. Privately, I thought the caffeine thing was a bit excessive, but in the end, he‚Äôs clearly wired in such a way to not be able to feel good or control himself with substances regularly close by, in a way that I am not (I never felt the desire to overdo). And it‚Äôs extreme enough to where if he‚Äôs going to meaningfully incorporate a woman into his life, it‚Äôs going to be too hard for him to stay committed to his lifestyle (hey, at least this is mental health-based and not some shit about preferences for areola size or what the fuck ever).

I‚Äôve had this health and/or ethics based dealbreaker convo come up with other men in terms of who‚Äôd they‚Äôd date...be it diets, activity, political leanings, religion, you name it. In terms of *meaningful* emotional  involvement, they had their baseline, and that just was what it was. 

So you know what I said to that sober life guy? Basically, good for you, man. I understand. I hope you find someone on the same path. And that was it. 

You know what I didn‚Äôt do? Shame him for it. Tell him that ‚Äúeveryone drinks occasionally‚Äù. Remind him that ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be really hard for you to find someone under those circumstances‚Äù. Lecture him on how marginalized people *rely* on the drug and alcohol trades to stay afloat, and I shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out, when I‚Äôm just being a helpful consumer. Why would I do that? To make him feel bad? To assert dominance over a stranger? To try to trick him into lowering his standards to date me, ensuring a compatibility issue? Do I really need to feel defensive? Literally. What would be the point?

And yet. You know what men have done to me when I‚Äôve said ‚Äúno porn in my relationship‚Äù or ‚Äúno sex without emotional investment‚Äù? Almost every time, this: ‚ÄúWell, everyone watches porn sometimes.‚Äù (often adding- ‚Äúeven women!‚Äù No. Shit.) ‚ÄúEveryone has sex before commitment‚Äù (idgaf! ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù used to smoke cigarettes too, ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù used to drink, ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù used to be in hetero marriages...cultural shifts happen). ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get sexual by the third date you‚Äôre going to have a hard time getting anyone to stick around‚Äù (how benevolent of him to warn me so that I may avoid the fate of not having wasted years on someone who does not respect me!). ‚ÄúSex workers rely on that income‚Äù (says the woke man who is likely watching only free stuff, and dollars to donuts has never been the one to spend the going rate for an independently operating high-end escort with rigid vetting requirements for her safety). And on and on. And for what? Why do they do this?

Ladies, while most men are pretty relaxed in their standards in terms of who they will have sex with, they feel no guilt or shame or second-guessing when it comes to who they will make an emotional investment in. You may confidently do the same, sexually and romantically. If a man tries to shame you on it- be it to manipulate you out of them, assert dominance, or just make you feel bad...I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a guy on an app or your family member or friend or whoever....do not tolerate this.

My favorite quote from the podcast (I believe it was Reaux) was something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou know you don‚Äôt have to just accept things men say right? They say the things that will advance their interests. It‚Äôs just narrative-based tactical advantages‚Äù.

That‚Äôs all it is!

When you listen to that, you are playing into a narrative that is based in a time where a woman‚Äôs partner choices were *very* limited, if you had a choice at all. And, unless you liked the look of a convent, for the sake of financial security, you *had* to make a choice. That pressure to accept whatever existed, so that women who had to marry could retain their sanity while spending their lives/having sex with men they never would have chosen, had they had agency. 

You don‚Äôt live in that framework, thus, you don‚Äôt need the narrative that supports it. Keep leveling up your life to be the very best you can be- women who came before us sacrificed hard for our right to fully do so. They did not second guess their fight (and believe me, the patriarchy fought them every step of the way). Honor them by not second-guessing yourself as you make the best use possible of the rewards of their labor. Date like a man, confident in your standards that support your health, principles, or just overall happiness.

He shouldn't be rushing you into things. You don't want a man that just wants to show you off like a trophy. 

-pay attention to how he treats his family, especially the women of his family, during the holidays. Is he helping his grandma decorate her house, did he help his mom with cooking and cleaning up, is he getting his mom a nice present or rolling his eyes and complaining that gifts are ""cooperate scams?""

-is he making an effort to understand what you do for the holidays, is he being respectful of how you celebrate? If you are from different cultures or religions this is especially important. He needs to be inclusive and should want to learn your traditions.

-if  he is celebrating a holiday with you he should be dressing appropriately and nicely. He should be bringing something along. 

-yes, he should be giving you a gift if he's celebrating a holiday with you. It should be thoughtful and substantial, not some super cheap generic gift. 

-If he celebrates Christmas pay attention to if his parents are still giving him clothing, socks, etc and they are doing that as a means of coddling him. Some lvm refuse to buy their own clothes and still rely on mommy to shop for them. 

-watch his etiquette if you fo along to his event. Does he stay with you the whole time? Does he take your coat for you? Does he introduce you to everyone? When people are talking does he make sure you're included in the conversations, answer your questions, and explain back stories/inside jokes? Does he vanish with his bros? Does he let people insult you? üö©

-watch for holiday themed negging? Ie ""she just had to order the peppermocha mocha whatever crap from the coffee shop! Ugh. She's been making me listen to Christmas carols. She's spending too much on gifts, shopping takes too long with her."" And this neg ""she's too much of a perfectionist with the holidays. Does it matter what her great aunt will like better? Does it have to be wrapped perfectly?!"" All üö©üö©üö©

-you want a man that's a good sport. If hes coming to an ugly sweater party with you then he needs to be a good sport and rock an ugly sweater too. Good sports will participate in the event's activities, games, and traditions. Is he rolling his eyes at how your friends do a gag gift exchange or how your family plays a special game on a holiday? Lvm will exclude themselves and not even try. 

-avoid men that complain about and resist whatever brings you joy this holiday season. If you like putting up a Christmas tree early he needs to be cool with that and should be offering to help you.

-holidays will mean that most lvm will pull back on you. They'll start dropping the effort and generally won't invite you to anything. They won't get you a gift. Or they'll try to invite you over to their place for sex without any of the work or gifts. Beware. 

-watch out for lvm that will come along to events just for the free food or out of boredom. The giveaway is that they act like bumps on a log, only eating food and doing things that benefit them. They will avoid any work of helping or bringing anything. They're awkward and often act shy. 

-if it's the early stages and you aren't being invited/aren't inviting him yet, you Do NOT have to get him any presents. From my experience even in the early stages men that are more serious about having a relationship with you will get you a substantial gift and will be celebrating with you, but he also won't rush into inviting you to meet his family. 

RECAP: holidays are a great time to gage a man. If you invite him to your events really good way of seeing how he acts, if he offers to help, if he gifts, and how he treats your coworkers, friends, and family. How does he speak of you? Do not rush into having a man attend your family or social events.

Edit: want to add one big reminder: if you go to anything with him please have your own means of transportation lined up / drive yourself. So if the red flags are coming out you can walk out asap, on your own terms. You don't want to be stuck at his event having to wait for him when he's being a jerk.",179.0

I get quite a few reactions to this that end up with me never taking them seriously again.

1. I win handily, and the guy refuses to stop playing until he either gets a win, or ragequits

2. I win handily, and the guy tries to hide his contempt/shame about the loss for the rest of the day, but claims that he doesn't care, or that it doesn't matter, or that he's just out of practice.

3. I win handily, and the guy complains that I played an easy character or used a cheap strategy

4. I lose by a large margin, and the guy says something to the effect of ""haha, i was using my worst character and you STILL lost! I thought you said you were pretty good at this game""

5. I lose by a large margin, and the guy immediately starts criticizing my gameplay and offering to teach me

717,t3_r2o95t,Reminder: Time is precious.,"This is something that I definitely ignored all through my twenties stuck in dead end relationships.

Yes - there‚Äôs a natural period of time while dating someone that you‚Äôre still getting to know each other and see if you‚Äôre compatible for the long haul.

No - this period of time isn‚Äôt years. In my case, it was approximately 7 years. 7 years of being with a LVM who strung me along with the promises of marriage that never happened. 7 years of losing my sanity day by day for a man who didn‚Äôt want to get his shit together. This is partially due to my lack of self esteem in that period of my life, but also societal conditioning.

A man will know extremely quickly if he sees himself having a future with you/getting married to you. I‚Äôve heard stories of men knowing within months, that the person that they met is going to be their future wife. These men also don‚Äôt drag their feet about marriage and commitment because they know how valuable these women are and don‚Äôt want them to slip away.

Society has told us not to ‚Äúrush into anything‚Äù. Fair, I agree with that. But come on, don‚Äôt you think slightly over a year to 2 years is enough time to make a decision?

Men love to waste our time. They know our time is precious and youth is fleeting. Men also buy into the trope that we ‚Äúhit the wall‚Äù at 30 and become undesirable, while their scrote-asses become MORE desirable as they age.

From now on, always remind yourself that time is precious. Invest your time in things and people with positive returns. Men will waste your time and waste it some more.

From now on, I refuse to commit to anyone unless they‚Äôre all in on me and consistently show HV behaviour. I also won‚Äôt subject myself to staying in a dead end situation for the sake of men‚Äôs poor feefees and indecisiveness. I won‚Äôt feel guilty for breaking things off close to the year mark if there‚Äôs no progress.

720,t3_r2jbwd,PSA: Another Reason Not to Give Up on Your Friendships While Dating: Sanity Checks,"Hi Ladies,

Back in from the field with a fresh report. I'll spare you all the sordid details. Because honestly, I don't even know how to make \*that\* make sense.

But....I can share the lesson!

It happened unintentionally, but while I was ""dating"" I lost touch with just a few friends. Nothing major, just a few days.

In the meantime though, I was already sucked into this ""person's"" way of thinking and viewing life. It largely conflicted with mine. He attempted to convince me of the ""normalcy"" of his behaviors. It triggered my desire to be ""understanding"". Little by little, I was nodding along to what he said, and not what I knew was right.

Of course, I snapped out of it. Luckily, sooner rather than later. By the way....on your journey, you will still come across bums, losers, sickos...but the warning signs are MUCH CLEARER once you've familiarized yourself with FDS. That tragedy could have taken me \*years\* to get out of in the past. This time, it was just a few days and I pulled the plug. Kudos to me!!!

The point? It wasn't until I cut him off and got back in touch with my friends, that I realized how far off course I had strayed. When I saw their smiling faces, happy demeanor, calm, well-adjusted selves--I was reminded of what is really ""normal"", at least for me.

So long story short...Check-in with your friends throughout your dating adventures. Don't be ashamed or afraid to ask for sanity checks along the way. They are the folks who know us, at least better than any new person. It can be useful to use your friendships as a gauge for normalcy, reciprocity, respect, and admiration.

This could also be related to how he had nothing good to say about his exes too. Seemed he had contempt for quite a bit of women in his life, even family.

723,t3_r2dzqf,"REMINDER: It's ok to ignore / not be friends with / get distance from a man ""for no reason"".","Happy Thanksgiving. I was working this out in my head, and I did want to share:

Some women try to be kind and normal around men that make them really uncomfortable, because ""he did not do anything wrong"". They invite them to get togethers so the boys don't feel badly. They text them like they are friends. They hang out with them in groups, because he did not technically ""do something"" or ""say something"" to them. And that might be true. But think about this: 

If you have a heart or an attitude that is authentically oriented towards good, or if you don't cultivate perversion in yourself, then you can compliment people and be truly close to them without creeping them out or disturbing them. If there is perversion in yourself, you don't even need to be close to anyone to make them feel grossed out. All you need to do is make eye contact or say ""hello"". That's because the wrong-ness in you will leak out somehow even in your most innocuous actions. Even normal behavior will get tainted by what you are. 

For example, I started work at an organization where there was a male leader in the group. I don't know him well enough to mark him cleanly as HV, but he gave off a TON of green flags: he volunteered to serve abused women and children without virtue signaling about it, he was kind and open towards older women, he was not touchy-feely with women and did not ignore them either, he told a bunch of men to be quiet to make room for a woman to take her turn to talk, he was not flirty or creepy with his female friends, and he *adored* his wife and kids. When I met him, he gave me a compliment on my new skirt. ""I love the patterns!"" he said. I was completely at ease, and said ""Thanks."" I could feel somehow that the guy was not gross, and he was respectful to me all throughout my term. I still only remember good things about him so far.

Later, I came into contact with a much older man that gave me an ""off"" vibe, even though he had not done anything. I held him at a distance. I never looked at him. I was not friendly. I felt badly about being cold, but I followed my intuition. He had not technically done anything wrong. Then he made a weird, flirty comment to me later on. I told him very firmly ""DO not talk to me like that."" He left me alone completely afterwards. I was much more of a pick-me in those days, but even then I knew my boundaries.

The first man was able to be openly friendly with women and give compliments, because his intent was (as far as I know) genuine. The second man could never do this, because his intent towards me was never good to begin with. All he needed to do in order to signal danger to me was to say ""Hello"".

A lot of men complain about women supposedly ""over-reacting"" to them. ""I cannot be friendly to women anymore."" ""Can't I even greet / compliment a woman on the street today?"" ""I was JUST saying hello."" But the truth is that female intuition can inform us of the intent behind supposedly innocuous behavior. And even if we don't have the whole picture, we should not be blamed for not immediately trusting men. You can detect when something is wrong even when nothing technically bad has taken place. 

You are not an ""idiot"" or ""oversensitive"" for creating distance between yourself and a man you don't like, even if the man has not done anything objectively wrong. If he says ""hi"" and you get a twist in your gut saying ""Ew"", then USE THAT INFORMATION to your own benefit. You don't need to justify yourself with an objective defense of your choices.

Story is about a gay man but if they have the scrotacity to do this to a dude then ladies beware!

Entitled: [He showed up at my house after I 'met' him on a dating app. I was freaked out](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2018/01/01/he-showed-up-my-house-after-met-him-dating-app-freaked-out-how-protect-your-identity-while-dating/972025001/)

Tinder, a dating app.

Last fall I did some chatting on a dating app with a guy I hoped to meet. He had a job, he had an adorable pooch‚Äîand he was friends with people I knew in the flesh. So I gave him my cell number and asked him to call me about 10 p.m. that night. ‚ÄúWhat could go wrong?‚Äù I asked myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs what: Just after 10 he texted that he was at a restaurant around the corner‚Äîand he pulled into my driveway two minutes later. ‚ÄúHow did you know where I live?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThat was easy ‚Äì you gave me your phone number,‚Äù he said nonchalantly as I told him to leave, which (fortunately) he did. But the episode freaked me out.

&amp;#x200B;

More than 15% of all American adults have used a mobile dating app or site, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center study‚Äînearly 40 million people‚Äîand one recent study found that at least half of them lie about themselves in their profiles (other research puts that percentage even higher).  Many of those lies are mild, like under-reporting weight or over-reporting wealth, but some are full-on ‚Äúcatfishers‚Äù ‚Äì which according to Urban Dictionary are ‚ÄúInternet predators that fabricate online identities ‚Ä¶ to trick people into emotional/romantic relationships.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

When I started dating again for the first time in 13 years, I realized I needed a strategy for uncovering the truth about romantic candidates, especially since the apps I was using‚ÄîOKCupid, Tinder, and MeetMindful‚Äîdid not verify users. My new approach: After a volley of chats on an app, I would ask prospective dates to text me. That way I would have their cell number, which I know from my previous reporting can be used to find out just about anything about you.

&amp;#x200B;

Eric Silverberg, CEO of Scruff, a dating app for gay men, didn‚Äôt think my plan was too smart.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúIf you switch \[from the app\] to text messaging, there‚Äôs no community support to protect you and it‚Äôs going to be much harder for you to get help if there‚Äôs ever some kind of issue.‚Äù He reminded me ‚Äúto be thoughtful and cautious about who you share your number with.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Mark Brooks, editor of [OnlinePersonalsWatch.com](https://OnlinePersonalsWatch.com), a dating news and commentary site, also cautioned me: ‚ÄúFull verification is not possible outside of actual real world matchmakers who often use background checks.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Brooks added: ‚ÄúBeware of jumping to a third-party form of communication. Scammers lure people off dating sites/apps, and then scam. It‚Äôs then beyond the jurisdiction of the app. Worse, it's beyond the tools that dating apps use to monitor abusive behaviors, for instance, device ID tools and communications monitoring A.I.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn‚Äôt know any of that so I bought a $5-a-month premium subscription to WhitePages, a ‚Äúpeople search‚Äù service. After I‚Äôd get a guy‚Äôs phone number, I‚Äôd run it through the ‚Äúreverse lookup‚Äù feature and voil√†! I had his full name, home address, real age, and more. With that data I‚Äôd turn to Google, where among other things I found a photo of one guy who had claimed to be single wearing a wedding band. Heartbreak averted.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúJust about anyone is going to Google your name before they meet you these days,‚Äù explained Rich Matta, CEO of ReputationDefender, a service that promises to cleanse your online presence. Then they can ‚Äúeasily triangulate other sensitive information,‚Äù he added.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert Sepulveda Jr., an interior designer from Atlanta, center, will go in search of love in the first gay dating show, Logo's 'Finding Prince Charming.'

Every once in a while, I found no information at all about a particular number. That was puzzling until I reached out to Thomas Martin, president of Martin Investigative Services, who explained: ‚ÄúCould be a number of factors. The most common is a burner phone, or they went to great lengths not to have their number in anyone‚Äôs system.‚Äù (Burner phones are generally used for one reason, such as a drug deal or clandestine relationship, then dumped.) When I couldn't confirm someone‚Äôs identity, I backed away.

&amp;#x200B;

I soon learned that what‚Äôs good for the goose is good for the gander. My texting scheme meant I had their number ‚Äì but they had mine too. One fellow got upset when I didn‚Äôt want to see him again and Googled me. Angry, he deluged me with personal information he‚Äôd discovered. He started driving by my new house and taking photos. When I went to the police about filing an order of protection, I learned he‚Äôd made threats to others. The officer told me to keep copies of his disturbing emails, block him on social media, and tell him firmly to leave me alone. Check. Check. Check.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn‚Äôt want to be tracked down again, so I got a Google Voice number, which rings on my cell phone. With the Google Voice app, I can send and receive texts, listen to voicemails, and block numbers. I now give out that number instead of my real cell. Of course, someone who looks up my Google Voice number and finds nothing will probably think I have a burner phone ‚Äì or that I‚Äôm catfishing them. Oh well. Life is far from perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

The take-away:

&amp;#x200B;

There‚Äôs no reason to give out a phone number before meeting. Use the app to pick a time and place to meet. Remember conventional wisdom: Meet in a public place, let a friend know ahead where you‚Äôll be, and plan to check in after.

&amp;#x200B;

Use dating sites that require proof of identity to establish an account. Online dating expert Mark Brooks recommends [Match.com](https://Match.com) and Meetic (in Europe) because they use their tech tools that help them stave off scammers. Zoosk and Badoo verify users‚Äô identities. Or seek out people who have linked to their social media accounts from their dating profiles. ‚ÄúThese are not foolproof,‚Äù says Brooks, ‚Äúbut they are another line of defense.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Look out for scam dating sites, says Scruff‚Äôs Silverberg. ‚ÄúIf the domain redirects to different domain name, that‚Äôs a huge red flag.‚Äù He suggests that we pay attention to an app‚Äôs reviews in the Apple store. The most successful dating apps will have thousands of reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

Don‚Äôt be in a rush to friend someone on Facebook, which gives them access to a lot more personal information about you, your family, and your work.

&amp;#x200B;

Opt out of people search sites, recommends ReputationDefender‚Äôs Matta. You can contact them directly or use a third-party service like his. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt remove every possible trace of your information on the Internet, but it certainly makes you much harder to find.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

But the last word goes to Mr. Brooks: ‚ÄúSometimes common sense is the least common of the senses when people are in a state of attraction.  People let their guard down a little too early.‚Äù That would never happen to me. Oops, it already has.",172.0

(An anecdote)","Every time I hear the hygiene and grooming related stories on here and the podcast I kind of roll my eyes, because it sounds like BASIC stuff which people should be on regardless. Which we shouldn't have to mention because it goes without saying. Surely it's not THAT common, right? RIGHT?? But then I'm reminded of a story that I heard from my aunt and a reminder that NOBODY should stay with dirty men.

I live in a place that has very few people of my ethnicity (African), to the point that people will just approach each other on the street to say hi etc... Anyway, this happened many years ago and essentially my aunt was approached by a woman in the street. The woman was desperate and  said that she wanted to fly back to her home country and needed help. My aunt works in healthcare so she calmed her down and suggested a woman's org she could go to. She assumed maybe the woman was being abused or even enslaved, sadly a thing that does happen here. But no, LOL.

The woman was from a popular sex tourism destination and had recently married a man who had been there on holiday. (First red flag obv.) Apparently he had wooed her and she liked him so she accepted to join him back in Europe. Upon arriving and living here for a few months however, she noticed that he did not bathe regularly and stunk. She tried to do everything, asked to bathe him, bought him soaps, begged him and he just didn't care. He was able-bodied and able-minded and had NO excuse at all, just didn't feel like it. She told him she wanted to leave and he essentially said nope, and refused to buy her a ticket.

The thing that annoyed her the most, especially being from a 3rd world country, is that shops here were full of all kinds of soaps, perfumes, deodorants, lotions, cheap and expensive and he just wouldn't make an effort. His house was modern with running hot water at all times of the day and still he would maybe shower once a week. Back home she knew people had to manually heat water for a bath, bathed from buckets and basins but still always made an effort to be clean *every day*, so what was stopping him? And the funny thing is she had noticed the smell while he was still on holiday but just assumed it was because he was a tourist and not in his home.

Anyway, the women's org ended up helping her with money for a flight as well as her divorce and she flew back home. I unfortunately don't know much about this woman what class or income she had back home, but judging that he probably met her at the beach I'm assuming she was not well off. The fact that she still said, she's out, leaving all the 1st world comforts behind because she will not deal with a stinking man, always stayed with me. It must have been a tough choice, but it is Queen Energy if I've ever seen it. To her it was a personal insult, that he wouldn't make an effort to be clean and smell nice for her.

While I've lived in the West most of my life, I've seen 3rd world poverty up close and it's no joke. But don't be fooled, even a woman from there will not put up with a stinking man.

But something that bothered me is that he didn't bring her anything not even wine or dessert and after dinner I offered to help her with the cleaning but he didn't. And it's been bothering me. I think it's basic manners to offer help as a guest after dinner and bring them something. What do you guys think?

739,t3_r17a3s,Cautionary Tale,"Hey Queens! I wanted to speak from the perspective of an older woman, and tell you all how I recently made a grave mistake. More than one, actually.

I'm 50, and divorced. I reconnected almost 2 years ago with a man (age 61) I worked with back in the 90's. I initiated. Mistake #1.

He had never been married, never even had a serious relationship. Red flag #1. I gave him lots of slack because of this, thinking his lack of experience led to his blunders. Mistake #2.

I allowed him to come to my home every single evening, eat my good cooking, spend time with my fun and friendly family, and bask in my love and affection. I'm a former nurse, and volunteered to help him care for his 95 year old mother. Mistake # eleventy-billion.

When we'd been together a year, I asked what he thought about a possible future for us. He, quite literally, would not talk about it. I let it go (see Mistake #2).

When our second anniversary rolled around last week, I forced the issue and there was a major argument. I learned that he had a vague thought that maybe once his mother had passed and he had retired (9 more years, ladies!) we might possibly move in together. Yeah. Like I want to move in with the old man/child just in time to do the housework and wipe his ass as he ages.

I broke it off. Blocked and deleted after 2 years. I would rather be without a romantic partner for the rest of my life than sacrifice myself on the altar of the ridiculous male ego.

What is super extra ass-chapping is that I am considered attractive and he...is not. I actually have other options already on the table to be vetted (see, I CAN learn!).

Hope that NVM has fun dying alone while I'm surrounded by friends, family and happiness.",352.0
740,t3_r1fjog,Beware of men who claim they‚Äôre a ‚Äúhomebody‚Äù and love ‚Äústaying in‚Äù.,"I suddenly remember this man I used to chat with through OLD. He recently moved to my city 6 months in prior. He offered to take me out for a dinner date that weekend, okay, great. I began chatting with him through out the week to vet/get to know each other.

A big orange flag I noticed is despite being in my city for the last 6 months, he told me he had only been to the local park right across from his apartment. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Are you telling me you have been here 6 months and never went anywhere within a 5 mile radius? I tried introducing him to other locations within a short drive. However, this man turned down all my offers, claiming that ‚Äúit‚Äôs too much work to go out to these places (nearby malls, downtown areas, beaches).‚Äù He claimed that he wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere that he has to deal with even the slightest amount of traffic.

And for me, I‚Äôm someone who loves being taken out on nice dates. I‚Äôm also a ‚Äústaying in‚Äù person but when I decide to go on dates with a man, I often put in efforts to polish my appearance and take time out of the day to see him (clearing my calendar/schedule). Because of this, I always prefer to be taken to nice locations, such as upscale restaurants, museums, art galleries, concerts. That‚Äôs what makes dating fun and worthwhile. I feel like I don‚Äôt even have to over-explain this haha.

This man began to complain about him being too ‚Äúshy‚Äù to go out and would love if on future dates, we could spend a night in, *cuddle* and watch Netflix. (Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah) 

I think that was a final straw for me to block him. This man hadn‚Äôt taken me out on the first date yet, but already attempted to manage my expectations for what dating him is like. Hint: it‚Äôs a waste of time.

And what a waste! He moved from a small town to a big metropolitan area, full of beautiful places to explore, with a huge population of young, fun, and educated people around his age that he could make friends and potentially network with to leverage his career. And for what? For him to only stay inside his apartment for 50% of the year to watch ESPN and play video games? (He‚Äôs also HUGE on watching sports, borderline addict)

I immediately asked myself, do I want to date someone who has no drive or passion to make his life more fun and exciting? He complained to me about having no friends, but when I suggested going to places with social events, he dipped out at the idea of putting himself out there. 

Through texts, this man seemed friendly, charismatic, and had a decent sense of humor. It‚Äôs a shame he doesn‚Äôt feel the need to take advantage of these qualities to improve his social life. I‚Äôm sure he could make friends pretty easily; He‚Äôs a good, engaging conversationalist, knowledgeable on a lot of unique, interesting subjects. I don‚Äôt see him running out of topics to talk about. Looking back at it now, even one of his pictures on his OLD profile is him standing in front of the TV, inside his house, holding a beer (ü§°). This man truly, truly, doesn‚Äôt go ANYWHERE.

No first date yet, but I can imagine what‚Äôs being his girlfriend would be, I stay in and watch as he glue his eyes to the Tv, while looking at other women enjoying their 5-star cuisine and cocktails by the beach on social media.

Blocked him without explanation. Onto the next man who would impress me.",347.0
741,t3_r1mtti,Did I make the right choice in cutting him off?,"I was seeing a guy for a month and we seemed to have a great connection at the beginning-he was very giving and considerate and on the same wavelength as me.

He seemed eager but by the time the last night I told him I‚Äôd be in town came, it was radio silence. He asked if he could call me this afternoon but then didn‚Äôt follow up. I checked his snap location (I know) and he had already left town himself. I can‚Äôt tell if he is still grieving or if he‚Äôs blowing me off. I think if he wasn‚Äôt ready to reach back out to me he should‚Äôve communicated that before getting my hopes up. I blocked him everywhere for my own sanity.

743,t3_r1g8b2,NEED ADVICE - Can't Tell If New Partner Is HV After Having Been With Too Many LVM/NVM,"Throughout college, I'd only ever been in toxic relationships where my exes showed blatant red flags that made leaving them easy (porn addiction, BDSM, physical abuse, coercion/rape, cheating, etc.). Now, I'm currently in my second year of grad school and I've been with someone since the start of this year. Although he's nowhere near as bad as my LVM/NVM exes (this current guy treats me well, takes me out and pays for everything, is physically affectionate/compassionate/caring in a wholesome way that's not just related to sex, takes me seriously and has introduced me to his family and is happy to hang out with my own family, respects my education and career and pushes me to become a better person), there are also some things about him that I'm not comfortable with - I'm just not sure if my feelings of being uncomfortable are the result of trauma from my past relationships making me paranoid, or if they're actual red flags that even someone who'd never had any trauma would see as well.

# Complimenting Other Women

He used to compliment other women's physical appearance while we were out together in public (telling them nice things about their hair/nails/makeup, etc.). Although this is, in a way, not as bad as flirting with them behind my back (which would be blatant cheating), it's still disrespectful in its own way to say these kinds of things while I'm right there.

While the compliments themselves weren't creepy or sexual, I nonetheless found it extremely uncomfortable because aside from his partner (me), family, and close friends (if it's a special occasion for them), I don't see why a man would feel the need to go around complimenting random women who are total strangers to him. He says nice things to me every day, but every compliment that he gives to a random, conventionally attractive woman makes me feel like his compliments to me carry less weight and don't mean as much anymore as a result. 

When confronted about this, he said he was just trying to spread positivity, make other people's days better, and be a gentleman - while I understand where he's coming from, this behavior is, in my opinion, extremely inappropriate while in a committed relationship with someone. After I brought up my discomfort, he stopped the behavior, but I don't know if he stopped because he truly understands where I'm coming from, or if he just stopped because he thinks he ""should."" If it's the latter, I'm afraid that a similar situation will arise in the future, where he crosses an inappropriate boundary again because he doesn't truly understand what is or is not appropriate while in a relationship.

# Problematic Friends

Both his male and female friends are problematic, and while I realize that we are not the same exact people as our friends, I also know that friends are a big influence in shaping the kinds of people we end up becoming, whether we consciously realize it or not. If these are the types of people he surrounds himself with, it makes me question his own integrity, even if he himself seems decent and isn't a total degenerate like his friends.

Male friends

* don't respect their girlfriends (one of them said he wouldn't have dated his current girlfriend if they were still in college because she ""used to be ugly back then"")
* cheat on their girlfriends (different guy than the above bullet point, by the way... he and his girlfriend took a break to work things out, but instead of working on himself, he took this time to sleep with multiple different girls every week over the course of a month, and when they got back together he pretended like nothing had happened)

Female friends

* are typical cool girl pickmes who post thirst traps onto social media and who pose in provocative and uncomfortable positions that cater to the heterosexual male gaze under the guise of ""female empowerment""
* have uncomfortably close relationships with him that border on emotional infidelity (I've confronted him about these ""friendships"" and he cut them off, but the fact that I had to tell him to stop without him realizing on his own is concerning. Again (like I already stated above), I don't know if he stopped because he truly understands where I'm coming from, or if he just stopped because he thinks he ""should."" If it's the latter, I'm afraid that a similar situation will arise in the future, where he crosses an inappropriate boundary again because he doesn't truly understand what is or is not appropriate while in a relationship.)

# Misogynistic Media

He himself is anti-porn and anti-hypersexualization/objectification. I know he's not lying, because even before I brought up my own concerns regarding these topics, he talked about these issues of his own accord (and seems to understand that porn is bad not just in terms of infidelity and maintaining self esteem while in a relationship, but also in terms of the exploitation and sexual assault that is tied to this horrible industry).

What I don't understand, then, is this:

* he complains about fantasy video games that have too much sexual content because he only wants to play the game for the adventure/monster-fighting/world building aspect, yet he still buys and plays these games that contain explicit sexual content (for example, one of his favorite game series, The Witcher, has options where you can have explicit, graphic, realistic sex with a prostitute or a ""romance"" interest. While these options aren't necessary to complete the game, they're there nonetheless, and I don't understand why he would continue playing this game knowing this information, even if he himself doesn't play through these choices)
* he complains about movies or shows having unnecessary sex scenes that don't contribute to the plot and has stated that a story can be good without even a single sexual reference, yet he still watches shows that are known to contain heavy sexual content (Game of Thrones, The Witcher, and The Last Kingdom are all set in some sort of medieval timeline and are problematic in their depiction of rape, sex, and female sexualization in general. The Queen's Gambit and Sex Education are supposed to be progressive and feminist shows (with the latter even being POC/LGBTQ+ inclusive), but I can't help but see these as nothing more than just some more libfem bullshit)

In all of the video games and TV series I mentioned above, he's explicitly talked about how these aspects of media are problematic, and he understands how/why these sorts of depictions are harmful. It just perplexes me, that, knowing how toxic these media tropes are, he still chooses to consume them. Personally, if I had a show that I enjoyed, but then after a couple of episodes it became misogynistic, I would just quit and find something else to watch.",124.0
744,t3_r0uzrs,Don‚Äôt be a live in maid for a guy and his roommates,"Thinking back on this day when my bestfriend and I went to lunch with our mutual male friend who we hadn‚Äôt seen in a long time. After a pleasant lunch, we stopped by his new apartment down the road since it was in the part of a city we all enjoy. When we got there he mentioned how one of his roommates has a girlfriend who stays over pretty much all the time. He then further stated that the cleanliness in the place is due to her efforts to keep it clean daily and that he doesn‚Äôt mind her presence because she does that. 

I‚Äôve heard this type of commentary on more than one occasion, guys commenting on how the girlfriend of one of the bros stays over a lot and as a result the place is clean.

766,t3_r0io8s,Why do guys tell you they don‚Äôt want a relationship with you but get mad if you date someone else? (long read and rant),"I was having casual sex with this one guy for about a year. I‚Äôll just refer to him as my ‚Äúex‚Äù. Typical situation, I wanted a relationship and he constantly told me no. I put up with it because I had really low self esteem at the time and thought maybe one day he would want to be with me. Funny enough, he would actually get extremely jealous, tell me I was his best friend, he would lie saying he wasn‚Äôt talking to other girls, wanted me to come over everyday, say he does like me but he‚Äôs not ready for a relationship but maybe someday in the future, and called me his girlfriend sometimes but than the next day I wasn‚Äôt his girlfriend anymore. A complete mind fuck. We started spending almost every day together and I was pretty much living with him he bought me a toothbrush and I ended up leaving a lot of jewelry and clothes at his house. It started to get old begging him for a relationship and I realized that he really was no prize so the last time I saw him I told him he doesn‚Äôt deserve a relationship with me and that he‚Äôs delusional if he thinks I want to be with him after everything he‚Äôs put me through but I‚Äôd be open to being friends. About a week later, my Snapchat got deleted and he called me 3 times, texted me twice, and contacted my best friend asking why I blocked him. I told him I didn‚Äôt block him and gave him my new Snapchat. I started dating this new guy about two weeks later and I was posting pictures of me and this new guy on Snapchat. My ‚Äúex‚Äù threw an absolute temper tantrum. He texted me right away claiming this guy is probably using me for my apartment, posted multiple stories on Snapchat freaking out the same day. One said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how people can just move on from one person to another‚Äù another one said shortly after ‚ÄúI need someone to spoil‚Äù when he told me 100+ times he doesn‚Äôt want to date anybody. He apologized to me a week later saying he was sorry for his reaction and he hopes this guy makes me happy. I probably should‚Äôve blocked him at that point but I just didn‚Äôt really care and kind of forgot about him and I have been dating this new guy for about 4 months and was focusing on that. My ‚Äúex‚Äù texted me about a week ago asking me when I can come get my stuff because I have a lot of stuff there. I was like ‚Äúokay I can come get it today or tomorrow‚Äù and he told me for sure everything was cool and to let him know. I planned to just grab it real quick, leave, and delete him.

767,t3_r0ivxv,Started watching Shrill on Hulu and one of the main characters is a LVM.,"The main character Annie is a plus size woman and she is 'dating' a man named Ryan (Who is just using her for sex) He hides her from his friends because she is fat. He never takes her out anywhere, because he doesn't want to be seen with a fat woman. He makes her enter the back door only so no one sees her. To leave and enter she has to jump over a chain link fence surrounded by shrubs and bushes. (Also Ryan lives with his mom and uses her car to go places. He has a part time job at a hardware store but he misses too many shifts so he get fired.)

Annie starts leveling up and goes through a transformation where she values herself. She breaks up with Ryan. This is great. Until he comes back groveling. Then she takes him back. Big mistake. Then he continues to be a disappointment.

Annie and Ryan go on a real date at a restaurant, his lvm friends show up and ruin it. And Ryan does nothing to stop them. He contributes to them ruining everything.

Annie has a work/social event and invites Ryan as her date. He doesn't show up because he 'put the wrong date on the calendar'. 

He takes Annie camping in the woods. Without a tent, food, or any supplies.

Annie's friends tell her, Ryan is a LVM and to dump him. But she keeps giving him second chances. Ugh

I hope eventually, Annie wises up and dumps Ryan for good.

(By the way, I've read the handbook, I know plus size women really shouldn't be dating instead they should be focused on leveling up to become HVW.

As a plus sized gal, I agree with this, I just like coming to this sub because I find it very inspirational. I'm trying to level up and become a fds queen.

Also Shrill is a great show about a plus sized gal recognizing her worth and leveling up in other aspects of her life. I just hate Ryan, so much)",126.0
768,t3_r0hfbd,A refusal to engage: How I came to terms with the reality of porn,"I was inspired by the recent post about the PREGNANT woman finding her LV husband's porn collection.

I grew up in a very conservative household. I knew about sex but didn't know what porn was until I got to college. I remember being confused and weirded out because I didn't understand what the purpose of porn was. Why would I stay at home and watch a video of someone eating a nice cake when there was a bakery right down the street? I can literally go get a cake and enjoy it myself in real life???? I found the concept of sitting alone and masturbating to a video of strangers having sex absurd and kind of pathetic.

Fast forward to me entering the dating world and speaking to men and finding out the prevalence of pornsickness. I am horrified and simultaneously heartbroken.

I meet my ex and he says that he watches porn sparingly (read: a lot). He describes porn scenarios to me, wanting me to perform like a porn actress, etc. etc. etc. and I just take in all of this like a deer in the headlights of a semi truck. He brought up porn way too much. I never had sex with him (waiting for marriage) and I am so glad.

After breaking up with him and finding FDS my eyes opened even more. I followed FDS guidelines recently to block and delete a guy I was talking to. To no one's surprise, he watched violent porn.

Porn use in men is common, and men who aren't porn-diseased are rare. I have come to terms with this and am ok with being single if my only other option is a man whose dopamine receptors are so fucked that he's hotwired his own brain to prefer sexual gratification from a screen and his hand over a real woman. I'm not trying to set myself up for self-esteem issues that will exacerbate disordered eating and add to depression.

I thought that if I looked like a digitally/surgically-altered porn actress that my ex wouldn't want to watch porn anymore. Which was false, as no amount of visual perfection can ever satisfy a pornsick man. It's like trying to fill up a pasta strainer with water. You can't.

So, as my opening statement says, I refuse to engage with pornsick men. I won't argue, plead, or be gaslit into thinking I need to ""work on my insecurities"" regarding porn. I won't be bullied into thinking it's worse to be single than to be with a man who isn't sexually committed. I deserve to be with a man who is thrilled by the thought of having beautiful, natural, loving sex with me someday.

769,t3_r0gz9v,Another negging tactic: Men asking your interests then telling you how they dislike them,"I've recently cut off a couple of men who've done this. It irritates the hell out of me and is an immediate red flag as far as I'm concerned. The conversations went something like this:

Him: ""What kind of music are you into?""

Me: ""Oh I like indie rock, r&amp;b, house music.""

Him: ""Ugh, I don't like house music at all. Can't get into it.""

Meanwhile, I'm thinking ""*Bitch, did I ask you what your opinion is on the music I like?*"". The other convo was from yesterday, where a man asked me the following:

Him: ""What's the best country you've visited so far?""

Me: ""Portugal. It's such a beautiful country with warm, laid-back people. Had a really wonderful time there.""

Him:""...Really? That's... Interesting. I mean I heard it's nice I guess but I've never had any desire to visit.""

What is the point of asking me my interests if you're going to put them down? They think they're being subtle, and some ladies may not read into their responses much but don't fall for the okeydoke. The moment a man asks me what I'm into and has what I feel is a shady response, he gets an immediate block. 

IMO even if a man isn't 100% into your interests, a HVM would never put them down, and if anything responds with intrigue or even asks more questions to get a deeper understanding of them, which helps him get to know you better. Don't let loser NVM neg you like this!",1175.0

He started saying I would love to take you to dinner sometime and mentioned how they have an amazing New York strip with great sides and an awesome desert menu. I chimed in that I love steak and enjoy that part of town. I figured he was going to ask me out there for a date, but as soon as I started saying that I love steak and that part of town, he almost sounded surprised and thrown off. he immediately then started saying how it's actually not that good at all, there are better places, and he actually doesn't like it there that much, and then complained at the prices again (all unprompted, I never mentioned price / finances with men)

I couldn't get a word in, and he continued on saying that it's not that expensive. I made it sound like a question when I squeaked in ""okay?"" and then he continued to trash talk the restaurant that he was just hyping up to me. I said laughing, ""you were just saying it was great and now you're trash talking it, you seem confused."" he got tongue tied and quickly had to go, ending the call.

he did not end up asking me out there, or at all.

I wanted to put it up here to warn all of you that whatever that stunt was, it was a red flag and definitely LV. if you find yourself in a similar situation, do NOT be mentioning or suggesting other places, don't be talking about the price do not acknowledge cost at all, just simply say okay and get going. whatever he had up his sleeve was not good.",970.0

My boyfriend is an amazing guy, but grew up in a super religious household. He‚Äôs 27, lives on his own, and his father constantly makes remarks about him spending the night at my house. His father has incredibly strict standards and beliefs on premarital sex, to the point where it‚Äôs had lasting impacts on my boyfriend‚Äôs sex life (lots of trauma, guilt, shame surrounding sex). We‚Äôve worked through a lot of it. When his father first found out my boyfriend was spending the night at my place he tried to have my boyfriend excommunicate himself from their church‚Äîwhich my boyfriend hasn‚Äôt attended in years. His father is relatively kind to my face, but behind my back will make comments to my boyfriend basically implying that I‚Äôm a whore. I‚Äôm a 30-year-old grown woman with a graduate degree, a great job, I pay all of my own bills, I take care of myself. Any father would be pleased to have me as a daughter-in-law. I‚Äôve gone to church with his parents, prayed with them before dinner, read religious books his mother sent me. They‚Äôre ultimately kind people and I have tried to remain open-minded.

I was never close to my biological father. My stepfather, who was like a Dad to me, passed suddenly this October. Due to my job and prior to that, being abroad or away at graduate school, I haven‚Äôt been home for Thanksgiving in years. My boyfriend invited me to his parents‚Äô house, along with his two other brothers, one of their girlfriends, and some family friends.

All was well until tonight when his father made some off-hand comment about him staying with me for the holiday. We‚Äôre semi-long distance due to work obligations at the moment. It made me feel shitty, and I basically commented ‚ÄúBabe your parents are great people but it‚Äôs hard for me to be around people who basically think I‚Äôm a whore.‚Äù He basically didn‚Äôt have a thoughtful response. He acknowledged the shittiness of the situation and apologized, but I got angry. For one, there‚Äôs a double-standard. The parents adore his brother‚Äôs girlfriend, and are delusional enough to believe that they‚Äôre both virgins despite recently returning from a vacation together. I feel like I‚Äôm competing against an impossible standard because his parents are aware we‚Äôve had sex and clearly hold it against me. I told my boyfriend I‚Äôm not really comfortable spending Thanksgiving with his father, especially when I know he doesn‚Äôt like me, views me as promiscuous, and I am overall just sensitive about the fact that I just lost my own father, who if he were alive, would probably lose his shit over this man‚Äôs treatment and behavior towards me.

784,t3_qztgnt,Have you recently met any man who was actually willing to wait to have sex with you under YOUR TERMS?,"I write this in a state of disappointment and exhaustion. At least in my area, it seems impossible to actually meet a man who will agree to respect my boundaries. My boundaries actually are: I will not follow any stupid 3 date rule to have sex. I will only have sex in a committed, exclusive relationship. I don't want to take part in any kind of weird sex rotation men are performing.I don't want to have sex soon because I know I can get very emotionally attached and vulnerable. I fall in love very hard with the guy. I don't want to get my heart broken multiple times. I don't want to feel devalued or used like a sex doll only to be mercilessly discarded afterwards. I don't want to give them my honest attention, my support, my tenderness and my time only to be used like an object and then forgotten. Edit to add: and no, I'm not a prude. I kiss them, I have heavy makeout sessions with them. I just tell them I need to feel safe before having sex. I need to know where I'm going before taking such a big jump. 

So what's been happening to this is that: guys tell me I'm gorgeous, they want to meet me, we go out on dates, some of them usually pull the ""long game"", with future faking, love bombing at etc. Some others are more subtle and don't do these kind of things. But in all cases, sooner or later it comes to a point in which they ask me when sex will finally happen and I feel pressured and turned off. I tell them I'd only do it if I felt safe enough. Sometimes if they keep pressuring me I tell them I only do it in a committed, exclusive relationship. Inevitably, sooner or later, they either ghost me or fade away. So it always makes me wonder if my personality is shitty enough because I'm incapable of making a guy stay with me even when sex is temporarily out of the table. It makes me feel old-fashioned, excluded, misfit. 

And I wonder... Do you know any man who was actually willing to wait? Who actually respected your boundaries!? I'm not gonna lie, I've never met any. I live in a very sexually liberated country and honestly Sometimes I feel I'll never meet a guy who'll actually want to truly get to know me for who I am.

787,t3_qzq7v6,Is This A Case of Too Good to Be True?,"I met a guy last year. He's around the same age as I am (late 20s). He has a reallyyy nice car (SUV Cadillac) and his dad has a huge distribution company that he works at as a director. When we were talking he was saying how much he would like for his future wife to work with him side by side. And he's from quite a religious background, so he seems really serious about this.

A couple of red flags I noticed, though:

1. During one of our first conversations he asked me what I look for in a guy, or what I find really important. I said I don't really look for anything, but it's important to me that he doesn't have a short temper and gets upset at little things. He then tries to justify how it's okay or normal for men to get angry sometimes. I'm sorry. I would have to disagree with that. I have never had the urge to yell or scream at someone. It's one thing to argue, or take a time-off from each other, but it's another thing to get angry. He kept arguing with me for a good twenty minutes trying to justify ""angry"" behavior.
2. When talking about his ex he basically they were engaged, but she called off the wedding and is now a working girl, aka a prostitute, at a club. For some reason I didn't like hearing this. I don't know why. It felt like TMI in the moment, like wtf? Why are you telling me this?
3. He got clingy and started messaging me a lot. When I didn't respond frequently, he sent a text that said ""I hate you"" (childish). When I took that seriously and decided to end the thing, he later claimed to be joking.

I'll be honest. Normally, when looking from an outsider's viewpoint in, I can tell right away when you should be walking away from a guy. It's a lot harder when you are in the middle of it. I legit don't know. So I'm asking you ladies, do these red flags raise enough concern to walk away?

788,t3_qzpozq,Supporting Systems of the Patriarchy,"I cross-posted this on our political sub- go check it out too!

I've been listening to Andrea Dworkin's 'Last Days at Hot Slit' and she makes some compelling points early on that I wanted to share and discuss here: women express all the coping mechanisms of an oppressed class, yet few acknowledge that they are oppressed.

All systems under a patriarchy are patriarchal. All patriarchal systems operate under a strict heirarchy- that you are above someone else. Economic, political, and social systems in place are all to enhance male power at the expense of women. This is seen economically by women's labor being systematically devalued, reproductive energy expected and yet unsupported by the community at large, and unending beauty standards that inextricably indoctrinate women to tolerate pain- that no price to pay is too high to be beautiful. 

In a larger sense, conditioning women to accept pain has allowed men to use women as surrogates to circumvent their coming of age. Historically when a boy becomes a man, he must go into isolation, face trials and tribulations, and come back with a scar or mark that proves he successfully navigated the world and has joined the ranks of men. However NVM and LVM push the coming of age journey onto the women they encounter. They never spend time in isolation, forming their ideals and morals of adulthood. They bring a woman along, and force her to undergo the trials, and often torture they wish to avoid. They brand women, beat women, and use and abuse women to avoid their own reckoning. By forcing a woman to surrogate his journey to manhood- he does one of two things: he avoids ever becoming a man and will perpetuate the cycle indefinitely, and he sets himself on top of the heirarchy (unearned) where he enforces the pain and subjugation of the women. I say the women, because these men will continue to use a woman until she is spent (dead or limping away). This cycle of perpetual sadomasochism men inflict on women is as old as the patriarchy itself- and can be tied back to the historical meaning of rape. 

Rape in its original meaning is to take by force and run off with the goods. This ties back to how women have been seen as chattel, and only capable of being stolen from the man who has current ownership of her. And it's how marital rape has been legal for so long- you cannot steal what you already own. You can liken rape to the theft of a cow- except the punishment for rape can include the woman, whereas a cow isn't killed by the owner for being stolen once/if it's returned. This to me shows that men have always known women to be capable of throught- whether they view it as infantile, or as a loyal dog obeys- they know that women have functioning brains. Why else would they punish them for not having cried out, or fought off their rapist?

Men have stolen from women since patriarchy gave them the pass to do so. Patriarchy in its basest form, is men stealing from women. How do our current systems continue to steal from women? 

Economically this manifests in the pink tax, the wage gap, and 'women centric' fields, lack of child support

Socially this manifests as disdain for single moms, conflict between mother's and daughters from mother's enforcing patriarchal standards on their daughters (acknowledged or not, we have all internalized patriarchal principles), and boys being perceived as easier to raise or preferred children. And women being bullied and harrassed if they speak out in anything other than support for patriarchal (read: supported by men) ideals.

Politically this manifests as women's body's -not as a political battleground, but as a political statement. To have a woman's body is to be an object of negotiation- an item to barter over policy. 

What other ways does this manifest? How can we watch for political figures to decide how they see women? I've noticed that most liberal men push for high level social programs that will also benefit them, not for social programs to benefit the most vulnerable in society - women, children, the homeless etc. This argument for free tuition is a band aid to distract the privileged from trying to raise up those disenfranchised in their communities. And it also destabilizes and deflates the currency to make other social programs that rely on $$ to be worth less either in the pool of funding, or in the met supply of currency available to pay for the goods/services (inflation). Inflation is an economic policy in itself. And economics are one tool of the patriarchy.",120.0

But since fds I decided to just match his energy he would give me low effort conversation and I would respond with the same level of effort.

And you know what I discovered these dudes would get weird as hell about it they would sometimes get angry I had one guy who sarcastically told me "" I must not be interested"" like bro you hit me up and then gave me nothing it really made me see how so many men especially on OLD want you to be the chaser they want YOU to pursue them and put in all the effort and when you match their energy they don't like that. 

Like this probably isn't revolutionary to anyone else here but seeing it firsthand was kinda crazy to me and it reminded me of an old ex I had at 22 who dumped me out of the blue one day because I was ""too boring"" for him but he was boring as hell too I didn't realize I was even supposed to be his entertainment and its not like he entertained me.

I need to fucking rant somewhere and I need a safe woman space to vent and be understood.
Also it's not that I'm just here screaming. 
I'm fully aware of my own actions and behaviors and I'm really working on it.

BUT that doesn't mean that I'm not angry.

I'm so fucking angry, livid, pissed off and sad that I've let myself crossed my own fucking boundaries. That I even have to feel this shit. That I've been gaslit and lured into dating a LVM/NVM male AGAIN. That I have to be on guard when dating. That I have to look out for signs and everything. It's so fucked up that this even is a thing?! That patriarchy is a fucking thing. That we as women, are basically never safe and not a single soul fucking cares (so it seems to be sometimes).

It did showed me that I have a lot of inner work to do because I really feel that I'm (and with me sadly a lot of women) so conditioned into this state of pleasing and serving that it almost sickens me, I'm taking that full responsibility, I'm in therapy for it.

799,t3_qz97g3,Study suggests female leadership will thrive as companies become more socially responsible,"There's a clich√© that women aren't as competitive as men and that's why there is a wage gap. Well, a new study shows that isn't true -- but the conditions of the competition have to be different. 

""Researchers found that women enter competitions at the same rate as men -- when they have the option to share their winnings with the losers,"" an overview explained.

""Women might be more attracted to positions where there is this social component that isn't there in more traditional, incentive-based firms where it's all about CEO bonuses,"" noted Mary L. Rigdon, associate director of the UArizona Center for the Philosophy of Freedom, who helped conduct the study.

It seems as if a lot of corporations are beginning to take that social component seriously, and I am very ready for the next gen of female leadership this shift will hopefully produce!

800,t3_qzixjz,There is no peaceful slavery," I saw a meme recently on ‚Äúdangerous freedom or peaceful slavery‚Äù and my reaction was: if you think those are the choices, then you don't know slavery.   

  
  I've seen what I think is a similar idea on the FDS forum ‚Äì the statement that ‚Äúabuse always escalates‚Äù, which is certainly true, and I wanted to reinforce that point from my experience, so that hopefully some other women can get to learn in theory rather than in practice.   

  
  I remember the moment I understood it ‚Äì it was more than ten years ago, I was in my twenties, and at this point I had spent at least 70% of my life in abusive situations of various kinds. It hit me all at once, and the way it came to me was: 

  
  It doesn't matter what someone threatens to you if you don't obey ‚Äì if you do obey, they'll do it anyway. 

  
  To give an overly simplified example: if a guy says: ‚Äúdo \_\_\_\_\_\_ or I'll beat you up‚Äù, then he's going to beat you up no matter what you do. The difference is that if you refuse, he'll beat you up now, but if you obey, then he'll beat you up later ‚Äì after having harassed and terrorized you, and when he does, then *you'll hate yourself, because you helped him abuse you*. 

  
  This might not seem like a big difference to someone who's never been in these kinds of situations, but my own experience was: abuse when you trust yourself and stand your ground is stressful and damaging, but nothing close to abuse you allow. Abuse you allow ‚Äì by participating in in any way, including trying to placate the abuser ‚Äì will suck your soul and the taste for life out of you. Abuse you resist will make a nervous wreck out of you, but abuse you allow will make you into an empty shell of a person. 

  
  Obviously, all abuse is bad, and of course there are situations where resisting might cost you your life, but I think that you can spare yourself the worst by drawing an internal one, if not an external one ‚Äì like keeping in mind that this isn't normal, that they are lying, that what they're doing to you is wrong no matter whit bullshit they say or force you to do. For some reason, I've found that abusers always try to convince you that their actions are your fault, and it makes a huge difference whether they succeed or not. 

  
  Anyway be safe, sisters. I do think that the world is changing, but the old power structures are flailing before they die, and we might not have seen the worst of it yet; that doesn't mean that things aren't going to get better over the long run. I think that within two or three generations, we're probably going to see a world that is very different, where women might not even be able to imagine our situation now. I hope so anyway.",253.0

I came across this video on Youtube. It's a sick animal-cruelty video where a little white dog is barking in a tiger's face. The tiger then proceeds to bite him in the neck, followed by a lot of yelping from the dog. I'm more careful about these TikTok's on Youtube from now on because I don't like seeing that stuff. I don't know why its seeps through. I will not post the video here either.

Anyway, as I was reading the comments a lot of people were rightfully sickened by the video, but there were a lot of scrotes laughing about it saying stuff like ""that's what you get"" or even comparing it to a woman hitting a man and the man hitting her back hard. I've also seen countless videos on Youtube where a woman would hit a man, and the man hits her back with a ton of force. Even if she gave him a slight tap or push, or even if she seemed to be under the influence of alcohol. The comment section would be full of people laughing at her. It's fucked up.

Almost immediately, he ‚Äúheart eyes‚Äù a selfie that I had posted earlier that day on my story. Then sends the fire/flame emoji. I just ignored it. A few hours later he slides into my DM‚Äôs asking if I remember him. I go to take a look at his profile because I remember he was quite attractive. But then I see not only is he MARRIED, but he has a baby due this month‚Ä¶I felt so icky even though I hadn‚Äôt at all engaged back with him.

There is zero innocent explanation for this, even if he hadn't sent those emojis. A married man should never be private messaging another female, period. 

My conclusion is that he most likely does this type of shit often and assumes there‚Äôs no point in trying to hide his marriage/family.  And that he probably misses being single and gets a sick ego boost off of flirting with other women (emotional cheating), even if things never get physical. 
This kind of fuckery makes me wonder if I will ever be able to trust a man. Obviously I don‚Äôt know for sure, but I would be willing to bet his wife has no idea.

*Men are asking you for coffee because they want a cheap and easy lay.*

There is no other reason on their end.

This scenario is a lose-lose and why you never accept coffee/drink dates. Imagine being a man and getting to take out a woman for the price of a short drive and two coffees. What makes you think he‚Äôll decide to step it up and start asking you on real dates in the future?

Men are nothing without female attention and they are desperate for it.

Edited to add: the psychology of men like this is they see a woman they want and they know that they can't have her (because they're ugly, fat, old, misogynistic abusers with bad personalities etc.) so they decide they hate her. Then that they want to get back at her for not being able to fuck them and take what they want.

820,t3_qykyje,(TW) Incredible book: The Tragedy of Heterosexuality by Jane Ward," Someone recommended this book on FLUS. I‚Äôm about one third through and it‚Äôs amazing. The author analyzes straight culture and how it is harmful to straight women. 

Here are some notes from what I‚Äôve read so far.

The author talks about how, historically, white men were in power and women were subordinate. Women were often sold, raped and used for their labors. At some point someone decided it would be better \[for white power\] for men and women to try to like each other. So this switch from ‚Äúwoman-as-degraded-subordinate to women-of-worthy-deep-love‚Äù has been very rocky. That is where the author starts.

Men and women didn‚Äôt like each other. They had little to nothing in common. They didn‚Äôt find each other attractive. Quite the contrary, they were repulsed by each other. Men cared more about getting the esteem of other men, than loving a woman. So much so that a whole propaganda started to try to have men and women be together. Early on, pamphlets were given out to help both men and women, to improve their attractiveness (such as hygiene), in hopes that they‚Äôd like each other. 

It very quickly switched to all of the responsibility for the heterosexuality-repair to be put on the woman. And propaganda, from books to tv shows and movies, pushed that. 

‚ÄúIn sum, midcentury representations of marriage doubled down on earlier themes of opposite-sex disinterest and resentment by suggesting to women that not only their bodies but also their personalities needed to be carefully managed in order to produce happy heterosexuality. As experts elaborated their expectations of the good wife, women‚Äôs submission and self-sacrifice became central ingredients of straight culture, with women warned about what they must give up in order to ‚Äúkeep their men‚Äù (\[‚Ä¶\] their jobs and interests, their desire for adult conversation, their selfhood). Straight culture was also marked by men‚Äôs fragility and irritation, their pervasive sense of burden, loss and entrapment. \[‚Ä¶\] Advertisers learned to capitalize on heterosexual tragedy by creating ads that played on men‚Äôs desire for freedom and power over women and women‚Äôs desire to be attractive and interesting to their husbands.‚Äù

The author recognized that ‚Äúmillions of women had become addicted to unstable, immature, angry, cold, and abusive men‚Äù after Women Who Love Too Much by Robin Norwood became a best-seller. 

The casual sex era was ‚Äúone way of managing the disappointment of heterosexuality.‚Äù 

The author also talks about how men actually hate women. The violence and coercion perpetrated towards women. The struggle for men to see a women‚Äôs personhood. And the false narrative of what love is (from a man to a woman) that propaganda has pushed on us to strive for. 

There‚Äôs much more but I couldn‚Äôt quote everything. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",259.0

822,t3_qyjfnt,"Tech Boss, Venture Capitalist Michael Goguen Kept a Spreadsheet of 5000 Women He Slept With","Goguen, a billionaire venture capitalist in big tech, kept women for sex in secret houses throughout Nevada and California according to a recent lawsuit filed in Montana. Some of the women stated in the lawsuit brought against Goguen that he would make them strip in various houses bought by his security staff. Four employees of Goguen's also provided statements for the lawsuit, including that one of his businesses had a basement ""boom boom"" room for women to be sexually assaulted. 

Goguen dabbled in tech investment due to his background in electrical engineering in the 1990s. His first wife, who gave him his first (and only children) followed him to California from Massachusetts to help him with his career. They divorced in 1999 and he married his second wife in 2000. In 2014, one of the women Goguen had been sleeping with, exotic dancer / waitress Amber Baptiste, filed a claim against Goguen claiming he had given her HPV. She received $10 million in restitution from Goguen, who was worried she would discuss his many affairs not to his wife, but to his business associates in Montana and California. Baptiste is a problematic figure here because she made the entire thing up - she did not have HPV and Goguen did not give her any STDs.

However, Goguen's nefarious activities at work and beyond have merit. He handed one of his employees $1200 after groping her and giving her alcohol and cocaine. He had her sign an NDA afterwards. His security staff claim that Goguen asked them to purchase residences so women could stirp for Goguen without others knowing. One security enforcer of Goguen claims Goguen asked him to participate in paramilitary expeditions in Mexico related to drug running across the U.S. / Mexico border. 

LADIES it is important to remember:

* Material wealth is NOT spiritual / emotional wealth. Goguen is a billionaire, but that does not mean he should have the female attention he did / does.
* For many men, women are objects to keep enumerated on an Excel spreadsheet as Goguen did. Be aware! 
* If you speak out, you may be helping women down the line. If Baptiste had not spoken out against Goguen in 2014, would other women have had the courage to in 2021 (again I know Baptiste made up a lot of stuff)? 
* Inappropriate activity can happen anywhere. Workplaces are not safe from inappropriate activity.

824,t3_qyhprm,"""Do not underestimate the obsession of a bruised ego.""","u/HermiticalyKermit wrote a [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/qx0q8n/safety_tips_for_internet/) the other day about internet safety. I want to magnify one thing in particular that she said:

# Do not underestimate the obsession of a bruised ego.

I read a lot about true crime, and one trope I've seen several times is that almost all homicides can be tied to three motives: love, money, or **pride**.

A lot of you probably remember my recent post about the perks of having sex wherein the man doesn't orgasm. Even with DMs off, you can imagine the vitriol thrown around over that -- I would get notifications from men trying to comment and could see what they wrote before the auto-filter pulled them. One scrote wrote about how *he* used that same strategy to make lots of women fall in love with him before dumping them ""to get back at them for being sl\*ts in college"" and for ""being so terrible"" to him. He had linked his YouTube channel in his Reddit profile. Naturally, he looked like a blobfish.

I was *so tempted* to edit my post so we could all laugh at the kind of ugly shitheads who love to hate women. But my better judgment took over -- what if he lashed out? *Do not underestimate the obsession of a bruised ego.* Men fear that women will laugh at them. Women fear that men will kill them. Do not risk being stalked, harassed, and/or physically endangered because you felt the need to put a man in his place. *It's not worth it. It is not worth risking your safety.*

This is also why block and delete is so effective. If you don't exist to them--if they know you simply aren't getting their messages (rather than reading them and ignoring them, which hurts their egos)--it keeps you safer.

It also gives scrotes power when we engage them. Acknowledging their stupidity and clapping back gives weight to their words and actions. Who the fuck cares what they say? It's not our job to try to change them. We're all here so we can learn to spot them from a mile away and *avoid them*. Floating above their shit clouds is much easier psychologically and safer physically.

827,t3_qydv8q,Generalizations aren't wrong.,"One of the biggest criticisms for this group is that it ""generalizes all men and should be banned.""

Besides the fact that generalizations aren't illegal or a TOS violation (else the entire manosphere would also be in trouble), it shows a gross misunderstanding of what a generalization is.

Generalizations do NOT mean ""every person in this given demographic will behave this way without fail."" When FDS users talk about men we know damn well it isn't referring to every man in the universe. If that were so, FDS wouldn't exist because there would be no HVM to pursue.

Generalizations ACTUALLY mean ""this is a behavior observed in a large share of the given demographic."" Of course there will be exceptions, we're talking about nearly 4 billion people.

Let's use short men as an example. I could say something like, ""short men generally act with a chip on their shoulder about their height and it hurts their dating prospects."" That would be a generalization. Am I saying every single short man acts this way? Of course not. I happen to be related to a few short men who don't do this, and they have no problems getting dates. But they also aren't blowing up the DMs of random women to insult them.

If you want to see generalizations about women's behavior, feel free to browse any manosphere sub! (Or don't. Or follow it up with some puppy pictures to cheer you up)

Generalizations are a form of pattern recognition. We as humans are really good at recognizing patterns because it's how we've survived for thousands of years. Don't let some Apex Redditor tell you that noticing common male behavior in 2021 is hate speech, especially when it's your safety on the line. They only think we're talking about every man in existence because 1) they are exactly what you've described, and 2) they've convinced themselves that they're normal to avoid any accountability.

If you haven't already, look up Gavin DeBecker's *The Book of Fear*. It makes a strong case for your intuition and recognizing behavioral patterns.",285.0

829,t3_qybgkb,Do not date men who are ‚Äúseparated‚Äù.,"I would strongly encourage women to avoid getting involved with men who claim to be separated from the spouse. Firstly, monkey branching to the next relationship before the previous one is formally dissolved is low value behaviour. If you get into a relationship with a man who is separated, you will have to accept the fact that he is still legally married to someone else. Divorce can be extremely stressful and expensive, and you do not want to be caught up in any drama. A HV man will have made sure that any previous relationship ties, including a marriage certificate, are fully severed before trying to court you. 

Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, men lie about their relationship status. A man once tried to approach me in a nightclub by claiming that he and his wife had separated. Once he had a few more drinks it then slipped out that they were ‚Äúseparated, but still living together.‚Äù After a few more drinks, he admitted that he was still in a relationship, it‚Äôs just they were going through a ‚Äúrough patch‚Äù. Essentially, he wanted to cheat on his spouse and he thought the ‚ÄúI am separated‚Äù line would work on me. Separation to men can mean anything from the divorce papers are being signed tomorrow to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking to cheat on my wife, but I‚Äôll lie to you and say that we are separated so you‚Äôll stick around and I can have my cake and eat it.‚Äù 

We all know that low value men often don‚Äôt know what to do with themselves at the end of a relationship, so they‚Äôll seek out their next victim as soon as possible, even if the previous one isn‚Äôt officially over. Don‚Äôt get caught in the separation lie. Only date men who are actually single and emotionally available.",614.0

May I add also that a HVM recognise a HVW by sensing she won't fall for the bare minimum. You will never attract a HVM if you don't value yourself or respect yourself because a HVM won't be attracted to you if that is the case.

831,t3_qyacfy,"Life hack: üí°Yes, there is a time and a place to ‚Äútake things personally‚Äù.üí°","
The adage ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take things personally‚Äù is frequently New Age gaslighting.  If your feelings are indicating to you that something is making you feel bad, maybe lean back and reflect why?


It could be that:

A.  Something is being triggered for you that has little to do with the other person.  But if they are having a bad day at work, it isn‚Äôt your responsibility to be nice to their rudeness.  Acting like a doormat makes them think it is ok.  Match energy, ignore or do grey rock.  Do not ‚Äúkill them with kindness‚Äù.

B.  This person generates these feelings within you and is someone to keep at bay.  It does NOT matter if they have ‚Äúgood intentions‚Äù.ü§¢

For women and traditionally oppressed groups, it is B more often than acknowledged.  There is a reason these groups have more instances of depression, high blood pressure, etc‚Ä¶because they are conditioned to accept maltreatment, suppress feelings and to gaslight themselves about their own experiences.

Now I take most things personally and I ‚ù§Ô∏è my life.ü§£. The people that are in it know that I‚Äôm a sensitive person and choose not to piss me off.  They also don‚Äôt act like I‚Äôm ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù for having bare minimum expectations of them.  

As a generalization, the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt expect people to read your mind‚Äù crowd are lazy and/or have low standards for their own relationships.  Eg‚Ä¶, If you cannot anticipate that a friend needs a phone call because their mom got diagnosed with cancer, you are a shitty friend.

üí°The behavior you tolerate is the behavior you replicate.  Internalized misogyny is a thing because women who don‚Äôt push back, punch down on other women.  And notice how when a friend tolerates nonsense from other people, sometimes they will expect you to accept that behavior from them or in your own life.  ‚ÄúKevin cheated on me and look how happy we are now!‚Äù  Um, okayüëÄ",277.0

But I started thinking about the pressure society often puts on women to *look* emotionally unaffected by a breakup and not come off as angry even when we have right to be.

Yes, it‚Äôs true that you shouldn‚Äôt even bother paragraphing people from casual dating or short casual relationships but if you‚Äôve been in a relationship with a person 1 year+ and were betrayed, humiliated, cheated on, disrespected openly etc. You have every right to let them know. And I‚Äôm kinda annoyed by the societal pressure from both ends male and female that you must never show anger about it, tell them off etc. We don‚Äôt have an obligation to ‚Äúgo gently into that good night‚Äù

Yeah sure leave. But in relationships where there was investment and then significant disrespect and betrayal (not saying this applies to adele‚Äôs) you have every right to be open in your anger or indignation about it. You don‚Äôt have an obligation to take all the knocks and disrespect quietly or as if they never happened, to seem dignified or like you‚Äôre handling the breakup in the ‚Äúproper‚Äù way and I feel the societal pressure to do so is another form of misogyny and letting men off the hook.

I‚Äôm tired of seeing celeb and even unfamous women in everyday life try to model this kind of non chalance and unaffectedness over disrespect, just so as not to look over affected or upset. And I‚Äôm glad taylor speaks out and expresses her anger where she sees fit.

Just some thoughts. I‚Äôm not saying your expressing anger will change anything. But you damn sure have a right to do it in relationships that lasted all 3+ years where you find out he was cheating or disrespecting you. There‚Äôs this very sanctimonious tone of ‚Äúwell if you‚Äôre getting upset you‚Äôre just letting him know he got to you/ controls you‚Äù and I‚Äôve never agreed with it. It‚Äôs ok to let him know he‚Äôs a clown or a punk. No he won‚Äôt change by hearing it from you but sometimes for your self respect and dignity you don‚Äôt leave with him thinking he got one over on you either.

It‚Äôs especially annoying and lame to me when it comes from other women, this pressure to keep up appearances even after having been mistreated- to whos benefit? Usually always the man‚Äôs

There are certain elements of disrespect within a long term relationship that even if you intend to leave them- shouldn‚Äôt just slide under the radar or go unanswered and that‚Äôs not because you hope to change them it‚Äôs for YOU and your self respect. Not having to leave feeling like a fucking punk who just took meek and mealy mouthed whatever was dished and for you also not to be seen by them and others in that light

We talk about keeping your self respect by not sending paragraphs or arguing. But it can be just as damaging to your self respect if you have to look at something as having ended without your ever have had the courage to speak up and say loudly- this is wrong or I don‚Äôt/ never liked this, etc. If you have to slink off with them thinking they still got over on you in someway- in the sense that they still got to pull bs undetected having manipulated you into being too afraid of how it looks or too concerned with social constraints to speak out.

It‚Äôs still giving them a win and they know that.

There really are some situations where it‚Äôs vital to your self respect and dignity to let a person have it and doing otherwise is basically punk shit

Especially if you have an introverted personality or a personality that looks weak and mild. People are already apt to read your walking away as cowardice or fear of speaking out, a form of shrinking and slinking away- and sometimes it‚Äôs necessary, better to show plainly that it‚Äôs not.

Another thing I deeply hate is when a man was cheating and doing the most and the relationship ends and everyone praises the woman, for never speaking poorly about him in public. Being classy. Never disparaging him etc. Yeah, ok she can do that if she want but she doesn‚Äôt have the *obligation* to protect his image by doing that. If he was a lying pig who fucked everything that walks and she speaks plainly the truth of what happened on that- she shouldn‚Äôt be viewed trashy or tactless for saying it. Or like she‚Äôs being a bitch or trashing him by simply telling the truth of what transpired in plain open terms.

The argument can be made if you‚Äôre trying to act stoic just to seem a certain way to him long after the relationship has ended. He‚Äôs still controlling you and thats a form of weakness too. But that argument seems to only ever be applied to expressions of anger which really may actually just boil down to you being true to you and finally doing what you want to do

835,t3_qy5scd,Male friends and brothers will 'pity' my bf,"Not sure if correct flair for this. I've started dating someone new and followed FDS closely as possible. We've been dating 6 months so this isn't a HVM man story by any means. No love bombing either. Just something I've noticed.

It's simply that my new man cares about me, prioritizes my well being, my health. He often does above the bare minimum and boy oh boy, do a lot of men in my life have opinions on it. Yes, I still have some male friends. (I know, I know) 

I've gotten quite a bit of comments from them and my brothers. Things like 'I pity him', 'simp', 'I'm so glad I don't have a gf', or 'I'm unbelievable'. 

It was rubbing me the wrong way which tells me I'm doing something right ü§™

Most of these comments are made when they find out he pays for almost everything, when he will travel 30 min -1hr to bring me a jacket bc it dropped 20 degrees F¬∞ and I'm outside all day, or if I'm sick and he takes care of me, or bringing me to a wedding bc I don't feel comfortable dressed up taking public transport by myself

Let me make clear, he's a grown man who chooses to do these things for me and is very happy to do these things. Sometimes it makes me feel spoiled but most of all, it makes me feel seen and cared for which is how you should feel in a relationship!!!

Edit: this got further then I thought. To clarify, I don't really hang around these guys much anymore. As for the brothers, they'll still be there.

His priority is the love, respect and adoration of his fellow bro. Any bro at all, even a rapist or abuser bro can validate this guy's bro-ness. His self-esteem and self-image is external to his self, he gets these needs met from his bros. 

Some recent examples from the sub: the husband who allowed the worker to sniff his wife's underwear and just made him coffee. Didn't kick him out. Didn't report it to the company who employs this dangerous creep. Didn't worry about his wife safety or any other woman's safety. But he did post about it on social media to laugh at this guy with his fellow bros. Zero thought to how this guy is a predator. The bros all agree: it's just a funny story about a weird, sad guy. 

Example number two: the man who ruined the wedding day for his new wife. When asked if he would take her as his wife during the ceremony he stopped the proceedings to have a huddle with his bros. They pretended to publicly assess her worthiness in front of everybody while everyone laughed. Then they pretended to all agree that it was okay for him to marry her. This was rude, petty and degrading to the wife. Instead of publicly declaring that he wants to marry her and that he loves her, he made it all about his bros and having a bro laugh. He should have stood up like a man and declared his love and his intentions to stay by her side. But instead he chose to turn a very serious moment into a stupid little joke.

So watch out for brosocial men. Is his primary concern always what his buddies think? What random men think? What is male boss thinks? Does he downplay your thoughts, feelings and needs because his bro said this and some other guy said that? Does he always defend a bro? Or any other man? Even to the point of believing patently ridiculous lies? How does he treat rape? Is the woman always a liar? Are his bruised always right? Is he constantly currying favour us with his bros? Do you feel you're taking a backseat to them? Then he is a brosocial.


These men need to be tossed back! You can't fix them. They are woman haters and woman dismissers. They will never listen to you, support you or protect you. He will even gaslight you in favor of his bros. They're too busy focusing on their bros to worry about you or place value on you.",1018.0

see the world over is diverse and there's a lot of good and bad everywhere but certain cultures are just at a level where most people in the west can't even comprehend, I'd say 90% of the advice and rhetoric would get me killed in my home country of Pakistan, In our nations you have to take shit from men otherwise you'll end up beaten and killed and this expends even to diaspora communities, I've known girls whose parents would beat their own daughter's until they had broken teeth  and would send them to Islamic schools if they ever caught holding hands with a boy that wasn't a relative of theirs

Marriage for women and girls can literally mean either salvation or a type of hell you can't imagine. the options a woman will be limited depending on your social class, religion and sect, certain families will allow you a choice between only your first cousins, others either your extended family or tribal ethnic group or someone who is the same racial group and religious sect as you are, ultimately its not even your decision bur rather your family's

**my grandfather was the one selected my husband btw, I didn't even know anything about him, ultimately it worked out and my husband was a very good man but It's still super messed up that 2 old men just decided that their grandkids should marry and no one could oppose them cause they were the senior males in their families, even they many of family members disliked I was marrying a Pashtun**

now some might say why even get married in this system? just swear off marriage and men, well you have to get married cause your family will force you, not with passive-aggressive comments  or calling you a hag, no instead they will beat you, starve you and send you to a religious school(it has happened to at least one of my cousins that I **know off**)

Many unfortunate women who go to relationships subs (which are literally FILLED with pornsick LVM) to look for advice on their relationships are told that they must cOmMuniCaTe with their boyfriends when they upset them.

Guess what? They. Know. They know they‚Äôve upset you. They know what they said or did to you was wrong. On the odd chance that a man would genuinely not know that something would be upsetting, he could immediately tell just by the reaction that his action would cause to the woman. Men KNOW.

The whole ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù bs gives LVM a perfect opportunity to gaslight you into letting go of the issue. You‚Äôll cry your heart out to him long enough for him to find the right shit to say to make you effectively forget what he did to you. This is how victims of abuse end up being desensitized. Because it starts gradually.

This is why FDS always tells us to vet ruthlessly. When a man starts dropping red flags, block and delete. It only gets worse from there. Explaining to LVM how they hurt you does NOTHING. They know they did, they know how you feel, it WILL happen again. They do not care.

857,t3_qx0q8n,Safety tips for Internet.,"I may or may not end up deleting this account too, so might as well make this post for everyone in here. 


Never use the same username across sites. No matter how convenient it is, you can get traced throughout the internet just by using the same username in different websites. The same goes for passwords, change your passwords regularly, and avoid the common trap of security questions like, what was your first pet's name or your favorite book. If you have to answer these questions, make sure it's a nonsense password.


-Lay off Facebook and Instagram. No, seriously, lay off these sites. Other than the fact these sites provide a trove of information to any stalkers, they track your online activity in order to curate your content. It is also the first place a lv or nv person will look for a suitable candidate for their shenanigans. Some have referred to this as ""window shopping"". If you MUST have one for professional purposes, make sure it is as clear and sterile as possible.


-Utilize multiple email addresses. Separate your business from your personal life, your dating apps if you still have any and your social media as well. The same goes for any banking services and tax services you may utilize. Separate accounts for each one. If someone manages to hack your social media, they will get your email address, which they can target next, or sign you up for any kind of spam. It also goes without saying, different passwords for each one, and names if possible.


-Be careful of what you post on the internet.
Even if you make a post before deleting it shortly after, chances are there is already a copy of it made by some bot, for archive purposes. Avoid any identifying details, including the weather and the time. Yes, you can be tracked if you post ""its hailing outside, and I thought it was going to be a sunny day today"", approximately by the time you posted this, any Google search on weather report and your timezone. Combine this with any other data you may leave on your other posts and you have an approximate location of your person. Selfies and risqu√© photos are a no brainer, in this sub.


-Utilize the tools available to you. You have Google, search your name and see what comes up. Same with your phone number, search it and see if it has ended up somewhere. There is a website called ""have I been pwned"" where you can see if any email addresses you may have has been linked to any hacks. If necessary, create diversions. If you have a stalker, create a fake life in another location, fake events, stories, even people.


-Do not underestimate the obsession of a bruised ego. For the lv and nv people, the sense of self importance is what keeps them afloat, the sheer, non based upon facts belief that they are the hot shit. For someone who doesn't have a reason to exist other than chase his own high, means that they have the biggest weakness too. When that ego is bruised, they will turn angry, because you just damaged their power of themselves and their denial. And because they just lost what matters the most to them, they subconsciously believe they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by getting back at you. If you think that no one in their right mind would go to such lengths, remember that you aren't dealing with someone like that. You aren't dealing with someone who has the same thinking patterns as you, or moral hangups, or lines you won't cross. You are dealing with a hurt ego running on rage.


-Familiarize yourself with your tech. Take a few hours to turn your phone and your laptop inside out, play with the settings, dive deep into your files and see where everything is stored, the amount of cache you have, if there is a recycle bin where deleted files go to, before being automatically deleted. Look for any settings and permissions you may have turned on in your apps and your devices, that can be used against you and locate you. Location settings is one, while in another post there has been an instance of an ex messing with the op's Gmail and have every mail she sent, automatically sent to his address as well. The same goes for your surroundings as well. Locate any hidden nook and cranny that can be used either as a safe hiding spot for you, or a hidden camera. Your car too.


-Choose wisely where and how you store your passwords and bank account details. Personally, I don't trust very much the password manager apps readily available, for the simple reason that you wouldn't trust readily any file off the internet. You don't know for sure if this app is also sending data of what is being stored to the company for optimization purposes. Avoid also the obvious password notepad you may have on your desk, in a case of a stalker, they could easily break in while you are away at work and find it. 


And be wary in case you are living with someone and you are planning an exist strategy. If you can, redirect all important mails to a PO Box, all important emails to a brand new email account you have created from a brand new device, in a safe wifi network that is NOT YOUR HOME NETWORK. Make sure you have a trusted person to hold onto a bug out bag and the original copies of all the important documents you have. The most dangerous time for a person is when they leave the relationship.


This list may sound like an overkill, but we all know that we would rather have this, than be killed ourselves. Nothing will tell you just how right you are, until you look back and see all these bullets you have dodged by being careful. People will dismiss any reason to follow this, until it happens to them. Hindsight is 20/20, and this list has been compiled with hindsight from other posts and cases found online. Feel free to evolve your own techniques and safety tips, as each situation has its own unique challenges.",326.0

860,t3_qwxf4u,A man disclosing his mental health/therapy habits early on is an absolute red flag,"This is response to another question earlier today and I feel this needs to be said explicitly. It is not cute or reassuring if a man tells you he‚Äôs in therapy early on. Do I think therapy is bad? No. Do I think everyone needs to be in therapy? Yes. But 90% (this is a generous number) of men are lv and will not change no matter how many hours of therapy they get. 

There have actually been studies and articles written saying therapy is only helpful to people with a good sense of self awareness. Therapy does not work with abusers, narcissists, sociopaths, or psychopaths. It just gives them a better understanding of how to shield their flaws in pretty psych jargon. 

In addition, most men have sociopathic, narcissistic, and abusive tendencies. *Do not* give them the benefit of the doubt. A man going to therapy is not a green flag. Him telling you he‚Äôs going to therapy is not a green flag. LVM have just learned to mask better by pretending to be the emotionally intelligent self aware male that‚Äôs in touch with his emotions. 

An HVM would not have these conversations early on either because an hv trait is discretion. Why would you tell a stranger this kind of information?

862,t3_qwu0ij,"Sex work is not a ""pure"" service job like being a barista or a maid, it is undergirded by the commodification of the female body. Women are viewed and treated like goods.","** EDIT: When I say it's not a ""pure"" service job, I do not mean that in a derogatory way (i.e I am not trying to slutshame or say that it's a dirty job). What I mean by ""pure"" is that it is not STRICTLY a service job because it is largely dependent on a woman treating her body like a product.

The libfem case (more like ""cope"") that sex work is just like any other service-oriented role is the backbone of the pro-sex industry movement-- just like how the Starbucks barista makes your coffee every morning, the sex worker gives Joe Shmoe his weekly blowjob.

The problem with this overly-simplified talking point is that sex work is not a ""pure"" service role like working at Target or being a Starbucks barista. Libfems like to harp on the service aspects of the job to cover up the true foundation of this industry, which is treating the female body as a product or good.

If sex work was anything like a ""pure"" service role, having desirable physical attributes wouldn't be a condition precedent to performing the service; i.e. in order to perform the service, you wouldn't have to first meet the customer's physical standards. Customers would still give you their money if you aren't physically their type (as long as you perform the service well) &amp; customers would generally be okay with being assigned to a random sex worker (even if they are unattractive) as long as they perform the service well. Customers wouldn't have such a strong preference to choose the person providing the services from a catalog of women advertising their bodies with ""sexy"" photos that appeal to the male gaze.

Do you give a sh\*t whether your grocery store clerk is an 18-year-old hottie or a ""post-wall"" 50-year-old? Think of the red light district-- you don't see Starbucks baristas standing by the window dressed up in lingerie with signs saying ""let me make your coffee! ;)""

Revenue in the sex industry has a very strong positive correlation with the possession of physical attributes that meet consumers' tastes (or fetishes, unfortunately). This is why we see women who are conventionally attractive (i.e their physical attractiveness appeals to a broader set of men) making the most money in this industry. The more men you sexually attract, the more $ you will bring in.

Now, this isn't to say that there aren't non-sex work jobs where physical attractiveness gives workers a leg up (i.e sales &amp; waitressing). However, we need to acknowledge that getting a ""leg up"" from being attractive is not the same as needing to be attractive in order to get hired. There are plenty of ugly men in sales who succeed because they are good at communicating, but you don't see strip clubs hiring overweight 50-yr old men. You don't see customers at a restaurant throwing a fit if their waitress isn't attractive (unless you're at Hooters, which I think is a disgusting franchise). Also, the modeling industry and entire brands have like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Victoria's Secret, and Brandy Melville gotten criticized for only hiring people they find attractive, &amp; Libfems were mad that these brands/industries for treating attractive girls like trinkets, so why is this mindset not being used when analyzing the sex industry?

When you think about it from this perspective, sex workers' bodies are treated like luxury goods that can be rented out to perform services. &amp; men (the consumers) agree too, hence why they commonly compare women to cars and do extremely degrading things to sex workers.

Ignoring the objectification that sex workers have to do in order to sell their services &amp; only focusing on the services themselves is sneaky &amp; manipulative.

&amp; this doesn't even touch upon the other issues with sex work such as paying for consent &amp; abuse from consumers who only view sex workers as objects (doing degrading things that they wouldn't do to women they respect, blackmail, screenshotting their OnlyFans content and sending it around to other people for free, etc).",820.0

I've seen the above mentioned many times on FDS, and while it may be good in some situations, it doesn't apply all the time and may actually be dangerous at times. 

Let me illustrate with a real-life cautionary tale, which I'm sure some of you will relate to: 


Last year, one of my dear friends who had been single for a while, took to OLD to find a man to date. Find a man she did, but I could tell right away he was going to hurt her emotionally. The very first red flag (which I only realised now as I'm writing this) was that she had waited until they'd been on a couple of dates already before telling me about him. She and I are very close, and in the past, she would have told me right away that she'd met someone. She likely knew deep down he wasn't it. 

There were other red flags (including him being barely a month out of a 5-year relationship and already on a ""serious"" dating app), but the most glaringly obvious was in the conversation she showed me, which they'd had even before their first date: 


""I'm not really looking for a relationship."" 


There it was, plain as day, his intentions spelled out. I told her: ""I hope you don't expect something serious because he is literally telling you he doesn't want that. So don't get attached; he'll use you for a bit as a rebound then he'll ditch you and if you complain, he'll say that he'd told you from the start that he didn't want a relationship."" 

Oh boy, she did NOT like it. The look on her face, the mumbling about ""just wanting someone to sleep with anyway"" and the quick subject-change made it very clear. I didn't press the matter any further. I knew she wasn't able to ""just sleep with someone"" (I've known her for 16 years), but I also know how stubborn she is, so, sadly, this was a mistake she needed to make to learn the lesson. 

Then, he starting pulling all the right moves. Paying for all the dates, taking her on weekends away, cleaning her place, etc, etc. Admittedly, this was what she told me, you never know what happens behind closed doors. And as we live in different cities, I never got to meet him. I started hoping he would prove me wrong, because I didn't want my friend to be hurt, but at the back of my mind, I was still waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

When he introduced her to his whole family at the 5 months mark, and they spent the whole weekend at their beach house, I thought ""Ok, maybe he is the exception to the rule? Let's see."" The niggling feeling in my gut was still there but I really, really wanted this to be true. I love my friend dearly and I wanted her to be in a loving relationship because she deserves it. 


2 months later, he broke up with her. 


He told her that he could tell she was falling in love but *as he'd said at the beginning*, he wasn't looking for a relationship, so *to be kind to her*, he thought it better to end it now. 

That arsehole had waited until he could see she had feelings for her before dropping her. Where exactly was the kindness there? He not only proved me right but also *intentionally* wanted to hurt her. 


Men can easily fake being loving in actions or in words, but often one of those will betray them. Of course, some can fake both very well. But the mask will slip eventually. 

So when dating and vetting a man, don't look solely at his actions, ignoring his words. It could come back to bite you in the arse.

FDS was kind of revolutionary in teaching me to think it was ok to work out what I like in a man/relationship and to pursue it ruthlessly. Before this, I just thought I was lucky to be wanted (yep - recovering pickmeisha!) and that I should pretty much accept anything that wasn't abuse.

The thing is I still don't feel great about myself physically. I'm pretty average in the looks department, I don't know how to use makeup and I'm still carrying my covid kilos. Plus my ex told me I was no longer attractive, and I still feel like if a short, obese dude who didn't shave and had facial problems didn't want me, no HVM will.

873,t3_qwerz7,Start having sex where the man doesn‚Äôt orgasm,"Buckle up with me, ladies. I‚Äôve disabled my DMs for this one. üòÇ

Women should start having sex wherein the man doesn‚Äôt orgasm for at least about 85%-90% of the encounters. My last two relationships have worked this way and it has been INCREDIBLE. (Another edit because someone asked: by ""last two,"" I mean my most recent one--which I ended for other reasons - the sex was phenomenal, though--and my current one.)

Why?

**1. It shifts the focus of sex from his ultimate goal (cumming) to mutual pleasure (i.e., maximizing** ***your*** **pleasure, since we already know he'll feel good)**

We‚Äôre not breeding machines. It‚Äôs 2021; the ‚Äúgoal‚Äù of every sexual encounter is not to be inseminated. Despite this obvious reality, women‚Äôs pleasure is still so under-valued and de-prioritized that women rarely orgasm during sex. \[[One source of many](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087699/).\] Instead, de-prioritizing *his* orgasm shifts the paradigm; now that that is no longer the end goal, you can both slow down and focus on connection, intimacy, and pleasure.

The result of this, naturally, is that the man becomes more focused on *your* pleasure. If he isn‚Äôt hyper-focused on his own orgasm, AND ***if he actually cares about you\*,*** then he will start focusing more on you ‚Äî if he‚Äôs not rushing to nut, the foreplay will be longer, you‚Äôll get wetter, he‚Äôll feel OK about pausing PIV to go down on you, etc. As we know, whether or not he orgasms, sex is still almost always going to feel great for him. Maybe not for you. That brings me to point #2‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

**2. It strengthens communication and his attentiveness to you**

How many of us have had sex when we didn‚Äôt really want to? Or wanted to, but then lost interest/felt uncomfortable midway? How many of us have still just gone through with it, because ‚Äúit will probably be over soon, and I want him to feel good/don‚Äôt want to face hostility or violence if I don‚Äôt‚Äù? Or, less uncomfortable/dangerous but also hugely frustrating: how many of us have *just* started to get really into it, when the man suddenly nuts and all action instantly stops? What a letdown. I still want mine!

Regarding the first of the above two scenarios: when a man isn‚Äôt mechanically focused on his orgasm, the entire dynamic shifts. With this arrangement, I‚Äôve noticed that my partners have been much more likely to check-in frequently and are more attuned to my body language and facial expressions, the sounds I make (or don't make), and of course, the things I say outright. If I say, ‚Äúcan we stop for a minute?‚Äù or if he so much as sees my face change before I even notice it, he *stops*. And sometimes we don‚Äôt restart. (Granted, a man should and MUST stop the second you want to‚Äîregardless of this arrangement, but sadly, we know this isn‚Äôt always the case. I‚Äôve asked LVM men to stop before and have been met with hesitation/slowing down but not stopping/or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so close!‚Äù ‚Äî um, fuck off. If he‚Äôs focused solely on his end goal, he might push through \[i.e., assault you\] to reach that end, even if you‚Äôre uncomfortable. Another reason why the importance of vetting before sleeping together cannot be overstated.) I‚Äôve noticed in my experience that this dynamic/paradigm-shift makes the communication around pleasure/starting/stopping much clearer.

Regarding the second of the above scenarios: like I said in point #1, this dynamic shifts the focus from his orgasm to mutual pleasure. I‚Äôve cum *much more* this way. Shit, maybe even more than he has, which is saying a lot because it takes time and patience for me to orgasm. But it also creates a new type of ‚Äúin-between‚Äù space, where we can both enjoy the buildup and the great parts of sex, but then‚Ä¶ just... stop when it‚Äôs no longer as good. It happens. Sometimes you remember something on your to-do list and you‚Äôre pulled out of the pleasure and can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt want to) dive back in. Maybe it stops feeling good, or starts stinging or feeling uncomfortable. I hate that ‚Äîfor so many reasons ‚Äî we have been conditioned to just lay there and give over rights to our bodies when that happens. Stop that shit in its tracks. We should only have sex when we want to, when we're thoroughly turned on, and when it is *continuously* feeling good. Taking his orgasm out of the spotlight is one way to help ensure that.

The other side of this coin is also a plus: sometimes you're enjoying sex, but then you want to stop for the moment -- and then a little while/hours later, you want to go at it again. It makes it much easier to jump back in if the man isn't spent from having cum already. (I'm just speaking from my experience; I know that some men can cum multiple times in a day from PIV, but that seems less common, especially in a longterm relationship/when you're not in the honeymoon phase.)

&amp;#x200B;

**3. It keeps men humble, challenges their sense of entitlement to an orgasm, and makes them work harder**

Women certainly don‚Äôt orgasm every time we have sex ‚Äî why on earth should a man be entitled to that?

Intermittent reinforcement \[[source](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/intermittent-reinforcement#:~:text=Intermittent%20reinforcement%20is%20the%20delivery,but%20at%20seemingly%20random%20intervals)\] is a powerful concept in psychology that is particularly useful in helping us understand addiction and abusive relationships. (e.g., if a child has an abusive parent who doles out love/praise sporadically, the child is actually more likely to work harder for that love.) But this concept can be used for good üòà; it simply helps us understand the way people respond to reward/punishment on fixed schedules vs. at random intervals. ‚ÄúResearchers found that the way to keep the subjects working longest was to reinforce the behavior at unpredictable intervals, rather than regularly.‚Äù Think about that with sex and orgasm. Hmmm‚Ä¶! I can hear the scrotacious echos now‚Ä¶ You mean a man might have to work harder and longer and *earn his orgasm?* I said what I said, mf. A man's orgasm is guaranteed as much as sex at all is guaranteed: it isn't. At all. I'm here to feel good, too.

Queens with low libidos might be put off by this concept. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt this mean that he‚Äôs constantly pushing me for sex, if his orgasm has been restricted several times in a row?‚Äù In my experience, no. In fact, I'm inclined to think the opposite is more likely: if he thinks he will cum every time he has sex, I think he‚Äôll be more motivated to have sex more often and more mindlessly, because he‚Äôs chasing an orgasm that he knows he‚Äôll get. If that ‚Äúreward‚Äù is intermittent, the whole dynamic shifts in the ways I outlined, and he starts viewing sex as a mindful and intimate way to connect -- and when it does happen, he'll work harder to make it enjoyable for both parties. **But your mileage may vary, and I cannot speak to the effectiveness/outcomes of this strategy if you have a particularly low libido that results in very infrequent sex or long periods of time without having sex with your partner, as I have not been in that position.** The best advice I could give in that case is that if you prefer to have sex infrequently or rarely, and your partner is different or pushes you for sex, then it‚Äôs not a good match (at best) or coercive/abusive (at worst) and you need to dump him.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. It's a vetting strategy**

We all know that vetting is an ongoing process. When you have begun sleeping with and forming deeper intimate connections with a man, your vetting inner-voice should only be heightened, because now you‚Äôre becoming emotionally vulnerable and therefore more likely to make excuses for bad behavior. If you ask that he doesn‚Äôt cum, and he responds with BuT mUh bLuE bALLs, hostility, dismissiveness, agreement-then-switching (‚ÄúI can‚Äôt control it!‚Äù), etc., DUMP HIM. He doesn‚Äôt care about you, your comfort, or heaven forbid, your pleasure. Men CAN control their orgasm. They just need to slow down, be mindful and intentional, and pay a modicum of attention to you and the situation. Sometimes it takes a little practice; sometimes slip-ups happen. Intention is crucial.

\*OF COURSE, all of this is effective only with thoroughly-vetted men. If you‚Äôve hung around here long enough, you know that casual sex is risky at best, dangerous at worst, and almost always physically and emotionally unfulfilling. You really think some schmuck you swiped right on last week is going to care if you cum? Be realistic.

&amp;#x200B;

**So how can you accomplish this?**

1. VET. (See asterisked note above.)

Also, this will realllllly bring to light (and let you vet) those doofuses who love to talk about being ""givers."" Don't ever believe that shit. Has ANYONE ever had sex with one of these men and actually been the recipient of selfless giving? What a joke. Let's see how much of a giver you claim to be when you don't get to nut. On the flip side, this strategy allows actual, genuine givers to really shine. (See point #2 above.)

2. Mention it before you have sex for the first time.

This can be sexy and/or dry. Who cares? It‚Äôs as simple as, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to fuck you, but I don‚Äôt want you to cum until I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù It‚Äôs not about BDSM-esque orgasm-control. It‚Äôs about all of the points I outlined above. If you're already involved in a relationship and want to shift to this, go for it. But I would definitely mention it before you next have sex, so his [monkey brain](https://tenor.com/view/i-cant-believe-it-mutantes-caminhos-do-coracao-unbelievable-mind-boggling-gif-16353336) can start [shifting things around a bit](https://tenor.com/view/math-thinking-zach-galifianakis-formulas-numbers-gif-7715569).

3. Mention it again while you‚Äôre having sex.

If you see him getting lost in his own pleasure/getting close, *stop.* Men are so conditioned to using us as fleshlights that the idea that they can feel good but maybe not nut is so mind-boggling to them. Remind him that you don‚Äôt want him to cum. Tell him to go down on you or massage you or do something else erotic that isn‚Äôt PIV. *If he‚Äôs a HVM/if he cares about your pleasure, this shift will come naturally for him.* If it doesn‚Äôt‚Äîif you need to coach him repetitively or explain your reasoning (note: I‚Äôve never had to explain all of the above points to my partners. If I ask them to do it, they do it.)‚Äîthen dump-a-scrote and run.

&amp;#x200B;

That‚Äôs all I have. Now go off, Queens: lean into your power as a sexual partner, relish your orgasm, and create a space where you both care a whole lot less about his.

//

EDIT: I know it's a long post but y'all talking on other subs need to READ. Let me reiterate some key points.

What this strategy ISN'T:

* BSDM orgasm-withholding. Believe me, I had my run in the BDSM world. This ain't it. In fact, that practice further centralizes male climax since there's an intensified focus specifically on his orgasm - getting him close, withholding it, punishment, etc. This is about taking male orgasm 85% out of the equation so you can both focus on connection and pleasure.
* vindictive - lol. I told you my partners and I have loved this. I'm not punishing anyone.
* playing games - I emphasize the importance of communication here and advocating for your own needs. The goal is very straightforward and my partners and I have recognized it as such. We were always on the same page.
* bringing men down to ""our level"" of infrequent orgasm. NO. This is about shifting the focus so you can orgasm more! (Or honestly, so you can just enjoy the pleasure in a different way - I don't cum every time we have sex and I'm truly down with that. It takes a lot of focus and energy on my part to reach climax and I'm not always in the mood to.) The fact that this gets men all riled up only proves my point that male orgasm is wayyyy too centralized. It's not all about men, ffs!

What this strategy IS about:

* de-centralizing male orgasm to allow for better communication, mutual pleasure, and intimate connection. I could've titled this same post, ""How to Have More Pleasurable and Intimate Sex."" It really shouldn't be so feather-ruffling.

I'm seeing a lot of talk elsewhere FROM MEN about how this will cause men to r\*pe us. No, MEN cause men to r\*pe us. This only solidifies my point that men are so self-centered that they might actually get violent if we suggest focusing more on our pleasure. Depraved men love to tell on themselves. Again, this is why **vetting is so important. You should not be sleeping with men you haven't aggressively vetted.** If you think your partner will respond violently to this idea, then that instinct is all you need to know the type of man he is. Listen to your gut -- seek support and get out as fast as you can.

I love the manosphere comments. So threatened. Such wiener shrinkage. I'm sorry you can't perform and please a woman beyond jackhammering to climax.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Do better.",1404.0

I have a small business - ""Really?"" ""OH so you know all the tax loopholes"" ""that can't pay much"" ""I prefer my cooperate job I wouldn't want to do that""

Mentioning meal prep - ""that's so much work. Ugh"" ""I would rather get fast food"" 

Mentioning I used to repair phones/code in college and that I don't do it anymore (I would fix my own stuff and friends) - ""really"" ""I only take my phone to a professional if it has an issue"" ""you need to have small hands for that""

If he has a certain hobby or skill even if he's not good at it and he thinks you don't know enough about it he will try to lecture /peacock to you and make negs about how he knows more than you. It's not cute its not helpful it's him being malicious and wanting to make you feel less than him. 

Also if you meetup in person and he makes fun/negs you about your height. I'm shorter I've had some guys see me and immediate squat down and giggle or say ohhh you're a shortie. Others if we are out somewhere will reach over me to grab something and the point out boasting how tall they are and how easy it is to reach. A hvm would grab something you couldn't reach and not even mention it or neg your height. 

He often will say these things in a spiteful manner and other times will try to act like it's ""friendly conversation"" when really these types of things are really negs. Him acting surprised you have a skill and going ""really"" implies he thinks you're top stupid to do it. Commenting on your body is not okay.

878,t3_qw582n,"How To Know Better That The Older Guy Isn't A Friend, He's Preying On You","I got this new job recently and thus had to meet my new coworkers. Right away this one guy was extremely friendly with me, making me laugh, joking, and all that. (For the record - I'm 18 and he's like 28-30, I can't be sure). I never thought about it too much. And it never bothered me as well, why would it? Although some things were a bit off. Like he'd make way too many compliments, or try to always touch me or get us alone. But he's like that with every woman, so I didn't pay much attention to that. What did bother me was the way he talked about women that rejected him, women that he tried to get together with and something went wrong and women in general. He would often use such words as ""bitch"", ""whore"", ""slut"", ""stupid"", ""dumb"" and so on. I know that he slept with prostitutes too, he said that himself. Honestly, he's the kind of guy who flirts with everything that moves and as I assume it does it so that at least someone would buy that. He also is what I'd call overly traditional, as in ""I earn money and you stay at home and do all this labour for me"". Basically a walking red flag, it's clear for me now but it wasn't before.  
Spoiler - I never liked him in any way. I just brushed all those things off and simply was on good terms with him at work. We never met outside of work, the only time that we did was when we were hanging out in a group of people, having drinks etc and it was fine. But he'd always ask me to go out and drink with him one on one, and for some odd reason, I did not want to do that, like my gut was stopping me. And thank God I never did.  
But this one time I was extremely bored and had nothing to do, and he randomly asked to go for a walk so I did. It was late in the evening. Btw he was hanging out with some other girl before we did so. And I said that I won't be drinking. So we went for a walk, had a conversation, all that. And then he started saying random shit about us moving in together and that I'm pretty etc. He'd forcefully hold my hand or my back as we were walking, did shit like putting his head near my neck, holding my things. I was extremely uncomfortable and I said that we're just friends, so which he replied that we could do a lot of things while being friends. He also mentioned that we're far away from where I live so we could just hang more and then come over to his place. And I was like oh hell no, so I made an excuse to get tf away, which I couldn't because he insisted to take me home. I did get home safe and I don't know what he expected, I didn't think much of this evening and forgot about that.  
But this one time we were hanging out in a group of friends, and everyone was pretty tipsy. So he comes to me, he put his hand on my leg which I removed instantly, and he started asking when will we go drinking alone. I began making up some excuses in a form of a joke, and what he said had just instantly sobered me up. He said, ""don't worry, I'm not going to try to fuck you anymore because I have a chick now"". WHAT?? All this time the dude I thought of as some friendly dude at work was trying to fuck me?? He's almost 10 years older and I have never given him the smallest sign that I want that. He's still asking me to go out for drinks and he still flirts at work and makes comments out loud about my body and how I look etc, but now I know better and I wouldn't put myself in such danger ever again because God knows how it could have ended.

~Current and former pickmes often have/had this trait deeply embedded in them. They constantly and consistently seek male attention for internal validation. *Im one of the guys, I‚Äôm not like other girls, I don‚Äôt understand women who are like that.* ü§¨Instead of trying to build true connections with other women and leveling up in their own lives, pickmes seek the easier route of obtaining male attention. In the worst of the worse cases, even attention from a male boss or a friends husband or serious boyfriend will give them the *rush* they‚Äôre looking for. The drive these pickmes have is often coming from a place of deep insecurity, low self esteem, and the misplaced need to seek revenge on a past or present partner. You know who you are!!! Do not hurt other women because you‚Äôre hurt! And when you have those tingling feelings from momentary male attention or even stacking up lots of attention from the male gaze ü§¢; please FFS remind yourself that all of that attention is worth NOTHING and you will gain NOTHING for it.
If anything, you will be feeling and thinking worse when it‚Äôs all said and done because that pickme cup can never be filled.
If you‚Äôve ever been one of these women or you‚Äôre currently like this, work hard at exorcising this mindset from your life. This is a baseline expectation for any FDS woman.

‚Ä¢**Stop explaining yourself and your POV to men in the vain hopes they‚Äôll respect you and ultimately change their ways**
~A HVM doesn‚Äôt need you to help him change his life. He is already the man he wants to be. If a man in your life wants and needs constant explanations from you about how you feel, what you think, what you want; he is likely LV/NV. HVM do want to get to know a woman they‚Äôre interested in, slowly‚Ä¶and this is far different than conversations requiring you to explain your stance on xyz. HVM actually LIKE women and respect women naturally, it‚Äôs part of their deep unchanging character. They would also not waste their time on a pickme so if you‚Äôre not speaking to men that truly like and respect women, you‚Äôre wasting your time on LVM and need to stop trying to date PERIOD because you‚Äôre too far away from your own goal of being a HVW yourself. 
This is where FDS requires you to really dig in and do the hard work of facing your own issues and dealing with them. 

Edit: I know pickings are slim out there in the wild. But it‚Äôs better to be single and alone than partnered and lonely!

‚Ä¢**Stop questioning if he likes you OR wondering where you stand**
~Ask yourself, do I like him? Is he good enough for me? What will a relationship with him add to my life?
~Am I settling because I‚Äôm fearful I‚Äôll end up alone? Am I really experiencing true attraction towards him or am I forcing it, and overlooking some red flags? 
FDS women set the bar high! There is no settling/compromising/overlooking those red flags. We don‚Äôt entertain FWB, casual flings, the let‚Äôs see where this goes/I‚Äôm open to anything trope. All of that is a waste of time. 

‚Ä¢**Watch out for your blind spots**
~Most of us are self aware and know what our blind spots are. Perhaps men with a sense of humor is or was our weakness. Or maybe we crush on the emotionally downtrodden, the lonely misunderstood guy, or the charismatic guy with straight shiny teeth and that beautiful grin.
What‚Äôs happening with some FDS women on their level up journeys is they start finally coming out of their haze of toxic lies, confidence is increased, they meet a LVM who has that thing you like‚Ä¶and bam! You‚Äôre here posting about your relapse. üò¢
FDS is a community of women who support each other and lift each other up. But this does not absolve us of recognizing our blind spots in the men and women we invite into our lives who may or may not add value‚Ä¶.Put in the work!! Vet ruthlessly!
This is key to knowing your worth and establishing/maintaining serious boundaries.

‚Ä¢**You will face rejection from HVW around you if you‚Äôre not truly a HVW yourself**
~Ouch right? I know some FDS women are super busy living their lives and we come from all walks of life‚Ä¶some of us are in true time crunches and cannot socialize much. That being said, if you find yourself unable to EVER connect with HVW, consistently..it could indicate that HVW are ignoring you because you‚Äôre not one yourself yet. 
At some point, you should be able to meet/foster/maintain relationships in your life with other HVW. Do not delude yourself with excuses. *Im busy (yet you have a roster of LVM you talk to on OLD). I‚Äôm an introvert (but you game a lot and entertain F bois online).*
FDS encourages us to have other HVW in our lives. It takes time, energy, and motivation. All the assets you use to pour into the chumps you were fawning over. Work on this and don‚Äôt make excuses.

882,t3_qw1pps,Men rarely think they are the problem,"I‚Äôve seen women argue with men hoping they‚Äôll see the light, or try and show them their shitty ways but the simple truth is men don‚Äôt see anything wrong with their behavior. Just like the article on rapists who don‚Äôt believe they are rapists that was on here a few months ago, a majority of men don‚Äôt think they are LVM. 

A lot of them make up excuses for why every woman they are with runs away. They make up excuses for their emotionally abusive behaviors. They make up excuses for why they are so lazy and unambitious. All of these excuses shield their fragile egos that have been fostered by society. We already see how violent men get when their egos get shattered so what makes us think they‚Äôll want to the work and become self aware? 

Do I think LVM can change? No. We do not live in a society that creates tangible consequences for shitty men and men require consequences to see their bad behavior. Of course there are exceptions but you can‚Äôt rely on exceptions. Even with our sub with over on 200k women, pickmes far out number us. They will stick it through with these men and support them in hopes they change.

I see this trope being pushed on various forms of media, especially on Youtube and Instagram. Many young impressionable women doing mental gymnastic and buying into the false idea that being a sugar baby is empowering. Dating for love is out of the question, and relationships should be a tit for tat situation with a man who is significantly older than you and has the ability to manipulate you in many ways to ‚Äúsecure the bag‚Äù.

Many bitter men think that aLl WoMeN aRe GolDiGgErs just because they‚Äôve heard an anecdotal story here and there. They assume that all women want to use and manipulate men for their own personal gain. These bitter men also assume that asking for the bare minimum and respect is also a ridiculous demand. 

A very VERY small minority of women think this way, although ‚Äúfamous apps‚Äù would like men to believe that there are really 3 million sugar baby students in the U.S.A. alone. We also see countless news articles applauding the lifestyle of women getting paid $500 per date with an older man that is entirely platonic! Unless this situation is an outlier, we can all assume this is entirely bullshit. 0.00000001% of men feel compelled to help a woman if sex is not involved in some way. These news articles also make it sound like these women are sugaring out of their own merit well in fact, many of them are in poor financial situations and are willing to be used by an older man to get access to an affluent lifestyle they may otherwise not be able to afford.

There is nothing empowering about having coercive sex, whether that‚Äôs with a LV broke man or coercive paid sex with a LV rich man. 

What will happen when you‚Äôre not able to capitalize on your looks anymore? The biggest issue with a commodified relationship is that once you‚Äôre not the young shiny new play thing anymore, you will get tossed aside and replaced with someone else. The plethora of news articles out there raving about the lifestyle fail to mention that.

Please don‚Äôt compare yourself to women you see on social media who are living an extremely lavish lifestyle and don‚Äôt have a job to back it up. Although they make look happy on social media, they‚Äôre probably miserable on the inside with what they‚Äôre doing and they know their time with their rich older man will be running out soon.

888,t3_qvwp9x,Why Women May Struggle to Leave Charismatic Me,"A LVM isn‚Äôt always NV. Oftentimes he may‚Äôve been supportive at some points or improved your life, helped you expand in some measurable ways. There are situations where you can be treated incredibly well on some points- extravagant trips, expensive gifts etc but there are still slight elements of disrespect in the relationship. They may be vague, hard to spell out in words. Done in a roundabout, undercover and manipulative way that the man uses in hopes it flies under your radar. That‚Äôs how they get you eating the shit sandwich. 


It‚Äôs also shrewdly kept to like a 98/2 ratio. So that you do feel overwhelmingly good from the highs of the relationship. The disrespect and negatives are titred and drip fed so as not to tip your negative feeling so much at any one time that you leave. They never allow you to get in the red feelings wise toward them


It‚Äôs like a big luxurious banquet that you start eating and really really enjoying only to be informed half way through that theres 1/8 a teaspoon of shit in it somewhere. You wonder if it even matters. You‚Äôve already eaten so much of it already at this point and been downright enjoying it.  


This is often the case if you date HVM who are into business and appear charismatic on the surface etc. They pride themselves on being generous but at the same time may try and covertly degrade you in some ways behind the generosity and gifts and it‚Äôs carefully titrated in a manipulative way that makes people more likely to take it.


I once read a psychology fact that for people to like you the ratio of positive to negative interactions with you needs to be like 5 to 1 or 8 to 1. I realize in situations with these types of charismatic outsize figure who poses as a high value man the acts of generosity and the overwhelming good feelings from it v the small incidents of disrespect were kept closer to 25 to 1 or 30 to 1. Which means that they‚Äôve carefully designed it so that the disrespect is slow to come on the radar and slow to raise your negative feeling enough for you to act.


Often the disrespect you do experience is also vague and indirect. Sublimated through other means- not him directly saying something shitty to you etc. So not only does it not come up often between all these extravagant trips and gifts but you may not even be conscious of what you‚Äôre seeing when you see it OR if you are, you may be confused about whether it really constitutes disrespect or is even coming from him specifically because it‚Äôs been done in such and indirect passive aggressive way. You wonder was that a mistake or really coming from him/ by his hand- it doesn‚Äôt seem to be in line with the overwhelming trend of behavior you see from him and you‚Äôve already begun to believe he‚Äôs a good person


Oftentimes these types of men are executives or extreme outliers of success. People who have risen to the top against the odds and done so through force and cult of personality. Intuitively, they have more an understanding of how to manipulate people‚Äôs feelings in their favor, how to get people to automatically like them and bond to them. If they are Leaders they understand how to engage in a way that commands both longstanding love and support and respect, that gets people to bond to them, serve them and support their cause long term quickly, even in non romantic situations. Imagine what happens when the chemical feelings of love attraction and sex are involved. I do think it‚Äôs often done purposely but they‚Äôre not reading out of any nefarious book on dark arts of human psychology- they just intuitively know from childhood how far to push and when to ease back, how to balance the scales to avoid losing your good will altogether at once or suddenly. They keep their finger on the pulse of your feeling and act responsively both preventively and retroactively with words and gestures meant to make you feel appreciated and seen at all the right times- to raise your meter of good will towards them so that it never hits E. They will not openly hit you with a spat of disrespectful actions or words it always indirect and sublimated through other people etc. And they will not hit you with a spat of the vague disrespect one after the other after the other- back to back, in the way that typically makes women fed up. It‚Äôs vague and very carefully mixed in with serotonin boosters so that your love of them, good will towards them never runs out and you walk.

What this means is- you basically have to go *against* overwhelming good feeling to leave them. When you part you‚Äôre likely to still be in love with them/ enamored with them and swimming up stream against that based on what you know on a mental level. You may even feel like the asshole because it will seem he‚Äôs been amazing to you and the disrespect was purposely kept so low and hazy that any person seeking to call or spell it out openly is going to struggle to articulate it consciously. But deep down you know beyond a measure of a doubt that it‚Äôs unmistakable- one too many coincidences to not be coming from him, etc

We always preach walk at the first sign of disrespect. But in these cases the disrespect is very carefully kept just below the threshold of conscious awareness and so subtly you may not even be sure it constitutes one. Is that a sign?? Wtf is that?? A stop? A yield??‚Ä¶.You‚Äôre really not sure wtf it says. Is that even meant for someone coming from your direction???

Edit: Important point that someone else mentioned to me privately. These types often have deeply hidden issues of insecurity and self worth issues owing to the difficult circumstances and poverty that made them so high achieving and driven to start with. You‚Äôll often find they can overinterpret and overreact to even *perceived* slights to their ego",211.0

891,t3_qvtpuz,The Toxicity of It All,"This girl I knew from a group I saw posted her story with her husband online. It was a slow night, I had time, so I said ""why not"" and clicked the link.

&amp;#x200B;

When I tell you the MESS that was being spoken!?

First of all, the girl is early 20's (22&amp; under), has THREE kids by this man and her husband is in his 30's. When she met him she was 17 and he was late 20's. Ick.

Red Flag #1

&amp;#x200B;

They talked about ""the challenges"" they overcame for their marriage and how they came out ""stronger and better than ever""(My eyes rolled at this part, but I proceeded on.)

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, in the start of the relationship they talked about marriage, kids, he said she was the one for her, etc etc etc. AND THEN.....he cheated on her. She found out. Was devastated, but as she said ""she still wanted to be with him"". So she stayed with him, popped out baby #1, then right after baby #2 and then they got married. Then after they got married he cheated again BuT iT WaS OnLy An EmOtIoNaL aFfAiR \*insert another eye roll here\*. They they continued to work on it, but then lo and behold...he comes out and says he has a porn addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes.

&amp;#x200B;

He says he needs to work on himself, starts going to church meetings where there are other men who have been struggling to help him \*insert gagging\* and is focused on himself. Meanwhile she is mad (rightfully so bc she has 2 kids under the age of 2 to take care of and a porn sick cheating husband) and she tells him that she wants a divorce. He then tells her NO, and that they will work this out.

&amp;#x200B;

And ladies....that no. That ""One moment of him showing up in the relationship"" (her words- not mine) were all that she needed to continue to fight. (which of course, she then took the emotional lead again and got them in classes, tons of books, etc etc etc) and now they are better than ever! \*insert final and LONG eye roll\*

&amp;#x200B;

Ladies....I can't make this up. Is this really how pickmiesha's are moving in the world? Is this the story that religious women tell themselves (and others) so that their shitty husbands don't seem so bad? And this is supposed to be a testimony of success? Of ""fighting for your marriage?"" Like.....wtf.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The toxicity of the ""fight for your marriage"" is the real issue here. So many married women are told this and it allows women to be in bad situations for YEARS. I know this sub is FDS (emphasis on the dating) but there are a ton of married women who feel like bc they are married they have to put up with so much bc of the patriarchal trope that ""marriage is hard"". I just want to highlight that marriage with the right person will not be hard. You will not have to fight for respect, dignity, emotional safety, peace of mind or any of that with the right person. Don't allow the false message of ""marriage is hard"" to trap you in a bad situation.",201.0
892,t3_qvto1k,Do you apply FDS to non-dating spheres?,"I was thinking today about work and my Next Big Move. I wondered if I was correct in showing 'humility' at my work and whether I was right for it or if I should apply the Act As If You've Always Been Treated Well rule to my career life as well.

 As a former pick me I tended to neglect myself and diminish myself religiously. I am worried LinkedIn ""thank you for firing me"" type posts may be conditioning me in a similar pickmeisha way.",121.0
893,t3_qvsx3l,"Testing for ""sexual compatibility"" is a bullshit lie to cross boundaries and get sex","I was having a conversation with my daughter last night about bullshit tactics LVM use.

We discussed about men who say they want to test that you're sexually compatible before committing to you. My daughter thought that was possibly a reasonable request.

We had earlier been talking about an article that stated men have sex with animals way more commonly than is known with dogs, chickens and pigs being favourites.

I said to her ""Men fuck Dogs, pigs, chickens, McChickens, kids, cheesecakes, apple pies, fleshlights and they have long term relationships with the cum sock under their bed. They are compatible with literally anything.""

I also said that if a man ever says he wants to test for sexual compatibility, then block and delete him right there.",1167.0
894,t3_qvqj0k,Realizing the ‚Äúcool girls‚Äù you used to be friends with were just total pickme‚Äôs,"After joining this sub and doing my research into what exactly a pick me girl is, I was dumbfounded to realize I used to surround myself with quite a few of them. 
In highschool, I had 2 female friends that always considered themselves ‚Äúone of the guys‚Äù. I‚Äôve probably heard them say it out loud or some version of it a hundred times. They were the girls who claimed to hate makeup, dresses, handbags, and pretty much anything considered feminine. Guys noticed this about them and initially gave these girls more attention. I‚Äôll admit it made 16 year old me a little envious because I was never able to really relate to men and get on their level, even the ones I considered my friends. I hated watching the pickmes roll their eyes at girls who ‚Äúwore so much makeup‚Äù or ‚Äúwere so emotional‚Äù. Don‚Äôt even get me started on how many times I heard ‚Äúguys are just easier to get along with‚Äù VOMIT. 

Moral of the story, years down the road I realized these men who seemed to be totally fascinated with the pickmes actually weren‚Äôt. To be blunt, they just wanted to get their d*cks wet. These girls screamed of low value and desperation for male approval. And to no ones surprise, they ended up being the type to sleep with their male friends who they had initially believed were allllllll about their pickme energy.

One of them is now married to a very low value man. The other spent a good 7 years as a ‚Äúforever girlfriend‚Äù to a man whom she shared a child with, before one of them finally broke it off recently. I would never wish bad things for them, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm shocked.

Never ever feel guilty for enjoying feminine things or for being a girls girl. Let the ‚Äúcool girls‚Äù make idiots of themselves pretending to enjoy shitty beer and playing video games for hours. Men never respect pick mes and can smell the desperation from miles away. Which they will almost always take advantage of.",419.0

897,t3_qvow9h,Y‚Äôall do not be hating LVM enough for me.,"Not sure if I flared this correctly, but I‚Äôm seeing a pattern lately where pick mes who get posted on here are ripped to shreds for having low standards and low self esteem, allowing a man to run them through the ringer, treat them like shit, etc. Yet I keep seeing WAY TOO MANY posts describing how a LVM was entertained for far too long, or even asking for advice on how to deal with him.

First of all, I thought dating apps were against FDS? So why am I seeing SO many posts asking for advice on how to deal with this man you meet on OLD, even though it‚Äôs been established that men who use dating apps are bottom barrel and nobody wants them IRL so they resort to OLD where they are encouraged to be low effort with high standards they don‚Äôt even meet themselves? I‚Äôm honestly not understanding the appeal of using OLD from women who also claim to absolutely despise hookup culture. that‚Äôs truly all you‚Äôre going to get out of dating apps and that‚Äôs also been established time and time again, both by women using apps and scrotes themselves who freely admit they are looking for a low effort lay. I used to be open to casual sex and dating apps were still not worth my time and effort, so marriage-minded ladies using them and then complaining about their experience is just so baffling to me. 

If that wasn‚Äôt enough, I‚Äôm seeing ladies who actually answer these stupid messages they receive with long paragraphs. What‚Äôs not clicking about block and delete??? There is no reason why I should be seeing screenshots of these messages with your response, at least crop out your reply and pretend like you follow FDS. I think one of the handbook posts should be stickied every week because I feel the core message is getting lost. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how there‚Äôs so much vitriol for the pick mes and forever gfs who willingly deal with these pathetic men, but so many users on here don‚Äôt even have the fortitude to block and delete losers they have never even met IRL. You shouldn‚Äôt be posting for advice for how to deal with these losers cause you shouldn‚Äôt be dealing with them period! The whole point of FDS, as I understand it, is to develop tactics to block these LVM from becoming something you even need to deal with in the first place. What‚Äôs the point of learning how to identify red flags if you still let these scrotes wave them in your face and stake them down on your front lawn? You are honestly no better than the pickmes who put up with these men. It‚Äôs giving hypocrite if I‚Äôm being completely honest. 

I am beyond grateful for the strategy posts that decode narcissist and abusive behavior, that educate us how to spot all of the not so obvious red flags. It brings me so much joy to read stories of women who left shitty relationships and leveled up in life after shedding that dead weight. I love hearing from the women who did find a HVM, who tell the rest of us what to expect as a baseline for every man we date. What I‚Äôm not here for is bashing women who are still under the fog of the patriarchy/liberal feminism, while so many of these shit talkers are only here because they want to learn how to find a ‚Äúgood man‚Äù and still need male validation just like the pickme‚Äôs they claim to be so different from. 


I love dating and romance from a man as much as the next woman, but I don‚Äôt love the chokehold that male attention has some of us in. I don‚Äôt see whats the issue with putting a stop to dating entirely and letting the right man come into your life organically and effortlessly. I know a HVW, an absolutely gorgeous, intelligent, talented, and kind woman who waited 10 YEARS after her previous relationship before getting serious with her current bf. And it‚Äôs not like she was waiting lonely and sad for him‚Äîshe was living her best life traveling with her girls, being a model turned body builder turned fitness influencer, getting a degree, etc. She also said ‚Äútalking to a guy you met off a dating app for 6 months doesn‚Äôt count as a relationship.‚Äù It‚Äôs a waste of your own time and energy that could be spent leveling up. I‚Äôve put a moratorium on men in my own life, and while I do get lonely and sad at times, I am much more at peace knowing any emotional turmoil I experience isn‚Äôt caused by dealing with a man who isn‚Äôt worth my time and energy.",867.0
898,t3_qvnppy,"Religion is by men, for men","This is a subject worth expanding on and discussing in further depth - I've seen a handful of comments in the sub lately discussing how religion is by men, for men.

We've got women from across the globe - let's put our knowledge together: what are some ways in which organized religion upholds patriarchal values?

I'll start: The Catholic Church is glaringly anti-woman.

One of the world's most powerful and enduring institutions, we must note the exclusive power of males. Like in many Christian traditions, women cannot be ordained or otherwise hold roles of leadership and power in the Catholic church. So outright, we have males calling 100% of the shots.

And what do they proclaim? That such things as divorce are forbidden. You're not just trapped within marriage for life - contraception AND abortion are also sins for which you will be mercilessly punished for the rest of eternity! Remember, this God is a loving God /s.

The blatant use of women's reproductive labor is baked into its very foundation. It's no surprise that the Catholic Church as an institution has ubiquitous p\*doph\*lia epidemic amongst its leaders. Fuck the Catholic Church - it's on the way out and I'm not sad to see it go.

I realize there are religious women in the sub, and this isn't meant to bash you for your beliefs. The conversation around faith and religion certainly calls for nuance, and our faith-based practices are  important to our well-being. We must, however, acknowledge the harm perpetuated by male-led religious organizations. Hoping this can be a good space for nuanced discussion!",1345.0

Anyone else notice and worried about the increasing men's rights/anti-feminist movement in South Korea? I know these misogynistic movements exist everywhere but as an outsider/foreigner, I feel like I'm seeing more and more female celebrities in Korea get ""cancelled"" and bullied by these incels/red-pilled men.

Hyosung didn't even say anything radical in the video (especially compared to Western feminist standards)- she just expressed her wishes to live in a safe country. Of course, reason and context don't matter to these misogynists who have fragile egos and take everything as their own personal threat (if the shoe fits).

But yeah, I feel really bad for her. Many of her videos have over ten thousand dislikes and a bunch of hate comments. It's scary to think about that many men working together and in-sync because of their hatred for women. I also noticed that Korean men who speak English are trying to defend their misogyny in the comments. They're gaslighting foreigners by saying we don't ""understand"" what's going on in their country and in the Korean feminist movement. Obviously, personal anecdotes from Korean women say otherwise.

Anyway I just wanted to share this news for awareness and I would love to hear some insight from any Korean women/women living in Korea in our FDS community.",918.0

While it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to help a parent who has just lost a spouse, it‚Äôs really suspect that LW is being told to go after her son finds a new babysitter. Sure, he calls her his fianc√©e but I think we all know what‚Äôs up:

Dear Carolyn: Over three years ago, my son was widowed. I moved in and helped care for my three grandchildren (8 to 14), kept the house, and basically enabled him to hold his life together.
Last year he started dating a nice woman, and it was so great to see him happy again. She is 35, the youngest of a large family, and lived with her mother until her mother died shortly before she started dating my son. Because of this family dynamic, I assumed she would welcome my staying on after the marriage. They both work and I can help so much, especially after they possibly have a baby.
The wedding is months away, and my son initiated a discussion about my finding a place of my own. I presented my case for staying on, but he said his fiancee is looking forward to running her own household after so many years living with her mother.
I feel like I‚Äôm being punished for the sins of a dead woman. I want to love and welcome my new daughter-in-law into our family, but it‚Äôs hard when she‚Äôs kicking me out.

Gave him the benefit of the doubt (facepalm) (pickme was showing). Made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/qq23sb/am_i_codependent_or_do_i_have_a_strong_intuition/) post, got great advice and dumped him today.

\----------

First I want to say how proud I am of myself. A year ago I would not have dumped this emotional unavailable pos, would doubt myself longer and would wreck myself eventually, for the sake of what?When I look back at my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/qq23sb/am_i_codependent_or_do_i_have_a_strong_intuition/) I see a lot of gaslighting towards myself. Now I'm out of my foggy mind, I KNOW and SEE and FEEL what happened. My intuition was and is always on point, I sense and feel everything very strong (I'm an INFJ and hyper sensitive), I fell for his guilt tripping, which made me doubt myself &gt;BIG LESSON&lt;

Anyway,

He showed me eventually his true colours, within a month:- negged things I liked - sad boiiii problems (talking about his exes, why they left him etc. dududu) - his friends were obviously sexist/mysoginystic, also anime addicts - again emotional unavailable ""due his past"" he said (didn't take responsibility for it, gotten therapy for it or whatsoever) - sadistic (laughing at a hurting animal, it really crushed my heart, it was a video on YouTube, he clicked and laughed, he saw my reaction and asked in a funny way if I wanted to see the video again (fcking psychopath)) - negative outlook on life (he said he liked to complain a lot) (?) - never showed an interest in anything I was doing, refered to his self only (everything was about him and he always turned the conversations so it was about him) - projecting and gaslighting (for example: he said he was worried about something, I made him clear he did not have to worry about that thing, then he said to me 'that I don't need to worry' (??)) - guilt tripping to the max (he said he felt guilty for x y z, but never took action on it) - only liked anime related stuff

I can go on and on really..I wonder how you queens would analyse/categorize this behaviour of him?Plus some recommendations for me to look out for and what I perhaps need to work on what I may have forget to mention

The fact that I still wanted this man to have an interest in me shows me already that I have lots of healing and self work to do which I'm going to invest in!

It is ‚Äúfaux feminism‚Äù that we need to give support and solidarity to rabid pickme women.  

Dani Leigh abused darker skinned Black women when she went out of her way to make a song disparaging them.  Notice that she did this to the least protected group of women in üá∫üá∏ .  It is important that we name and call out behavior accurately.  I do not use the word abusive lightly but the abuse of Black women is so normalized that people find 1,001 ways to call it by any other name.  

Black women were even kind enough to warn her that she was playing with üóë and she turned around and called them jealous.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Realize that part of your impetus for defending her is because we all grow up within white supremacy where the person with most proximity to whiteness always gets more empathy, compassion and forgiveness than the darker person.  Many of you would not be defending her if her song had been abusive towards dogs but you think it‚Äôs okay what she did to Black women.üßê

I‚Äôm light skinned and I‚Äôve been able to see through this colorist bullshit since I was like 7 so stop making excuses for women that oppress you and/or harm other women.  Also, I mentioned that I‚Äôm light skinned because some of you are only willing to listen to people who are closer to whiteness.  (Again, do you see how that is white supremacy at work?  Many Black woman will say the same thing I‚Äôm saying and will be called jealous but when I say it ü§Ø‚Ä¶)

üí°Shame has a time and a place.  When you don‚Äôt know any better or it is beyond your control, then no reason to feel shame.  Do NOT feel ashamed that you were abused or grew up in poverty.  

But when you do know better and choose to willingly hurt people, shame on you.  When you perpetuate racism, colorism, exploitation, shame on you.  

Understand that as humans, our ancestors would exile a person or send them away &gt; the death penalty.  If you cannot behave as a decent person than sometimes you need to learn by feeling a dose of the cruelty you have inflicted onto others.

He died without a will. The small sum of money he had in the bank automatically went to his kids, to be held until they are 18 since they are under 18. If they were married, she would have automatically inherited it tax-free!

The children receive social security/survivor benefits, but she gets nothing.

She couldn't file a lawsuit regarding medical malpractice concerns against the hospital. She could sue on behalf of the children, but she herself had no right to sue.

Because they weren't married, his parents planned his funeral, not her. This is cultural, I guess, but still signifies the lack of respect for her role as a ""forever girlfriend"" rather than his wife/legally recognized life partner.

Six years of building a life with this man and when he died, legally, it was as if she was never his partner who contributed to his life and their family. It was no different than as if she had just been his ‚Äúbaby mama‚Äù with whom he co-parented and lived in a separate household from.

Ladies, there's a reason why LGBT groups were protesting and filing lawsuits all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court for the right to marry. There are over 1,000 legal rights and benefits that ""piece of paper"" gives you. [https://now.org/resource/civil-marriage-v-civil-unions/](https://now.org/resource/civil-marriage-v-civil-unions/)

Don't listen to the lie that if you just go speak to a lawyer and draft the documents, you will get these problems out of the way. Lies! You still won't be entitled to social security benefits, you will be taxed for anything he leaves you in a will, you have no right to be with him at the hospital, no right to sue on his behalf, no right to have access to his health insurance plan and hundreds of other benefits from being his legal next of kin!

Marriage exists to protect your children in case something were to happen to your or your partner. Marriage exists to protect one partner ( MAN or WOMAN) in case something were to happen to the other. Most importantly, marriage exists to protect the spouse who contributes to the marriage through unpaid labor from being exploited. (Yes, cleaning, cooking and raising kids is labor!)

The ""marriage is just a piece of paper"" saying is a lie. The U.S. Constitution is also just a piece of paper, do you hear men saying it is not that important?

UPDATE: Saw this post was crossed posted by some LVM scrotes on FDSredpill.  The things they said are not true. The father didn't ""leave the money to his kids."" When you die without a will and no spouse, the money automatically goes to your kids by law. And no, the mother doesn't get immediate access to the money the kids inherit because they are the parent.  If kids inherent money above a certain amount, the money is LEGALLY  REQUIRED  to be held in an account until the kids turn 18.",906.0

Or is the ideal FDS scenario that the guy pursues without needing an ""in"" first? 

I can see how showing interest first might make the guy think his work is cut out for him, but in theory one could initiate FDS vetting from that point forward? Or would it be dead on arrival?

922,t3_qullr8,Is the collapse of the middle class producing more LVM?,"Maybe it's just me, but it seems like a lot of the LV behaviors described on this sub are also low-class. I don't want to seem too negative about it because I don't want to demean anyone who's in poverty or came from a poor family, but the way I was raised, the shit that LVM get up to was simply unacceptable ""redneck"" behavior.

I'm almost 40. I grew up in an American Christian lower middle class household with boomer parents who both worked. Dad did skilled factory labor and mom was a nurse. They enforced real family values, a decent work ethic, and my dad didn't cheat or watch porn.

Other kids in my rural, impoverished town weren't as lucky as me. They had ""trailer trash"" parents with ""redneck"" values. They never had a chance. They didn't have parents who had aspirations for them. My best friend is unemployed and always broke. Another friend of mine is broke and lives with her parents because she had to help raise her sister's fatherless children. Another friend of mine is a Forever Girlfriend with kids, and her sister got pregnant in high school and married a redneck NVM and works OnlyFans for extra cash.

Meanwhile, my brother and sister are married to HV people and live in nice middle class homes, with kids. I'm alone but childless and never divorced; I own a condo and can afford occasional luxuries despite having a single income. Although I've sometimes wondered if my parents' success came from having a little extra money and not from their beliefs. It's a chicken-and-the-egg mystery.

My boomer parents benefited from their time and place. The job my dad retired from literally doesn't exist anymore, and he got a pension. Boomers don't appreciate how much harder things are millennials and gen Z. Could it be that Middle class values of old might be eroding away along with the middle class? Poverty pushes people into more desperate, stressful situations. As more middle class generations fall *down* the economic ladder, are they becoming ""trailer trash""/""ghetto"" themselves?

But this isn't about Christian supremacy, though. My brother doesn't go to church at all but still manages to not cheat. I think it's more about the culture. There may be a correlation between ""family values"" and HV behaviors, but there's also lots of LVM and pickmes that are enabled by Christianity. NV trash men have always existed, and only recently have women become economically independent enough to walk away from them-- which is why I refuse to accept any argument that it's feminists' fault that the American traditional family ideal broke up. But the core values of a good HVM in the past and today are also the core values of a good middle class man, are they not?",752.0

Now I'm in my late 40s and I wouldn't really call myself experienced. I've had 5 serious boyfriends my entire life and only one did I not have to remind (nag) to take a shower.  I would have to beg my ex husband to bathe. It didn't bother him to go without a shower for 3 days. Oh my lord it was so nasty.  

My father and my brother were both extremely neat, so I never knew most men were slobs and had poor hygiene until I was college aged. I was sheltered, I guess. 

So I started thinking about comments previous men said to me on their dicks. Most said they didn't shake it more than 3 times after using the restroom because they didn't want to look like they were gay or playing with themselves. Washing your dick must fall under the same umbrella.  And it's not gay if it's you.  And why are you watching other men in the restroom?  And WTF is wrong with these guys thinking smelling like BO is ok?  

But who needs these stinky men??  At my age the vibrator is so much better.  It's always hard and makes me cum every time. No viagara necessary. No having to say it's ok, it happens to everyone and being disappointed.   P.S. it's not OK! I'm lying to you, you scrote!

930,t3_qu465c,The reason why men marry some women and not others. Warning! ‚ö†Ô∏è Long post.,"[This article from 2016 blew my mind](https://www.today.com/health/reason-why-men-marry-some-women-not-others-t74671)*.*

*TLDR; Two market researchers, did a study about why some men marry and why some don't. This study used focus groups, 1-1 interviews, and surveying. However, please read the article so it can give you a full picture of the study.*

I'm going to bullet point some of my favorite excerpts from the article. Some of these excerpts really enraged me but offered valuable insight. I'd love to hear all your thoughts about this.

* Most men who graduate from high school start thinking of marriage as a real possibility when they are 23 or 24.
* Most men who graduate from college don‚Äôt start considering marriage as a real possibility until age 26.
* When men go to graduate school, it takes them longer to get into the working world, and they‚Äôre not ready to get married until a few years after that.
* 90% of men who have graduated from college are ready for the next step between ages 26 and 33; this is when they are most likely to consider marriage. But this window of opportunity stays open only for four to five years, and then the chances a man will marry **start to decline.**
* A majority of college graduates between 28 and 33 are in their high-commitment years and likely to propose.
* This period for well-educated men lasts just a bit over five years. The chances men will commit are sightly less when they are thirty-one or thirty-two than when they were between 28 and 30, but they‚Äôre still in a **high-commitment phase. (&lt; remember that term)**
* Once men reach 33 or 34, the chances they‚Äôll commit start to diminish, but only slightly. Until men reach 37, they remain very good prospects.
* After age 38, the chances they will ever marry **drop dramatically.**
* The chances that a man will marry for the first time diminish even more once he reaches 42 or 43. At this point, many men become confirmed bachelors.
* Once men reach age 47 to 50 without marrying, the chances they will marry **do not disappear**, but they **drop dramatically.**
* \[After getting out of school\] many look at time spent as a carefree bachelor as a rite of passage. So for the first few years that they‚Äôre on their own, their primary goal is having fun, which translates into dating without any serious thoughts about marriage.
* For men who go to graduate school-doctors, lawyers, and the like-the high-commitment period runs from 30 to 36.
* Men whose friends and siblings are married are more likely to marry.

**The singles scene is full of kids**

""When we conducted a focus group with 12 men who had just proposed to women, we learned that men were far more likely to marry when they got tired of the singles scene.""

""Many men reluctantly admitted that for **more than a year**, they had felt uncomfortable in the singles world where they had been hanging out for the past five years.""

""All three admitted under questioning that when they had started hanging out in ‚Äútheir‚Äù singles place, they too were teenyboppers or kids. They had simply gotten too old for the crowd.""

""So there is a point at which men are likely to be ready for the next step, but the specific age depends on the man‚Äôs maturity, education, and profession. There were two notable exceptions to the age guidelines: men who were balding or heavy. Losing hair or putting on weight often makes men look older, and when a man looks older in a singles places, he is often treated by the women as if he doesn‚Äôt. belong.""

**Stringers** (my favorite part of the article. Please read the article, it has more)

""If you‚Äôre dating a man who has had one or more long-term relationships with other women and didn‚Äôt marry them, there‚Äôs a real possibility he‚Äôs a stringer. A stringer is a man who strings women along. He likes having a woman, sleeping with a woman, eating with a woman, possibly sharing his life with a woman without ever making a real commitment. He often tells women, upfront, he never intends to marry, so if and when he decides he wants to cut out, she has no reason to complain.

If you think you may be involved with a stringer, establish a deadline. If he doesn‚Äôt commit to you within six months, get rid of him. Pay no attention to his excuses. He may tell you that you‚Äôre coming on too strong. He may complain that the two of you haven‚Äôt been going together long enough, that he doesn‚Äôt know, that he hasn‚Äôt made up his mind. In fact, he is likely to tell you anything that will get you to stick around without his needing to make a commitment. Don‚Äôt fall for it. The chances a stringer will marry are very slim; he is simply not the marrying kind. Earlier I mentioned those men who went with one woman for a time, then shortly thereafter went out and married another. This was the pattern.

If you meet a man who has had a long-term relationship, make it clear to him that if he dates you for a certain length of time, you‚Äôll expect a ring. If he doesn‚Äôt understand that, you haven‚Äôt done your job. Don‚Äôt think his affirmative response to such a declaration is a precursor to his making a commitment. He‚Äôs strung many women along, and he may try it with you. If after six months you don‚Äôt have a firm commitment, leave.""

**Parents' marriage**

Another factor that determines whether a man is likely to get married is the success, or lack thereof, of his parent's marriage. We found that many single men and women in their late thirties and forties were products of divorce. Men from divorced homes do marry, but they‚Äôre a bit reluctant to do so. Often the women had to drag them to the altar. **The marital status of a man‚Äôs parents is one of the first things you want to find out.**

**I completely ignored the ""Unpolished jewels"" section. Men are responsible for marriage and if they still can't a woman who's also looking for marriage then they aren't looking hard enough and aren't working hard enough to satisfy the woman.**

What I got from this read: Men have absolutely nothing to lose when they decide to stay a bachelor and to be wary of those who just left the ""singles scene"" because they could just be settling for anyone that'll have them. Meanwhile, most women marry for security, financial or otherwise, and to start a family. Men don't care for any of that because modern feminists have made it SO easy for them to never actually commit.

Edit:  1) I actually mean lib fem. Not feminism as a whole. 2) The portion where it says to make it clear that you'll expect a ring is something I don't really agree with but I think I know where the author is coming from. Men aren't stupid. They know exactly what they're doing. Personally, I think every man should propose to the woman he loves and the woman should have the agency to say yes or no. If he doesn't do it in a timely manner, a time of your choosing, onto the next. Men make it VERY clear if they intend to marry you. ",669.0

935,t3_qu0ber,Beware of fuckboys who pretend to be HVM - mistakes I've made and how I dodged a bullet!,"Recently I've had a curious experience dating a man who ended up being a jerk - but this experience was useful for giving me many lessons on how LVM have evolved and can now behave like HVM if all they want is sex. I'll describe here their tactics as the dates progress, how they pretend to be HVM and what signs you should be paying attention to in order to dodge a bullet and not waste your time like I did (I didn't have sex with him, but I wasted my time anyway).

**INITIAL CONTACT**

* **HOW HE PRETENDS TO BE A HVM:**
   * If you met him online, his profile will be very well written, he won't have any attention-grabbing or shirtless pics, he'll look very dignified, like a man you could proudly introduce to his parents;
   * He'll be very polite and attentive. He doesn't make any grammar mistakes, he's clever and has a good vocabulary;
   * He seemingly respects your boundaries - if you're talking on Tinder he asks for your number in a very polite and careful way, saying ""Can I have your number? But I'll understand if you want to keep talking here, it's alright""
* **SIGNS HE'S A FUCKBOY:**
   * He'll be very compatible with you right from the beginning. Of course there are cases in which people are genuinely compatible but it'll feel like he's faking compatibility. It feels too good to be true. He always likes everything you do. If you want to test him, say you like a certain band or movie. He'll say he loves it, too. And when he says that, you say ""Yeah, but you know... maybe it's not really that good. I don't like this and that about it"". If he agrees with you again, be careful. It's a red flag.
   * He'll want to text you for hours at the beginning. He'll try to force intimacy and so it goes.
   * He'll ask you out after one or two days texting. Maybe he'll ask you out on the same day. HVM don't do that. They want to make sure you're not crazy and that you're dignified and compatible enough to go out with them.
   * Love bombing. Yeah, he'll begin with the daily ""Good morning"" texts right from the beginning. There's nothing wrong with good morning texts per se, but if he tries to talk to you all day long, calls you ""babe"", pampers you a lot from the beginning and is too eager to know all the details of your schedule, be careful.
* **MY MISTAKE:**
   * He asked me out two days after we started talking . He proposed me a dinner date on a weekday and I accepted it. I should have known better and postpone it and make it happen during the weekend, so that I could get to know him better and perhaps vet him before meeting him.

**FIRST DATE**

* **HOW HE PRETENDS TO BE A HVM:**
   * He'll invite you to a dinner date on a nice restaurant. It's not some effortless bullshit, he wants to know what kind of food you'd like to eat and so it goes.
   * HE WILL NEVER GO DUTCH. HE WILL ALWAYS PAY FOR EVERYTHING.
   * He'll be willing to pick you up at your place. (I don't recommend accepting it because you don't really know the guy very well)
   * If you tell him you'd rather go to the restaurant by yourself or by Uber, he doesn't freak out. He seems cool and understanding.
   * He doesn't flake, he gets there on time. He's very punctual.
   * He is very talkative, seems very interested in you, knows how to talk about everything, is polite to you and to everyone. He knows how to make you feel comfortable and safe.
* **SIGNS HE'S A FUCKBOY:**
   * HE KNOWS THE ENTIRE STAFF OF THE RESTAURANT: beware! This is a very tricky one. If he knows everybody in the restaurant, it's a sign that perhaps he brings all his girls there. This guy I met knew all the waiters by name. I should have known better, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt - never give him the benefit of the doubt.
   * HE'S TOO ATTRACTIVE: I know there are many attractive HVM out there, but if the guy is jaw-dropping hot, beware. This guy I met was absurdly hot and I felt the sparks the moment I saw him.
   * HE SEEMS ABSURDLY ATTRACTED TO YOU: Of course we want men to be attracted to us, but this guy is WAY TOO ATTRACTED TO YOU. This guy I met was literally jaw-dropped the moment he looked at me. It was an incredibly intense and romantic moment, I won't deny that, and it felt like something out of a romantic comedy. But if it's too good to be true, it probably is. Narcissists and dangerous men have a specific way to look at women and make them feel seduced - it's the narcissistic stare. Be careful!
   * HE'LL TRY TO GET PHYSICAL VERY FAST: he'll try to kiss you or hug you very quickly during the first date. In my case, he said I looked much more beautiful in person and when I said he also looked much more handsome in person, he said ""If you don't mind, I need to do this"", and he gave me a light kiss on my lips. I found that endearing, but now, looking retrospectively, there were RED FLAGS EVERYWHERE.
   * HE'S A VERY GOOD KISSER: if he's a very good kisser, if physical contact with him feels addictive and too good to handle, beware. He may be a HVM who knows how to kiss, but he may also be a very experienced fuckboy.

**AFTER THE FIRST DATE**

* **HOW HE PRETENDS TO BE A HVM:**
   * He won't mention sex, he won't try to have a ONS with you;
   * He'll drive you home, if you feel safe around him;
   * He'll give a polite goodnight kiss, no sexual innuendoes involved;
   * He'll text you as soon as he gets home, telling you he had an amazing night and that he's too eager to meet you again. He'll even schedule the next date with you (my guy did that, and I felt like I had finally met a HVM).
* **SIGNS HE'S A FUCKBOY**
   * Love bombing continues for the next few days. Texting all the time, he'll send you videos, pictures of himself, songs he likes, he'll ask you 3 times a day how you're doing and what you're doing, he'll try to get to know every single detail about your schedule and when you're doing any activity he'll ask who you're doing it with. You'll soon feel like he's head over heels for you.
   * He'll mention details of the first date saying ""Wow it was so amazing, you're so gorgeous, it was the best first date I've had in a lifetime""and so it goes. HVM don't do that. Why? Because they don't want to scare you off by seeming too eager or desperate.
   * He'll try to make you sext. Now this one is a major red flag. If this happens, block and delete the bastard.
* **MY MISTAKE**
   * When my guy tried to make me sext, of course I REFUSED TO DO SO. NEVER SEXT A GUY IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD SEX WITH HIM YET. The problem is that I just said ""Well, I don't want to talk about these things so soon"". But I didn't block and delete him immediately because I was very attracted to him and I thought he had many HVM qualities. I should have just blocked him, because that was a clear sign he was a LVM.

&amp;#x200B;

* **SECOND DATE AND FOLLOWING STEPS**
* **MORE SIGNS HE'S A FUCKBOY**
   * He'll try to have a date in the movies so that you guys can make out. But there won't be dinner involved, just movies and perhaps coffee. His efforts for the second date will be smaller than those for the first date. No more dinner dates, just movies and coffee. He won't ask you to Netflix and chill, because he's still pretending to be boyfriend material to you.
   * He'll be more flirtatious and more pushy, sexually speaking. He'll try to make you talk about sex.
   * He'll give you clear signs of immaturity - perhaps he's way too close to his mother, or gives signs of emotional unavailability, or shows he's a manchild, or needs constant validation. If he asks you things like ""Do I look good? Do you find me attractive?"", beware. My guy told me his friends said he looked like a famous actor and he one day asked me ""Do you think I look like him?"" and I found that absurdly attention-grabbing and ridiculous.
   * After the second date he'll mention sex or perhaps ask you out on a date in which you know sex will inevitably happen. In my case, he asked me to go on a weekend trip with me to the countryside to watch movies and relax. I told him I wasn't ready for that and that sex would only happen if I really trusted a man.
   * His texting habits are not consistent. He leaves you on read on Friday afternoon only to answer you on Saturday morning. He disappears during the weekends and then texts you on Monday as if nothing had happened. He takes hours to answer you on weekends and only texts you during week days.
   * HE'S DATING OTHER WOMEN: He'll never want to see you during weekends because he has other options. He's rotating among the other girls he's dating, and if he realizes he won't have sex with you very soon, you'll soon become a backup. You'll stop being a priority and he'll start pulling away. If you want to test if he's dating other women or not, just try to schedule a date on Friday, Saturday or Sunday and watch him bail.

**WHY YOU SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR YOU'LL ONLY HAVE SEX IN A RELATIONSHIP**

* After the second date, when that guy tried to make me go to the countryside with him to have sex with him, **I only told him sex would only happen if I really trusted a guy.** I tried to be subtle, because I didn't want to scare him off by mentioning my need to be in a relationship so soon. I thought he'd get the clue and I thought we'd build enough emotional intimacy and that he'd eventually want to become exclusive before having sex.
* **WHY MY STRATEGY WAS WRONG:** the minute I said I wanted to have sex only when I felt safe and trusted him, he started to FAKE INTIMACY LIKE MAD. He wanted to Facetime every evening and he would talk to me for hours, saying he loved talking to me and that he adored me and found me amazing. I was very attracted to him so I fell for that, and I thought we were really having a real emotional connection. (Based on this experience, I made a post on how you should NEVER give emotional support to a man who's not a boyfriend, you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/qqukmx/dont_waste_your_time_giving_emotional_support_to/)) But I didn't realize that he was just MANIPULATING ME - he wanted me to feel safe around him, to trust him enough to have sex with him.
* **SAYING YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX IN AN EXCLUSIVE, COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP WILL ALWAYS WEED OUT PLAYERS AND LVM:** so in my case the third date happened and we had a very steamy makeout session. It was hot and very pleasant, and he asked me if I wanted to go to his place. I refused, but, since he was pretending to be a HVM, he didn't freak out and he seemed to be very understanding. That same night, after he had taken me home, he texted me and told me how much he desired me and how much he wanted to have sex with him. That's when I realized I had to tell him my real boundaries, so I called him and told him I'd only want to have sex in a committed, exclusive relationship. I also told him that if he didn't agree with that, I'd understand because I wouldn't pressure any man to be in a relationship with him.
* **FAKE HIGH VALUE MEN WILL ALWAYS PRETEND THEY UNDERSTAND YOUR BOUNDARIES:** this guy said ""Oh, it's okay, I'm not in a hurry, I'm loving to get to know you better. If you don't want to have sex right now, it's fine, we can wait."" If a man tells you that, don't go and think you've finally found the one. He may very well be bluffing.
* **FAKE HVM WILL NEVER BE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR INTENTIONS:** this guy used to say ""Well, it's not that I was looking for a relationship, but I'm open to the idea of having one"". If a man truly wants to find a girlfriend, he'll be EXPLICIT ABOUT IT. He'll say ""I WANT A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP."" He won't say anything different.
* **EDIT TO ADD - HVM WILL ALWAYS BE WILLING TO WAIT:** if they like you, they'll wait. They'll be content with making out and kissing until you guys are finally in a relationship and can finally have sex. IF A GUY IS TRULY HVM, he'll actually be RELIEVED that you're not sleeping around with many other guys while you're dating him.
* **IF HE STARTS PULLING AWAY AFTER HE KNOWS YOUR BOUNDARIES, HE'S A FUCKBOY:**  if you tell him you'll only have sex in a committed, exclusive relationship, and he starts pulling away, HE IS A FUCKBOY. No matter how understanding he seemed to be. Don't overthink it. You didn't do anything wrong. It's just a sign that sex was the only thing he was after.
* **WHY DOES HE PULL AWAY?** He pulls away to make you go chase after him and become desperate. He wants to trigger that fear of loss in you. If you fear losing him, you may very well lose your dignity and have sex with him only to make him stay with you. That's why you should NEVER chase a man or ask him out. If you ever do that, he'll try to make the date happen under his terms (eg: it'll be at his place, or you'll have to pay the bill) and he'll make the date happen in a way you'll inevitably have sex with him. AFTER HE PULLS AWAY, HE WILL ONLY GO OUT ON A DATE WITH YOU IF HE'S 100% SURE YOU'LL HAVE SEX WITH HIM, that's why he pulls away - he needs to create that fear of loss to make you go desperate and lose your dignity.
* **EDIT TO ADD - THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS - HIS ATTITUDE MUST MATCH HIS WORDS:**  I don't care if he says he adores you, I don't care if he's saying he'll introduce you to his family, and I don't care if he already says you're his girlfriend. DOES HIS ATTITUDE MATCH HIS SPEECH? Is he being consistent? Does he talk to you everyday? Does he leave you hanging? Does he disappear during weekends and then comes back texting you on Monday as if nothing had happened? Does he leave on read on Friday night only to answer you on Saturday? Is he stringing you along? Ask yourself these questions, pay attention to his ATTITUDES and take everything he says with a grain of salt if he doesn't seem to be really investing in you.
* **THINGS HE'LL START TO DO WHEN HE PULLS AWAY - THE SLOW FADE:**
* **Remember: men who pretend to be HVM never ghost you abruptly. They'll do the slow fade.**
   * He will be less affectionate through text
   * He'll still talk to you to keep you in the backburner, but now conversations will be shorter
   * No more pet names, no more ""babe""
   * If you text him, he'll always be too busy to talk to you
   * VERY CLEAR SIGN: HE'LL STOP ASKING YOU ABOUT YOUR DAY. He suddenly doesn't care if you're healthy or sick, dead or alive. You're the only one asking him questions.
   * He'll stop sending you videos, songs and etc.
   * He'll eventually stop texting you altogether.

**WHAT YOU SHOULD DO THE MOMENT HE PULLS AWAY:**

* DON'T CONTACT HIM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. If he were a HVM, he'd text you. He knows how to get in touch with you and during the beginning he KNEW VERY WELL how to do it.
* CELEBRATE IT. You've just dodged a bullet. Your strong standards and principles scared away a fuckboy, and we want to be fuckboy repellents.
* DON'T OVERTHINK IT. He didn't pull away because of anything you said. He didn't pull away because he didn't like you enough - trust me, he found you super attractive and interesting, so much that he was willing to play a fictional character in order to get into your pants. But he disappeared because he realized he couldn't manipulate you. He didn't leave you because you're mediocre or worthless. He left you because he realized you're a super HIGH VALUE WOMAN who cannot be played.
* BLOCK AND DELETE HIM. It's over now. And you didn't have sex with a selfish, manipulative scumbag, because fortunately you truly are a HIGH VALUE WOMAN who knows how to weed out bastards.

ETA - Thank you so much for the gold and the awards! I'm glad to be helpful!

Male companion verbalizes the error.

*This is good right?........not so fast.*

I had noticed the error right away, but \*I decide\* that my day/time/peace is more important to me than holding up the people behind me and, potentially, ruining the cashiers work-shift with a customer complaint. I decided to let it go and requested that he do the same. 

Male companion will not let the situation go, wants to call the manager to issue a re-fund. 

I walk away irritated that my own desires about my own money have been ignored. 

\*\***There are a couple of layers to this which I think are important to outline when vetting a partner.**\*\*

Isn't it romantic that someone will go to bat for you? Not exactly. Benevolent sexism can feel like someone having your back but it is rooted in the belief that *you are unable to watch your own back.*

This specific situation could be exacerbated by his feelings that you are bad with money, that he owns your money, that you are simply incapable of handling customer complaint situations appropriately, and/or he is cheap. NONE of which are good. 

***The ultimate goal is to have a partner that is protective of your interests like he protects his own WHILE respecting that you are the ultimate decider of your own life both in large and small things. \*\*AND he is ok living with the consequences of your choice.\*\****

&amp;#x200B;

Other instances of benevolent sexism that, when combined with the feels of a romantic partner, one may confuse as protective behavior:

1. Making suggestions on what you *should (according to him)* be eating to be what he considers """"healthy.""""
   1. Vetting Strategy: Tell him that you're open to try anything he shops and cooks for you but only on a day that fits into your own diet plan.
2. Side-seat driving. You know the directions to a place, but he points out turns and """"reminds"""" you of the speed limit or that there is a car in your blind spot.
   1. Vetting Strategy: Gray Rock
      1. does he continue or get more """"helpful"""" or recognize his error?
3. What price you pay for make-up or clothes...that he knows """"good quality"""" for cheaper.

942,t3_qtvsn8,becoming an older woman is the best in most ways,"Physically, you have to do more and keep on top of your diet and exercise. Sarcopenia is real, and I'm fighting it. However, I've looked at those videos and pictures of older women who lift heavy, and they do NOT look their age. All of them consistently look 15-20 years younger. That's what I aspire to. I'm also aware that when I'm in my 70s and look like I'm in my late 40s/early 50s, there will be jealousy to deal with, but whatever, I don't care. I'm doing this for me, not to appeal to the male gaze or to one-up any other woman. 

I was a pickme when younger, like most of us were, but it never sat right, just as libfem ideals sat almost but never quite right and eventually just seemed ridiculous and toxic. Over time, I learned to put me first, to vet as best I could. I learned the hard way from two marriages over 25 years what a LVM was and what a HVM was. Second time around, very happy but he was older, unwell, and never again will I be a nurse and a purse. Now with FDS, after five years of being widowed, now that I'm no longer a caregiver to my late dad, I feel like I'm ready to date again.

So why is it better overall as an older woman trying to date? Things are a lot more real. No hormones in the way, so there's no limerence or crushes or idealization. I've learned to see myself just as I am, warts and all, strengths, weaknesses, mediocre bits I'm still and probably always will be working on. I accept all of me. I know what I have to have in a partner, what would be nice to have, what I absolutely won't stand for. Lots of that I didn't know when younger, or I knew as much as I could. 

What pisses me off now is how society treats all women's preferences as optional, as pliable, plastic, easily changed. That to me makes my preferences that much more rigid and unbending due to lack of respect from society, from men in particular. Particular case in point: I'm not moving from this state; my family and friends are here. Wherever I am, I want family and friends close by, so there's no way some scrote is going to isolate me. Had that happen during the first marriage -- dude kept vipers in the house (in cages of course). Eventually no one visited; I had to go to other people's houses. So yeah, moving is non-negotiable. You're not moving to be close to me? Kthxbye, it won't work. Vetting in action.

With men, the vetting is nearly instantaneous simpliy by how I'm treated. Am I looked at, at all? If so, is it a look of respect, kindness, openness, interest? Quite honestly the eye contact and physical proximity is the biggest tell of all. What they say to me, how they say it is the next tell. At work, I've noticed a few men there simply won't even look at me at all, and I think it's because I'm older, confident, and I outrank them educationally. I also think it's because I have a voice and use it, and don't hesitate to say how things should be done, or ask questions. I think it REALLY intimidates some men that I have a voice at all, put forth cogent, cohesive thoughts, ask questions, and can give directions that people just naturally obey quickly, because what I ask people to do makes sense, isn't something I wouldn't do myself unless I physically can't, and is reasonable. 

I'm also a mature woman, not a girl, and I look the part. No dressing young; I dress my age, casually, comfortably. No acting coy, shy, or demure, but I'm also not loud or aggressive, either (but can become so if the situation warrants it, ie a man is threatening or acting stupid and I've had enough). Tiktok goddess was right: ya don't have to grow as a human being when you're dating a 19 year old.

944,t3_qtv4i8,Grown ass 30+ year old men taking highschool/college girls way too seriously,"Anyone else notice how grown-ass manosphere guys (like 25-50+ year olds) on Youtube and TikTok keep making reaction videos to 18 year old girls (or even younger)? I saw one earlier where a 35 year old scrote was getting all butthurt over some college freshman girl's TikTok of her and her friends having fun and laughing over a 'strike' list they made for the guys they date (like a '3 strikes you're out' kinda thing).

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, why are they mad over girls setting standards and boundaries for the men they date? More importantly, why are these GROWN ASS men getting so butthurt over college girls having fun with their friends? Why are they being so critical of girls who are fresh out of high school and haven't even experienced the real world? To me, this is very creepy (as a 22 year old who has been seeing that content online since I was a teen) like why are they even watching that stuff when they're way past their high school and college days?  Some of it can be another form of victim-blaming where they blame literal teenagers for getting sexually assaulted or harassed.

&amp;#x200B;

When men view a girl as attractive, even if she if still a teenager, they think of them and talk to them like they're grown-ass adults (when it comes to sex and dating). If you've ever seen those 'To Catch A Predator' type of shows, this is made very clear when 50-year-old men have very sexually explicit conversations with 14-year-old girls.

&amp;#x200B;

Same concept kinda applies to these manosphere guys who are overly critical of literal teenagers. These guys find these girls attractive, so they assume they have matured/developed mentalities when it comes to sex and relationships. They think their criticisms of these girls are valid because they ""should have known better"", when most of the time, they LITERALLY DIDNT KNOW ANY BETTER BECAUSE THEY ARE FREAKING TEENS!!!!

...FDS and bi-weekly therapy üòÇ. Wanted to share my journey post LVX breakup in the hopes it helps someone else.

The breakup:
'Wanted different things' is the simplest explanation. Namely, I wanted to marry him and he wanted to get drunk in the tropics and ""meet people at bars."" Ok fine - I was a pickMe and this was my medicine.

The hurt I couldn't get over:

If I was his best friend and ""soulmate"" and ""partner"" (his words) - why couldn't he have been honest with me and say ""I'm unhappy in this relationship and want to leave."" Instead I had to drag it out of him and say ""do you want to breakup??"" It really stung to know I'd been sleeping next to someone who wasn't attracted to me any more and wasn't going to ever tell me, instead he was just going to stop having sex with me and make me think it was my fault.

****50/50 is a complete and utter scam and I never would have seen it without FDS:****

LVX was all about 50/50. We used an app to literally split everything. Guess who liked fancy bars with expensive cocktails more? Guess who wanted to order dominoes at 2am? Guess who hated grocery shopping yet loved my cooking?? 

If you're hesitant about the 50/50 rule think about it this way: you'll be paying for 50% of HIS life, he's not paying for 50% of yours.

Where was my 50% contribution to therapy costs which he graciously benefited from? Where was my 50% contribution to all the nights he slept in my bed at my apartment which was 2x the price of his and better/cleaner/calmer/more aesthetically pleasing than his w cokehead roomies and cats (he was allergic and moved into a 5br w 2 cats ü§°). Oh and he also made 20k more than my salary and daddy paid his medical bills. But ""splitting things evenly is mY pHiLoSoPhY"" yeah. Okay. Turd.


Going NC and finding FDS:

Shortly after I went NC (~3mo after breakup) and bc he was still trying to use me as emotional mommy I googled ""dating subreddit for women only"" etc etc and found FDS! I had been looking at r--/OLD/tinder/bumble you name it - and everywhere I looked it was **drumroll please** MEN COMPLAINING ABOUT LACK OF MATCHES. As if that's the problem. As if the apps aren't designed to use women as bait and take money from ugly men. As if having a match = having a chance. It doesn't. It's all a scam. Women are the product and we're not fairly compensated nor protected. 

I knew if I posted anything in those subs about being an attractive women struggling to understand my breakup and finding it difficult for men to want to date me instead of use me the responses I would get: ""yeah but it's easy for you bc you're a woman!"" ""Oh boo hoo someone wants to have casual sex w you"" again. No thank you.

Also - wtf is up with all these unsuccessful nerds giving ""advice"" in OLD subs?? Why would I take advice on how to build a house from someone who's never been let inside one?? Get outta here with that ü§°nonsense.

Back to FDS:

I read the handbook ~shook~ you're telling me I should have listened to my gut from the beginning and saved myself the heartache?? HOLY SHIT THANK YOU. Everything else out there is ""talk it through, tell him how much he hurt you"" etc etc - how about ""here's how to protect yourself and not waste your time."" Revolutionary! FWIW im grateful for the relationship I learned a lot and it brought me to FDS.

The biggest comfort FDS brought was knowing so many other beautiful women were experiencing the same struggle. And the safety to talk about it in an all-female sub. I cannot stress how relaxed I felt when I realized not just anyone could post here. Yes I was annoyed at first when my comments got auto-deleted bc I wasn't flaired. But that also told me they weren't going to let just anyone thru. 

***Sidebar - Message to Reddit Corp:
I've been on Reddit for 5+ years and FDS is the first (and only) subreddit I felt safe posting as a woman.***

For me now Reddit = FDS. It's literally the point. To come together with women strangers in a safe haven and discuss our lives without fear of being attacked/harassed.

Back to dating:

I'm ready to try again and I have SO many more tools at my disposal. I no longer feel guilty about changing my mind about a guy who makes me uncomfortable over text, or complains about his job, or negs me even the tiniest bit. I say ""no thanks!"" And block/delete. So much more PEACE. I never realized how much I felt I owed men: an explanation, a chance, my body, my time, my emotional energy, my sanctuary of being. Thanks to FDS (and therapy) I can go into a new dynamic without the weight of trying to make him like me, he either will or he won't. 

Some revelations:

	‚ÅÉ	if a man likes you and wants to impress you, he WILL ask you to dinner and he WILL pay. 
	‚ÅÉ	reduce attachment by not saving their # until after first date (and you know you want to see them again)
	‚ÅÉ	embrace the silence: you don't need to fill every gap in conversation irl or in text. Wait to see what he says. How does it feel to sit in silence with him? Are you nervous or do you feel calm.
	‚ÅÉ	if he doesn't post his height - ASK HIM - make sure he meets your standards and if he shows an ounce of defensiveness or flips out - drop him.
	‚ÅÉ	listen to his VOICE - I might do another post on poly-vegal theory which is that our nervous systems are constantly vetting for safety and small signs like vocal patterns convey significant messages. If you pick up weaselly, weak, whiny, weird vibes from his voice GET OUT - that's your eons old nervous system stepping up to bat.

and 2., Uses ""spiritual"" mumbo-jumbo to imply that women are ""naturally submissive"" and it just ""takes the right guy"" to ""bring out your submissive feminine energy"". This is nothing but thinly veiled pick-me behavior behind spiritual jargon, and I am embarrassed to say that this used to be my thought process 2 years ago.

All it took was a little introspection about my own feelings: When all is said and done, do you like feeling ""dominated"", sexually or otherwise? Do you want to be labeled as ""submissive""? I always got a feeling of irritation and annoyance, even when my boyfriend would make ""jokes"" about dominating or degrading me sexually. Even in my pick-me days, I struggled with pretending like I was okay with these labels. I see now that I subconsciously believed that this was the only middle ground between men who are either wimpy and incompetent, or straight up abusive.

I do not understand why men want you to be enthusiastically submissive when no living creature on this earth, not even an animal, willingly submits to another. I will never even attempt to understand why they would want that as opposed to an equal. However, I now know to steer clear of males who expect submission in a relationship, and pick-me girls who try to normalize being a doormat.",224.0
949,t3_qtb6nw,Love Hard - Netflix Film - Does anyone else see the red flags?,"Hi everyone,

I recently brought up at work how I watched Love Hard and thought it sent some pretty terrible messages to women about what behaviour is acceptable and isn't acceptable in a potential partner. My coworkers seemed to think I was overreacting and I was curious if any of you have seen it and what your thoughts were? I know its a ""just for fun"" movie but the fact it's on Netflix and shows a guy getting away with cat fishing someone out of his league REALLY rubs me the wrong way. It also confused me that no one else seemed to be bothered by this and made me question my sanity. I support my beliefs though but thought I'd ask for your thoughts too. Pretty sure those who disagreed with me married their first ever boyfriends and don't have the same experiences I've had to potentially see the red flags I saw throughout this movie.

Being a recovering people-pleaser that I am, I gave him my number and I instantly regretted it. I knew that I was going to reject him on text if he was going to text me. I guess I didn‚Äôt want to feel like facing rejecting someone in person. I gotta work on this, still!!

- Tried to shorten my name when putting in his phone (I have a non Anglo-Saxon name and it‚Äôs very important to me that people pronounce it exactly as it should be, I think people are too darn lazy with ethnic names, so this was a LV behavior I thought)
- His dog didn‚Äôt look well, lots and lots of dust and dirt in his fur - did this guy even care for his dog??
- His face was riddled with acne scars and he wasn‚Äôt attractive
- Flaunted his businesses like I should be impressed by it
- My intuition was saying he was physically unwell or possibly a drinker, his speech wasn‚Äôt clear and I could pick up that he had trouble expressing himself clearly, sort of moving his head side to side, his body showed a lack of confidence - I‚Äôm currently staying away from men who drink - I decided to listen to my gut and not question it

Sent him a text saying I wasn‚Äôt interested and wished him all the best. I was proud of myself that I didn‚Äôt spend much time with him, or gave into the freaking ‚Äúdog walk date‚Äù under the fake premise that he just ‚Äúwants to chat about my hobbies‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Eventually, I may start dating again - if nothing else, then just for fun. Get to know people. See what dating is like after a decade of being away. I don‚Äôt feel any pressure to pair up again. I was choosy before, and knowing the best side of things had only made me more so.

With that being said, today I talked to a family friend who asked, not for the first time, how I‚Äôve always been so lucky with the men I date. My relationship history isn‚Äôt as glorious as she imagines; I‚Äôve made mistakes. I‚Äôve stayed with the wrong people. For the most part, I‚Äôve avoided major things, unlike her.

What‚Äôs my secret? Turmeric, and a dash of cinnamon.

No, no, that‚Äôs not really it!

My actual main method has served me well: demand the bare minimum, which is‚Ä¶

- He has to be single. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs only staying for the kids (lol; I can‚Äôt believe some women actually believe this. Level up, sisters!), or that his ex would be devastated if he left her (and she won‚Äôt be devastated if he cheats? Come on!) I‚Äôm not playing with ‚Äúwe‚Äôre effectively separate‚Äù and ‚Äúwe lead completely separate lives.‚Äù *He has to be single,* and over his previous relationship, too. His multiple year relationship ended just last week? His divorce was finalized three months ago? Congrats‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm not interested.

- Unless he and his ex have kids together, there‚Äôs no reason for them to remain in close contact. Even then, there are limits. Everyone is going to Disneyworld for Timmy‚Äôs birthday, and staying in the same room to fulfill his fantasy of the family being together? Great! Go on with your bad self, but I‚Äôm not sticking around for this. (And let‚Äôs be real: I would never have stuck around this far because these situations tend to be riddled with red flags and poor boundaries.)

- No cheaters, or even a hint thereof. I feel like this is the most basic of the basic requirements, but I‚Äôve seen a lot of women repeatedly take back a cheater or lie to themselves. Not me. I get so much as a whiff, and I‚Äôm gone. Save the explanations for your scrote buddies who will try to convince you I‚Äôm unreasonable because it‚Äôs not like you had feeling for whoever you cheated with.

- Pressure me for sex and find yourself out the door. I define pressure as whining, cajoling, and/or outright asking before I‚Äôm ready - and especially if he persists after I tell him we don‚Äôt know each other well enough.

I have other expectations, of course, but the list above is the very minimum. I see so many women who make excuses when a man can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt do the above, and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Why are you sticking around? It doesn‚Äôt get any better if he can‚Äôt even do these basic things.

As for bd$m stuff stop describing it as k1nky, rough, spicy or whatever. It's okay to have a really concerned look on your face or even look shocked when someone says they want to be ch0ked.if someone is telling you this then call it out and be like ""that's violence and that sounds abusive. Start calling it what it is: abu$e. 

If you hear your friend saying something like ""he got frisky with me, started putting his hands all over me, and we were just sitting at the bar and I wasn't into it"" again start calling it by the correct names: assault. 

If you hear your friend saying he was essentially trying to get her to have sex with him, started begging her or saying come on, or even how guys will use that bs line of saying ""we should see if we are sexually compatible, come on we both like each other so why not"" again call it what it is: sexual coercion

If you hear you friend telling you that her ex keeps making new numbers, trying to show up at her door, or even trying to ""catch her at work"" start calling it what it is: stalking and harassment.

Even if you hear your friend saying some guy asked her to come over for drinks at his place especially when she doesn't know him or it is the very early stages you should be looking concerned and express that by calling out exactly what it seems like: sounds like he wants to coerce you into sex and use alcohol

If your friend says how he slept with her when she was unsure, drunk, etc, then call it out as rape. 

Same with if someone is talking about how some male celebrities go after much younger women, with huge age gaps. Start calling it out as being predators and call it out as grooming. 

Often times society as well as our own family members, coworkers, and even our friends downplay the seriousness of men's depravity. This happened all the time when I was at college, my friends and classmates would constantly be sugar coating their experiences with men, even when they were coercing her, harassing her, and even when they were assaulted. 

My friend and I went into a crowded bar just after we turned 21, it was wall to wall people. People were walking past us and being crowded they couldn't help but bump into us or be brushing up. Some guys in passing though took advantage of the situation and were purposely grabbing and pinching womens butts as they walked passed. This happened to me three guys in a row and my friend as we were standing there. I started calling it out and got upset and my friend (a former friend now) giggled it off like he he they just go that, its a bar come on its crowded, they didn't mean to! This is the type of thing I am talking about. I was being groped and assaulted she was too this is an example of call it out by the proper terms. 

By calling things out by the proper names we can help others realize how wrong they are. Many women are still brainwashed into think coercion is normal. Many women who were actually raped or assaulted do not even realize it. You don't have to be or stay friends with people especially if they are pickmes but if you hear someone at your girls night out or group you attend describing something you should call it out or you can go over to them like a concerned friend and be like what you described before was actually assault and that's serious and you know you can report that.

This morning I went out to buy flowers for my mum's birthday. I got her a gorgeous set of lilies, something very small and simple to accompany her main gift. I spent less than 10‚Ç¨, and while I was paying the florist I found myself thinking: ""Damn, if a man *really* wanted to make you happy, he would"". It really takes almost nothing to buy nice flowers.

I was with my ex for four years, and he never got me flowers once, even though he knew I liked them. I, on the other hand, often got him little gifts to make him feel appreciated and show him I thought about him. The few times he got me something out of the blue, like food and sweets, it was always for the both of us. It came to the point where he didn't even get me Christmas gifts, because according to him ""it was a waste"". At the time I thought our relationship didn't need such ""superficial"" manifestations of romance, because LoVe Is AlL tHaT mAtTeRs. Right? Wrong. After four years of pretending I was happy with less than the bare minimum, he dumped me anyway. The usual destiny of the wannabe Cool Girl.

Today I walked home with this beautiful bouquet of lilies for my sweet mum, and told myself that I will never settle for struggle love ever again. Buying flowers and little gifts for your loved ones, even on a random day and not necessarily on special occasions, is a way of showing your affection. If you have to hide your disappointment and find excuses for your cheap, lazy partner, is your relationship really good for you? Are you really, *genuinely* happy?

By coincidence, I was now looking at [**this reel**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWJsFKhA4W4/) on Instagram and, whilst reading all the comments, I realised that women are constantly told that flowers - and romance in general - are lame, and that settling for a man who clearly doesn‚Äôt care about making you feel loved is the normal course of life. Not only this, we also end up *mocking* women who are cherished by their partners and expect romance in the form of flowers and gifts. Well, now I can say it loud and proud: couldn't be me, not anymore.

This year, my bf surprised me with concert tickets of a singer I really like and he made a very special and unique design for my birthday card. I was really touched by this because it shows that he listened to me when I talked about his music, researched this artist's concerts, found one in a city we want to travel to and he is gonna plan the trip for us.

In the past he would talk about having shared custody of his daughter and how her mom would take her during the day and he took her after school. (Rip off btw, he got prime time work hours while she had to work at night)

Anyway, I noticed he had the opportunity to have a carefree trip with his gf while his BM was at home struggling with their daughter. I was thinking maybe this wouldn‚Äôt have been possible if they were still together since they would have to make so many childcare arrangements etc. Also, I usually don‚Äôt notice couples with kids taking tons of trips alone without their children. Example: My other coworkers with families NEVER bring the wife along. Even if we are sent to a beautiful destination. Don‚Äôt even get me started on what they do on these business trips üëÄüëÄ

I realized it‚Äôs advantageous for them to have one woman as the incubator and one for ‚Äúfun‚Äù. Child support be damned, much cheaper than him supporting them as a family. This way they can play single and still have someone raising their young at home. Even if he doesn‚Äôt have sexual access,she is still providing a massive service. For free. Some men try to recreate this by having a mistress on the side while being married. They have no shame, they don‚Äôt care if they create broken families along as they are getting what they want. 

They get the feeling of passing on MuH lEgAcY while acting like a single bachelor ü§Æ They always accuse women of having a dual mating strategy when they ideally want both, a Madonna and a whore. 

Don‚Äôt bother incubating LVM seed.",458.0

Why so many of them think that we are choosing monogamy, because we are insecure? 

This subreddit have been such a great help to me, on my journey of leveling up, and  I wanted to know  about your experiences with polyamory. Is there any ex polyamorous women here? 

1) What was your journey towards  monogamy like? 

2) why did you choose an exclusive relationship over polyamory?

3) What is your answer to people who think that you outdated or immature or possessive for choosing an exclusive relationship?(especially for polyamorous women who think like that?)

Thank you in advance üòî",348.0
986,t3_qsk8s8,Wish I knew about FDS when I was younger,"When I think about all the dumb shit I put up with, the heartbreak, the LVM, the low standards I had - ughhh. And the pickme‚Äôs I was surrounded by‚Ä¶I feel so ashamed. I wish I knew about FDS in my early 20‚Äôs. I met a girl who subbed to FDS and she has made such awesome mature decisions in dating because of this sub as a early 20‚Äôs woman. I‚Äôm slowly trying to convert my friends over and it‚Äôs a challenge but I love them. The thing is FDS always proves me right. Honestly FDS is actual realistic feminism. Anyways sorry if this is low effort, just wanted to gush. The sources and handbook have been so helpful and have really helped me.",310.0
987,t3_qsgtq3,"I found FDS this month, and I have a new outlook on men and dating!","I'm from the middle east, and I am surrounded by LVMs and pickme girls. I always thought that I was doing something wrong, and that I should change myself more to appeal to men. I spent years feeling insecure and like shit because I didn't fit the ""criteria"" here. The girls I was surrounded with have always put me down, and gave me the worst advice. For example, my ex-roommate would freak out on me if I don't look like I'm going to a beauty pageant on the first date. So I started doing more to appeal to men on the first date, even though I looked great and dressed appropriately. It was only until now, did I realize that she never cared about me or she is a victim herself. 

Dating in the middle east is a nightmare. The men in my city are the worst. I still can't believe that I would give LVM a chance because I was na√Øve and stupid. In my culture, the man is responsible in providing for his family, but they are changing the narrative now and starting to blame woman that they have such high demands. The sad thing is that many women here are starting to date broke men that would cheat on them at the first chance possible.  Its a complete nightmare here, but FDS has changed my whole perspective. I know my worth now, and I know to never ever settle for a LVM. So thank you! and I am happy to be part of this group.",337.0
988,t3_qsjii9,"I'm so tired of seeing 'demisexual' tossed around like it's some sort of aberrant practice when really, it's just HEALTHY to want trust &amp; a connection with intimate partners.","*\*Disclaimer - I AM EXASPERATED. Please forgive my liberal use of italics and capitalization.*

In a reality not warped by pornsick men, 'demisexual' behavior is NORMAL, HEALTHY, and BASELINE.

Hookup culture is toxic and dangerous, and I won't be a part of it. I consider my desire to have trust and a connection before sex becomes a possibility to be entirely reasonable.

It's simple self-preservation. Pregnancy, disease, abuse, injury ...... You risk ALL OF THAT NONSENSE *continually*. WHY? Why would any sane being subject themselves to that?

I blame porn, I blame society, I blame *MEN* for ***allowing*** themselves to become so fucking warped that they can't even comprehend, and have the scrotacity to act *offended* that I am not going to jump in the sack with them *immediately*, and then act like I am asking them to cut off their genitals to respect me as a human being.

End of rant.

ETA; Getting a lot of comments saying this isn't what true demisexuality is ........ I know. Big part of what I'm complaining about is how it's used to label any woman who refuses to have sex at the drop of a hat.",1607.0
989,t3_qsj91m,"If he tells you to swallow his cum, tell him to swallow your period blood :)","Only half-joking. Can you imagine if women as a collective went around fantasizing about men ingesting our bodily fluids? 

Imagine if there were porn videos with millions of views titled, ""She makes him suck on her used tampon"" or ""Barely-legal choir boy gets menstrual blood smeared all over his pretty face"". Imagine if women pressured our boyfriends to drink our period blood directly from the source because iT's oUr kINk! Don't kinkshame!!!

I dated a guy who brushed his teeth and he kicked puppies for breakfast!""","One of the main reasons FDS gets so much hate is that we have standards and we dare to speak about them. Most people have standards even the ones who claim not to, they just lose their shit if women ever dare to mention some.


You can have the most basic, reasonable standard ever, that most people have. Still you will get attacked for it if you dare to mention it. 
Let's say you don't date people who don't brush their teeth. What kind of feedback are you going to get in most spaces outside of FDS? 




- Male mental health is so ignored! What if he has depression? You are literally Satan and the reason why some men want to unalive themselves.

- You are ableist! What if he has a condition that doesn't allow him to brush his teeth? What if he doesn't have teeth? What if he has ADHD?

- It's such a minor thing to care about, that's why you're gonna end up alone with cats! (Don't threaten me with a good time)

-Wow you are so shallow. What if he is the perfect guy for you, and this is just one thing that makes him imperfect?

- Oh yeah? Some of the men who brush their teeth are serial k%llers! Therefore you would be ok with dating one! Checkmate atheists. 

This last one is possibly the most common one. They think that the existence of bad people among the selected group is somehow an argument. If you want a man who has his life together financially, suddenly they'll remind you of all the horrible people that are wealthy. As if mentioning one standard means you stop caring about anything else.",498.0
