I know what you're thinking: Well men commit more crimes so this is a non-issue! But its more complicated than that.

Unfortunately, men can face discrimination in the legal system. For example, in the USA justice system, Sonja Starr found that men were being disadvantaged: [https://repository.law.umich.edu/law\_econ\_current/57/](https://repository.law.umich.edu/law_econ_current/57/)

""This paper assesses gender disparities in federal criminal cases. It finds large gender gaps favoring women throughout the sentence length distribution (averaging over 60%), conditional on arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge observables. Female arrestees are also significantly likelier to avoid charges and convictions entirely, and twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.""

This is one of the reasons men are more likely to go to jail than women. Anothe reason is the Duluth model which says that if a man and woman are in a relationship and someone calls the police the man should be arrested. This makes it seem that men are more likely to be abusers than men.

Men are often subjected to rape, torture, and other unpleasant experiences in prison. Many commit suicide or self harm.

Should prison and the death penalty be seen as a man's issue?

6,t3_rvrc33,[Study] Judgments About Male Victims of Sexual Assault by Women: A 35-Year Replication Study,"[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08862605211062990#.YdPt01KkROU.twitter](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08862605211062990#.YdPt01KkROU.twitter)

## Abstract

Sexual assault of men by women has received increasing attention in recent years, as has research on rape myths about male victims. This study is a cross-generational replication of a 1984 study of college students’ judgments about male and female victims in a scenario involving a sexual assault carried out by male or female assailants. The 1984 data (*n* = 172) were compared with those of a 2019 cohort (*n* = 372) in a 2 (participant gender) x 2 (assailant gender) x 2 (victim gender) x 2 (cohort) factorial design to assess potential generational changes in perceptions of victims. Judgments by male participants of male victims of assaults carried out by women changed notably over time. The 2019 male cohort was less likely to judge that the victim initiated or encouraged the incident (40% in 1984 compared with 15% in 2019) and derived pleasure from it (47.4% in 1984 compared with 5.8% in 2019). In contrast, the 2019 female cohort was more likely to attribute victim encouragement (26.9% compared with 4.3% in 1984) and pleasure to the male victim (25% in 2019 compared with 5% in 1984). A similar gender pattern occurred in judgments of how stressful the event was for the male victim. Analysis of the 2019 data revealed that overall, despite scientific and cultural shifts that have occurred over the past three decades, participants continued to judge the male victim of assault by a female to have been more encouraging and to have experienced more pleasure and less stress than in any other assailant/victim gender combination. Results are discussed in relation to gendered stereotypical beliefs and male rape myths, as well as possible sensitization to power differentials inspired by the #MeToo movement. We emphasize the need for greater awareness and empirical attention to abuse that runs counter to preconceived notions about sexual victimization.",41.0

She has a child, 2 year old baby, that she claims is mine. Since I have ""no legal rights,"" the child ""belongs to her""

Truth be told, don't judge me, I never wanted a child. I never liked this woman and I'm leaving out all the details regarding her insanity because I do NOT have all the time in the world to explain how demented she is.

Facts: \*I am not on the birth certificate and it's been 2 years.

\*They are in Europe and I'm in California (but she and the baby are US citizens)

\*She has no interest in having me in the child's life outside of financial support

\*I am willing to waive my rights in order to remove her from my life permanently

\*She helped administer a home DNA test, which was highly open to her manipulation. (came back that he is my child but she says the kid isn't mine when she gets mad, which makes me think there's something she knows that I don't.)

&amp;#x200B;

PS please don't virtue signal all over me and tell me I shouldn't have had sex with her or anything along those lines. That's a basic thought and doesn't contribute anything productive. I know some of you want children or can't see your children, I never wanted children, I never liked this woman, so don't judge me. She 100% plotted, took advantage of me, and baby trapped me to the fullest degree. I just want to remove myself from the equation entirely.

Here then is the motte and bailey fallacy of ""the patriarchy"" laid bare:

...

Definition 1: The Bailey

The Bailey is what I call the ""academic definition"" of patriarchy.

(taken from the sidebar of r/askfeminists)

""Patriarchy is a system in which men have all the power, women have none of the power, and men use their power (as a class) to oppress women (as a class)"".

Note that in the same sidebar the term ""power"" is left undefined.  This is no accident. This is the downfall of applying this definition to my society.  Where I live half of the ruling class are women, and it's been that way for quite some time.

This is the bailey.  It is easy to argue against this description of reality by imploring people to look around them and see who primarily benefits from our current societal conditions.  Are the people who live in the expensive houses, drive the nice cars, and wear the status clothes mostly men, mostly women, or about 50/50?

If you look at who is actually in the ruling class then my society is clearly not a ""patriarchy"" in the academic sense.

...

Definition 2: The Motte

The Motte is an easily defended proposition that has nothing to do with The Bailey, but is inherently robust, and close enough to the subject at hand to be substituted for the bailey when the bailey is called out as obviously false.

Here is the motte definition of ""The Patriarchy"":

""Look around you.  Do a head count of leaders (CEO's, elected officials, etc).  If 51% of them are men then it's a patriarchy.""

This definition of patriarchy has nothing to do with class oppression and proves *nothing* of the sort.  Under this definition, if 51% of leaders are male and 51% of leaders support gender equality, then we must live in a ""feminist patriarchy"".

There are videos on YouTube of men getting shot by police just for having a mental breakdown in public. Yet the anti-male media will only talk about the racial aspect of this, not the gender aspect, which is more concerning, considering the fact that 97% of people shot and killed by in police in 2020 were male.

Hello everyone, I made this page specifically to join this group. I AM AN ACTIVE DUTY DAD THAT WON FULL CUSTODY OF MY TWO LITTLE GIRLS WHILE STATIONED OVERSEAS. SHE FILED FOR FULL CUSTODY AFTER HER ATTEMPTS AT ALIENATION FAILED.  SHE KNEW MY CHILD SUPPORT WAS SKY HIGH SO SHE BANKED ON THE FACT THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD A CHILD CUSTODY BATTLE. I SOLD EVERYTHING EXCEPT MY FINGERNAILS TO ENSURE I FOUGHT FOR MY KIDS. I RECORDED EVERYTHING AND I KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT! I WON FULL CUSTODY. SHE WAS ASKED TO PAY $150 A MONTH WHICH SHE PAYS ONLY SOMETIMES!!!I PAID THOUSANDS IN CHILD SUPPORT! NOW SHE GETS TO PAY $150 WHENEVER SHE WANTS. THIS IS WHAT I DID TO FIGHT BACK!!!!!

1. RECORD EVERYTHING:  Please invest in a small recording device. (Please check state law with regards to filming) keep it with you at all times in case you run into the parent.
2. DO NOT REACT: There will be some disturbingly nasty things said to you, for the sole purpose of getting a reaction from you,  which could be used against you.
3. PUBLIC INTERACTIONS:  Abusers will utilize every interaction to their advantage, including  false accusations such as physical abuse etc.  Please schedule meetups at large businesses that have cameras.  Also bring along a witness when possible.
4. STAY OUT OF TROUBLE:  If you are serious about custody, it is imperitive that you maintain a clean police record because their attorneys will not hesitate to use it against you.
5. EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE:  Please organize any interaction with the other parent by date, correct heading etc. Example,  if the abuser punches you in the face, title the recording as punched in the face. You won't be left scrambling for evidence when you do go to court.
6. ASSUME THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS BEING RECORDED:  Please  assume that you're being recorded by the other parent, or their relatives that you may have interactions with.  They might be used by the other parent to gather  information. 7.WORK UNTIL YOUR EYEBALLS FALL OUT:  Chances are you've been  asked to pay child support while simultaneously fighting for custody or visitation.  The other parent  will stop at nothing to alienate you from your child, so you should stop at nothing fighting to be an active parent.  They also have the advantage of being the custodial parent. (Active brainwashing will be made a lot easier)
7. EXPECT YOUR KIDS TO HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED AND COACHED TO MAKING FALSE ACCUSATIONS:  It is never the kids fault, all you can do is show them who you are by your actions with the little time you might be given to see them. Encourage them to love both parents equally.
8. DO NOT EXPECT THE JUDGE TO KNOW WHAT THE ABUSER IS DOING TO YOU:  Many judges will view your case as just a number.  Thousands of custody hearings go through the court system with similar allegations being levied against a parent.  You may know all the things that the other parent is doing but remember the judge isn't there with you Everytime there is an altercation and so they're hearing it second hand from you.  Work as many hours as you can to retain a competent attorney that is able to successfully relay your concerns to the judge.
9. DO NOT MAKE FALSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE OTHER PARENT: It is important to build credibility in the eyes of the presiding judge.  Again, it's not going to be easy sitting in court hearing false allegations being made against you, however, it is important that you do not do the same. Judges don't like parents going back and forth with each other, they tent to view it as pettiness, immaturity, resentment or even retaliation.   Whatever you do, keep it about the child and their wellbeing. While you may have the urge to tell the judge everything this person has done to you, please don't, tread with caution because judges don't like that very much, even though what you would like to say is 100% accurate. They tend to see it as juvenile and they don't really care what the person has done to you, they prefer to focus on things that directly affects the kids.
10. SOCIAL MEDIA: Do not take to your social media to blast the attorney or judge by name during an active custody battle. Ask for advice without making derogatory comments about the other parent, judge, parent, guardian ad litem etc.  It will be used against you. Find a trusted confidante that is good at listening because there will be days that you just have to vent and sometimes cry. 12: KEEP THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CHILD: Any interaction with the other parent should be about the child. If they try asking you about your dating life, or attempt to bring up passed arguments about cheating etc,  ignore it and bring the conversation back to talking about the child.
11. MOVING ON WITH SOMEONE ELSE WILL TRIGGER THE OTHER PARENT: I am certain you have heard stories of parents having decent communication with the other parent until they caught wind of them  moving on with someone else and all of a sudden all hell breaks loose. The child/children are immediately withheld from the other parent with unreasonable demands.  Document everything for the inevitable child custody hearings.
12. FIGHT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT: Parental alienation is child abuse, brainwashing is child abuse, coercing a child to make false accusations is child abuse.  Fight to give your child access to both parents. Tell them that it is okay to love both parents.
13. SCHOOL ATTENDANCE/ MISSED DOCTOR APPOINTMENT: Be active at school, reach out to the teachers. Show interest in their grades etc. Inquire about missed school days, tardy days etc. Document everything. Judges take education very seriously. They don't like the kids missing school. Call the doctor/ dentist to inquire about missed appointments etc.",259.0

Cobra Kai is currently the #1 streaming show on Netflix US. I enjoy it; much of the theme is centered on flawed fathers and the positive male role models who take their place, and most characters get a decent development/redemption arc.

In S4E7, the All Valley Karate Tournament Committee see a video of a boy vs girl fight, feels it’s problematic, and decides to start separate boys vs girls tournaments. Fair enough, most sports do this. This causes Sensei Johnny Lawrence to rush to recruit a girl for his currently all-male dojo at the last minute and, in an attempt to prepare his team for Cobra Kai’s “dirty tricks,” has the girl repeatedly KICK HIS STUDENTS IN THE BALLS for most of an entire class. The girl is shown to be happy to do this, and the scene is played for laughs. These are high school boys, they’re shown looking terrified and shaking their heads no, and the girl proceeds to give them each nutshots with all her might and look proud of herself afterwards.

To me, this is yet another example of Hollywood’s shining hypocrisy and refusal to get rid of some very stupid and problematic tropes. What are your thoughts? Do you feel this trope is a recurring problem, or do you think it’s not a big deal?

My guess is that the UN and others wanted to make this also or perhaps predominantly a ""girls' problem"" and started counting others than just soldiers into the category of soldiers. Knowing something about the track record of the organization, that doesn't sound too implausible.

46,t3_ru7wzj,Genital Mutilation - A Message to My Parents,"Dear mom and dad,

This letter may come as a shock to you. After reading this, you may feel hurt. However, I can guarantee  that you will never feel the amount of mental anguish, dejection, and resentment that I felt - and continue to feel - when I realized that you permanently mutilated my body when I was just a few days old. My anger and resentment towards you, mom and dad, can not be overstated. I may never forgive you.

23 years ago you decided to have doctors permanently alter my body, and have them genitally mutilate me. You did so without any regard for my consent. Although it was not absolutely medically necessary -- you decided to have them do it anyways. There is unquestionably no other reason that can vindicate your decision. It is a fucking abhorrent and disturbing thing that you did to me, at such a young age. It is fucking intolerable. It is impermissible. It is repugnant.

I want you to know why.

You violated my body autonomy. You do not have the right to decide for me ever, HOW, or even IF my body should be altered or not -- in any fashion. Whether I am 30 seconds old, 30 years old, or I am dead and laying in a morgue; you will never have the right to decide what should be done to my body. The worst of all, you permanently mutilated my body when I could not speak for myself. Or understand what was happening. You made the decision for me. I may never forgive you.

You took the most sensitive and pleasurable sensation that my body was born to feel, and you made it less. You robbed me. You robbed me of this feeling, for life. You fucking took it from me; with zero regard for how I felt. With zero regard for what I wanted. With zero regard for my consent. You did not even think twice. I may never forgive you.

I do not wish for the reason. I do not wish to know why you decided to do this to me. Do not attempt to explain or rationalize your reasons for doing this to me. I do not want to hear it. Your reasoning is beyond irrelevant. It is unjustifiable; it is inexcusable.

I feel so abandoned. So neglected. That the same people who set out to purposefully have me; the same people that set out to protect me and care for me, could also similarly decide such a fate for me. How the fuck do you come to this conclusion. The conclusion that you would willingly have me permanently genitally mutilated, as a fucking two-day-old baby. It is fucking repulsive. I will never forget what you did to me. You do not deserve a single atom of love, attention, thought, or care, from me. I will never forgive you.

I know that there will be some men who will read this and relate to the feelings in this letter. I hope that you find comfort in these words. You are not alone.

EDIT: To everyone who sat down, read this post, and decided the best response was to attempt to invalidate my feelings…you are the fucking reason men can’t talk about this issue. You are the fucking problem. You are the reason this issue will continue. 

A note about my feelings towards my own circumcision: my feelings are NOT up for negotiation. This is not a fucking debate. These things are real, and they will stay real. They will not change, no matter what shitty evidence you use to attempt the justification for genitally mutilating infants at birth. 

Thank you to everyone who hears, and acknowledges, and understands. Thank you.

EDIT 2: 

It looks like a lot of you seem to think that male genital mutilation does not alter the sensitivity or feeling of your sexual organ. The foreskin is made up of between 10,000 and 20,000 nerve endings. My parents decided to have that part of me cut off of my body forever. I no longer have my foreskin, along with any feeling there, because it is no longer attached to me. It was cut off of me. Therefore, the feeling that I have is less, and most undoubtedly less sensitive than it was before I was mutilated. Before commenting on things that you know nothing about, I recommend you educate yourself on the vile common practice of circumcision, which is male genital mutilation.",344.0

This happened roughly about two years ago and a few days before my hs graduation. My mom wanted to buy me something I can wear under my grad gown, and wanted me to tag alongside her at the mall. What she didn't tell me, however, she invited her friend who bought along her daughter and her daughter's friend to go to a mall outside of town. Meaning, it was gonna be a long fucking day. My mom always tricks me into going into the all-female mall ventures that I have no interest in taking part in, and have expressed heavily numerous times in the past. (Single mother, absent father, only son struggles.)

So, my mom's friend picked us up in her SUV and stopped by the gas station. She asked, not anyone in particular, ""Who wants to get out and pay for the gas?"" Her daughter jumped to doing so. My mom's friend then turned around at me and said, ""I thought you was supposed to be the man. You should've been the one to pump the gas for us poor women."" No one said anything, but it was more of an understanding, agreeing nod followed by a laugh among themselves.

That moment was basically the prologue to what this day had me dealing with: shadowing a bunch of women going into female-centric stores and only having a small percentage and care of that time put into what I actually agreed to - buying something to wear under my grad gown. Not to mention, being the one doing all the heavy lifting because ""that's what a man is supposed to do"" and if I don't I'll be ridiculed for it. Going back to the gas thing, I'm not obligated to pump gas for someone else's vehicle because I'm a male. It's not like my own mom is asking me to do the same thing for her. In fact, why not ask your daughter by the fact of you being her mom and her being your daughter? Why not ask me the first time if you thought so strongly to me doing it? Why expect the guest to pump gas in your vehicle who's been pushed to sitting all the way in the back when there are other people capable of doing it who have easier access in and out the door? 

I wish I could've said those things, but knowing my mom and the toxic environment it would've turned into a full-blown argument and I would've been the only one having to defend myself.",231.0

He went on to cite as an example of the growing cohort of devastated sinners Jay Wells, an Ohio resident who recently dropped out of college for $34,000 a year and told the Wall Street Journal in September, ""I'm kind of waiting for the light to come on to figure out what to do next.""

According to Hawley, men have long been persuaded that they and their male nature are problems in themselves. Because of this, they drop out of school, are less likely to get married and work. The senator has called for more jobs and new benefits for married men so that men spend less time on porn and gambling. If successful, a record number of men could put down their dicks and virtual assault rifles to rejoin the patriarchy.

So today, I am going to debunk that blarb. 

# Some Background about male suicide

**History of male suicide**

Men have been committing suicide more often than women in the UK since 1860s (thats as far as the statistics go usually) Source: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20519333/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20519333/)

In the USA, men have been committing suicide more than women since the 1950s (as far back as the statistics go) Source: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/187478/death-rate-from-suicide-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1950/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187478/death-rate-from-suicide-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1950/)

So this isn't a new issue by any means

**Worldwide statistics**

In all countries, men commit suicide more than women (for some reason they say most of the suicide victims are women in China but the table shows the opposite, so I am a bit confused). Source: [https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/suicide-rate-by-country](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/suicide-rate-by-country)

# Why male suicide is not caused by toxic masculinity

**Myth #1: Men don't seek help**

They usually say men commit suicide is due to men not talking about their issues or resisting therapy. This is NOT true. 

According to a [study](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=55305) by the University of Manchester, almost all men who committed suicide went to therapy or sought help atleast once:

"" Most (91%) middle-aged men had been in contact with at least one front-line service or agency, ranging from within 1 week of death (38%) to more than 3 months prior to death (49%), most often primary care services (82%); half (50%) had been in contact with mental health services, 30% with the justice system (i.e. police, probation or prison services). 2% were in contact with employment services, despite the high rates of unemployment found; overall 67% had been in recent contact with services (i.e. within 3 months of death), mainly primary care (43%).""

So NO! It is NOT because men don't talk about their issues. 

**Myth #2: Women attempt suicide more, men just use more dangerous methods**

This one is false as well. According to a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032711005179), even when suicide methods are controlled, men still commit suicide at higher rates than women.

""However, except for drowning, case fatalities were higher for males than for females within each method. This was most apparent in “hanging” (men 83.5%, women 55.3%; φ = − 0.28; p &lt; 0.001) and “poisoning by drugs” (men 7.2%, women 3.4%; φ = − 0.09; p &lt; 0.001).""

Additionally, women may do what is called a 'suicidal gesture' as opposed to a serious suicide attempt (SSA) or might self harm which can be taken as an attempt if they go to the hospital. 

According to a [study](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8), men were much more likely to make an SSA (Serious Suicide Attempt) than women: 

""A significant association between suicide intent and gender was found, where ‘Serious Suicide Attempts’ (SSA) were rated significantly more frequently in males than females (*p* &lt; .001). There was a statistically significant gender difference in intent and age groups (*p* &lt; .001) and between countries (*p* &lt; .001). Furthermore, within the most utilised method, intentional drug overdose, ‘Serious Suicide Attempt’ (SSA) was rated significantly more often for males than females (*p* &lt; .005).""

**Suicide prevention programs help females more than males**

According to this [study](https://archive.is/3MnuZ), existing suicide prevention programs help females more than males:

""The results that feature programming effects for both males and females are provocative, suggesting that when gender differences are evident, in almost all cases, females seem to be more likely than males to benefit from existing prevention programming""

According to this [article](https://thelatch.com.au/men-mental-health-statistics-australia/), men DO go to therapy, but they benefit from it less and many leave:

""The most common reason for dropping out of treatment was reported as a lack of connection or understanding on the part of the therapist (54.9%). Men also reported that therapy was unhelpful or “didn’t feel right” (20.2%). Expense and a logistical inconvenience were also reported as a leading reason for drop-out (18%). Only 5.5% of men dropped out of treatment because they felt as though their issues had been resolved. Men in the study spoke about feeling emasculated by the process of therapy. Younger men and those without jobs were the most likely to drop out due to lack of connection with their therapist or the feeling that therapy was “not working”. Clinical psychologist and study author, Dr Zac Seidler, [told *SBS*](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/high-therapy-dropout-rates-reveal-failure-to-connect-with-men-study-shows) that, traditionally, men haven’t been “consumers of mental health services”. Because of this, mental health treatment is frequently created or advertised “with women in mind,” he said. Waiting rooms in therapists’ offices are often filled with women’s magazines and use branding that appeals to women. And apparently, this can lead men to think, ‘This is not for me. This is not where I’m supposed to be,” Dr Seidler explained.""

# Conclusion

So men DO go to therapy before committing suicide, do more serious suicide attempts, and commit suicide more even when methods are controlled for. Additionally, suicide prevention programs help women more and men drop off therapy because it simply isn't designed for them. 

It is NOT toxic masculinity, it is lack of care and exclusion of men, pure and simple!",1157.0

I'm curious how this sub in general feels about censorship.","I personally fall under the umbrella of the third option. Inciting violence or terrorist activity is never okay. 

But us attempting to censor subreddits or spaces that we personally disagree with is the equivalent of feminist organizations in New York spending thousands on an ad campaign against manspreading. It is unimportant drama that is a departure from what should be the primary goals of men's rights. Fairer prison sentencing, default equal custody of children, the education gap, alimony reform, and overturning the Duluth Model are examples of what men's rights should be focusing on, in my opinion. 

I am also of the opinion that making progress on these more important matters serves to further delegitimize anti-male and misandric spaces and communities. When we make progress toward actual men's *rights,* the cultural shift that follows will alienate hateful bigots and make their opinions and beliefs more taboo. 

What are your thoughts?

Edit: Congratulations. You have all successfully ostracized an ally of ten years from your movement. Turns out I'm no longer radical enough to wear the label of MRA. I am sincerely heartbroken by the way that this thread has turned out, because I have considered spaces like this to be a safe place to voice concerns, frustrations, and despair over the injustices men face - for years. For years spaces like this have been a part of my identity. But because I am not authoritarian enough, and because my post history is ""suspicious"" (even though not a single one of you people elaborated on what you meant by this), I'm dismissed as nothing more than a troll. The account that I am on right now is my most genuine account, and the account that I use for everything. I use this account when mingling with folks from all walks of life. I'm unsure if it is the fact that I mingle in other sorts of communities, or the fact that my post history is littered with my attempts to stop smoking weed, or if it is the occasional shitty meme in my history. I don't know why it is that you people hate me the way that you do. But I have been called meek, I have been called a troll, I have been told I am pathetic, and worse, from the people in this sub. Because I am anti-censorship. Anyways, my point being, again, congratulations. In defiance of my gender studies major of a mother, I have worn the title of MRA for over a decade. In defiance against the vitriolic bullshit that the general public, media, and online spaces label us, I remained an MRA. In defiance against the friends I lost, who were convinced that I had become a misogynistic, sexist, bigoted incel because I wore the label of MRA, I still wore it. But you people have managed, over a course of less than 24 hours, to show me that none of that was worth it. Because you were all going to turn around and eat me alive the second I stepped outside the dogma of the religion this movement has become.

103,t3_rsch9i,The myth of 'Women have less power than men in the US' type statements,"We always hear from feminist circles about how women hardly have any power in the US; and about how it's men making laws regarding women. Yet in all these arguments, they fail to mention that women make up a larger portion of the electorate than men. In the US population that is 18+, women make up 52% of the population. In every state and every congressional district, adult women outnumber adult men. This means that if women wanted, they could easily make every US Senator, every US Congressperson, and every future President and Vice President a woman for the rest of history. 

Furthermore, when women do run for office, they have a higher success rate than men running for office. For example, in the 2020 US Congressional elections, many more women who ran for office were elected compared to all men who ran for office. This shows that there are more men in power, simply because many more men run for elected office compared to women. If an equal number of women chose to run for office, there would likely be more female politicians than male politicians. 

And it's not as if there is a lack of qualified women. 65% of people graduating with college degrees today are women. Female college graduates have outnumbered men for decades, and the gap is only widening. So the result of most US politicians being male is simply caused by a large number of women choosing to vote for the male candidates, and by qualified women choosing not to run for public office. Not because of the 'Men hate women, and don't want women to get in power' narrative.",90.0

111,t3_rryzhe,What about him?,"I cannot remember exactly the age in which the abuse started; those years of my life continue to remain bleary at best. I think I was about ten. We had just moved into my stepfather’s house after immigrating from the UK some two years before. I remember being strangled multiple times, I use to grab the dog and put him in between myself and my abuser, knowing full well he would never hurt his dogs. Within a couple of weeks, he had figured that one out and would send his dog outside before attacking me. I remember having batteries thrown at my face, leading to a chipped tooth and split lip. I remember going to school with bruises. I remember having a steel pole swung at me, followed by being thrown at me. 

I also remember the first time I told a teacher about what was happening at home, I was 10 years old. I also remember the eighth time I recounted what was happening to a teacher. Nothing ever happened. Out of the eight teachers I told, including a deputy head teacher, all but one was a man. Out of those eight teachers, it was only the male teacher which escalated my complaint further. Nothing happened as it went straight to the deputy head, she once again did nothing.

I also remember at 13 (I think) being sent out of a PDHPE class for arguing with the teacher. I argued that men are also victims of domestic violence. If I recount correctly, we were being taught that domestic violence against men and boys is so rare it is not worth referencing. I was sent out of the class for 'disrupting' the conversation and being 'attention seeking'. From then onwards I learned that, in fact, men and are almost never victims of domestic violence. It has taken me nearly a decade to unlearn what I was taught at school. For it was only in 2020 that I accepted that I, a boy, and now damaged young man, had been abused.

At 13 I remember him punching through the glass on the front door to try and grab me at 2am. He was in the garden screaming and throwing chairs saying he was going to kill himself. 

I opened the door and said, 

""Stop shouting it's 2am"". 

He then said, ""I’m going to smash that little cunt"". 

All this time I was being taught, and accepting that men and boys were not really victims of abuse. I remember running for my life and locking the door to my room where I stood shaking like a leaf. If I wasn’t so scared, I would have cried. He paced outside my door and punched it for over ten minutes, swearing, threatening, and trying to break the lock to get me.

I also remember the night I became homeless at fifteen. He had punched me in the face and throttled me but this time his hands felt different. Normally he would grab my neck to get me to stop trying to escape his grasp. But this time I could not find breath, my survival instinct kicked in and I had to defend myself. I don’t know if I would be here writing this if it wasn’t for what happened next. I punched him back and he let go, I ran away into the trees. However, I split his nose open. I called the police and told them that I had been abused. When I called the police, he heard me on the phone. The police asked me if there were firearms on the property, and I said yes as he has many black-market weapons including a crossbow, rifle, and varies shotguns. He heard this and hid the guns before they arrived.

I remember taking a bush basher to the top of the driveway and waiting to be saved by the police. I remember they arrived about two hours after I had called and went to speak to my abuser. They then came back and told me that they had spoken to my abuser and had decided that it was me who was the abusive one. They told me to get into the back of the paddy wagon. I asked if I was being arrested. The stony silence was the only answer I needed.

I remember arriving at the police station and being put in the holding cell and waiting there until morning. I was allowed to leave then and was given a court date to attend. I remember sleeping in the park that night, and for the week to follow. Then I found a small, unlocked room at Coles, where I would sleep at night and keep my things. 

Two months later I was in the courtroom being told that my abuser had taken out an AVO against me. I didn’t reply as I did not know what to say, so I nodded my head and left. I then went back to Coles. I then slept in the underground Coles carpark for another six months until I found a youth refuge to call my own. All this time believing that men and boys are not abused and are in fact only abusers themselves.

Reflecting back now I am not angry at what happened. I am angry as to why it happened. I am angry that if I was a girl this would have been stopped. I was profiled during this ordeal based on my sex, and my sex alone. If my sister (who thankfully was not living in my abuser’s house) had told any number of the teachers that I had spoken with that she was being abused, she would have been believed. If she would have called the police that night she would not have been arrested. She would not have been homeless for a year at 15 but most importantly, she would have been believed.

I get angry when I see domestic violence portrayed in the media as a gendered issue entirely. Although my abuser was a man, I, a boy, and now young man was the victim of abuse. I cannot help but feel that if the discussion around domestic violence was more inclusive of male things would have been different for me. If I was taught that men and boys are commonly victims of abuse, I may have been able to recognise what was happening at home wasn’t normal. Instead, I was punished for pointing this out. I would have been supported and helped. I would not have been homeless at fifteen. But most importantly, I would have been believed.

I've been lurking this sub for a short while now, and I might investigate similar outlets (such as the left wing male advocates sub).

It looks like numerous MRAs disagree with the usage of it, saying that it advocates for supremacy, even if the individual feminists claims they're for equality.

**important note:**  I'm **not** a feminist (but I am female) - some people are already putting words in my mouth, so I wanted to distinguish this.

Do MRAs have any plans or approaches on how to deal with the term 'feminism' being so deeply ingrained into society or culture, at least amongst those who consider themselves for equality/egalitarianism? What makes the term too irreconcilable to not simply try and make it evolve into a movement of equality as some feminists intend? As the movement of feminism itself (and MRM) have also evolved over time.

For example, they'll propose putting up posters like 'It's okay for men to cry' even though we have far more pressing issues than such condescending rubbish.

I fear that the more International Men's Day grows, the more feminists will shift to appropriating it for their own purposes.

To counter that, I wonder if it might be better for the MRM to abandon International Men's Day and promote Pizzey Day (19 February) instead?

I can see a few advantages with this:

1. Erin Pizzey is a woman, was a feminist (before turning against feminism), and founded a refuge for abused women. Feminists will find it next to impossible to portray Erin Pizzey as a misogynist.

2. Erin Pizzey tried to help all victims of domestic abuse regardless of sex, something feminists could deny only at the cost of looking foolish.

3. International Women's Day has increasingly abandoned lower-class women in favour of promoting more opportunities for high-flying female politicians, managers, and CEO's, making it an increasingly elitist day. Many lower-class women who have experienced domestic abuse would appreciate a day dedicated for survivors of domestic abuse and so would probably embrace Pizzey Day as more relevant to their lived experiences.

4. The name 'Pizzey Day' directs the reader to a specific person, which encourages them to look her up online and read about her life; unlike 'International Men's Day' which feminists can easily twist just by pointing to evil men as the model of what a man is.

145,t3_rqtdgx,"So, today my ex wife phoned me up to complain...","... about the fact that I'm a good dad.

My daughter wants me to increase my access to 50/50 split, (which would reduce my child maintenance to £0) as it's 'not fair' that she doesn't spend as much time with me as with her mother. the ex wife has told my daughter that children need to spend more time with thier mothers as that was the law. I found this out as my daughter has asked me if this really was the law and could I do something about it, but please don't tell her mum it was her idea (my daughter is 7).

Today, the ex wife phoned up to say that my daughter and I had 'ruined' Christmas for her and her in laws, by repeatedly asking if she could go and spend Christmas with me as she'd 'have a better time with me'. She said I had introduced her to the real Santa, whilst the mum had sent her to a 'fake, imposter'. In reality, I had just tried to make the experience a memorable one and had put a stocking on her bed for when we came home as I had anticipated what she was going to ask for. Her mother had spent approx twice as much as myself on presents but doesn't engage with her to the level I do.

After this, my daughter had said how Boxing Day (with me and my in laws) was much better than Christmas with the mum (and her in laws) as we had fun and played games and had nicer food and her cousins from the ex-wifes side just spent their time throwing their toys against the wall. My daughter had then apparently cried and stayed in her room for an hour afterwards upon coming back to her mothers. The ex wife had wound herself into a fury as she kept asking me 'how does this make her feel'.

I was genuinely baffled about this. I explained to her, that she had just now absolutely convinced me that going for 50/50 access was now in the best interest of our daughter and I didn't really give 2 fucks about how she felt, I was more interested in what was better for my daughter. She thinks less access would be better so she can 'rebuild her relationship'.

146,t3_rqc97j,For those who think boys always have fun and no stress,"Each one of us knows about the dirty side of our society, the patriarchal side. But what about the other part? The other part! Yes, the part where the females misuse the laws and rights given to them. Don't take me wrong, this is a very important topic and most of you will agree with this, especially the boys. We, the females, face many difficulties because of society for sure. But have you ever heard of the false rape allegations, the fake harassment cases, girls blackmailing guys to achieve their motive? I have seen many such cases and this isn't at all right. Nowadays many women, even though they are at fault, blackmail the guys and threaten them of ruining their career and public image by putting false allegations on them. Boys, who are helpless about it, have no other way but to accept their conditions. This is a pathetic situation. The laws made for our safety shouldn't be used to pressurize the other gender. The laws shouldn't be used as threats to ruin an innocent person's life. And the society we live in, won't support girls when it's necessary but will jump in, to support these false cases without having any idea of what's wrong and what's right.
And this special note for all girls out there: DON'T, I REPEAT DON'T RUIN A GUY'S LIFE, OR GIVE FALSE THREATS TO HIM TO FULFILL YOUR MEAN WISHES AND DEMANDS. IF PROVEN WRONG, PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HELP YOU, WHEN YOU NEED IT!

147,t3_rqsbcz,Gender terms are 'offensive'...unless they're not.,"Not sure if this is okay to post here, so if not, the mods can feel free to delete. Just thought this might be of interest and couldn’t immediately find any other communities to post it in.

I’m an amateur writer in my spare time and I bounce back and forth between two online grammar checkers. While I’ll avoid naming them specifically (just in case) I will upload a screengrab (that doesn’t show names either) just to show what I’m talking about here.  

Anyway. When pasting my text into one of the checkers today, I noticed they’d updated the system to include a new analysis tool. Previously it had tools for Passive Voice, Glue Index, and things of that nature. Now there was something called an Inclusive Language tool that I didn’t notice until I pasted my text. Upon analyzing my text I noticed this Inclusive Language analysis was saying ‘Your document contains language that could be considered offensive.’ Needless to say I was surprised since my text didn’t contain any foul language, racist terminology, or anything else you might imagine might trigger such a warning.  

Upon sorting through the text to find the words it was referring to, I found myself in for another shock. Every word that triggered this Inclusive Language tool was a word that was generically masculine. For example, it said the word ‘fisherman’ could be considered offensive as it applied to males only and suggested I change the term to ‘fishers’. Never mind that the character was a man that fished, lol. The word ‘mankind’ was also detected as ‘offensive’ since it had a basis in generic masculinity…suggestions for corrections to that included ‘humanity, humankind, and people.’  

Now you might be wondering, “What’s the big deal? Maybe it’s a bit overly PC, but what’s the problem at the end of the day?” Good question. While I was telling my roommate about this humorous find, I had a sudden inspiration…I wondered if this tool would register something as offensive if it was based on a feminine terminology. Care to take a guess what happened when I replaced the word mankind with the word womankind? That’s right, gents. Apparently mankind is offensive for not being inclusive to women but womankind is perfectly acceptable despite excluding men.

Needless to say I think we can all find the double-standard being applied here rather humorous. This is apparently the lesson to would-be writers: Mankind is offensive, but womankind is A-okay!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Gender-based bias permeates the criminal justice system, manifesting itself in the investigative stage, in the form of law enforcement biases; the trial stage, in which a fair trial may be unavailable for economically disadvantaged and uneducated women; and in sentencing, when women defendants are sentenced to death after being prevented from arguing that gender and patriarchy affected their criminal conduct.  This discrimination can also lead to critical mitigating factors not being considered during arrest and trial, such as being subjected to gender-based violence and abuse.

Let's not even talk about gender and patriarchy affecting criminal conducts. It is simply a way of saying that women should be treated differently for simply being women.

Let's talk about gender based bias in criminal justice system. Yes, there is a biais but this bias is against men and boys :

[Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Sentencing: Evidence from the U.S. Federal Courts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/l417sb/racial_ethnic_and_gender_disparities_in/) :  Males offenders receive substantially longer sentences.  Males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available; less likely to receive downward departures ; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and, conditioned on having a downward departure, receive smaller reductions than females.

[The Determinants of Punishment: Deterrence, Incapacitation and Vengeance ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/l417da/study_the_determinants_of_punishment_deterrence/):  Male offenders receive a 6.2 year longer sentence than female offenders if the victim is female and a 6.9 year longer sentence if the victim is male.

[Help seeking experience of male Intimate Partner Violence victims: Police more likely to jail him than to jail the woman (29.7% vs 20.9%) when he calls them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ljcbet/help_seeking_experience_of_male_ipv_victims/)

[Women in UK cannot be send to prison for non violent offense. Men can.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-launches-dedicated-strategy-to-break-the-cycle-of-female-offending)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In countries where the death penalty is a mandatory sentence for murder, such as in Trinidad and Tobago or Ghana, a woman’s prior history as a survivor of physical or sexual abuse is simply irrelevant. The death penalty is automatically imposed for death-eligible offences without consideration of the woman’s background or the circumstances of the crime.

Now background and circumstances. Let's remind everybody that +80% of rough sleepers are male. +70% of suicide are men. Male victims of domestic and sexual abuse are more likely to not be believed, to not be protected and to be punished. Also several decades of studies have shown how male prisoners had on average a far worst live than others. Eg :

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533348/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533348/) :  Most participants (84.2%) had suffered at least one ACE and 45.5% had suffered ≥4 ACEs. Prevalence of lifetime mental illness diagnosis, self-harm (lifetime and lifetime in prison) or suicide attempt (lifetime and lifetime in prison), and current low mental wellbeing increased with exposure to ACEs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Women are victims of the death penalty to a great extent even when it is mostly men who are tried, sentenced and executed.   While men are in prison, it is left to women to hold the family together, to earn a living, perhaps for the first time, to support the children, to organise lawyers and support, to travel sometimes great distances at great difficulty to visit their husbands, partners, sons and fathers in prison.   It is not a comment on the treatment of women when they are charged, but an important and often overlooked component of the criminal systems and the death penalty everywhere. Women are left to pick up the pieces and try to recreate lives for their families.

Classic, we can't let men being talked about without making it about women. It will not go well with the narrative that women are most affected when most executed victims are men if they did not try to parasite conversation about men.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In order to tackle the problems that exist, I believe we need to implement the following steps: repeal provisions that allow for the mandatory imposition of the death penalty, which do not allow judges to consider the circumstances of the offence or of the defendant at sentencing; acknowledge the compounding forms of violence suffered by girls and women – including gender based violence and early and forced marriage; ensure the training of all those involved investigation, representation and prosecution of crimes involving women; ensure that all those facing the death penalty have access to free and effective legal counsel – specialised in capital representation and trained to recognise and bring forward claims of gender-specific defences; increase the number of women involved in decision-making positions within legal systems, including judges, prosecutors, and court administrators, and develop and implement programmes to prevent gender-based violence and discrimination.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Make a problem a women's issues
2. Argue that the solution is to give women privileges and power and push them into high positions.
3. Use those newly gained positions to push even more feminim and expand toward other institutions.

Edit: I truly believe that nothing will get changed if men don't start to act and advocate as men like women do. If not, we will have men fighting for people while women will fight for women. Men working for things to be better for everybody. Women fighting to get women privileges and superior care. In this example, women will fight against death penalty against women only while men will fight against death penalty itself.  This is history reppeating itself. Women fought for non prison sentences for lesser female criminals. Women fought for domestic and sexual abuse laws only for female victims. Women fought for food distribution in disaster zones to be given for women and girls. When given occasion to talk in newspaper, TV or in Parliament/Government, women will explicitly isolate and focus on women. Time for men to be tribal.",295.0

A guy explains that after divorce, all his friends are siding with his wife. The wife is bad-mouthing him, his X-friends tends to feel that the ""woman needs protection"". 

The therapist? She completely ignores the sexist aspect, although it has been clearly stated by the people involved.   


Also does not forget to add a sexist aspect against men... it is usually men who try to blindsight their spouses

womens sexuality, even more than that womens permiscuity is celebrated and supported by mainstream media and accepted by pc and woke people. and it is labeled as womens rights and seen as women impowerment. and as men we are supposed to be not allowed to make negative judgements about these kind a permiscious women, not even in our thoughts. 

whereas men are being shamed if they have abundance mentality, if they are free agents, if they are smooth operators... you have to hide your sexuality as a men and be secretive about it. as opposed to women can have rub it on others face and be public about it no matter how low and ""permiscuous"" they are...

this thought come to my mind while ı was watching the good wife season 4 episode 10. spoiler: alicia saw a sexual search in her computer and talked to her kids seperately. when she asked zach about it they create a goofy/funny scene as opposed to when she asked grace they made a scene very melodramatic and almoust secred scene.. and this difference made me think about this thing and made me come here and blab about it...

Basically on every post, including this sub, men are shamed for their virginity. If a man misbehaved or people disagree with him, its not uncommon for that man to get attacked on their sexual prowess. So what people are telling me is that men's only value is their capacity to pleasure women. Isnt this objectivization of men? Then if women complain about objectivization, why is that the first insult most of them use is an attack on your sexual capabilities?

This is something that both men and women do. But women are never shamed for their virginity, in that case they are seen as independent.

Im virgin, I have low sexual desire, and I also have some psychological problems since the beggining, which plays against me on getting laid. So this is not to say that Im an Adonis and can fornicate whoever I please. But Im not in a rush to get my dick wet. Im a human, not a sexual toy. It is not my purpose to pleasure women.

Also I have to mention in the second season it turns into a shitty semi reboot of The King of Queens.

Now we have Kevin Can F Himself. Which is supposed to subvert stereotypes and be a mockery of the former show I mentioned. In this show, the sitcom wife breaks out of her role to realize that she is eternally stuck with her selfish husband and plans to get control of her life….by initially planning to kill him. Yeah, since the husband is self centered and selfish and mistreats his wife he deserves to die. But imagine if the sexes were switched. And the wife was selfish and mistreated the husband so the husband plans to murder her. 
Yeah that wouldn’t go along so well. Second, the show subverts the sitcom wife stereotype but the stereotypical husband who is stupid, fat, selfish, disgusting and lazy is still there. Why doesn’t that get defied? 
Oh and some people call this show a “genre bending masterpiece”. Are you fucking kidding me? 
This show has the same misandrist views that most shows and movies today have. If they really wanted something genre bending, they can subvert the sitcom husband stereotype instead and show the wife to be abusive and controlling towards him. That would be a sight to see. But no, we can’t have that because feminists would just say that show would be sexist and the show would get pulled. Or better yet, never made. Especially if the husband plans to kill her.

Take Men Don’t Tell for example, where the wife is abusive towards her husband for years despite his physique and she even slaps her daughter once. Now, this movie was never rebroadcast on TV, was never sold on DVD or VHS and was pulled because of several “women’s groups”. AKA feminists. A woman being abusive to a man, you don’t see that a whole lot on TV do you? And if the woman is violent towards a man, that must mean he must’ve deserved it in some way. But a man being abusive or violent towards a woman is shown ALL THE TIME. You see it everywhere. With men being portrayed in a negative light especially compared to women. They’re portrayed as evil, violent, creeps, or losers and the women are portrayed as good hearted, moral, kind souls who can do no wrong or they’re portrayed as victims. Again you see this on TV and on the big screen all the time. 

This is why I don’t watch TV and movies so much these days.

226,t3_rout02,Rebuttals to claims made about the Duluth model,"So I had the opportunity to discuss the Duluth model with someone. Here are some claims they made and the rebuttals I came up with.

Short explanation if you don't know about the Duluth model: It's a gendered model for domestic violence that is rooted in feminist patriarchy theory. I.e., it assumes that domestic abuse is rooted in patriarchal control of women by men and views only women as victims and only men as perpetrator. See this picture for a visual explanation (Wheel of Power and Control):

[Duluth model — Wheel of Power and Control](https://preview.redd.it/cq3rrbm0ev781.jpg?width=556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de16046f475ad19e9d6f2ecf08a190a4ae8525a)

# Claim 1.

The Duluth model is only based on the scenario of female to male domestic violence, so naturally it doesn't apply to male to female domestic violence victims, just like it doesn't apply to male-to-male or female-to-female domestic violence.

* **Rebuttal 1.1.** This model is taught to law enforcement and motivates the creation of batterer programs for male perpetrators and domestic violence shelters for female victims only. Since it is the only model taught, it leaves law enforcement with a gendered framework in mind which they then operate with.
* **Rebuttal 1.2.** You cannot apply two models simultaneously. In practice, you have to decide which model to use. Deciding which model to apply in a given situation would itself require another model, and the aggregate of all these models would form a unifying model, making it a different model altogether.
* **Rebuttal 1.3.** As stated by the one who made this claim, the Duluth model was created with only female victims and male perpetrators in mind. But this is *precisely* the problem. Research suggests that motivations for domestic violence do effectively not differ between the sexes. The Duluth model is a result of patriarchy theory, exemplifying the harmful effects of feminist theories. Only compassion for female victims is part of the old gendered mindset that casts women as victims and men as perpetrators, and sees women as more worthy of protection. Imagine there was a domestic violence model that only considered white victims of black perpetrators of domestic violence. The solution is to stop using the Duluth model and use a gender-neutral alternative that explicitly stresses that both men and women can be perpetrators (as only implicitly being gender neutral is not enough because the old gendered mindset makes us cast men and women into the respective roles of perpetrator and victim). According to Professor Murray Arnold Straus (who is unfortunately not alive anymore) in his 2010 paper [Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233717660_Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment): ""It is insufficient for prevention programs to be gender neutral. They need to be explicitly directed to girls and women as well as boys and men"" because ""gender-neutral terms are perceived by program recipients as referring to male perpetration"". While the creators of the Duluth model likely only intended to help, the model has been proven unsuccessful and even one of its creators (Ellen Pence) admitted to this. This is what she said in her co-authored book [Coordinating Community Responses To Domestic Violence: Lessons from Duluth and Beyond (page 29)](https://books.google.com/books?id=s_tyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29):

&gt;By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff \[...\] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with \[...\] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find.

* **Rebuttal 1.4.** The Duluth model was made with no understanding of psychology and therapy, and ignores the effects of substance abuse and attachment disorders traced to childhood abuse and neglect (the cycle of abuse). It also ignores the massive amount of literature showing that women are at least as violent as men in relationships and that most intimate partner violence is *bidirectional*, i.e. both partners are violent to each other. See e.g. [References Examining Assaults by Women on Their Spouses or Male Partners: An Updated Annotated Bibliography (Fiebert, 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261543769_References_Examining_Assaults_by_Women_on_Their_Spouses_or_Male_Partners_An_Updated_Annotated_Bibliography):

&gt;This annotated bibliography describes 343 scholarly investigations (270 empirical studies and 73 reviews) demonstrating that women are as physically aggressive as men (or more) in their relationships with their spouses or opposite-sex partners. The aggregate sample size in the reviewed studies exceeds 440,850 people.

See also [Does Batterers’ Treatment Work? A Meta-Analytic Review of Domestic Violence Treatment (Babcock et al., 2004)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8915306_Does_Batterers'_Treatment_Work_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_Domestic_Violence_Treatment), a meta-analysis which found the Duluth model to be *ineffective*:

&gt;This meta-analytic review examines the findings of 22 studies evaluating treatment efficacy for domestically violent males. The outcome literature of controlled quasi-experimental and experimental studies was reviewed to test the relative impact of Duluth model, cognitive – behavioral therapy (CBT), and other types of treatment on subsequent recidivism of violence. Study design and type of treatment were tested as moderators. Treatment design tended to have a small influence on effect size. There were no differences in effect sizes in comparing Duluth model vs. CBT-type interventions. **Overall, effects due to treatment were in the small range, meaning that the current interventions have a minimal impact on reducing recidivism beyond the effect of being arrested.** Analogies to treatment for other populations are presented for comparison. Implications for policy decisions and future research are discussed.

* **Rebuttal 1.5.** Counter-question — How would the model be applied in an intimate partner violence situation with a trans man and a trans woman?

# Claim 2.

The man is going to be released afterwards, so it doesn't matter that the Duluth model encourages the arrest of innocent men.

* **Rebuttal 2.1.** The way police officers perceive the situation and record it is going to be influenced by the framework they are taught. This has effects on sentencing. Being arrested makes it more likely for the man to be cast as a perpetrator, which will affect court decisions.
* **Rebuttal 2.2.** Being arrested and your partner not while being believed to be the perpetrator while actually being the victim is traumatizing and adds to the victimization of men. If the reason for arrests is to avoid further injury and worse, a better solution would be mutual arrests.
* **Rebuttal 2.3.** Some people are required by their employer to report any arrests. Simply being arrested, regardless of why, will most likely result in them being let go from their job. In some jobs, arrests must be reported as a condition to maintain a [security clearance](https://www.tullylegal.com/resources/articles/keeping-your-security-clearance-after-an-arrest/). Even if he defends himself, there is no guarantee the arrested person will keep this security clearance.

# Claim 3.

Even though women are more likely to use domestic violence against their partners, men are more likely to kill / severely injure their partners than women.

* **Rebuttal 3.1.** This would also imply that female victims of non-severe domestic violence should also be taken less seriously. The Duluth model however does not make this distinction and treats all domestic violence as motivated by male desire for patriarchal control over his victim.
* **Rebuttal 3.2.** The person making this claim ignores that most cases of domestic violence are bidirectional, and among those *especially* the severe cases that result in injury. Focusing on only female victims and male perpetrators is counterproductive, even if you care especially / only about the severe cases of domestic violence. See e.g. [The Battered Husband Syndrome (Suzanne K. Steinmetz, 1977-1978)](http://www.papa-help.ch/downloads/Steinmetz_The_Battered_Husband_Syndrome.pdf):

&gt;Curtis (1974) reported that while violence by men against women was responsible for about 27 percent of the assaults and 17.5 percent of the homicides, violence by women against men accounted for 9 percent of the assaults and 16.4 percent of the homicides int his study. Thus, while women commit only about one third as many assaults against men as men commit against women, **the number of cross-sex homicides committed by the two groups are nearly identical**. Wilt and Bannon (1976:20) warn that caution should be applied when interpreting Curtis' findings. They note that **""non-fatal violence committed by women against men is less likely to be reported to the police than is violence by men against women; thus, women assaulters who come to the attention of the police are likely to be those who have produced a fatal result**.""

See also [Gender Differences in Patterns and Trends in U.S. Homicide, 1976–2015 (Fox &amp; Fridel, 2017)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/vio.2017.0016):

&gt;Among all the results already reported, perhaps the most striking and important surrounds the trends in intimate partner homicide, particularly in the context of ongoing efforts to curtail domestic violence. Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012).

This graph from the same paper shows that as women got help, the rate of female to male murders significantly went down as the rate of male to female intimate partner homicides stayed the same:

* **Rebuttal 3.3.** The claim that women are more likely to suffer serious injuries is not supported by the available evidence. The evidence on this claim is mixed. Some studies find that women suffer more serious injuries than men, others find the reverse, while yet others find no difference. See e.g. [Severity and Predictors of Physical Intimate Partner Violence against Male Victims in Canada (Dim &amp; Elabor-Idemudia, 2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10926771.2020.1853298):

&gt;In addition, 35% of male and 34% of female victims of IPV experienced high controlling behaviors—the most severe type of abuse known as intimate terrorism. Moreover, 22% of male victims and 19% of female victims of IPV were found to have experienced severe physical violence along with high controlling behaviors. Although female victims significantly more often than male victims reported the injuries and short-term emotional effects of IPV (e.g., fear, depression, anger), there was no significant difference in the experience of the most long-term effects of spousal trauma—posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms. This article argues that future research should explain the increased gap in reporting of the IPV victimization among men compared to women.

What made me write in here is another topic. There was a huge amount of commenters trying to shame dudes for going to her inbox. Some even wrote mean comments directed to teenagers who might have messaged the cosplayer with romantic interest, intending to humiliate and shame the kids.

What an hypocrisy. What other reasons would they have to serve the unrequested white knight role other than falling in the good graces of miss pedestal cosplayer?

238,t3_rogwap,Men invited to job interview though job open only to women,"Anyone perusing my somewhat intermittent posting history will be able to tell that I was once part of a union, and that union began to implement policies which excluded white men from things solely on the basis of being white men, so I left.

Two members of that union, both white men, recently approached me for advice on a situation they'd encountered, because they knew I had been a committee member of some years experience. I immediately told them that I'd left, and why I'd left, and they explained to me that they knew all about it and that's why they'd approached me.

The situation is that we all work in the same industry where self-employed people are often interviewed for jobs of a few days' to a few months' duration. These men met when attending such an interview. Man 1 had been leaving while the other waited in the lobby, and as he passed, Man 1 said to Man 2 that he was wasting his time; the job was only open to women and that any men interviewed were invited only to avoid the appearance of a women-only hiring process. Man 2 went into the interview, asked whether any of this was true, and was told quite unashamedly by the interviewers that it was.

It had been their inclination to complain about this to the union, which would be a reasonable reaction to such a flagrant breach of employment law, not to mention wasting their time preparing for and attending the interview. However, they are both aware that the relevant union subcommittee is heavily influenced by hardline feminists, and  that the union has consistently tolerated flagrant breaches of the union's own rules as well as absolutely illegal behaviour.

As such these guys' concerns are unlikely to be meaningfully acted upon. Not only that, but they both independently raised the likelihood of deliberate attempts to smear their reputation in retaliation makes them cautious about even making the complaint. I couldn't give them much comfort; I suspect they're right.

In the end there are a lot of examples of this sort of thing and we can talk about it here on the internet until the end of time, but what can I actually *do* here? I'm not a lawyer nor can I afford to hire one. What concrete action can we take? We're just three guys.",134.0

251,t3_ro9i42,Male sexuality it innocent.,"I grew up with the impression that looking at female bodies in a sexual way was a bad thing to do because it is objectification.

I now think that looking at women's bodies in a sexual way is perfectly innocent. It's a natural human behaviour. Heterosexual and bisexual men are biologically programmed to find looking at attractive women pleasurable. There's nothing wrong with it.

The demonisation of male sexuality is a form of abuse perpetuated on men and boys to make them feel ashamed of completely natural and healthy sexual behaviour.

You can see why this is the case if you flip the genders. There is nothing wrong with women finding men pleasurable to look at, it's natural, healthy, and innocent.

I believe the shaming of males for their sexuality is partly rooted in cultural conceptions of traditional sexual relations and identities. Whereby the female must be courted and shown not to be ""loose"" with her love, and so she must condemn any man who looks at her sexually. This is the woman acting out the archetype of the virgin.

Also, it is a clever construction to shame certain low status men from approaching women. As it can be deployed as a defence without the woman saying that the problem is the man not being good enough for her, instead the problem is a defect in the man, and if the man only wasn't a pervert he might be rewarded with affection. This serves to retain the moral purity of the woman as being primarily concerned with the moral character of the man and not other characteristics of a potential partner which would deter her from accepting him (appearance, status, wealth, connections).

**Edit:** In this post, I didn't say all women and it shouldn't have to be said, but I'm not refering to all women. I'm talking specifically about women who talk as though male objectification of women is always bad, or who use this as a way to reject men they dislike.

It isn't always disingenuous. **Displays** of male sexuality aren't always innocent, but that is different to what I was talking about in my post. **In my post I was talking about the instinct of heterosexual men to look at women and find them attractive.**

Also, I am not specifically pointing the finger at women and saying ""there lies the problem"". The problem is partly an inheritance of culture which dictates relations between the sexes and that both sexes subscribe to, to a certain extent.

I believe that this part of culture has been predominantly mobilised by a portion of women (some feminists, I have no specific percentage) to attack men. However, it wouldn't work without there being something already there to build upon in our history.

And, again, the last two paragraphs of the original post are not an all explanatory theory, they are just contributions that I believe exist.

Edit 2: Wanted to share a link to another user's comments which highlight the common goal of both women and men for emancipation.

First occurrence: me and my gf were making out. She was on top of me I was mostly laying down. She pulled my penis out from my pants and pulled her pants down a bit and revealed her vagina. She then looked at me for approval , as she was suggesting sex. I said no. She slowly moved it more towards her vagina as I kept looking at her and saying no. As I kept saying no, she eventually brought my penis to touch her vagina. It looked like she really wanted to and she wasn’t listening and I thought she probably was going to anyway, so I just sighed and said “fine but only for a couple seconds.” This was because we did not have any condoms so it would have been unprotected sex. She rode for a couple seconds before I said alright and picked her up and set her down next to me. I didn’t think anything of it, but when I told my friend they suggested it was full on rape, which surprised me I guess cause I wasn’t particularly scarred by it or anything and I didn’t think intentions were ill, but I also suppose being a male may have contributed to me thinking it would have been dumb to feel bad about it. Not trying to make myself sound like a victim by saying that or anything, just what happened.

Second occurrence: she broke up with me after months of toxicity from her (long story but some of the story is posted on here on this acc if u want to see). Two days later she wanted me to come over to have sex with her. She was at her friends house that I had never been to. I’m not gonna lie I did feel like I was being a bit used for sex. I kept saying no and that I didn’t want to do it. She then said she was going to make out with her friend if I didn’t come over and have sex with her. She then promised that she might if I didn’t come over (promises had a big meaning in our relationship where they couldn’t be broken). I kept saying I didn’t really want to but when she started suggesting she would make out with her friend, I caved. I eventually said fine. She knew it was something I would have hated cause it had been discussed in our relationship before but only a couple times. She said it so that I would go have sex with her, which worked. I didn’t feel too terrible at first but I did feel used which was a poor feeling. Shortly after, she broke up with me again. Then a couple weeks later I saw a video of her kissing that friend on a private snap. I really don’t know how to explain it but having felt used for sex and then saying she wouldn’t do the thing that would hurt if I had sex with her and then doing it anyway, idk I’ve just been struggling with sex feeling meaningful anymore cause of it I think which is difficult for me cause sex was always a very special thing to me. She’s the only person I’ve had sex with and also the person I lost my virginity to. But the last bit about her kissing her friend is kind of irrelevant to the question. When I talked to my therapist about this, she suggested it was almost sexual assault in a way, which blew my mind. I didn’t even think it could have been that. I mean at the end of the day it’s still my fault and I consented right?

She also keeps sending unsolicited nudes despite me asking her to stop and saying no before hand but I suppose that’s also irrelevant to the question, but thought may have been relevant to the topic.




So, does anyone think either of these are cases of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or even rape? Any thoughts would be appreciated as I’m very confused but thinking too much about the second scenario leaves me hurt a lot. Thank u.",18.0

I’m really tired of listening to guys complain how they can’t get a girlfriend, but I also get where they’re coming from. If you’re programmed to think about something all the time, constantly told it’s the best feeling in life, constantly presented with media where someone’s story ends with getting it, and constantly told you’re a pathetic loser if you can’t get it you’re justified in asking”what do I have to do to get it?” I’m not saying guys should have whoever they want, I’m saying society should have more sympathy. Stop claiming all incels are monsters, not say a guys an asshole just for hitting on a girl.

I know how dumb this probably is, but I had this idea for a political cartoon that might change someone’s mind on sympathy for incels, and since there’s movies on gay acceptance that swap to homosexuality being dominant maybe this could exist. There’s a future society with mostly desert and little water. So a pill is developed that protects someone from the effects of dehydration, but for a set of reasons it only works for women. So all the men in this society are constantly carrying around big jugs of water while the women are told they don’t need it. The women’s brains still tell them they should drink water, and they feel some effects of thirst but nothing causing serious pain. This society would have a bunch of movies that end with female protagonists getting a guy to share his water with her, but also a man power movement where men men are told the days of them needing something from women is over and they should keep their water(there’s a number of ways this society could function differently)The main story would have a female protagonists who is constantly made fun of for not finding a guy to share his water. There would be a moment where her friends are shocked to find out she never got any water. She’d have one friend tell her she’d get it eventually, than over hear that friend later saying she never would. Then there’d be a montage of her talking to different guys. Some would let her down gently. Some would tell her she’s to ugly, a loser and a few other flaws. Some would just go off on her for only wanting their water.

Now we live in her Parents house where there’s guests that stay past 11:30pm and we share a small bedroom and have to use a small hallway bathroom where guests constantly go in and out of. I expressed that I wish I could just take a shower and use the bathroom without being in view and earshot of everyone in the living and dining room and how it was so much more comfortable when we had our own room and bathroom and much more privacy. Income everything negative my mother has ever said about me and her and how she was uncomfortable living with my family so now I’ll have to adjust to living with hers the same way she did. Income she could’ve left me when I lost my job due to Covid and when she found out I was selling drugs to buy food and things to support us. I’m only 24 and the thought that I got married to early crosses my mind everyday. We both work constantly to save up for a car for her so we can both make it to work without having to rely on each other. Living with family is hell.

I know this is long I’m not even generally looking for sympathy or replies. Mostly it was therapeutic to type all this out. But if anyone else struggles with not being able to be a man but also show emotions like anger , annoyance , depression without being told suck it up, go to work and one day it’ll be better or you’ll just have a stroke at 38 and lights outs.

It seems to be used as a catch-all phrase, and is even being used in official literature. It doesn't make any sense to me. 

For example, rape on campus is often referred to as ""gender-based violence"". But why?  
Surely men can sexually assault other men. And women can assault other women. Are those ""gender-based"" issues?  
Why is sexual assault referred to as ""gender-based violence""? What does that even mean? It seems they are trying to frame the issue as exclusively ""things men do to women"". But that is not accurate.

In addition, GBV can mean lots of different things, including:  
\- psychological violence (Art. 33) 

* stalking (Art. 34)
* physical violence (Art. 35)
* sexual violence, including rape (Art. 36)
* female genital mutilation (Art. 38)
* sexual harassment (Art. 40)

What about any of these things is ""gender-based""? Men get sexually harassed at the office, too. Women can be stalkers. Men can have their genitals mutilated too. Men can be physically assaulted or psychologically abused. 

It is very strange to refer to these as ""gender-based violence"". It sounds to me like some kind of agenda to demonize men, while erasing the fact that men can be victims of these things, or that women can commit crimes.",85.0

While women can express their sexuality freely and openly, and nobody judges them (to the contrary, praise them) men are harshly judged. This leads to discrimination, bullying, pushing men to solitude, low self esteem, self blaming, etc. 

Women can date whoever they want (older men, rich men, hot men, even ugly men), and don’t you dare judge her. People praise her. 

But if a man makes any move (which ironically is expected from you) people start judging you. Pretty? Out of your league. Older? What a loser, can’t get a younger woman. Ugly? What a loser, can’t get a pretty girl. She rejected you? You must be pathetic, learn to talk to girls (but if you reject a woman they call you faggot). 

One girl of my university uploaded a picture with a man on a bed showing her nipples with piercings. Hundreds of likes and commentaries in the picture. Society enables this behavior to women. But what if it was a man?

279,t3_rn3xfl,"Domestic violence is not a gender issue, framing as such only causes more harm and helps perpetuate tge circle of abuse","Erin Pizzey is a pioneer in classic femimism. She was the first to open a shelter for female victims of domestic violence (""Refuge"") and the first to write a book in the topic in the UK. Curiously, her unique experience led her to conclude that most domestic violence abuse is reciprocal and women are just as capable as men to be violent, even though men usually cause more physical damage. This observation has later been confirmed by an independent study, concluded by dr. Malcolm George which was later reinforced by prof. John Archer, 
 https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/women-are-more-violent-says-study-622388.html%3famp
but there are a plathora of other independent studies arriving to the same conclusion. 

After she tried to make her findings public, Erin Pizzey was immediately denounced, been subject to death threats and boycotts, various smear campaigns and her crutial and pioneering efforts in regards of helping batterd women (and men!) were deleted from most feminist textbooks.

According to her views - which I 100% aggree with - it is crutial to understand that domestic violence is not a gender issue, that ""men are NOT the problem"", because no one can help to people who see themselves as victims regardless of their own actions. She admits, that there are plenty cases in which the abuse is not reciprocal. But those women (and men) are in need of different treatment. Framing men as the perpetrators, the enemy, will only allow the circle of abuse to continue, because this notion turns a blind eye to the actual cause which is the prevalence of abuse in early childhood, and the fact that abused girls are just as likely as abused boys to be abusers themselves in adulthood. Further, those abused in childhood are more likely to end up in abusive relationships and the cycle continues. 

Tl;dr: domestic abuse is a gender neutral phenomenon, and if we wish to solve the problem once and for all, the first step would be to asses the cause accurately. The cause is the prevalence of abuse in childhood, not men/masculinity. Radical feminism is doing a disservice to both battered women and men.",128.0

281,t3_rn353j,Is kneeling and presenting a ring during a marriage proposal sexist???,"Hey guys, I have a question to ask yall.

(If you are coming from againstmensrights I promise I talk about more pressing issues lol.)

But back to my query, I was wondering why men get down on one knee and present a ring when proposing, so I tried to find info. I found [this](https://www.bustle.com/articles/181413-why-do-guys-kneel-to-propose-the-history-of-the-modern-western-proposal):

"" One possible origin of the modern kneeling ideal is in the Middle Ages tradition of courtly love, in which a man of good birth essentially devoted himself (complete with poems, odes, deeds of honor, and general vassalage) to a noblewoman he perceived as superior. **The entire principle of this popular attitude was that the man was a kind of servant to the woman, whom he idealized beyond all reality; and he performed his servitude by kneeling, spiritually and figuratively.** (Whether they ever actually got together is a matter of historical debate. Probably not, in a lot of cases; many of the women in question were married.) Kneeling represented feudal surrender and admiration. Historians have actually had arguments about whether certain medieval images show men kneeling to their courtly loves, or to their male masters. But kneeling in general in European history has been a sign of supplication, humility, and servitude. A lot of Christian iconography of prayer, for instance, involves kneeling, expressing your service to and debasement before God; and it's also been pointed out that kneeling between men was a big sign of status. Knights kneeled before their lords to receive honors, and surrendering armies kneeled before their conquerors.   **Kneeling to the woman you're going to marry may be part of the same thing: a request for her favor and a physical demonstration of loyalty and surrender.** ""

what the hell??? This is so misandrist!

And about the ring: 

"" But rings themselves as engagement symbols were likely around for many centuries, but they turn up in law at several points. The Visigothic Code, a set of Spanish laws from the 7th century, declared that betrothal rings, like pledges in business, could not be revoked once they were given; you *had* to get married. Pope Nicholas I in 860 attempted to make an expensive, gold engagement ring legally necessary, **so that men would make a significant monetary sacrifice and take the marriage seriously**."" 

Draining.

This is particularly harsh on men like the Kikuyu who already have to do SO much for the woman:

I wrote about this in an article I wrote some time ago:

 The Kikuyu tribe is the largest tribe in Kenya. According to [Kikuyu traditions](https://venasnews.co.ke/2019/05/28/kikuyu-dowry-payment-procedure-ruracio/), after a man proposes to a woman (usually with a diamond ring, that he purchased himself, in modern society) him and his family visit his fiancee’s home, in a visit known as ‘Kumenya mucii’, where the groom and his family must provide gifts, such as cash or animals, and also bear all the expenses of the visit, such as the food and drinks for both families. After this, the groom has to pay ‘kuracia’ or a part of the dowry payment, which can include animals, cash, or assorted items for the father and the mother of the bride. On the eve of the wedding, the groom and his friends or family must come to the gate of the bride’s house and ask to be let in. The bride’s female friends and family will ask for gifts from the groom before they let him in, such as food or even money. This is called ‘kuhura hoti’. Than the bride and some other women will cover themselves and the groom has to pick which of the women are his bride, if he chooses incorrectly he will have to pay a fine. This is called “gucagura muka wake” Then when the actual wedding happens, the groom and his family must pay for a portion of it. It is important to note that paying dowry, in Kikuyu culture, lasts a lifetime. 

 **So, after paying for several dates, gifts, the engagement ring, a portion of the dowry, various other payments throughout the engagement process, gifts for the mother and father of the bride, and a part of the wedding, what does the groom get for all his efforts? He gets to provide for the woman, and any children she has, for the rest of his life.** 

Am I the only one who thinks this is sexist or at least too much for the man???

Well guess what? Women actually watch MUCH MORE lesbian porn than men, AND studies show that many women won't date bisexual men but both straight and gay men are willing to date bisexuals. Why don't women wanna date bisexual men? Because they worry they will eventually become gay or are promiscuous womanizers who will cheat. They also perceive them as unmanly, and women are attracted to traditionally masculine men (talk about ""toxic masculinity"" perpetuated by women).

In a [survey](https://www.glamour.com/story/glamour-sexuality-survey) by *Glamour* of 1,015 women aged 18 to 44, 63% said they won't date a man who has had sex with another man. Other research showed that women refuse to date bisexual men. In the study ""[Swipe Left on the Bi Guys: Examining Attitudes Toward Dating and Being Sexual With Bisexual Individuals](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1080/15299716.2018.1563935)"":  


&gt;In qualitative research conducted in a midsized American city, Callis (2013) found that the many nonbisexual participants would not date a bisexual person, and that important differences emerged along gender lines. For example, eight out of 13 heterosexual women versus only two of 13 heterosexual men stated that they would not date a bisexual man or woman, respectively. Among the seven lesbian-identified participants, only one indicated that she would not date a bisexual woman; however the majority reported knowing lesbians in their community who refused to date bisexual women. This aligns with the experiences of bisexual women in the study who reported particular difficulty finding lesbian women willing to date them. Four out of eight gay male participants shared that they would not date a bisexual man. Callis (2013) noted that participants’ rationale for their decisions closely aligned with well-documented stereotypes about bisexual people. For example, heterosexual women reported concerns that bisexual men would be more likely to have an STI or be unfaithful. Heterosexual male participants, however, cited stereotypes about hypersexuality in their willingness to date bisexual women, noting the potential for “more sex” or the opportunity to experience a threesome with another woman.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a quantitative, online study of heterosexual men and women, Armstrong and Reissing (2014) also found evidence for gender differences in attitudes toward engaging in casual sex, dating, or a committed relationship with a bisexual person. All participants expressed negative attitudes toward engaging with bisexual people, and this negativity increased with the commitment level of the relationship. However, across all three relationship types, women reported more negative attitudes than men about partnering with a bisexual person. Specifically, women endorsed concerns that reflected stereotypes about hypersexuality and the presumed instability of a bisexual orientation, such that a bisexual male partner may “become gay in the future,” would be unsatisfied with a female partner, and would cheat on them with, or leave the relationship for, a man. Such results parallel the work of Mohr and Rochlen (1999), who found that cisgender men were more accepting of female bisexuality than cisgender women, and the work of Yost and Thomas (2012) who found that cisgender men were less accepting of bisexual men than bisexual women.

In the research paper's experimental design of 224 straight women, 120 straight men and 96 gay men:  


&gt;rather than asking participants to self-report attitudes toward dating and being sexual with bisexual individuals in general, this study utilized minor deception to assess attitudes toward dating specific hypothetical individuals. Participants were asked to complete a survey about online dating in which they were shown dating profiles of men and women randomly depicted as either straight, gay, or bisexual. They were then asked to rate the profiles on how sexually and romantically attractive they found the individuals, how much they would like to date and have sex with the individuals, and how masculine or feminine they found the individuals.  
&gt;  
&gt;To measure whether participants attended to the sexual orientations listed on the profiles, they were asked at two points during the survey to report the sexual orientation listed on the profile they previously viewed (one question came after a male profile, and one after a female profile). Results indicated that 12.5% (n=28) of heterosexual women and 20.8% (n=20) of gay men failed to report the correct sexual orientation of the male profile, and 22.5% (n=27) of heterosexual men failed to report the correct sexual orientation of the female profile. However, removing these participants did not ultimately change the significance of the MANOVA analyses for heterosexual women, (F(10, 2726)=7.61, p&lt;.001; n2=.03, heterosexual men, F(10, 1288) = 5.34, p &lt; .001, n2 = .04), or gay men, F(10, 1034) = 1.21, p = .28; n2 = .01. Therefore, the decision was ultimately made to include these participants in the analysis.

Here's the abstract:

&gt;Dating and maintaining romantic relationships can often be difficult for bisexual people due to binegativity and related negative stereotypes. The current study utilized an experimental design to investigate attitudes toward dating and being sexual with bisexual individuals. A convenience sample of 440 participants, including 224 heterosexual women, 120 heterosexual men, and 96 gay men was recruited to complete an online survey. Participants were shown seven cisgender male and seven cisgender female dating profiles with various sexual orientations. Participants rated each profile on measures of attractiveness and masculinity/femininity. Results indicated that heterosexual women rated bisexual men as less sexually and romantically attractive, less desirable to date and have sex with, and less masculine compared to straight men. No such differences were found for heterosexual and gay men’s ratings of female and male profiles, respectively. These results support previous research findings that indicate more negative attitudes toward dating bisexual men than bisexual women. The current study also provides further understanding as to how negative attitudes influence sexual and romantic attraction to bisexual individuals. Areas for future research are discussed.

Here's the results:

&amp;#x200B;

[In this table, it is shown that women are less willing than both straight and gay men to date a bisexual and they perceive bisexual men as less manly.](https://preview.redd.it/xxvyjfin07781.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aa88400363ba8bd8a9af8781ff50e535f663d46)

Many women might not outright admit they won't date bisexual men because they might get called biphobic or homophobic. Here's how they dug into her subconscious or her true colors:

&gt;However, rather than asking participants to self-report attitudes toward dating and being sexual with bisexual individuals in general, this study utilized minor deception to assess attitudes toward dating specific hypothetical individuals. Participants were asked to complete a survey about online dating in which they were shown dating profiles of men and women randomly depicted as either straight, gay, or bisexual. They were then asked to rate the profiles on how sexually and romantically attractive they found the individuals, how much they would like to date and have sex with the individuals, and how masculine or feminine they found the individuals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taken together, these results support previous research indicating that heterosexual women dem- onstrate more negative attitudes toward bisexual men than heterosexual men do toward bisexual women.

In case you assume participants didn't notice the sexual orientation of the dating profiles, read this:

&gt;To measure whether participants attended to the sexual orientations listed on the profiles, they were asked at two points during the survey to report the sexual orientation listed on the profile they previously viewed (one question came after a male profile, and one after a female profile). Results indicated that 12.5% (n=28) of heterosexual women and 20.8% (n=20) of gay men failed to report the correct sexual orientation of the male profile, and 22.5% (n=27) of heterosexual men failed to report the correct sexual orientation of the female profile. However, removing these participants did not ultimately change the significance of the MANOVA analyses for heterosexual women, (F(10, 2726)=7.61, p&lt;.001; n2=.03, heterosexual men, F(10, 1288) = 5.34, p &lt; .001, n2 = .04), or gay men, F(10, 1034) = 1.21, p = .28; n2 = .01. Therefore, the decision was ultimately made to include these participants in the analysis.

This shows that straight women are a lot less willing than straight men to date bisexual men and less willing to date bisexuals than even lesbians. It even finds lesbians are less willing than gay/bisexual men to date bisexuals of the same gender. It also finds that bisexual women are less willing than bisexual men to date or have sex with or engage in sexual/romantic activities with bisexual men although slightly more willing than bisexual men to enter relationships with bisexual men. It also finds that bisexual women are more willing to date/have sex with/enter relationships with/engage in romantic or sexual activity with other bisexual women than with bisexual men whereas bisexual men are more willing to date/have sex with/enter relationships with/engage in romantic or sexual activity with bisexual women than with other bisexual men.

It's women who have homophobic dating preferences (i.e.: many of them won’t date bisexuals but men usually will). They worry bisexual men are womanizers who will cheat on them or will eventually become gay. They also think bisexual men aren't masculine enough and want a masculine men (sounds like ""toxic masculinity"" to me). Nonetheless, feminists ignore this and instead will complain about men simply watching lesbian porn. At the same time, women watch lesbian porn much more than men. They actually watch more lesbian porn than men.

According to PornHub statistics, lesbian porn is, by a long shot, the most popular category among women, and lesbian porn is 151% more popular with women than men.

So women watch far more lesbian porn than men and often refuse to date bisexual men and see him as a red flag or see him as not a ""real man"" whereas men have no problem at all dating bisexual women and even many gay men won't mind dating bisexual men, but feminists are mad at men for ""fetishizing"" lesbians just by merely watching lesbian porn or being aroused by lesbian sex, even if men don't go out of their way to sexually harass lesbians yet they say nothing about what women do?

This is like how feminists condemn men for being attracted to Asian women yet they don't complain about how way more Asian women are obsessed with white men than white men who are obsessed with Asian women.",884.0

301,t3_rmin5m,Dealing with ex introducing kids to boyfriend too early,"I know I am somewhat powerless here, but looking for any tips to deal. 

My ex became brave and introduced our children to her boyfriend of 3 weeks after I requested they not join the birthday dinner he planned for her. Not only did they meet, they all stayed the night at his house. I was never told, I found out through tracking my daughter's phone. I didn't even know the guy's name, I had to figure it out.

He might be a good guy, I'm not assuming. What I don't want is the emotional trauma to my children, they are 9&amp;10, if they get too attached and the relationship fails. 

I tried discussing it with the ex today, and while she agrees that she would not want me to do what she just did, she took them back over to stay the night again tonight. 

What can I do here? Even if that means what do I discuss with my children. I am going back to court for full custody due to her relapsing again in August. We don't have court until March. She is sober for now due to a S.C.R.A.M bracelet. It's going to be easy for the kids to be excited about being over there as he has  two daughters 8&amp;12. So I'll just be plain dad. I've always had to be the discipline parent since she won't discipline no matter how many times I show her the affects  and how it makes her daily life harder. And time with her has been a little.more special since there has been long stretches she doesn't see them if shes on a bender. 

Is there anything useful to use as leverage in my custody hearing from this?

She attempted to 'take me to the cleaners' but it didn't quite work out the way she intended.

I kept the house, gave her some equity and I currently have my daughter 5/14 nights per weekend. I also have parental responsibility in the UK which means we both have full legal guardianship of my daughter, the ex wife is just the residing parent.

My daughter has stated she wants 50/50 access, which my ex wife went crazy about. We are only talking 1 extra night per week I imagine the ex wife went crazy as this would reduce child maintenance to £0.

During this time, the teachers have contacted me about my daughters progress, as the ex wife doesn't  'get' what we are trying to do with the maths for further knowledge.

My ex wife also got COVID and I just took my daughter for that fortnight period. All was fine and dandy. I have shown I can manage a household.

I may be moving jobs soon and If successful, my workplace will be a lot closer to my house and the school, more flexible working, less hours and more pay.

There's 2 motives here:

1) Most importantly, I want my daughter 50/50. I legitimately think this is in her best interests. I also think this sends the message that my ex wife is not first amongst equals, but we are actual with respect to paternity.

2) Secondly, this would reduce child maintenance payments to zero. It's true. But I would look to reinvest this money into things my daughter and I can do together, such as going on holiday and getting her into clubs. Yes, this will affect the ex wife's' income, but it's not my responsibility to subsidise her life style. She can work some more hours or something. I wouldn't be expecting her to pay me anything on my half of having her. I already pay for school uniforms, trips, childcare (we split this, but it's typically when she has her). If it gives her financial problems, well my daughter can just live with me full time then? I feel like an asshole writing this, but if we have a 50/50 split, that's how money works in my country. Why should I just keep writing cheques to my wife when I get a promotion so she can flitter it away. Yes, there is an inequality in our income, but she left because she wanted to be independent. But financially, she doesn't want to be independent.

332,t3_rln8fl,Most prison rape is committed by women,"I think it's fair to say that the majority opinion of prison rape is that it's something that happens between criminals, and hence is less serious and possibly even comedic. There are some very victim blaming attitudes around it.

These sources, and there are plenty of others, paints a different picture:

* Most sexual abuse in secure facilities housing male inmates is committed by staff, not criminals, and mostly by female staff.
* These facts also hold true for juvenile inmates, most sexual victimisation of juvenile male inmates being conducted by female staff.
* Inmates in female facilities are more likely to be abused by other female inmates than by staff.

So basically the opposite of the stereotype, but the stereotype still drives a lot of policy decisions and media representation.

I think there are parallels here with domestic violence. Female-perpetrated violent crime is mostly not aimed at strangers, as violent crime committed by men is, but mostly against people over whom those women have power: intimate partners, children, elders, people in institutional settings.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1525107115580785?journalCode=jrxa

&gt;Although the surveys conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics over the last decade in response to the 2003 Prison Rape Elimination Act are unable to speak to the motivations of the victims or the perpetrators, they provide an assessment of the magnitude of the problem and offer extensive detail on the circumstances surrounding female staff sexual misconduct. The findings indicate that female staff members are overrepresented among perpetrators of staff sexual misconduct in prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_rape_in_the_United_States

&gt; Male sexual victimization was more frequently perpetrated by the staff, whereas the perpetrator for female inmates was more frequently another inmate.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/

&gt; Not only does the traditional sexual victimization paradigm masks male victimization, it can obscure sexual abuse perpetrated by women as well as same-sex victimization. We offer a few counterparadigmatic examples. One multiyear analysis of the NCVS household survey found that 46% of male victims reported a female perpetrator.23 Of juveniles reporting staff sexual misconduct, 89% were boys reporting abuse by female staff.

https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/59-6-6.pdf

&gt; When surveyors uncover surprising data suggesting that women staff are more likely than men to sexually abuse men and boys in their custody, they tend either to ignore the counter-stereotypical findings, or to reinterpret them in accordance with conventional gendered expectations: Could male inmates be misinterpreting women guards’ authorized physical searches31 as sexual assault? Another form of stereotype reconciliation is to redefine staff–inmate sex as consensual, “romantic,” or even as sexual exploitation of the female guard by the incarcerated man or boy. ... A second interpretive impulse that tends to reconcile unexpected findings with gendered expectations is to doubt the survey results. The BJS’s initial response to its counter-stereotypical findings about staff sexual abuse was to question them. It reported on the 2007 NIS: Nearly 62% of all reported incidents of staff sexual misconduct involved female staff with male inmates; 8% involved male staff with female inmates. Female staff were involved in 48% of incidents reported by male inmates who said they were unwilling and in 79% of incidents with male inmates who said they were willing. In an effort to better understand the allegations of staff sexual misconduct, the 2008 NIS will include questions to determine how often sexual contact reported as unwilling occurred in the course of pat downs or strip searches.170 Could male prisoners be reporting routine physical or strip searches as sexual misconduct?171 The results of the most recent BJS survey suggest that this does not account for the unexpected findings. In the second NIS, as in the first, male inmates continued to report disproportionate rates of sexual misconduct by female staff, and it was not confined to authorized physical searches. While about 40 percent of male and female victims reported that staff had touched them sexually during a “pat down” (physical search) or strip search, 86 percent of male victims (and 91 percent of female victims) reported sexual touching by staff outside the context of strip or physical search.172 The BJS reported these findings without comment, but presented them under the heading, “Reports of staff sexual misconduct were linked to strip searches and pat downs.”173

&gt; Similarly, Dyan McGuire acknowledged the BJS finding that “male inmates are at substantial risk of sexual exploitation by female correctional personnel,”174 but she reframed the findings in accordance with conventional gender expectations that sexual abuse of men by women is neither likely nor harmful. She cautions that it would be “misleading” to read the BJS data as “impl[ying] that the abuse of male inmates by female guards is a larger or more serious problem than the abuse of female inmates by male guards.”175 She characterizes women guards’ sexual abuse of male inmates as “qualitatively different” and less serious than sexual abuse of women inmates by male guards, which she characterizes as “confirmed instances of serious rape or forcible sexual assault.”176 She speculates that sexual abuse by women staff may be overreported,177 and she claims that male inmates allege minor indignities such as “inappropriate viewing and other ‘passive’ sexual impositions” (even though the BJS surveys ask only about sexual abuse that involves touching).17

https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1073&amp;context=mjgl

&gt; The Prison Rape Elimination Act (""PREA"") of 2003 mandated that the Bureau of Justice Statistics (""the Bureau"") undertake new studies of sexual violence in prisons.8 Accordingly, the Bureau released a report in July 2006 revealing some groundbreaking data. Of the 344 substantiated allegations of staff-on-inmate sexual violence made in federal, state,and private prisons9 in 2005, 67% of the overall victims were male inmates and 62% of the overall perpetrators were female staff.1 "" The data contradicts the deeply entrenched perception that, in cross-gender interactions between prison staff and inmates, men are the perpetrators of sexual violence and women are the victims.11

Regarding cases of rape against confined children, we have this:

https://www.propublica.org/article/boys-in-custody-and-the-women-who-abuse-them

&gt;Reggie Wilkinson, the former director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, said that consensual sex between a corrections officer and an inmate is impossible given the power imbalance between the two.

&gt; But he also said that, in some cases, both female guards and the boys they molest share some responsibility.

&gt; “There’s no such thing as consensual sex when you are supervising someone, regardless of their age, but the reality of it is that some of the guys in prison are very persuasive and some of the women are very persuasive,” Wilkinson said.

&gt; “I’m not sure anybody has got a real handle on why the Bureau of Justice Statistics is finding these kinds of numbers, but it’s on the radar screen of a lot of people.”

&gt; Wilkinson and Stannow agree that it is important to keep women as detention facility personnel. They often do great work. But the predators, they say, must be identified, halted and prosecuted.

&gt; “I think in many cases female staff are better suited than males,” Wilkinson said. “A good mix of staff is what we always want. That so-called motherly impact is a big deal and women who are stern but fair with the inmates I think can perform that job as well as any male could.”

Their response to most rapists of confined children being women is to remark on how women are better than men, and hiring them is really important, while their victims are ""very persuasive"". 

Most offenses in juvenile facilities are female staff on male children:

https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/victim-perpetrator-and-incident-characteristics-sexual-victimization-youth

&gt; * A higher percentage of male (6.1%) than female (2.9%) youth reported staff sexual misconduct.
- A higher percentage of female (4.7%) than male (1.6%) youth reported youth-on-youth victimization.
- In most-serious incidents of staff sexual misconduct, an estimated 91% of incidents involved only female staff, while 6% involved only male staff.",793.0

Except I am also really good with kids and can bake an crochet and all so I can beat her in domestic skills as well. What does she bring? Just being lucky enough to get to be a woman.

A woman can always find sex and companionship so she can hold out while the rigged system pressures men to settle. Men end up becoming beta bucks to someone who have their best years to someone else while they were lonely and suffered solely because they were cursed into being an average or not so attractive man. I don't really have interest in loose sex; I want a life partnership. But if I can't get that, being a woman would at least guarantee me that I'd never ever ever ever be lonely again or in want of companionship of the opposite gender; or physical desire if I choose. I'd have people pining to be with me and I'd be loved and desired like no way before. Life as a woman would be a heavenly dream. 

So what if I have to deal with the occasional physical pain. The life of being loved and wanted and desired; a life free of loneliness; a life where you are valued. That all would be given to me. The occasional pregnancy and period pain would be worth it.",16.0

""As of 8 December, 1,318 civilians have been killed during military crackdowns on the pro-democracy movement, including 93 women, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) non-profit human rights organisation.""

Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59462503

Instead of focusing on how disproportionately over ten times more males died than females died because of Myanmar's current oppressive regime the BBC wants to focus on the women that died rather than the men despite women being less than one-tenth of the total deaths. This is just another example of the continuing norm of male disposability/expendability in the West. BBC journalists righteously believe in destroying sexist expectations, norms, and stereotypes of women but wrongly refuse to destroy sexist expectations, norms, and stereotypes of men such as a man's life being, in this case ten times, less important than a woman's. I'm sure many or you can recall how the lack of Western media's focus on the massacre of boys and men by Boko Haram was ignored by Western media so Boko Haram kidnapped girls afterwards because they realized that Western media doesn't give a darn about boys and men being massacred but when some girls are kidnapped they go into outrage. This and other examples I have read like this in newspapers such as the New York Times just make me so angry and frustrated. What are your thoughts on this and do any of you have any tips on how I can deal with my frustration that because I happened to be born male my life is inherently less important to society than a woman's life. It's not like I chose to be born male and if I could go back in time and choose my biological sex at conception I would choose to be female. Thanks in advance and happy holidays!",214.0

Rape is about consent. If other doesn’t give a consent, it’s a rape. That why you can’t have sex with a sleeping person. Also just not saying yes or being silent isn’t a consent. 

And that’s why it’s a rape when you ahve send with someone who can’t give a consent. Like someone who is mentally disabled.
Guess who also can’t consent; kids! 

Why is it so hard to understand????
I’m so sick of this double standard that media is pulling out of their ass when it comes to boys. All these people are saying is that kids can consent when they say “well the boy wanted it”

Edit: And just because it’s techie legal, doesn’t mean it’s morally correct. If you are a man/woman who searches for kids that are “easy to get” and work at place full of kids, there is something wrong with you. 

The fact that even if 2 adults consent but the other asks to stop in middle of the sex and you don’t stop, that’s still rape. So why is it, that having sex with a person, who mentally isn’t capable of consenting, is seen as “just having sex”? 

Just because you are “more powerful” that the other, doesn’t mean you can’t be raped. Ever heard of manipulating? “Well they were flirting and sexting.” And who’s fault is that? Do you go to other victims and tell them “well why did you wear that skirt? Why were you out at night? Why did you drink the drink he/she gave to you? Why didn’t you scream?” No, you don’t.",433.0

It is mostly used in situations where a man is living with a woman in a house or apartment, as boyfriend &amp; girlfriend or husband &amp; wife.

The term tends to be used in jest, and people (mainly other men) are often saying how ""cool"" and/or ""awesome"" it is. No questions are asked and no negatively is expressed about it.

Thinking more about it, I think it's a term that has an indirect and disguised negative connotation, because what it *really* means is that the wife or girlfriend is in control and has the rest of the house or apartment to herself. It's basically implying that the man has been relegated into his own little space, as if to say *""that's all he'll get""*.

It's even worse when a man uses an outside shed or outbuilding as the ""man cave"", as it means that the wife or girlfriend has the entire house to herself.

For our anniversary celebration, my partner and I went out with his work friends. One of his colleagues sister’s happened to bump into us and we all had a jolly good time. 

All was well until the following happened: I was dancing with some of the friends and he hung back at the booth as he isn’t much of a dancer. He noticed the sister laying down on the seats so asked if she was ok, and she took that as an invitation to try and snare him. She sat next to him, and kept demanding he dance with her. So he told her sorry but no that he’s here with me for our anniversary. She then said that if he won’t dance with her, she’s going to accuse him of raping her. Thankfully, one of the colleagues witnessed this, and he removed himself from the situation, it eventually made its way to me and I was livid. White hot rage livid.

I found my other half and we left shortly after. The brother knew of her issues and regretted allowing her to come along, and he endorsed us going to the police. 

We ended up reporting her, and we were told that she’s known to the police so I hope her actions will lead to her getting in trouble. 

What honestly gets me is women like this. It makes me so sick and honestly I’m not even upset that she tried to smother me.

383,t3_rjgiza,The execution of men," 

Men executed, women most affected

Men’s rights activists often talk about the empathy gap, but there cannot be a clearer example of the empathy gap than this.

Around the world, men are more likely to be sentenced to the death penalty than women. There are even countries where only men can be executed.

In the United States of America, during the year 2020, 17 people were executed. [All of them were male](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/execution-database?filters%5BstartDate%5D=01%2F01%2F2020&amp;filters%5BendDate%5D=12%2F31%2F2020). Since the year 1976, [1,540](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/execution-database) people were executed, [1,523](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/execution-database?filters%5Bgender%5D=Male) of them were male. Men represented 99% of those executed. 

[According to Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/04/death-penalty-in-2020-facts-and-figures/), the top countries with the highest number of executions were China, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Data for China is inaccessible or low quality, so excluding that, these four countries executed approximately 425 individuals. So says the factsheet, “Amnesty International recorded that 16 women were among the 483 people known to have been executed in 2020 (3%), in the following countries: Egypt (4), Iran (9), Oman (1), Saudi Arabia (2).

Egypt recorded at least [107 ](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/04/death-penalty-2020-despite-covid-19-some-countries-ruthlessly-pursued-death-sentences-and-executions/)executions in 2020, making men more than 96% of the executed. Iran executed at least 246 people, making men more than 96% of the executed. Saudi Arabia was slightly more equitable with men being ‘only’ 92% of those executed. However, this is an unusually low number for the middle eastern nation, as in 2019, [numbers were much higher](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-52358476), “The kingdom executed 178 men and six women in 2019, just over half of whom were foreign nationals” This would make men around 97% of those executed. 

But the obvious anti-male bias extends much further than this. In a number of countries, it is actually illegal to send a woman to her death, but it is fine to do it to a man. One example is Belarus. [According to article 59](http://www.levonevski.net/pravo/kodeksy/uk/009.html) of the law, women cannot be given life imprisonment, or be executed. In Russia, a similar principle is followed. Both [article 57 and 59](https://www.imolin.org/doc/amlid/Russian_Federation_Criminal_Code.pdf) of the criminal code contains misandrist laws. Article 57 says women cannot be sentenced to life in prison, while article 59 says women cannot be sentenced to death. Both of these men can be sentenced to. I’m guessing Pussy Riot isn’t going to be asking for equality in this.

[Guatemala](https://pbi-guatemala.org/fileadmin/user_files/projects/guatemala/files/spanish/Boletin_15_espanol.pdf) is yet another country where such a law applies, where it says, about the death penalty, “However, it does not apply in cases of political crimes, women, men over 60 years of age and youths below the age of

criminal responsibility” As well as [Tajikistan](http://preventgenocide.org/law/domestic/tajikistan.htm), in Article 59 (2) of the Criminal code, women cannot be given the death penalty, but men can. 

In total, men made up around 97% of those executed around the world. I wonder where The PatriarchyTM  is to save them? But never mind, maybe it goofs, but apparently not, according to some. 

[The World Coalition against the death penalty](https://worldcoalition.org/campagne/19th-world-day-against-the-death-penalty/) dedicated 10th October 2021 to the **women** who are executed or sentenced to be executed. Now why would they dedicate this one day a year to the three percent of those who were faced with the death penalty? Well because women are discriminated against, of course! 

“Extensive discrimination based on sex and gender, often coupled with other elements of identity, such as age, sexual orientation, disability, and race expose women to intersecting forms of structural inequalities. Such prejudices can weigh heavily on sentencing, including when women are stereotyped as an evil mother, a witch, or a femme fatale. This discrimination can also lead to critical mitigating factors not being considered during arrest and trial, such as being subjected to gender-based violence and abuse.”

The PatriarchyTM is so incompetent that with all of the ‘structural inequalities’ that they only managed to get 3% of the executed to be their enemy. [It is definitely not because men are punished worse in the justice system](https://repository.law.umich.edu/law_econ_current/57/). 

[And it’s also not as if men are victims of gender-based violence as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/rc0bbm/lets_talk_about_gendered_violence_against_men/).

Should a man have the right to give up all his parental rights and essentially abort himself from the pregnancy? After all if a woman has the right to abort an unwanted pregnancy why should the same not apply to men? Obviously it would be wrong to give a man the power to force a woman to abort her pregnancy. After all her body, her choice and as my wife said ""exactly, and as for the man, his money his choice""

Now we do also agree that a man should notify the woman early enough in her pregnancy of his decision to not want to be a part of the childs life, and therefore give up all parental rights and not be financially responsible in anyway shape or form for the child. We feel this should be done around 10-14 weeks (I'm at 14 weeks, she's at 10). 

The reason we feel this way is because as a pregnancy goes on an abortion does begin to carry more medical risks. So the pregnant woman should be informed early enough that she can make her own decision as its reasonable to assume that his decision could affect her decision. 

Also there should be some kind of documentation/notification process. 

The only caveat to the above, is if the woman hide her pregnancy from the man, then those limits go out the window. A woman should have the responsibility of informing the father of the child she is carrying that he is expected to become a father. This way he has time to make his decision as well.

Kinda surprised by her reasonable take and thought this sub might appreciate it.",814.0

398,t3_rittt1,Is there a good way to get married for the sake of raising A child? Advice,"Looking into state law, marriage is maybe still doable for me in Michigan and with our circumstances. I don't want it to be a death sentence for me if God forbid things don't go perfectly. I know that you can't control your SO and only control yourself even though our relationship is still good today. Some things I find fair; splitting assets during the length of the marriage. Not fair; no default 50/50 custody, and not being able to know alimony. Please tell me what I'm missing if anything. Michigan alimony is 1\3 of marriage length which sucks but is maybe okay, but I'm afraid of changing laws and other circumstances ; some states are completely messed up. 

Details:
We've been together for about 10 years since HS (so I feel obligated to at least try to figure it out). We have similar dept. 
I'm only willing to have one child. I would have more if there was 50/50 custody as long as I'm good decent parent, however I can't mandate that. she doesn't want to be a stay at home wife, and I'm okay because I think it helps me with alimony and financial support if it doesn't work out. it helps her stay marketable. (I'd pay child support on top so I don't understand alimony). The idea is she works while the kid is away at school. She works preschool so there's actual programs that help for the young age bracket. However, push comes to shove I think it's important for early years to be with the child. She agrees. Although, we have disagreements about how to raise the children, I thinks it's important to at least be able to walk away. 

You can't get rid our alimony on a prenuptial agreement, even though we both disagree with it. I only agree with it to the point of getting back on their feet. I don't think I should be financing sometimes lifestyle for what can amount to 4+,10+ years. The problem is I don't even know until it's all said and done. Second, I don't think I can do anything ensuring custody except being active in their life ECT. 

I am planning on getting a prenuptial agreement which was already agreed to. I'm just not totally possible if it can even help at this point with similar assets. At least it could help keep a divorce expedient if it happens.",0.0

I also saw an episode of the Golden Girls spinoff Golden Palace, where, in order to distract the health inspector, Blanche started hitting on him and then planted a huge kiss on his lips. 

Also, this episode of The Nanny when Fran tried to prove to Max that she’s a good kisser and immediately started making out with him. This was in the second season. Now as much as I *love* The Nanny, that’s still an annoying double standard. 

Also, on the Big Bang Theory, Leonard’s mom got drunk and drunkenly kissed Sheldon on the mouth. And she and Penny were making comments about the bartender’s penis. 

At least on this King of the Hill episode where Luanne’s mother showed up, they called her out for getting trashed and grinding on Luanne’s boyfriend Buckley, and Buckley was clearly disgusted. So there’s that at least.

413,t3_ricz3m,"Women are NOT ""73% more likely to suffer fatal injuries in a car accident due to safety procedures in cars being designed for men"".","Some feminists claim that ""women are 73% more likely to suffer fatal injuries in a car accident due to safety procedures in cars being designed for men"". This is false. Let us see why.

According to page 4 of [ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection) Publication 23 — Report on the Task Group on Reference Man (1975)](https://journals.sagepub.com/pb-assets/cmscontent/ANI/P_023_1975_Report_on_the_Task_Group_on_Reference_Man_rev0.pdf), the *Reference Man* is defined as follows:
&gt; Reference Man is defined as being between 20-30 years of age, weighing 70 kg, is 170 cm in height, and lives in a climate with an average temperature of from 10° to 20°C. He is Caucasian and isp a Western European or North American in habitat and custom.

Note that there is no explicit mention of gender, except for the use of generic masculine nouns and pronouns.

Average heights did not change significantly since the *Reference Man* was designed, so we can rely on recent data. Since the *Reference Man* was at the time designed with Caucasians in mind, notwithstanding whether this was a good choice or not, we will look at the average heights of Caucasian men and women. According to pages 13 and 15 [Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults: United States, 2015–2018 (CDC, 2021)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03-046-508.pdf), Caucasian US men of age 20 and over are on average 176.7 cm large, while Caucasian US women of age 20 and over are on average 162.4 cm large.

Now let's average the average heights of women and men in the US: (176.7 cm + 162.4 cm ) ÷ 2 = 169.55 cm. As we can see, with 170 cm the ""Reference Man"" is about the average of Caucasian US men's and women's average height.

Also note that [in recent years, variations of the *Reference Man* were created](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02992693) for different body size, age, sex, and race.

Then you have some articles claim that women suffer from higher fatality and injury rates than men. What they fail to mention is that this does not take into account that women crash in different situations, e.g. they tend to sit in the passenger seat and drive smaller cars. The ""fact"" has been repeated e.g. [by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes) (title: ""The deadly truth about a world built for men – from stab vests to car crashes"") [who again quote The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/female-dummy-makes-her-mark-on-male-dominated-crash-tests/2012/03/07/gIQANBLjaS_story.html) or [by the CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/automobile-accident-crash-collision-gender-safety-injuries-1.5183079) (title: ""Why life-saving improvements to car safety have benefited men more than women""). However, the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) [released an article](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicle-choice-crash-differences-help-explain-greater-injury-risks-for-women) earlier this year that reads:

&gt; Women are much more likely than men to suffer a serious injury when they are involved in a crash, but much of the heightened risk is related to the types of vehicles women drive and the circumstances of their crashes, rather than physical differences, new research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows.  
&gt;  
&gt; “Our study shows that today’s crash testing programs have helped women as much as men,” says Jessica Jermakian, IIHS vice president of vehicle research and one of the study’s authors. “That said, we found that women are substantially more likely to suffer leg injuries, which is something that will require more investigation.”  
&gt;   
&gt; Though men are involved in more fatal crashes than women, on a per-crash basis women are 20-28 percent more likely than men to be killed and 37-73 percent more likely to be seriously injured after adjusting for speed and other factors. However, when IIHS researchers limited the comparison to similar crashes, they found those discrepancies mostly disappeared and that crashworthiness improvements have benefited men and women more or less equally.  

Additionally, women more often sit in the passenger seat [which increases their likelihood of suffering fatal injuries during a crash](https://trid.trb.org/view/1572698).

So yes, women do have a greater relative risk, i.e. a greater risk *on a per-crash basis*, of suffering fatal injuries in a car accident, but not due to discrimination. The article authors do note however that ""\[w\]omen were still more than 2½ times as likely to suffer moderate leg injuries. They were also about 70 percent more likely than men to suffer serious leg injuries, though that figure wasn’t statistically significant"" and that this is something ""that will require more investigation"".

**But all of this factors out that men overall drive longer hours and that in absolute numbers, men suffer more from fatal car crashes:**
&gt; Seventy-one percent of all motor vehicle crash deaths in 2019 were males. Males accounted for 71 percent of passenger vehicle driver deaths, 48 percent of passenger vehicle passenger deaths, 96 percent of large truck driver deaths, 67 percent of large truck passenger deaths, 70 percent of pedestrian deaths, 86 percent of bicyclist deaths, and 91 percent of motorcyclist deaths. — [IIHS, 2019](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/males-and-females)

In absolute numbers in passenger vehicles alone, men are almost twice as likely to suffer fatal injuries from a car crash as women are. Taking into account all motor vehicle deaths, this factor jumps up to around 2 ½.

**Phrased differently:**
If you picked a random man and a random woman out of the population who are also going to drive / be driven in two separate cars for the same length of time in circumstances that are 'typical' for their gender, and you asked me to guess who is more likely to die in the next car crash, I would bet on the woman.

If on the other hand you picked a random man and a random woman out of the population who are also going to drive / be driven in two separate cars for the same length of time in the exact same circumstances, and you asked me to guess who is more likely to die in the next car crash, I would bet on neither.

If instead, you picked a random man and a random woman out of the population and asked me to guess who is more likely to die in a car crash over their lifetime, I would bet on the man.

**Edit:** As one of the commentators pointed out, crash-test dummies are not modeled after the ""Reference Man"".

Please have a look here instead: [https://www.motorbiscuit.com/the-humble-history-of-the-crash-test-dummy/](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/the-humble-history-of-the-crash-test-dummy/)

&gt; The first crash test dummies were actually cadavers. […] There were brief forays into testing with live people and animals. Neither produced highly useful results and presented ethical dilemmas.
&gt; 
&gt; It wasn’t until 1949 that crash test dummies were first developed. The first dummies created served for testing aircraft ejection seats for the U.S. Air Force. Sierra Sam was the first crash test dummy, fixed to propelled sleds on rails.
&gt; 
&gt; The same type of dummy was later used by the automotive industry to develop shoulder harnesses and lap seat belts. […]
&gt; 
&gt; **By 1970, concerns rose because the adult-size male dummies didn’t give the data needed on what happened to smaller child and female physiques in crashes.** Restraint systems designed to protect the adult male dummies were actually causing injuries to smaller passengers, especially children.
&gt; 
&gt; **That year a larger male dummy, named Sierra Stan, and a female model named Sierra Susie came along.** The same year saw them joined by Sierra Sammy, a dummy the size of a six-year-old child, and Sierra Toddler who was the size of a three-year-old.

So in short, crash test dummies used to be male only because they came out of the military (so it is understandable why they didn't have a female model), but this was corrected already in 1970.",1061.0

I thought it was well done and one of Ernie’s best roles. It followed a man in his 30’s that was single and had no dating prospects (big and overweight man that wasn’t easy on the eyes) and was being pushed by others to get into the dating world and socialize with women even though he knew the outcome and was tired of the same thing over and over again. 

Though, he gets a hopeful ending. The movie addresses a lot of things in there that I felt were important. 

1. Societal Pressure for men to pursue relationships even if they don’t want to
2. Men being told who they can and can’t see by friends and family
3. Mens feelings and opinions on their personal life being dismissed by everyone who knows better 
4. The pain of constant rejection for things you can’t change for men that no one ever addresses and makes fun of today

I’m a big guy myself and relate to this movie on many levels. I’m near 6’5 and large. I’ve been used and humiliated, been made the brunt of women’s jokes and games from teens to mid 20’s. I’ve been pressured to date from family but I don’t want to. I want to be a dad and have a family but with how things are, it just doesn’t seem possible. 

I remember one scene from the movie that just hits home.

Also, I feel much of the anger and blame is misdirected. I notice that feminism is talked about a lot as a cause to virtually most issues afflicting men as a class. But I feel this is misguided and counter-productive to coming up with meaningful solutions. It's more accurate to blame patriarchal institutions and culture for unfair stigmatization and treatment. (An example would be the concept of chivoulry or the discrepancies against men in divorce courts, both of which are mostly influenced by a historically patriarchal culture &amp; society.) 

To expand off of this (frankly, kind of weird) obsession with feminism: it seems more reactionary and, as such, doesn't give rise to meaningful solution-oriented thinking to the problems men face as a class.

434,t3_rhjdsi,Radical feminist seeks advice on gender relations,"Hey 23 yo female here. I joined this group out of intense curiosity, and I love reading your posts/learning more about your ideas on modern day feminism.

I am a liberation (radical) feminist as opposed to an equality feminist. This basically means that my goal is not equality with men as I believe that men are also oppressed/unfree (in a more complex and inconspicuous manner than women). By advocating for mere equality, I would be agreeing/assimilating to your own plight.

When I was in college, I experimented with my own take on equality feminism by adopting the fuckboy approach when it came to guys/hookups. I took everything I learned from past relationships and friendships with men and started applying them to my own interactions with men. (I know that not all men are fuckboys, but the hookup culture environment I grew up in was heavy on this). I did this because I genuinely felt that the only way I could get a guy to like me was to be manipulative (as this had made me obsess over guys in the past). 

It fully worked. I had no problem getting or keeping guys with this approach, and it was fun. But, at a certain point, I found it unfulfilling and started to feel overwhelming guilt for the toxicity I was promoting, so I just stopped engaging with men romantically for about a year and half to reflect on what the fuck I had even become.

Now, I am in a healthy relationship with an amazing guy who has allowed me to remove myself even further from the deep insecurity that made me want to adopt the fuckboy approach in the first place.

I am posting this because the general vibe I get from most of these posts is frustration with women using the means they have at their disposal to assert control over men. For example, while I believe that the cancel culture surrounding rape/sexual is highly toxic, I believe that many women cling to it bc they see it as an accessible way to take back some control in the male/female dynamic. At the same time, I believe misogyny/toxic masculinity is overwhelmingly the result of deep-set insecurity that our society has engrained in men, and this insecurity (and it’s causes) are not adequately recognized by the feminist movement.

Essentially, I am wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to end the cycle of toxicity men and women are currently stuck in. It seems like we aren’t getting anywhere with current movements on both female and male sides bc we are too divided. For me, it took first trying to match toxic/fuckboy energy to realize that I wanted something completely new/different from my relationships.

I am wondering if anyone here would be open to a movement that recognizes the unique ways in which both men and women are oppressed and emphasizes open/empathetic communication between both parties to develop certain goals.   

If so, what would you like this movement to look like?

Now, biased unacademic language and flat out inaccuracies aside, there's one thing that really caught my attention.

&gt; There isn’t [any conclusive evidence](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/circumcised-vs-uncircumcised) for or against having a foreskin or its associated anatomy. 

This is what caused me to begin seeing a massive issue with this article and others like it. They play dumb.

First of all... how is that even possible? In all of humanity's existence, apparently there has never been anyone who's interested and scientifically minded enough to prove or disprove claims about a perfectly healthy and natural part of human anatomy? Are they saying that no research or evidence exists or has existed on the internet nor human civilization's VAST archives of medical study?

Plus, this STILL isn't a remotely passable defense for circumcision. After all, chopping off a part of someone's body without their consent nor any understanding of that body part is STILL a monstrous and inexcusable breach of any and all medical ethics including the Hippocratic oath.

And this isn't even exclusive to this article. It's all over, and needs to be called out wherever it is.

Also, just as a sidenote [a nonprofit called Foregen](https://www.foregen.org/) is making progress in regenerating the human foreskin and could be of great use, in both it's potential to undo circumcision and the resources it provides against circumcision.",136.0

I really do wish prospect of marriage and what made it so valuable could still exist today becuase many under estimate what a beautiful thing it truly is.

It is becuase of this combination of factors that i feel that i have no perpose and Man cannot live without perpose. I dont want to join the military becuase i disagree with the direction they are going in, they cannot draft me due to a medical condition that i have that prevents them from doing so. Tho i am safe, it still sends chills down my spine that young fellow men just like me that I know in school will one day be called apon for duty and be ordered to lay down their lives, and do so without a say in their fate. The men who object to being drafted as a result for having the basic moral standard of wanting to keep their own lives have been labeled cowards since the first world War with the white feather. It is the unfortunate truth that we are truly disposable to a society that doesn't care about us and that deeply saddens me.

471,t3_rgff7r,"Is anyone here familiar with Laura Bates and her book ""Men Who Hate Women"" that was recently released?","I had heard of her book when it was coming out late last year because the subtitle caught my attention ""Men who hate women - From incels to Pickup Artists, the truth about extreme misogyny and how it affects us all."" and I haven't gotten around to reading it yet but I did listen to a 45 minute podcast with her on Intelligence Squared.

It was actually fascinating to listen to someone describe the manosphere from an outside perspective. She tried to do her research and looked into the MensRights communities, the incel communities, the Red pill communities, etc and although her impressions were very negative, I can't really blame her for being an outsider with an agenda. 

I was disappointed to see that she fundamentally misunderstands these communities and only seems to have seen half the picture. Are there a bunch of misogynist men online that hate women? Of course. Is that the majority? Definitely not but the few are creating our reputation.

The manosphere to me has been a bastion of hope, community and progress for my personal life and if I hadn't found the seduction/redpill community for example, I think my life would today be a lot more painful than it is. Did I witness a lot of misogyny and men being heavily bitter towards women? Absolutely. Did I also get to read/hear stories that shocked and horrified me, portraying men getting absolutely demolished and ruined by women? Absolutely. 

It is my belief that most of us here and a lot of the feminist crew also just want equality and the world to be a better place for everyone. It is important for us to realize that both camp is heavily biased and that makes sense but these issues will never be solved if we just keep pointing fingers and demonizing the other.

I think Laura's book was made in good intentions but it failed short in actually understanding these issues. Good on her for trying though, if she's willing to make a sequel and get a more nuanced perspective I think there's real potential here. She needs to speak to quality figures in the manosphere to actually be able to portray a realistic and unbiased view of our current gendered issues. 

An example is she was very surprised that a lot of the men in these incel communities were university educated. She pictured the ""angry misogynists online"" to be more like the uneducated tinfoil crowd where as I would argue that as a man university is where you do start to get redpilled to the world. That's where you start to find out your position in life and how being a good boy won't give you the financial resources that you see other people having nor the respect and attraction from your female peers.

She, and a lot of women, have the impression that men's biggest issue is this hatred of women, and if they just started to be nice and respecting women they would all the sudden get the relationship they're looking for. I don't even blame them for that view, how could you possibly understand what life is like as a man? 

This is why I really like for example Alexander Grace's video on Youtube where he has a 19 year old girl make a fake tinder as a guy and see what that's like and she literally reports feeling anxious and depressed afterward. There's also the BuzzFeed video where a female reported tries out pickup and gives up at the start and hires girls to approach men for her video because she realizes it's too hard and scary to approach random strangers. 

Curious if any of you have read/heard about the book and what you guys think about the idea that the Men's Rights and feminist community should collaborate and have a more open discourse if we each want to get to solutions.",10.0

486,t3_rg51j3,"TwoX are citing a new study showing that outcomes of male surgeons are better for men while female surgeons reach same level outcomes with both sexes - an entire biased discussion ensues stemming from what seems as a bias of the researchers themselves. Before the media feasts on it, here's why.","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cg10vmgbkh581.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da06702d6fd61371721283f4c3fb8eebd7d2a74f

A premise for this discussion is the fact that about 23% of surgeons are women and the rest are men. I resent the subtext of this post as if men don't care enough about women - men care mostly about women. This outcome could be evidence of communication gaps between the sexes - the researchers could have compared to ""same culture/different culture"" and it would be interesting to see if the same pattern is observed, pointing to subtle communication as an explanation. As for why the female doctors seem to understand both sexes just as well, this could by either a selection bias (25% of surgeons are female, it might be the case that an equivalent 25% among male surgeons are also just as sensitive, but the other 50% are less so and still recruited to fill the ranks, lowering the male average, while among females the better ones are selected and when female numbers will be increased so will the entrance of less excelling individuals), or this could be a result of better average communication capabilities of females (but when we acknowledge that women are on average better at something, we also accept that men can on average be better at something else - this stick has two ends).

**The researchers could check the selection bias explanation, by simply aggregating male doctors by performance to see if there's indeed an equivalent 25% group among men** (or more) with the same results as females - **this is some 3 clicks in an excel spreadsheet or SPSS** \- and, they could even assess whether indeed such two groups are in fact the excelling groups by other measures (from graduate scores to internal assessments to patient scores, etc.). **The fact that none of these were even applied (selection bias control which is extremely simple to run - all it takes is not having the assumption ""men are bad"", and cultural control) spells a bias of the investigators themselves.**

I am rather familiar with the medical world and how doctors are selected, trained and appointed, and I can attest to several things: 1. competency is the the factor that has the greatest weight, 2. There are less candidates reaching the targeted cut-offs than positions to fill and therefore always and throughout the medical career stages, first the best and most suitable are selected and then next-level tiers are brought in, 3. There are less women than men who want to continue after graduation as well as women who wish to pursue the more stressful professions (a surgeon may be summoned from home at any hour even when reaching a high rank). I don't have the numbers in front of me but about 35% of female MDs retire after graduation. Hence one explanation to the results that must be examined and wasn't, is that females who become surgeons are the 1st tier selections, more females are not readily available due to many leaving the profession after graduation, hence when ranks are filled after an equivalent 1st tier male group was added, most additional appointments are from 2nd and onward tiers of males - hence the outcomes. If so, the recruitment of more females would simply reach the female 2nd tier, in which case we would observe the same communication gap as the study found in some males - and the outcomes would be balanced (females will also have an average 15% better outcomes for own sex, because performances of 1st tier with excellent communication skills will be averaged with 2-3rd tiers with more average such skills that allows them to understand own sex but less so for other sex). Or, if the explanation is that women are simply better at communication skills - the conclusion needs to be that those 35% need to be discussed - how to make them not quit. Or if they just made their choice and don't want to get involved, communication training for male doctors might be brought up for discussion.

Editing will be poor, since I'm using a mobile phone.

Things started out as a simple game on a discord server.

I was given a dare to tell a person in my dm list that i got a girl pregnant.
First thing I'm greeted with is
 ""congrats??.. Or fuck you if you raped her""
I was perplexed, a friend i made on internet and with whom I shared some interests had such a low opinion of me.

I go ahead and ask why is it that she'd even consider that I'd rape someone. I'm met with a reply explaining how it is dangerous for girls to trust men in current society and how a lot of girls share a similar mentality. To which i simply point out that it is detrimental to assume men are untrustworthy and would rape women whenever possible. It is plain misandry.

I raise a another issue with that mindset, about how much of a negative effect it has on the good men. Personally i wouldn't rape, I'd even go to the extent of preventing it from happening to someone else over the safety of my own body. If its for family or a close friend, I wouldn't even question my actions before jumping between the preparator and victim.

I'm met with a reply saying ""thats nice but-"", simply brushing away the worth of a mans sacrifice in that hypothetical situation. For an analogy i put in the thought of considering all black men to be criminals (which is racist according to all sane people) in an attempt to help her notice how her views were misandrist (which was ignored).

Being emphatic i agree its better to be cautious, but being vocal with such harsh opinions isn't the right thing to do. Theres a line to be drawn between caution and misandry. 

For trying to point out sexism and its ill-effects on men, i was called out for being ""too defensive"" and ""looks like fragile masculinity is working here"" 

At this point i knew there was no convincing her, and simply cut off contact since I'd never really enjoy their company again, after this incident.


So my question here is, is it normal to be this cautious and hateful towards men under the pretext of ""looking after myself""
Are there stats proving that (say) ""1% of men are rapists"" I'd understand that caution if the numbers were that big.

Is it acceptable to brush off the efforts of fathers, brothers and male friends who would or tried to prevent such incidents from happening. It is obvious that there are more men who would protect women vs those who would rape women.",33.0

Then the male ex will receive death threats by the woman's friends and family, and within his society, he'll be seen as an abuser/rapist etc. If he's innocent, that is more than enough to unjustly ruin his life, even though no legal action is taken, yet if someone defends him, they're automatically misogynists and rape apologists?

Im not too involved in the topic however it is something i'm very passionate about and can talk about it for hours if it gets brought up. 

Anyway we were chatting about the topic for an hour or so and i was debating my side of the argument (fighting for equality, and that there are many struggles men go through that are not reported in the media) however, almost any argument i brought up to do with mens suffering was immediately shut down by the two woman with the line ""its men doing \*said thing\* to other men"".

From my own experiences and knowing several homosexual people in college, I know that many older homosexual men tend to ""get off"" on ""converting"" younger questioning men. It's not being talked about often and I wanted to put it out there. I want everyone to know that it's ok to explore your sexuality, but it's not ok to be manipulated into doing things you probably wouldn't do. 

A majority of my homosexual friends have told me stories of when they were first coming to terms with their sexuality. Most were led on by older men with manipulative tactics they took for kindness and acceptance, and it usually turned into explicit texting and eventual sexual encounters. Some were even underaged.

In my own personal experience when I was questioning, I spoke about it to an older openly homosexual person I had just met. IDK why it came out that I was questioning, I just wanted to shoot the shit with someone while I was smoking a cigar. As soon as I mentioned I was questioning, the conversation became increasingly uncomfortable to the point he was offering to ""help me find out my sexuality."" I declined and headed back to my apartment. He followed me inside because he was staying at the same place. When I reached my apartment, he wanted a hug goodbye, and I let him because I thought that would get him off my case. When we did, he grabbed my butt hard and I just ran inside. He then sent me many graphic pictures, which I told him I deleted and asked him to never speak to me again. The whole encounter made me very uncomfortable and prevented me from exploring that side of me at all.",30.0

I’m a musician and basically my ex girlfriend (diagnosed with BPD) had a psychological break and started confusing me with her rapist from a few years back before I even knew her and  started telling all of these stories that weren’t exaggerations but whole heartedly completely untrue… just things that weren’t even a conflicting POV, they were things that just straight up didn’t happen. Complete fabricated lies. I have legal documents and court transcripts to back up what I’m saying and I even filed a motion for a false police report against her. It’s really hard to deal with because I do support women’s rights and the general idea behind feminism and that more women need to speak up but unfortunately some people just lie.. I don’t really know what else to do about this, I’ve already lost my childhood best friends because they’re involved in the same music scene and don’t want their reputation tarnished by being friends with a “rapist” even though they genuinely don’t believe I did any of those things. I never thought I’d be posting in a men’s rights subreddit but I literally have no clue what else to do. Ideally I’d like to get my story out and to speak on how damaging false allegations can be, because there’s really no legal recourse for me to take unless I want to spend tens of thousands of dollars trying to sue her for defamation but even then it probably would be useless. These claims have straight up ruined my life, I was suicidal, I’m afraid to go in public, I’ve gotten death threats all over something that legitimately is just a flat out lie.

1. If some altercation between a male and a female occur in public space, there will a male crowd who will come to support the female without knowing the matter and presume the male to be guilty and in worse case beat him up too.

2. Most of the Police are males. Even they may face anti-male laws but they wont empathise towards men. On the other hand they never let go of an oppurtunity to hit and show their dominance.

3. Most of the politicians are male till now. But they have passed anti male laws all over the world for votebank politics. In India, men are legally guilty till proven innocent and proof of burden in many cases lie on them. Worst part is many men around the world dont acknowledge that there are anti men laws and preach that if you are normal then there is no need to worry about laws.

4. Many men, some may be among us too, have ridiculed fellow males for their body. Short height, small dick, bald, weak/fat are common words used by many men to ridicule fellow men mostly to get attention from women. 

5. Male sexuality is demonised by men mostly. Women encourage other women to explore their sexuality by giving advices/ promoting toys and masturbation. Male masturbation is looked down upon and male sex toys owners are ridiculed by men as failure/losers.

6. Circumcision is another topic which has divided men greatly. Patriotism is mostly fed by men to other men as they are supposed to die in wars around the world.

So many men allowed the women and children to go first knowing that they were going to die a horrible terrifying death, in the dark and freezing cold water. And they did it anyway, without complaint. They gave up ever seeing their kids and grandkids grow up, ever seeing another birthday, or another holiday surrounded by people they loved. This is just one of billions of examples.

I've been groped by girls at school and sexually harrased by female teachers and bosses.  A woman lied about me being ""mean"" when I was actually trying to help her, and it got me fired.  My attorney said, ""no one is going to care"".  A company I worked for sent out an article that said, ""women are better at [my job] than men"".  I complained to my boss who literally said, ""no one is going to care"".
Unlike women I spent 17 years of my life under threat of a draft.

We are victims.

I've witnessed women at work cry and sob openly about their job being tough.  If I did this, I'd be a social pariah.

We are strong.

My wife works 50 hours a week plus 20 on her other extracurricular activities, and I work 50.  When she's busy with all of those things or too tired to do anything I clean, cook, fix toilets and do childcare.  Some men look down on me for this. 
Then people tell me, ""wherever there is a successful women, there is a man behind her"".  What the hell does that mean?  They say I have a sugar momma (not realizing I make more than her).

We are judged more harshly.  

Equality?  Well you seem to want the equal privileges and not equal burdens.  You're not tasked with laying your life down for your spouse and children.   You're not planning for disasters, threats, and intruders daily like many men do (as I do).  No, you blissfully enjoy rain showers as the men prepare for floods.  It is our pleasure, and we wouldn’t have it reversed.  

We are the protectors.

Do whatever you want, but stop denying men's pains and hurts and acting like men and women will ever be equal.   All land on Earth has been conquered almost exclusively on the backs and bloodshed of men, and don't pretend woman had nothing to do with it being all men and starting wars and violence!  

We are the warriors. 

So, my wife can continue put work over me, and women can abuse and cry.  Things are unfair for men, and that's just fine because we are men.  We don’t require fairness because, we can pound the World into dust but choose not to because we are men and not beasts.  Who says we cannot simply kill our enemies?  We're not afraid to die.  We are warriors and are not afraid to kill.  However, we do not do so because of our strength of will, because we seek the glory of self sacrifice and not bloodshed.   We seek to create goodness for our wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers.  However, we won't be silent while the World mistreats us and refuses to follow our designs meant for peace and goodness. 

We are the peace keepers. 

We are glorified through our suffering, and do not need women or comfort.  We are men because we choose to be.  We are stronger and better than all the rest, but let the World carry on with contempt as we drive the plow.  

We are the providers.

For it is our pleasure to die for our families and communities.  We hope to have a good death and drink undeserved suffering for the sake of others like a fine wine.  We hope to die for our wives and children.   The more gruesome the more glorious.

535,t3_regkrb,Comments on male bullying,"I am a 25 year old male. I don't want to give my bullying story right now. Some comments from someone who has been through it.

Men who are bullied are treated much worse than women. Lot's of people can say this from observation and experience.

When the victim is a women, bullies know that the victim will eventually get the help she needs because society gives a certain amount of unconditional love, trust and support to women, so bullies have to temper themselves or if they push too far (suicide) there will be backlash. Just look at the number of false rape cases filed - and nobody dares to say that we need to disbelieve women until they 99% prove themselves. (unlike men)

However, if the victim a man, then the worse the bullying is, the less backlash the perpetrator has. This can be explained as follows. The more a man is bullied, the more their development gets set back and less respect they have. (e.g. virginity) The less respect they have, the less likely anyone will believe them and even if they do, the perpetrators will get less punishment because a) Less people believe or care about the victim and b) People will believe it is fair because it happened to a bad person. (bad person being - a person with little social status) One example of this - How many people who bully people into becoming mass murderers actually get punished for what they've done? Now imagine if they had only bullied 3 girls into public suicide. There is no accountability for men.

Whenever a weaker man is treated less well than others for doing the same thing, we are sending a message to everyone that you can get away with ANYTHING you want as long as you bully enough, so they become low status. Then we wonder why some men are so cruel...

A man is expected to either stand up himself (not always possible) or speak out for himself and prove he is being bullied while having little respect or social status. Anyone can see it and turn away or not even bother to look. This is especially true in the church. (Fuck evangelicals) But a women will almost always get an investigation independent of her status. And people will reach out to her - maybe even have a boyfriend. This gets worse if it's combined with other factors such as racial prejudice, mental illness, poverty and/or child abuse. And these accumulate. So men are expected to pay all these things while getting more and more shit from society for it being their fault.

Don't get me wrong - it not the fault of low status women that it's like this. It's a sociological problem. But it's still very bad nonetheless. The culture of New Zealand is particularly hard on low status men compared to the rest of the world - male suicide rates are very high here.

I hope this has been of help to someone. If you're being bullied, don't be afraid to be a bit controversial (it's reddit). Especially if you are young and in school, the consequences are not that bad.",22.0

First time visitor in here but I just had to rant somewhere, this thing is really getting on my nerves 

I (18F) was sitting in the living room when my parents started watching some comedy film on the TV about single mothers and there was this scene where they talked about being scared of a guy turning out to be uncircumsised, how it's gross and they don't know what to do with that. Then the more experienced friend tried to explain how it looks and how to pull back the foreskin on her friend with a hoodie. And then the friend says that she's never gonna wear the hoodie again.

I know that its a stupid comedy but I came across ignorant comments about uncircumsised man so many times that it was the last straw for me.
Why is it okay to treat a natural part of mans body like this disgusting useless thing that should be cut off or else you're different or even considered 'gross'.

Its even more bizzare to me because I live in Europe, I don't know anyone who's circumsised, I'm not sure if its even allowed in our hospitals.
My boyfriend is uncut and I don't want to hear anymore comments about how uncut guys have to be smelly, or that it ''looks ugly"" 
Like.. what? You just have to pull it down and it looks almost exactly the same..

I feel so bad for any guy who had bad experience with women who thought that their part of male anatomy is ugly. I don't understand it at all, your dick is fine the way it is. It works that's what matters

The same women would get pissed if you said her vagina was gross because her labia is too long

541,t3_re0rq6,I'm thankful to this subreddit that I am not alone when it comes to feminism.,"I am a young man living in the Philippines. I am so sick and tired of Filipinas saying that feminism is equality when in fact, all they share in Facebook are feminist posts that stereotype men as rapists or perverts. I also hate them for taking things personally, such as jokes regarding anime girls. Honestly, at some point in time, I started to think if I am really a rapist or a sexist for being offended at what they are doing. I tried to avoid looking at women because of all the labelling these feminists have done. I also felt shy to talk to my peers about these feminists because they might say that I am sexist, considering that feminism is gradually brainwashing the society I live in.

But when I visited this subreddit, I started to think that I am not alone. I am no longer the only one who feels irritated by feminists in general. This subreddit has opened my eyes about the hypocrisy of feminists. Because of you guys, I am no longer ashamed of being a man. You guys gave me the reasons to fight against misandry. I am no longer afraid to speak up my mind about the wrong things that the feminists are doing against men. Thank you so much. Wish y'all a good day.",189.0

544,t3_rdvo61,Opinion on feminism?,"So I personally think women were disadvantaged heavily in previous years and feminism has helped bring equality for women in many aspects. However, now I can’t help but feel like it has lost its meaning. The media makes women seem they are at a disadvantage all the time even though they aren’t. A lot of women blame the patriarchy for their lack of opportunities and whatnot but I think these are just excuses. My dad moved to the United States from his country and he barely knew any English. He used to live in one of the most poorest villages in his country. He is now a software engineer making over 300k a year. I’m not saying this to brag or anything but if my dad can come here to the US from basically nothing and build a successful career, then why can’t a woman born here do the same. What opportunities do her male peers have that she doesn’t. And also, my dad never once used his race as an excuse for anything. Like yeah there are racists out there, but if you work hard then you will be successful. He never victimized himself. I don’t know if this is just American women, but feminism has now made women think that they’re disadvantaged because they aren’t handed everything. There are definitely some men out there who are very sexist towards women, but I don’t think all that affects women as much as a lot of feminists claim it does. When do you guys think we will get out of this “all women are disadvantaged” phase?",2.0

552,t3_rdly6r,The Existential Dilemma of Being Male,"There is no shame in being as we were created: having XY chromosomes, testosterone fueled sex drive, a logical object driven mind and a body designed to protect members of the tribe, provide resources and assist in the procreation of life. However we are also an evolved species with the ability to moderate our primitive impulses to improve outcomes, awareness of the impact of our actions on others and compassion.

It is difficult to understand why women are not designed to be complementary to the drives of men, or vice versa, but we would have to take that up with the creator: however it is not difficult to understand that women are biologically vulnerable to procreation and being burdened with constant child raising and its associated risk to life as a consequence of the male sex drive and might thus not be appreciative of the extra biological male interest in sex. Yet although man has largely now freed women from the dangerous procreational consequences of sex, if they choose to avail themselves of those methods, women are no more complementary with the male sex drive than before. In fact, now women can choose to engage in sex only when they wish to do so: whilst being an enormous improvement for women, it has come at the expense of men's biological sex drive expression now being held hostage to what women want. In a sense, the situations of men and women have been reversed rather than an improvement for both.

The dilemma of being male is that we have been designed to be this way, however it is now perceived to be detrimental to the interests of women (except when it isn't) and under attack. Whilst women's interests are important, so too are men's, equally if we believe feminists.

I personally can't see any reasonable way to resolve men being held hostage to women's choices, except to remove the power women have over men, through controlling access to sex, by going their own way. It seems pointless battling against women, as they should have a right to choose for themselves but it is distressing from an equality perspective that women do not seem to hold the same view when it comes to men and their choice over sexual expression and are not championing improvements for them too: it seems very much ""heads I win, tails you lose"" against men by women and a revenge fantasy being played out against millennia of perceived oppression of women, by men, when it is simply the reality of biology.

Once again, it is up to men to improve the lot of men this time and I believe it can only be accomplished by men going their own way (we shouldn't try to forcibly change women's minds or impose on their bodies). This is not an easy thing to do as tradition has limited mens' choices in pursuing recreational sex, often deliberately opposing it as with the 18th and 19th century's diabolical devices to prevent masturbation and, I believe, with the continuation of male circumcision, plus instilling shame and homophobic fear.

I implore men to begin to consider how their sexual expression has been historically limited and to explore legal options for sexual fulfilment that have previously been dissuaded, belittled, shamed or otherwise funneled only towards relationships with women.

This is not a time to become depressed over someone elses choices, but to take our own power to choose for ourselves, back, and to take a different path that we men map out for ourselves and provide as options to other men, not get corralled into by women for their own purposes.

I believe some men in the past have suggested that when women call names or drag in spurious elements to arguments, that the women's argument has been lost. With the number of names men are being called (incel, rapist, little dick, etc) I think women must already be afraid they have lost their argument, so be not despondent yourselves men of planet earth, for the situation is not without hope.",2.0

562,t3_rddae3,"If an all-male draft is a conservative victory, how come nobody on the fake left is talking about it except to agree with them?","Democrats and feminists are right wingers the same as Republicans, the ""fake left"" as both parties serve the wealth and corporates interests.  As the right both sides are against sex equality.  So I tried to find some comments by feminists or Democratic party politicians about the failure to pass legislation to make the draft constitutional.

Firstly, there is no talk about it being unconstitutional anywhere.  The issue is entirely framed as Congress had been ""considering"" changing the law but you know, not like they were under the gun or anything.  It's framed as an option.

Secondly I couldn't find any Democratic politician mentioning it at all (but I haven't tried very hard yet) whereas I keep seeing articles about this or that Republican politician talking about it to endorse the sexist/unconstitutional position.

Thirdly I did find a handful of feminists talking about it but their comments appear to be overwhelmingly in favour of the sexist/unconstitutional position too.  Some examples:

https://truthout.org/articles/expanding-the-military-draft-is-not-feminism-abolishing-draft-registration-is/

That one exemplifies the usual way feminists/the fake left, frame their support for the Republican position.  They pretend that even talking about the draft or changing it to be non-sexist would be to endorse the idea of war.  Of course no feminist ever said that when they were campaigning for decades for the right of women to volunteer for the armed services in various positions, which is a much clearer endorsement of war (after all if war is bad then why do women need a ""right"" to do something immoral?).  So this excuse is bullshit and obviously so, but it's the standard way for feminists to endorse the sexist draft.  In reality forcing women to sign up for the draft would be a huge shot in the arm for the antiwar movement because, as we all know here, nobody gives a shit about men dying but if you suggest women might have to get their hands dirty oh my god that's terrible.  If you're against the draft or against war you should 100% support drafting women.  Hell make it only women that would be even better -- if all you wanted to do was make a draft impossible.

&gt; “Drafting women is not feminist - no program that forces women into involuntary labor or harm's way can be called feminist. Feminism is abolishing the US draft registration system for people of all genders. Expanding the injustice of involuntary conscription to women does not make it more fair - it simply imposes the injustice on more people."" —Rivera Sun, CODEPINK

https://www.afsc.org/newsroom/quaker-and-feminist-orgs-denounce-vote-drafting-women

&gt; No, I do not oppose Selective Service registration for women because of their delicacy. I oppose it because a sex class analysis would reveal that women already sacrifice more for their country than men do, and women should not be asked to bear even more. There should be parity between men and women in the work of protecting our country and giving it a future. Selective Service registration for women would undo that parity, placing an unjustly heavy burden on women, and making their load far heavier than that of men.

https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2021/8/3/22594821/im-a-feminist-a-mandatory-military-draft-would-be-terrible-for-our-women

&gt; Like Mastrine, Steigerwald supports equal access to the military for women, but opposes conscription. She does not believe, as some have argued, that the return of the draft would make the U.S. more cautious about engaging in conflicts.

594,t3_rclcaq,Don't let anyone use illogical reasoning to say that men are more violent than women. They are not.,"There is a post on a different sub asking why most school shooters are men. (The post isn't linked in order to prevent brigading; let's keep the discussion in house). There are hundreds of responses with thousands of upvotes describing how men are culturally more violent and how that leads to murder. Don't buy into those flawed arguments.

Consider this statement:

&gt;All people from Maryland are from the United States.

This is indisputably true. Now, watch what happens when we say it backwards:

&gt;People from the United States tend to be from Maryland.

Now the statement is bullshit. Even IF school shooters tend to be men, that does NOT mean that men as a whole are violent. Taking this a step further: 

&gt;Some people from the United States are from Maryland.

Sounds like the statement is fixed, right? But no, it's still flawed. From the statement above, we can't tell whether 1% or 40% of the US population is from Maryland. While technically true, it is so misleading that it should be considered a malicious lie when a statement like that is made. That is what is wrong with saying that men are more violent than women. 

According to DOJ statistics, there are 99,984 men per 100,000 that have never been convicted of violent crime. The popular opinion is that the 99,998 convicted women per 100,000 prove that women are significantly less violent. There are many factors that explain *why* fewer women have been convicted of violent crime. However, even if the statistics were valid, the trend means absolutely nothing. A tiny fraction of a percentage of individuals CANNOT apply to all of the individuals of a group.

African Americans are not more violent that Caucasians.

Being of a certain religion does not make you violent.

And men are not more violent than women.",55.0

The law would only be applicable in states where abortion is legal and it would not apply to instances where the cause was non consensual. The man would have to decided whether he want's anything do do with the child or not within a time frame and from there the woman would be able to decide if they want the abortion or not, if the woman decides to keep it knowing the father doesn't want it then all of the responsibilities fall onto her as it is her decision.

619,t3_rc0h9x,Lets talk gendered violence against men," So right now, whenever someone, especially a feminist, talks about gendered violence, they usually only mention violence against women. The common view is that whenever violence happens towards someone because of their gender, it only happens towards women. But the truth is, that not only is gendered violence against men something that happens, it is actually surprisingly common, and even more common than gendered violence against women.I will be giving a few examples of what I'm talking about. During war times, it is common for women and girls to be shephered off, and the males to be left to die or be killed. Sometimes even the baby boys are killed. There have been several 'androcides' throughout history. Androcide meaning genocide of males. **Examples**

# Military/Warfare

**The Anfal Campaign** "" The anti-Kurdish ""Anfal"" campaign, mounted between February and September 1988 by the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, was both genocidal and gendercidal in nature. ""Battle-age"" men were the primary targets of Anfal, according to Human Rights Watch/Middle East (hereafter, HRW/ME). The organization writes in its book *Iraq's Crime of Genocide*: ""Throughout Iraqi Kurdistan, although women and children vanished in certain clearly defined areas, adult males who were captured disappeared en masse. ... It is apparent that a principal purpose of Anfal was to exterminate all adult males of military service age captured in rural Iraqi Kurdistan"" (pp. 96, 170). Only a handful survived the execution squads."" One Barzani woman described the roundup of the menfolk: ""Before dawn, as people were getting dressed and ready to go to work, all the soldiers charged through the camp \[Qushtapa\]. They captured the men walking on the street and even took an old man who was mentally deranged and was usually left tied up. They took the preacher who went to the mosque to call for prayers. They were breaking down doors and entering the houses searching for our men. They looked inside the chicken coops, water tanks, refrigerators, everywhere, and took all the men over the age of thirteen. The women cried and clutched the Qur'an \[Koran\] and begged the soldiers not to take their men away."" In 1993, Saddam Hussein strongly hinted at the final fate of the Barzani men: ""They betrayed the country and they betrayed the covenant, and we meted out a stern punishment to them, and they went to hell."" As Human Rights Watch noted, ""In many respects, the 1983 Barzani operation foreshadowed the techniques that would be used on a much larger scale during the Anfal campaign."" (Human Rights Watch, *Iraq's Crime of Genocide*, pp. 4, 26-27.)   

&gt;*The male is born to be slaughtered.*       \- Kurdish proverb  
&gt;  
&gt;*Your men have gone to hell.*       \- Iraqi soldier to a survivor of the attack on Qaranaw village, Fourth Anfal, May 1988

After a few days of such treatment, *without a single known exception*, the men thus ""processed"" were trucked off to be killed in mass executions.

**The Srebrenica Massacre** In the Bosnian silver-mining town of Srebrenica in July 1995, one of the most notorious modern acts of gendercide took place. While the international community and U.N. peacekeepers looked on, Serb forces separated civilian men from women and killed thousands of men *en masse*, or hunted them down in the forests.  Serb General Ratko Mladic made it plain that he held a special grudge against the menfolk of Srebrenica, armed or unarmed. In scenes that gripped the attention of the world, hundreds of women and children were evacuated from Srebrenica before the Serb noose tightened and shut off all refugee flow.  Women and children gathered at the U.N. base of Potocari, together with about 1,700 men,while most of the ""battle-age"" males -- mostly unarmed non-combatants -- took to the hills in a desperate attempt to flee to Muslim-held territory to the west. At Potocari, Dutch troops meekly allowed the Serbs access to the camps and the refugees they held. Then, the following day -- July 11 -- some 1700 men, disproportionately the elderly and infirm, were separated from women and children. The peacekeepers ""stood inches away from the Serb soldiers who were separating the Muslim men, one by one, from their families"" (Sudetic, *Blood and Vengeance*, p. 306). At Serb command, the Dutch drew up a registry of 242 Bosnian men remaining in the camp, again mostly elderly and infirm. Then they handed the men over to the Serbs. *Not one of the 242 men is known to have survived.* **The children and women were bused, with isolated exceptions, to safety in Tuzla. Men, almost without exception, were carted away to their deaths.**

**1971 Genocide in Bangladesh**

The war against the Bengali population proceeded in classic gendercidal fashion. According to Anthony Mascarenhas, ""There is no doubt whatsoever about the targets of the genocide"":

&gt;They were: (1) The Bengali militarymen of the East Bengal Regiment, the East Pakistan Rifles, police and para-military Ansars and Mujahids. (2) The Hindus -- ""We are only killing the men; the women and children go free. We are soldiers not cowards to kill them ..."" I was to hear in Comilla \[site of a major military base\] \[Comments R.J. Rummel: ""One would think that murdering an unarmed man was a heroic act"" (*Death By Government*, p. 323)\] (3) The Awami Leaguers -- all office bearers and volunteers down to the lowest link in the chain of command. (4) The students -- college and university boys and some of the more militant girls. (5) Bengali intellectuals such as professors and teachers whenever damned by the army as ""militant."" (Anthony Mascarenhas, *The Rape of Bangla Desh* \[Delhi: Vikas Publications, 1972(?)\], pp. 116-17.)

Younger men and adolescent boys, of whatever social class, were equally targets. According to Rounaq Jahan, ""All through the liberation war, able-bodied young men were suspected of being actual or potential freedom fighters. Thousands were arrested, tortured, and killed. Eventually cities and towns became bereft of young males who either took refuge in India or joined the liberation war."" Especially ""during the first phase"" of the genocide, he writes, ""young able-bodied males were the victims of indiscriminate killings."" (""Genocide in Bangladesh,"" in Totten *et al.*, *Century of Genocide*, p. 298.) R.J. Rummel likewise writes that ""the Pakistan army \[sought\] out those especially likely to join the resistance -- young boys. Sweeps were conducted of young men who were never seen again. Bodies of youths would be found in fields, floating down rivers, or near army camps. As can be imagined, this terrorized all young men and their families within reach of the army. Most between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five began to flee from one village to another and toward India. Many of those reluctant to leave their homes were forced to flee by mothers and sisters concerned for their safety."" (*Death By Government*, p. 329.)

# Conclusion

Both men and women can be victims of violence, but men are the vast majority of assault and homicide victims in the world. Additionally, men are also targeted for their gender.",95.0
620,t3_rc02wu,People have to stop marginalizing and omitting men when they depict horrors and injustices,"This post originated as an inquiry, but as I was typing it, I realized how absurd it is and I solidified my stance. I'm bilingual and in my other language we have a common-used phrase that is translated to ""women and children"" or ""women and infants"". People use this phrase when they want to emphasize the severity of incidents and events. For instance, when people describe the horrors of the Holocaust, they say, ""The German soldiers witnessed the homicide of women and children, and did nothing"" or something similar. They say it, consciously or subconsciously in order to gain sympathy or emphasize immorality. But there were men there as well. People always say it, even in minor injustices in comparison to the Holocaust, ""they left women and children to starve to death"", ""they deprived women and children of (insert something random)"", ""they left women and children without electricity for the whole day"", ""women and children were made to run away from the sinking boat"", etc. In all of these examples, there were also men, but they've been omitted for no apparent reason.

It seems like people base the merit of injustices on the fact that there were women/children there. Morally it sounds worse when you mention these demographics, rather than saying that it occurred to people (in general) or men (""men, women and children"", which is slightly paraphrased). I stumbled upon an incident lately which ignited my disbelief in this alleged social convention. Suddenly it sounded so ludicrous. Given the context, it was crystal clear how messed up it is and also irrational. Someone talked about a horrific incident regarding the Holocaust, but she didn't acknowledge the fact that there were men there. She merely mentioned, ""They did it to women and children"". Obviously, men were in this disaster too, so why omit them? It may sound more reasonable in this inquiry, but in the exact same moment that I heard it, it was so obvious, ridiculous and prominent, that it suddenly heat me.

I know women and children are more vulnerable and can't fend for themselves (there are people who'll claim that those are archaic and outdated sentiments, but never mind), but those characteristics aren't relevant in this context. In hindsight when you describe events, it seems disrespectful to exclude men when you're talking about the victims of genocides or other minor and major injustices. The lives of people who were born in a certain gender or happened to be younger when this occurred aren't more valuable than anyone else's. When you mention an injustice, it needs to shock and convey the repulsion and fury about the abusers, regardless of the exact identity of the victims. If it was truly gruesome, the horror would have been implicit from your story either way. Don't men deserve empathy as well? It seems like society deems crimes and injustices that occurred to men as non-important, unsubstantial or to a much lesser extent.

Why does disclosing the gender/age of the victim increase the severity of the injustice? Why is it acceptable to exclude male victims when you talk about horrific crimes and nobody's dubious of that? Men are being steadfastly marginalized deprecatingly. People draw attention from victims, sometimes ones who've been fought valiantly, just to make their story sound worse. I think it should be impermissible and frowned upon.",8.0

I'd like to put forward the idea to establish a pro-MRA political party in the United States to promote dialogue and action towards issues affecting men and boys.

[These are the federal requirements to start a party recognized by the FEC](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/registering-political-party/), I don't believe them to be too difficult.


It's easy to imagine lots of mainstream media coverage were such a party to be established under the FEC. Such a party would generate attention towards public policies that are discriminatory to men and boys, and draw national attention to them. We could educate the populace on the data of male disparities that are largely obscure. We could comb through major bills/provisions and highlight any anti-male or discriminatory provision or passage. Things like that are often snuck into those 1,200 page bills that no one actually sits down and reads.

We could also hold public events and release publications on all the common male issues. I imagine major networks would cover such events and publications.

Ideally, we can raise viable candidates who could run for major public office- anything from city council to state representative to Congress.

This is obviously an idea in it's incunabula, so I think it's very interesting to think about. Ideas for names:

This shows that we are right about the gender issues and reason of the gender roles.,"I'm aware that Wikipedia is feminist-biased and that it's not good source to show any issue deeply but for short review I can in the beginning return you to the article in this site about [gender equality implementation attempts in Jewish Kibbutz.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz#Gender_equality)

I noticed some things that are worthy to highlight. Some women from them said that even there there wasn't the equality of sexes. Even if firstly women had do the same tasks that men do, they preferred this kind of them that is traditionally associated with women gender role. So even without cultural influence (they attempted to cut of themselves from it), women want more to do things like cooking, sewing, and cleaning than performing guard duty and heavy labor. Emancipated women, without pressure to do traditional maternal and domestic duties, later demanded themselves to do it, instead of leaving these things to communes (that were there responsible for providing meal and raising children before). So it's clear that narration about ""patriarchal oppression"" is completely false. Women also embraced traditional marriage and whole society had conservative, puritanical attitude to sexuality (in the times when in the west there were the opposite trends; visitors from outside of this communities noticed it).

So the most important points are:

1. Women from Kibbutz rejected egalitarianism and burdens that traditional masculine gender role is associated with. They preferred domestic duties such as cooking, cleaning and taking care of children than participation in the industrial, agricultural and economic sectors alongside men (especially when we talk about working in farming or in the factory).
2. This shows us that feminist narration about women's dependency is totally false, it's just gaslighting of men. There is no ""patriarchy"" construct that enforce women to do some things. These women just realized that male's burdens are heavier and their gender role is more comfortable for them.
3. Finally, nearly 80% of women worked in the service sector. It's additional evidence for my stance from previous point. Women are interested in being tradcon housewives or in convenient and prestigious job in the service sector. ""Split"" between feminists and tradcon women runs mainly through this thing.
4. Even if masculinization of women was possible, there never were parallel process of feminization of men. This shows that women, not men, have a power and influence to enforce gender roles. The gender roles are only obligatory for men who were still under pressure to fulfill them and they weren't allowed to female spheres, female' gender role.
5. Such egalitarian societies shows more clearly how informal forms of power and influence matters. Without strong significance of formal ruling positions or money, influence of things like gossip network was hard to hide and strong.

I hope this post finds well.

Over the last few years I have gone through and experience which I believe is common to many of us growing up. We read more books, listen to videos and people, and invest more in ourselves at a personal and professional level. Thankfully, nowadays, useful information is being shared with men in order for them to improve their lives, specially in a context where the mainstream media and many other institutions seem to want people to be held back.

There are many things we listen to and unconsciously begin to apply to our lives. I think we should make a list, to help us and other fellow men, that we can revisit from time to time to help guide us through life. I will some sentences which I believe correspond to useful advice, and I would be glad if you could chime in! So, here we go:

1. Seek to understand more about psychology and female psychology. I think it will help with your interactions at school, at work and dealing with people on daily basis;
2. Don't take things so personally. This is related to the first topic. People have their believes and attitudes, and it's not up to you to change them. You can only change yourself;
3. Make yourself a priority. This does not mean that you have to be selfish, but don't do things you don't want to do to please people;
4. You cannot win somebody else's heart by doing things for them, ""buying love"". They either like you, or not, and it's not something under your control;
5. Listen to people, and think first, before giving them an answer, if at all. Nowadays people don't tolerate different opinions very much, and it's important that you do not fall into the trap of fighting back. You listen, you process, you reply. If they respect, fine, if not, walk away. Don't waste time with bulshit.
6. Read books. Gain by reading what others have laboured hard for;
7. Dress well, and take care of your appearance;
8. Seek to have some interesting hobbies. It is also an opportunity to meet more people;
9. Save money and learn to invest;
10. Develop several skills. Learn how to fix things. It will make you a resourceful person and will save you some monery;
11. It's not possible to have too many friends. Time is limited, and if you're investing in yourself, there's only so much you can give away, so you better make sure you're investing your time with people who want the best for you, who care for you and help you move forward;
12. Workout. Do serious exercise routines, with fully body exercises and heavy weight. Train the mind to do things that are hard;
13. Be humble, for somedays you're are the top, and next day you're at the bottom;
14. The only permanent thing in this life is change. Pray for wisdom to accept what you cannot change, courage to change what you can.

This is it on my part!

Looking forward for more advice. I hope this can prove useful to our fellow reddit men!",4.0

But those times are long gone thankfully. Instead it is men who also need help to get ahead. Feminism has had a very positive impact on society, but it is time to acknowledge a very clear reality: most men are not in positions of power. You hear from journalists in the media obsessing over the fact that most if not all Fortune 500 companies are run by men. That’s fair, however it should also be pointed out that these people are in the 1%. And, once again, most men are not in the 1%. If we are going to talk about the top 1%, we need to also talk about the homeless population. 

Sure, our politicians and media will address the need for affordable housing. However, it is rarely acknowledged that homeless men outnumber homeless women. The homeless divide between men and women isn’t as stark, but it still shows that more men are homeless. I bring this up because homelessness isn’t often discussed in the media without the obligatory mention of “1 in 3 homeless are women.” This has always fascinated me. It isn’t necessary or wise to say the majority of homeless people are men and just ignore the homeless women.

But none of the media reporting a ""conservative victory"" (whether approvingly or not) bothers to talk about the theoretical problem with such a ""victory"", namely that the underlying law remains unconstitutional on it's face and that the Supreme Court in rejecting a review of the case still indicated they agree that the facts have changed and the twisted logic they used last time in the 80s (was it?) to pretend SS isn't sexist won't pass the laugh test this time.

So in theory this ""victory"" of conservatism would lead to the entire draft system being shut down by the Supreme Court or a lower court, as unconstitutional, whenever they figure out Congress lied to them when it said they'd fix the law so it was no longer sexist.

Are we all going to pretend the end to the draft would also be a conservative victory?

Alternatively I suppose the SS people could be simply directed by the courts to start drafting women and men on the same basis in which case it's the same result as if this ""victory"" never took place at all.

I say it's a theoretical problem because in reality they (courts, Congress, Republicans and Democrats) are all on the same page here.  So this little delaying tactic will not be slammed down by the courts angry at being fooled by the lies of Congress, but rather the entire case will be forgotten about.  See you all in another 30 years!  Or whenever some men's group next has the money to bring a law suit (you can bet the ACLU won't be supporting the next one - they've changed a lot in the last few years).

I don't see anything about this latest news (which of course isn't ""official"" in any sense though it's obvious Congress lied to the Supreme Court essentially) from the NCFM and I don't know if there's anything more that can be done with the original case or if they'd have to start the entire process from scratch.

Many of you may know [Jessica Taylor at VictimFocus, best-seller author, self-proclaimed radical feminist and chartered psychologist](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206011929/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor). You may not recognize the name just yet, but stay with me.

Note: For those who still don't understand why her self-proclaimed feminist affiliation is even mentioned. It is simply because her claims are in conflict with her actions. If you are afraid that highly influencial people like her will be framed as representatives of feminism, maybe you should join me in calling them out. The reason I write about her is not her feminist affiliation but her misandristic statements and questionable research practices.

She knows that - by law - women can't rape men. Of course she uses that knowledge to ~~call out the inherent misandry~~ spread the belief that the only ones ever responsible for a rape are men and that it is inappropriate to phrase statements as if female rapists could exist. Here are the quotes:

&gt;[(Jun 25, 2021) Rape is committed by a male with a penis as per the law](https://web.archive.org/web/20210627104615/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1409100671287283714)

&gt;[(Aug 4, 2021) Only males can commit the act of rape by law.

She's not technically wrong, but the way she uses that knowledge is disturbing and dishonest. It **is** essential to point out the problem of misandry within laws. What is not essential, is to use it to justify *this*:

&gt;[(Aug 4, 2021) To be CRYSTAL CLEAR: The only person responsible for rape is the man who committed it. No one else, ever.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206171506/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1422846820254892034)

[Not only is it not inclusive regardless of the made-to-penetrate question, it would also need someone to have gone out of their way to deliberately make it ambiguous for the very population that needs it the most to be clear, thereby continuously silencing them whilst telling the public that they are totally included though. It does not matter if it is ""technically included"". If you need a confirmation mail from the FBI to settle debates on it, then the definition is flawed and claiming feminists to have fought for it does not make them look less misandristic. A definition that is unable to produce statistics that can be assumed to adhere to a common understanding of that definition makes not just the definition but also the data published under it completely useless. There is no way to interpret it. This useless change is used to silence real change for male victims as people accepted this ""definition"" as inclusive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/lrm69c/made_to_penetrate_excludes_male_victims_of_rape/)

Now, at first I planned to address more of her at times blatantly misandristic statements, but it just resulted in a tweet compilation. She has some pretty ""interesting"" ideas, though rarely any idea about what her opponents' arguments are (straw men...) whilst providing no evidence for most of her claims. You remember this weird list of very specific items that was meant to prove that misandry does not exist?

They are registered though, so whatever.
I am sure the men there would love her tweets. Or not, who knows. Anyway, I don't care if she talks about men's issues - unlike those whom she's trying to address in that post. In fact, given her questionable and at times harmful takes, I'd rather have her not talk about it than spread misleading statements.

So why make a post about her? Unfortunately, some use women's issues to silence men and attach their PhD to it.

She is one of the many people who push the ideas that reddit's feminists then need to walk back on:

This is the type of conspirational worldview that less influencial figures then claim to be nothing but an outlier seen in ""feminist debunked"" youtube videos.


She subscribes to the idea that [public shaming of criminals is totally the way forward](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205191454/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1428628992744099840) and that male victimization would not be connected to male violence:

As victims, they outnumber men, but men make up 97-99% of all violent offenders.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206172223/https://mobile.twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1463799808481767429)

First of all, a high proportion of criminals have been victims, but very few victims will become criminals - this has been known forever. If you look at the differences in perpetrators of violence among victims and the general population, the proportions will be small in both. If you look at the [differences in victims among perpetrators and the general population](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1079063214535819), you will find huge differences. Similarly, looking at the [differences in sexual victimization between sexual offenders and non-sexual offenders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213409000374) (but still offenders), you will again find substantial differences in victimization with sexual victimization being multiple times higher among sexual offenders. Does correlation imply causation? Absolutely not. Is investigating such substantial effects a conspiracy to justify male violence against women? No, it is not. She also ignores how violence aginst men and women differs (especially looking at more severe outcomes like injuries and hospitalizations (and that is despite men being misandristically pressured to hide/downplay injuries and be reluctant to attribute them to violence) - see violent injury data for [men](https://wisqars.cdc.gov/data/non-fatal/explore/selected-years?nf=eyJpbnRlbnRzIjpbIjgiXSwibWVjaHMiOlsiMzAwMCJdLCJ0cmFmZmljIjpbIjAiXSwiZGlzcCI6WyIxIiwiMiIsIjQiLCI1Il0sInNleCI6WyIxIl0sImFnZUdyb3Vwc01pbiI6WyIwMC0wNCJdLCJhZ2VHcm91cHNNYXgiOlsiMTk5Il0sImN1c3RvbUFnZXNNaW4iOlsiMCJdLCJjdXN0b21BZ2VzTWF4IjpbIjE5OSJdLCJmcm9tWWVhciI6WyIyMDE5Il0sInRvWWVhciI6WyIyMDE5Il0sImFnZWJ1dHRuIjoiNVlyIiwiZ3JvdXBieTEiOiJBR0VHUCJ9) and [women](https://wisqars.cdc.gov/data/non-fatal/explore/selected-years?nf=eyJpbnRlbnRzIjpbIjgiXSwibWVjaHMiOlsiMzAwMCJdLCJ0cmFmZmljIjpbIjAiXSwiZGlzcCI6WyIxIiwiMiIsIjQiLCI1Il0sInNleCI6WyIyIl0sImFnZUdyb3Vwc01pbiI6WyIwMC0wNCJdLCJhZ2VHcm91cHNNYXgiOlsiMTk5Il0sImN1c3RvbUFnZXNNaW4iOlsiMCJdLCJjdXN0b21BZ2VzTWF4IjpbIjE5OSJdLCJmcm9tWWVhciI6WyIyMDE5Il0sInRvWWVhciI6WyIyMDE5Il0sImFnZWJ1dHRuIjoiNVlyIiwiZ3JvdXBieTEiOiJBR0VHUCJ9)) and how societal misandry influences the effects of and reactions toward violence against men (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/pbh579/additional_evidence_on_the_systemic_denial_of/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/omzl78/multiple_popular_magazines_might_have_contributed/), for example). To believe that someone's path into violence may be attributable to a single factor or that said factor would adhere to whatever definition of violence you used to make women the majority of victims is not what people are proposing either. Being stared at may be uncomfortable, yet lightyears away from being beaten into the hospital and even suggesting otherwise is insulting to all victims of severe violence, among which men are a substantial majority. Violence against men - and especially the normalization of violence against men is just one factor on men's path into criminal behaviour and your comment falls apart completely in that context, regardless of your ignorance to everything else I mentioned. ""Men bad"" is so brazenly unhelpful that it may be seen as insulting to the future victims who rely on researchers to go beyond that in order to uncover the clear patterns seen in the histories of criminals. ""*We must not let this narrative succeed or become accepted in practice, theory or legislation*"" is unscientific and disrespectful to anyone who trusts ""scientists"" to do better. Putting your personal comfort first whilst violence prevention comes second is not what society would want if you were transparent about it.

Unfortunately, you weren't transparent toward yourself (if you actually believe the things you write) and I would love you to change. I don't think you are just evil. It is not that simple. Still, you made a mistake and that should be acknowledged. Maybe one day you will reconsider your values and beliefs... until then, people should know about the way you conducted research as you continuously put people at risk who rely on research to address violence. And if this is the quality of evidence they want their safety to rest on, so be it. If ""men bad"" is the intellectual peak of how we should think about violence and criminality, so be it - but I don't. 

Let's go into the infamous ""99.7%"" [report](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205181037/https://irp.cdn-website.com/f9ec73a4/files/uploaded/Key-Facts-Document-VAWG-VictimFocus-2021a.pdf).

A) The intention.

&gt;[(May 2, 2021) I am actually so tired of answering this - the study isnt about generalising, none of my work is, we haven’t generalised any of the findings and this is an irrelevant criticism. All information, reports and graphics pertain only to the sample.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205235910/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1388878987708047360)

+

&gt;[(Apr 30, 2021) Just to be absolutely clear to all the sudden stats experts out there - we aren’t seeking to generalise or extrapolate to the UK population from our study so I know you’ve learned some cool new words but could you stop accusing the study of doing things it doesn’t do? Awesome.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205235106/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1388042860075814913)

The fact sheet says:

&gt;[Our aims were as much about gathering accurate data from women, as they were about what we could do with such a comprehensive dataset. **The first aim was to present a clear picture of how much violence women and girls in the UK are subjected to**, broken down into types of violence, how many times they had been subjected to it and who committed those acts of violence against them.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205181037/https://irp.cdn-website.com/f9ec73a4/files/uploaded/Key-Facts-Document-VAWG-VictimFocus-2021a.pdf)

+

&gt;[**Understanding the true scale of violence against women and girls in the UK.** We found that 99.7% of our sample had been repeatedly subjected to violence including assaults, harassment and rape. Only 0.3% of women had only been subjected to one violent incident or less.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205181037/https://irp.cdn-website.com/f9ec73a4/files/uploaded/Key-Facts-Document-VAWG-VictimFocus-2021a.pdf)

+

&gt;[**Our findings in this report suggest that current statistics of the prevalence of violence against women have been underestimated for decades, and instead, it is likely that every woman and girl will be subjected to violence, abuse, rape or harassment.**](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205181037/https://irp.cdn-website.com/f9ec73a4/files/uploaded/Key-Facts-Document-VAWG-VictimFocus-2021a.pdf)

+

&gt;[**It appears from this sample that violence and abuse against women and girls is a universal
experience**, with only 0.3% of the sample reporting that they had never been subjected to any violence, harassment, abuse or harm.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205181037/https://irp.cdn-website.com/f9ec73a4/files/uploaded/Key-Facts-Document-VAWG-VictimFocus-2021a.pdf)

But yeah, no generalizations were ever made... /s

Also have a look at [the statements, infographics and media section of this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206005101/https://www.victimfocus.org.uk/womens_experiences_violence_abuse_study).

Some headlines they shared on that page:

&gt;""99.7% of women experience repeated violence, harassment and abuse"" - SWLondoner - 06/05/21

&gt;""If a third of men were raped and 94% thought the justice system stacked against them, they'd call it a crisis"" - Mirror - 30/04/21

&gt;""Women subjected to at least 26 sexual crimes on average in their lifetime as study reveals scale of 'collective trauma'"" - ITV News - 30/04/21

&gt;""Half the population lives with fear of male violence — this can’t just remain part of life"" - Evening Standard - 29/04/21

&gt;""Violence ‘a universal issue’ for women, says study"" - Big Issue - 29/04/21

&gt;""Harrowing sex crimes faced by 99.7% of women with 82% harassed before they're 18"" - Mirror - 29/04/21

&gt;""Half of women 'have suffered sexual assault by a partner while asleep'"" - LBC - 29/04/21

&gt;""More than half of women 'have been sexually assaulted by a partner in their sleep'"" - Yahoo - 29/04/21



From my point of view, they make generalizations in their report, on their website, in their infographics and celebrate media articles making generalizations. But who am I to decide on that...

And why is this such an issue? Keep reading.

B) The invitation.

According to the authors, all studies have the same issues in that you can't get a random sample and have to gain consent (see the [FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206005101/https://www.victimfocus.org.uk/womens_experiences_violence_abuse_study)).

&gt;[(May 1, 2021) We clearly posted to say that the study was about violent experiences of women since birth because it is vital that women are not deceived before they take part, in case it harms them. The only criteria was being a woman over 18 in UK. No other criteria was set out.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206004451/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1388410277755080704)

Now compare that to the following twitter statement that was posted to recruit women for the study:

&gt;[(Nov 18, 2020) I am pleased to release this new study which seeks to collect experiences of UK adult women subjected to any form of violence and abuse since birth. We need the biggest sample possible.](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205181531/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1329160860661637120)

The same statement was found on [other material used](https://web.archive.org/web/20201119111836/https://victimfocus-resources.com/collections/frontpage/products/victimfocus-launches-a-new-study). 

This is not normal and the fact she still believes it is is a huge problem. This statement *clearly* searches for women who were subjected to violence. It was not merely transparent about the contents of a study - it literally asked for victims. The fact that she is now trying to make it about having to gain consent does not strengthen her case. [You can call it normal all you want](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206001036/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1388411991874805760), but you are misrepresenting the data.

C) The intent part two.

As the study was launched, the following statement was made:

&gt;[(Nov 18, 2020) Thank you. I have been thinking about this study for years. I need to collect enough data to put some total bullshit stereotypes to bed](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205181855/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1329186201094549509)

Which may be considered problematic.

But it was doubled down:

&gt;[(Nov 19, 2020) Thank you. Not that she cares, but I’ve been planning this study for years, I’m trying to disprove some of the biggest and most harmful myths and stereotypes in academia about women subjected to violence and abuse](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205183541/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1329361493729619968)

So let's recap.

* For years she though about a study meant to put stereotypes to bed and disprove harmful myths. Ok.
* She then asked for female victims to take part in her study.
* She then found a sample of victims (99.7%) and went on to describe her asking for victims as merely being transparent and the norm whilst the report states the assessment of the prevalence of violence against UK women as its first aim.
* Eventually, she repeatedly made what I would call generalizing statements about the UK population using her data before denying to do so.
* Articles making generalizing statements are celebrated on their website and sell the findings as representative of women across the UK to their readers.

Make up your own mind. Was she transparent about literally asking for victims? Is conducting research with the explicit intent to get specific results valid? Obviously one will have personal beliefs about what the evidence might look like and may be especially interested in projects where one suspects or even strongly believes to find results that are largely denied by the public. Still, does ""I need to collect enough data to put some total bullshit stereotypes to bed"" reflect openness to results that may not be in line with one's personal belifs? Do her statements and infographics constitute generalizations - and is that even relevant if she is not transparent about the recruitment material specifically asking for victims, just to then *not* exclude non-victims who still happened to end up on the study somehow? Is this worthy of a [BPS post](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206021612/https://twitter.com/BPSOfficial/status/1394922767661756417) that is not open about them asking for victims?

She doesn't seem to see any issues, and if all else fails, she can still claim misogyny - making it practically impossible to engage in any kind of constructive interaction with her:

&gt;[We have much to consider and analyse over the coming months but it’s been shocking to see people attempt to discredit a study based on widely used methods - suddenly those common methods are not acceptable - maybe that’s because they are women talking about abuse and violence?](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206001036/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1388411991874805760)

Dear Jessica Taylor, if your conduct around this paper as well as the misandry in your tweets are anything to go by, I don't think I need what you currently represent. I would need an ally, but that would need you to change substantially.

I don't need a centre where I can serve as your go-to [argument to justify](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206011858/https://www.twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/949279907405881344) mocking me and my experiences [on your podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20211205184358/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1390729208645758984) and [on your twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20211206171506/https://twitter.com/DrJessTaylor/status/1422846820254892034). I am not an argument to justify your misandry, and you are not an ally. [The way you describe our experiences](https://web.archive.org/web/20200701005449/https://victimfocusblog.com/2018/01/03/stop-asking-me-what-about-men/) clearly show that your work with men hasn't been used to educate yourself on their experiences rather than to verify your personal misconceptions about men's issues. Just like with your research, this is not valid - and neither are your conclusions. I know that when first confronted with restrictive and oppressive stereotypes, most men - especially vulnerable ones - won't be able to quickly grasp why it is misandry, and the suggestion of anything describing their experiences, even if it is dishonest and ultimately harmful, might be accepted. It seems intuitive that ""you hit like a girl"" could only be misogyny, though that has been addressed numerous times (a recent [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/r4tyf8/comment/hmj07p0/) - not a perfect fit, but good enough). I guess I'll need to make a post on it once I get to it. It seems intuitive - especially in the gender binary framework you claim not to subscribe to - that non-conformity to masculinity would equate conformity to femininity - and why would that be bad if it wasn't for our hatred of women, right? This has been mostly addressed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/r4tyf8/comment/hmj07p0/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/r2pj81/comment/hm9umaf/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/r2pj81/comment/hma3eg1/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qy2j10/comment/hlfrias). Suggesting patriarchy to someone who lacks any alternatives is not a valid way to explore their experiences. As long as it is the only thing they know - and even more so if you paint anyone who does not subscribe to your terminology and conspirational worldview (see above) as tradcons - of course they will proudly carry the one flag they were made to believe is the only one calling out what harmed them. It does not matter if any of it is accurate or consistent as long as they finally have *something* to blame - even if it is themselves, the patriarchy, men or the content of the norms rather than the associated misandry of male norms in general - a mistake that is part of why people come up with misandristic ideas like ""real men cry"" (or [this](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dads-learn-to-style-daughters-hair-at-new-york-city-salon-real-men-can-braid/)). Why would they care if their issues are implicitly belittled when compared to womem if it is the only way to have them addressed? And as part of misandristic norms is belittling their own issues, they won't be hard to convince that their issues don't deserve the severety we associate with ""misogyny"". If you believe that you can't call out ""traditionally masculine norms"" (or, more accurately, the associated misandry) whilst at the same time calling out the ways labels like patriarchy and toxic masculinity are used, of course you are going to believe the lies that are spread about men's advocates. They don't know better and are easy prey to feed your worldview. And once they internalized the ideas they thought to be necessary to describe their issues, many become reluctant to listen.

Anyway, if you want to change, I will support you. If you don't, then don't pretend to support me.

657,t3_rbai87,We really need to figure a way to combat censorship ASAP,"What good is pointing out the facts in daily bases if no one can hear/see you?

The Anti-male censorship is outrageous in recent years.

Remember back around 2013-2017 where pro-male content gets so much attention at least in the internet space? But then feminist figured us out and starting strategically shutting down pro-male content.

Try any search engine to search pro-male content, you'd be shocked how much it had changed.

Especially Youtube which used to be the platform that most pro-male content inhabits, now look at how it became. Not to mention Twitter, Google etc.

Anti-male forces became even stronger now than ever, even compare to pre-pro-male boom era we had 8 years ago.

We really need to figure out a way or our numbers diminishes rapidly, politic is never about truth, but a numbers game after all.

Came to think of it, its actually ridiculous, how could a movement that support half of the entire population gets such little attention? The potential for our movement is limitless, and feminists fully understand this, that's the reason they are so eager to kill us in our infant stage. Words such as Gynocentrism are Kryptonite to feminist ideology if it ever gets a wider reach.

This the most emergent issue we are facing right now above everything else

Edit: Some of the theory I could think of

1. Make more of our own platform in a decentralized fashion, to disperse their focus
2. Change our name to something else but with the same focus, term such as MRA and MGTOW gets so much demonization in recent years
3. Use big tech platform as an outlet, and redirect people to our own platform, main while self-censor to cope within these platform just to stay alive, using its influence to our advantage. We will only discuss the real issue within our own platform, but stay censorship friendly on the outlet platform. This way we could continue to grow our number secretly without getting too much attentions.
4. Ally with other group that also oppose censorship and advocate free speech, this means even if that group's main ideology we disagree with. Its a strategical compromise, we learn from our enemy, why do you think feminist advocate for LGBT, even many of them actually oppose trans

She then goes on to post how responding by saying that #notallmen is being part of the problem.

“Nobody wants to be with somebody in prison, son.” “Do you think someone out there, on the streets, will be loyal to someone in here?” “Who would want to waste their time messing with a prisoner?” I’ve heard all the negativity.

I understand the prejudices, but are we discarded as lepers now? Am I eternally scum because I have an inmate number to identify me behind enemy lines? Is all the good that I do wasted because I am incarcerated? 

My father tells me that a relationship with an inmate isn’t one at all, because I am in here and they are out there, “You can’t touch them, so how can you even be together?”  My mother tells me that “Anyone who wants to be with someone in prison has mental issues.” I remember a visit I had with my mom and grandma years back. a woman came to visit her boyfriend/husband and she was dressed to the 9s. My mom scoffed and said “Who would want to drive up here to visit an inmate?” I sat there, angered and hurt. Because we’re having this talk in a prison visiting room.

I was wondering if anyone might have some advice. I'm looking at possibly applying to the courts to request access to my son.
I have not seen him since he was a baby and he has had a new father in his life since just a couple of months old and is now almost 8 years old. 
He seems to be in a normal happy family environment and seems a well adjusted child..
I was interested in knowing whether the courts might still consider a request for access given the length of time it has been. If whether they might view it as unnecessary for him to know me or whether there would be the view of potential disruption at this stage of his development. 
I was wondering perhaps too much time had passed where I had been absent and I would be perceived to have no relevance or have no positive value that could be contributed in his upbringing.
Any advice or thoughts would be gratefully received.

Many thanks.",4.0

694,t3_rabeuw,Men should start leaving western and westernized countries and migrate to hospitable countries. The media now portrays the overall earnings gap between sexes as a pay gap by treating raising children as unpaid work. This will lead to discrimination in pay by law. Men must leave.,"The [BBC reports today](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59542790) on a new ""study"" about the overall earnings gap (described as ""a pay gap""), and presents the authors' narrative with no critical perspective as valid and true. Thus the BBC describes to the public as facts, the notion that there is a 40% ""pay gap"" as of 2019. The reader would have to interpret this as meaning that the BBC determines that a woman is paid 40% less than a man for doing the same job - this is the only meaning of the term pay gap. In fact the text reveals that this 40% was derived by **averaging the overall earnings of all ""working-age women"", that is, the authors calculated a pay gap by comparing working individuals, to people who don't work.** Naturally this irrational rhetoric is then justified by the BBC, following the authors' narrative, by determining that women who don't work or work in less lucrative positions or less hours, work at home in raising children. Hence the zero taxable payment of women who don't work is averaged with the salaries of working women and compared to men's average (whose participation in house work is therefore assumed to be zero - nothing is factored into the men's average as ""unpaid housework""). The BBC thus asserts after the authors, that if a woman is not working or works part time because she is with her children, she is in a situation of a pay gap. **Since no one will consider forcing women to spend less time with their children, the only conclusion from this narrative is that in order to not see 40% difference, those women who do work will have to earn more for doing the same job as now.** As currently they are payed the same as men, this can only be achieved by **stating in the law that a woman will be payed more per hour than a man** doing the same job, with the justification that this is payment for ""the unpaid work at home"". That is, true discrimination in the law. **There is no escape from this eventuality: there is no criticism in the media about this manipulative narrative, and policy makers are endorsing it fully out of fear of being shamed as ""being against women"".** Men are facing a concrete possibility of being in a true pay gap, if the law will state that women need to be payed more for the very same effort, and **the formation of such laws seems unavoidable**. If so, men must begin to leave the west and westernized societies. Discrimination by law is the most fundamental form of oppression. It seems that men do not have the power to stop the processes taking place right now that lead to their discrimination by law, and must therefore abandon the societies that have resolved to discriminate them.

In should be noted, that treating women who choose to spend more time at home raising children, as being in ""a pay gap"" from men, is dishonest first and foremost because many if not most of these women are supported by their husbands, so that their husband's income is in fact - if to use the terrible and inhumane feminist term for raising children as unpaid work - their ""payment"". Women are responsible for most expenditure including cars, houses and computers. Deciding that they should be ""paid"" from other sources can be seen as rationale only by ignoring the plain fact that in the overall comparison of the earnings of the two sexes, part of ""the red column"" is in fact a segment of ""the blue column"". Husbands do not normally spend their salary on race cars but hand most of it to their wives - this then should be regarded by the cynical inhuman way feminists treat parenting, ""payment for the work at home"".

It should also be noted that women in the west are not raising children for men, and the entire narrative of ""unpaid work"" after treating motherhood in the west as some forced labor, is false and manipulative. Women are raising children out of their own drives, and in fact having and raising children is one of the strongest drives in most women - parallel in its magnitude to the male drive toward women. Otherwise feminist will have to explain why women and feminism have been fighting for decades for full custody in divorce, why women will repeatedly risk their lives in fertility treatments, why women and in particular single women demand that fertility treatments and egg freezing will be covered by medical insurance, why feminist organizations all over the world have celebrated the year when for the first time in the US the majority of births was by single mothers. Women do not see in children unpaid work but a personal dream and drive. Requiring payment for fulfilling their dream is similiar to a man demanding pay for the work of having sex with women. For women, the motherhood is itself the gratification. **I am so sorry that this is true** and the feminist pay-gap narrative on this matter is a complete falsehood and manipulation. But the society we live in is not interested in truth, it internalizes the false narrative, which will leave it eventually with no other means to satisfy the feminist demands but **passing laws that require employers to pay more to women for same jobs as men**, and to pay women who don't work at all - for gratifying their deepest need, of raising children.  This will be payed from the taxes of men who work, this will sometimes be paid to a woman who wants to be a single mother, from the taxes of a single man - men will be required to pay through the state to women for raising children that are not theirs and without the women being their wives.

Men have no other choice but to leave these societies and migrate. These societies are on a course to the subjugation of men to servitude for women - working for and funding, non-working women who are not even willing to be their wives, and doing so when being discriminated in pay by law. No human, of any sex, should accept this. Leave. Migrate. Let the societies that treat you this way, who call you expendable, who drown you in hate speech, who neglect your health causing the life expectancy gap to grow every decade but at the same time require you to retire after women, and now form an indisputable narrative that has no other conclusion but your discrimination by law which spells subjugation, to try and sustain their system of lies by themselves.",287.0

I used the MCU as an example to talk about how a lot of women complain only when black widow is sexualized but don’t say anything when the male characters are. And they blame everything on the “male gaze”. Anyway, today I was watching the new Marvel show Hawkeye and I witnessed a double standard in the first 5 minutes of the episode. In the beginning hawkeye and his kids are watching a musical about the avengers and at one point in the musical, the lights focused on two men that played Captain America and Thor. And the song that was playing in the musical said something along the lines of “boy are they easy on the eyes” while the camera was pointing at the two men. And the entire audience cheered. And right after that the focus shifted to the woman who was playing black widow but the song didn’t mention anything about her looks. Now imagine if it was the other way around. If the song said “she is easy on the eyes” while the entire audience cheered. There would be tons and tons of articles talking about the misogyny in marvel and how the male gaze is very sexist and all that bullshit. People act like Scarlett Johansson is the only one that faces sexism but nobody talks about the time when in Captain America: The First Avenger, Haley Atwell “accidentally” touched Chris Evans’s pecs even though it wasn’t in the script. I know this is just a tv show but this bothered me a little because we all know it wouldn’t be acceptable if it was the other way around.

 I’m amazed that what’s happening currently in popular culture as relates everything female and feminism.

A married woman goes to a bar alone and a guy tries to buy her a drink. According to the bartender the woman finds out the the rejection of his drink made the guy go nuts and she should be careful. There you go job done. All men suck. 

First off all I would bet most the posts are total BS, but if it’s true, what TwoX will never admit is the female loons who act the same way. We have all seen some women go nuts when reject by men including married men. I saw in high school a 17 year torment a young English teacher who was married so much so her parents were notified. 

At work I am aware of two bizarre incidents over the last decade where female employees are brazen to the point of abuse chasing after married men. One who was rejected by her boss tried an abuse charge that was thankfully dismissed by an all female HR department. The loon was fired from our place and from her next job as well for pulling the same stunt. 

Both genders have this lunacy but one feels very entitled to proclaim that its special in its martyrdom. Guess which one.

Location - FL, USA

I have been divorced for 4 years.  My now exwife left, cleared accounts and emptied our marital home prior to filing.  We had a minor child that stayed with me and I ultimately was given full custody during the trial.

After the FJ was rendered (over 4 months after the trial) both myself and my exwife filed motions challenging portions of the FJ.  My motions involved the financials used by the judge in making his determination (used my gross income vs my exwifes net income)...we made the same amount of money annually.  I was ordered to pay an amount of alimony that I could not possibly afford without even considering the fact that I was solely providing for my minor child as well as maintain the marital home.

My ex-wife won her motions challenging the FJ but I was never heard.  My ex-wife filed at least 10 motions of contempt and various others against me for non payment of alimony during this period of time and as a result 3 years had gone by with me not  being heard...I could never get my motions heard (I went through a number of attorneys who tried), the court just kept hearing from my ex-wife and ruling in her favor.

During this period of time a new judge replaced the old judge.  My attorney filed motions to get various financial docs from my ex...it took 2 hearings/orders to get my ex to produce (1.5 years), ultimately I had to subpoena most of the docs I needed from her.  About two months prior to me filing the subpoenas the judge threw out my motions (now 3 years old) without a hearing or anything.  My attorney petitioned the court to have my motions reinstated but the judge was refusing to hear some of the most important aspects of my motions.

I also need to include that my exwife was supporting another man for 2-3 years and he was living with her prior to our original divorce trial.  Every financial affidavit, testimony and etc to the court was fraudulent.  My motions were finally scheduled for trial and the trial occurred recently.

My exwife admitted to supporting the other guy for 2-3 years all while dragging me through hell while I was caring for our minor child...my case was completely and without question proven.  I was asking that the court significantly reduce the ordered alimony or eliminate completely based on my exwife being in a supportive long-term relationship, the issues with the Financials used in determining alimony and a suspension of alimony for 3 years...I lost on everything.  

I have been completely bankrupted by this process, feel like I have been completely discriminated against and have lost all hope.  The court literally will not enforce anything that was awarded to me in the FJ. The court hammers me and holds me accountable but will not hold my ex-wife to the same criteria. I don't know what to do anymore, please help.",24.0

# Some Feminist Readers May Want to Sit Before Continuing

 [April 26, 2021](https://lovists.com/2021/04/26/some-feminist-readers-may-want-to-sit-before-continuing/) [Henry Blair](https://lovists.com/author/henryblair/)   

Is the attack against sexual  communication and the language of sexuality justified? Is the position  of women in sexual relations with men so abusive, desperate, and violent  that the step taken by feminism – disqualifying almost the entire  language – should be endorsed even if the price is a cessation of human  sexuality between the sexes?

Feminist women and  feminism-sympathizers have absolute confidence that the answer is an  unequivocal yes: the feminist belief is that all women were sexually  injured and that all men sexually harass, if not in practice then  potentially, if not directly then indirectly in creating an environment  that encourages harassment. Feminists see this as a plain, clear picture  of reality that is easy to establish. The problems begin when one  attempts to do just that.

In 2015, [the Journal of Public Health published a study](https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/39/4/738/2298455)  that was conducted in Spain and included 10,171 women. The researchers,  all women themselves, contacted randomly-sampled women to avoid data  bias, and performed in-person interviews with each of the thousands of  participants to find out if they had experienced assault or harassment,  from rape to “Has anyone touched you sexually, or did anything else  sexually that you did not want.” In case the women weren’t comfortable  answering verbally, the interviewers offered to point to cards. It is  important to emphasize that the study addressed assaults and harassment  from any person of any type of acquaintance, except for a spouse  (regarding sexual assaults by spouses, according to the World Health  Organization, [the prevalence](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf)  ranges between 3% and 11% in the West and reaches up to 40% in small  tribal communities in Latin America where weddings between minors are  frequent).

Some feminist readers may want to sit  before continuing: the results were that a total of 7.2% of women  reported some form of rape or harassment of the types examined.  Specifically, out of 10,171 participants, 1.4% went through an offense  of rape of any kind by a man of any acquaintance, 2.8% have experienced  attempted assault that did not end in rape, and 5.6% reported some form  of sexual harassment. We should pay attention to a crucial aspect of the  data that will later take on dramatic significance: when we mentioned  how many of the women reported each type of event, we got the numbers  1.4% plus 2.8% plus 5.6%, which when added up give 9.8%. But it was  written here that overall, 7.2% of women reported some form of assault  or harassment. Not 9.8%. How is it possible? This happens because there  are ***overlaps*** between the groups. Some women  who reported a particular type of incident, also reported another type  and are included in both groups. If we were to calculate the total  number of women who experienced any kind of wrongdoing by adding the  percentage of the second group to that of the first group, women  appearing in both would be counted twice, and we will not arrive at the  percentage of individuals who reported some kind of incident. We would  get the wrong percentage – a higher one. Therefore, the researchers  reported the total percentage of women who went through any kind of  event. Only the researchers themselves could have reached this figure;  it cannot be derived from simply reading the percentages of the  different events. In order to reach this total, the researchers had to  calculate the percentage of affirmative questionnaires out of all  questionnaires. If the researchers had not reported the result, we  wouldn’t be able to arrive at it ourselves because we have no way of  knowing the overlap between the percentages of the different groups.

If the figure 7.2% seems surprising compared to the information you may have heard, you may want to remain seated. Because in [a study published in 2014 in the Lancet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673613622436),  one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world,  researchers conducted a review (meta-analysis) of 7,231 different  studies that examined the percentage of women who have been sexually  assaulted or harassed, excluding incidents from a spouse. This is not a  mistake, these are seven thousand, two hundred, and thirty-one different  studies. The summary of the studies reached the following figure: 7.2%.

The critical reader will quickly turn  to the possibility that the studies rely on legal definitions, which  would entail omitting harassment that women experience during their  lives but supposedly is not reported in the studies. The chances that  this explains the figure 7.2% are extremely low: the definitions of  harassment in such studies, usually refer to the interviewee’s  subjective experience (“have you felt harassed”) and not to any rigid  definition taken from criminology or the law, nor to whether a complaint  was filed or legal actions taken. For example, the purpose of the  Spanish study was to examine the long-term psychological impact of  harassment and sexual assault. It was a study in Psychology, which takes  no interest in criminology or legal definitions. Most studies on the  prevalence of harassment, such as those included in the Lancet review,  are of this type. They ask about those events that women experienced as  harassment and, most of the time, do not limit themselves at all to what  the law defines as criminal. Still, feminists will have a hard time  digesting the figure 7.2%. They may demand that new studies will be  performed, with some broader definitions of harassment. Fortunately to  them, these studies have already been carried out. 

In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US published [a study conducted by telephone in 2010 among 16,507 respondents](https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf), in order to assess the prevalence of harassment and rape in women and men, and [published again](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692457/.%20Accessed%20December%2027,%202020)  in 2014 findings from 2012. The study is particularly interesting  because of the way the questions were worded and how harassment and  sexual assault were defined. Unlike in most studies, participants were  not asked, “have you been assaulted” or “were you harassed.” Instead, ***situation-descriptions***  were given. Respondents were asked, for example, “How many people have  you had sex with after they pressured you by… lies, (or) making promises  about the future?”, “How many people have you had sex with after they  pressured you by… showing they were unhappy?” or whether they had sex  “when you were drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to  consent.” If the respondent answered in the affirmative on the last  question, the interviewer recorded that she was raped, and an  affirmative answer on the other two was recorded as sexual violence.  Non-physical harassment was similarly defined with the broadest  definitions. Did this study support the feminist assertion that 100% of  women were harassed?

The findings of the 2014 study (the  2011 study presented similar data) were that in total, 43.9% of women  reported incidents that the study defined as types of non-rape  harassment. Specifically, 32.1% answered in the affirmative on questions  defined as non-physical harassment (exposure, nudity, verbal harassment  in public), 27.3% responded affirmatively on questions defined as  physical harassment (“Caressing, cornering, grasping or touching in a  way that made you feel insecure”), and 12.5% answered in the affirmative  to questions defined as verbal coercion to sex, including with  dishonesty or sadness, defined as sexual violence (the three categories  are contained in the number 43.9 but do not add up to it, because of the  overlaps between groups). Regarding rape and attempted rape, a total of  19.3% answered in the affirmative to questions defined in the study as  sexual assault. Specifically, out of all the participants, 11.5%  answered in the affirmative to questions that according to the study  definitions indicate they had been raped, and 6.4% answered in the  affirmative to questions defined in the study as attempted rape.  Finally, 8.8% reported being sexually assaulted by a spouse. These last  three figures together add up to 19.3%, as mentioned earlier. Also, all  sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs was categorized as rape,  constituting 9.3% included in the figure 19.3%. 

Regrettably, the CDC researchers did  not publish how the figures of 43.9 and 19.3 are summed up. They did not  report the overall percentage of women who experienced any form of  assault or harassment. This is at least 43.9% (full overlap between  categories) and at most 63.2% (complete lack of overlap – that is, no  woman in the study was harassed in two or more ways). The two extreme  states do not appear in reality in studies, so the sum is likely to  range between the two values – possibly around 50%, that is, that 50% of  women were sexually harassed or attacked. If one wishes to compare this  figure to the 7.2% that 7,231 studies have reached, it’s necessary to  add sexual assaults by a spouse, because these were studies that focused  on incidents from any person other than a  spouse. The prevalence of  incidents caused by a spouse can be found, for example, in the World  Health Organization figures mentioned above, pointing to [3% to 11% in the West](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf).  When added to 7.2%, these incidence rates reach an overall prevalence  of between 11% and 18% (this addition is done under the stricter  assumption of no-overlap, so the actual sum can only be lower). No  doubt, if 11-18% of all women have gone through any kind of sexual  harassment or assault, from the mildest possible verbal innuendo to  actual rape, this is a high figure, but it is still very far from the  50% arguably reported by the CDC. Which is more reliable? The finding  reached by 7,231 studies, or the CDC’s?

Shortly after their release, the two CDC studies were criticized in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cdc-study-on-sexual-violence-in-the-us-overstates-the-problem/2012/01/25/gIQAHRKPWQ_story.html?utm_term=.38d6accfbd38), by prof. Christina Hoff Sommers (who also runs a very revealing YouTube channel, called [The Factual Feminist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLytTJqkSQqtpB1YvQFdEEdAtYO3qg7fow)) and in [Time magazine](https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/)  by Dr. Kathy Young. Both have wondered if the CDC’s questions  distinguished at all between women who were harassed, and women who were  in consensual situations. Because, in order to reach the figure of  around 50%, the researchers defined any sexual relations under the  influence of alcohol or drugs, as rape (9.3%). There were no follow-up  questions – just a phone call asking the respondents if they had sex  “when you were drunk, high, drugged, ***or*** passed out and unable to consent” – the ***Or*** made  the statement just as true for those who were not passed out but that  had a drink. The question could very well receive an affirmative answer  from those who would not think of themselves as assaulted in any way,  but have responded that at least once in their life, they had sex after  drinking. Due to the wording of the questions, there is a very likely  possibility that women who drank a few glasses of wine in a restaurant  and slept with their husband or boyfriend were counted as raped. In the  same manner, any verbal persuasion for having sex, including lying and  expressing sadness, was counted as sexual harassment (12.5%), so a woman  who slept with a man only to find out a week later that he was married,  would be counted as harassed because she was lied to, even if she was  married herself and lied as well to the man she was with, and may have  felt angry, but not necessarily sexually harassed. Non-physical  harassment, which reached 32.1%, included showing and taking nude  photos, so teens who voluntarily exchanged photos with their boyfriends  were most likely considered harassed because the researchers only asked,  “How many people have ever… made you look at or participate in sexual  photos or movies?” (the rest of the sentence – “against your will”, did  not exist in the study). 

Unlike studies that reach 7.2%, the CDC study did not ask anyone, “were you harassed.” Instead, the researchers formulated ***situation-descriptions***,  thinking only of the negative examples for each description and not of  the positive ones. As a result, very innocent situations that also fit  the same rigid situation-description (having a drink before sex,  exchanging photos for fun) should have been counted as violent  incidents, making it extremely plausible that some proportion of those  who responded in the affirmative, were women and men who did not feel  harassed at all and yet counted as such. This is probably the most  plausible explanation for the gap between 11-18% reached by thousands of  studies, and the 40-60% reached by the CDC, whose creators were  associated by the commentators with radical feminism.

Importantly, studies reporting 7.2%  assaulted and harassed, also record much less rape cases than the  numbers commonly used in public discourse today. For example, the  Spanish study found the number to be 1.4% of women. What is then the  source of expressions such as “one in five” (20%) and “one in four”  (25%), that are being spread? Even the CDC study reached 11.5% assault  incidents, not 1 in 5 or 1 in 4, and this figure was obtained with rigid  situation-descriptions that probably counted many who were not  assaulted, thus artificially increasing the actual number. Where did the  feminist belief in extraordinary figures 20 times higher than the data  come from? One possibility is that the number comes from biased samples.  Feminism-sympathizers run internal surveys, but without minding  methodological considerations such as random sampling, that are  necessary for the results to apply to the entire population and not just  to the site where respondents were recruited. For example, in such  surveys, feminism-sympathizers may approach women in places where rape  rates are exceptionally high, such as busy city centers, and then report  the findings as applying to the entire population (in fact, one  gender-studies department published instructions to its teachers and  students not to apply random sampling, but to focus on “interesting  cases,” which amounts to intentionally introducing a sampling bias that  would render results uninterpretable). Another explanation might be that  feminism-sympathizers summed up percentages of different categories  (from the same research or even from different studies). If done while  ignoring the overlap between groups, this would cause an error that  inflates the numbers. Another likely possibility is that feminists  applied the same way of thinking of the CDC investigators, of defining  rigid situation-descriptions, and counting as assault the categories  that studies created in their questionnaires, because the sympathizers  decided that a question is a rigid situation-description that  constitutes an assault, without having access to the respondents to  verify this. 

The feminist statement that all women  were harassed was formulated only very recently, and as part of a  broader endeavor, to convince in a different claim – that all men have  harassed women, directly or indirectly. Notably, even if it ***would*** have  been true that every women was sexually harassed, this would not  necessitate that all men have harassed because such a result could just  as well ensue from a small number of men harassing all women. That is,  even if “all women were harassed” ***was*** a true  proposition, it would not entail in any way that “all men have  harassed”. However, this plain fact was missed entirely by feminists,  who, believing in the logical fallacy that if all women were harassed  then all men have harassed, aspire to reach 100% harassed first and  foremost, to show, basically, that all men are guilty. 

The feminist motivation to show that  all men are guilty by attempting to show that all women were harassed  continues to grow. The use of arbitrary situation-descriptions without  ever inquiring “were you harassed”, that is, without taking interest in  personal will, thus forcing on respondents a negative interpretation of  innocent experiences, has become ever more popular since Me Too. In  feminism, the situation-descriptions expanded to encompass almost all of  daily life, until nearly every human interaction between men and women  may be regarded as harassment, [the greeting “hello” included](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/when-did-hello-become-har_b_6173284). This forcing of situation-descriptions on interactions to count them as offenses, enabled recent pseudo-research [to conclude that 81%](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment) and even [97% of women](https://mashable.com/article/sexual-harassment-un-women-uk/)  were sexually harassed.  Feminism-sympathizers joined the efforts and  apply voluntarily the new situation-descriptions to their own lives to  count innocent interactions as “harassment”. Just recently the New York  Times reported that [Gov. Andrew Cuomo was accused by an assistant](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/nyregion/alyssa-mcgrath-cuomo-harassment.html)  of sexual harassment because “he inquired about her lack of a wedding  ring”, “him telling her she was beautiful — in Italian”, and once “gazed  down her shirt and commented on a necklace”. All along, what drives  this ever-increasing expansion of the definitions of harassment by  situation-descriptions that become more and more arbitrary, is the  relentless aspiration to point a blaming finger at all men, to argue,  “all men are guilty”. 

Thus we arrive at the underlying  question that drives this entire discussion – how many men have actually  sexually harassed women? While there are plenty of studies assessing  how many women were harassed, it is difficult to find ones that examine  what percentage of men out of all men behave in a harassing way. Still,  my searches led me to [a 2013 study performed in the United States](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1748355)  with a thousand young men and women of the ages 14 to 21. And here are  the results: Of the boys and young men, 9% have harassed – far from the  notion that all or most men engage in such behavior. But the findings  also revealed that the proportion of girls and young women who committed  the same sexual harassment was the same – 9% – and the girls’  harassment was directed primarily, like the boys’, toward the opposite  sex. It is generally very difficult to find studies examining the  question “what percentage of men have sexually harassed,” because ***until recently, this was an absurd question.*** It  was clear to everyone that there is crime in the world, committed by  both men and women, and everyone knew that criminals are a tiny fraction  of humanity. The notion that all men might be criminals, so that  studies should seriously look into the question of “what percentage of  men are criminals,” was unthinkable and therefore almost no studies can  be found that have examined such a question. 

Some historians specialize in trying  to understand how a popular error about research facts has been created.  Historians will be able to examine in the future what caused the  feminist false beliefs that all women were harassed, and that one in  five, four or three were raped. In reality, studies that apply a  verified methodology to identify the number of women who have been  raped, reach 1.4%. In the West, another 3% to 11% of women have been  sexually assaulted by a spouse. As for harassment, these studies show  that 5.6% of women have been sexually harassed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Currently prisoners are clothed in a standard issue prison uniform, which consists of a blue t-shirt, a grey jumper (sweater), and grey soft trousers (jogging bottoms/pants). All male prisoners must wear the uniform during the first two weeks of their sentence, and are then entitled to wear some of their own clothes if they choose to after obtaining a higher enhanced reward level, for doing things such as performing their prison chores and keeping good behavior, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Although female prisoners are not subject to the same rules and do not have to wear uniform under government legislation, individual female prisons are able to set their own regulations regarding uniforms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Women prisoners must not be full-searched as a matter of routine but only on intelligence or reasonable suspicion that an item is being concealed on the person which may be revealed by the search. Full searches must be conducted in accordance with the correct procedures. The procedure for searching women prisoners is different to that used to search male prisoners and women visitors and staff.  (p16)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;An appropriate manager must authorise the full search of a woman prisoner in the case of a “target search”, i.e. not following reception, a visit or a cell search, where time allows prior authorisation to be obtained. (p34)

&amp;#x200B;

Men can be searched naked, made to squat, bend over, lift his genital and pull his foreskin, etc. Women can be searched naked only if there are high suspicions

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A women must never be asked to squat. (p34)

But even male visitors can be asked to. They dont need the same level of suspicion to get male visitors naked and squatting. But don't worry when men are asked to squat it is recorded ! And male visitos can only asked to lift their genitals or his foreskin only he there are suspicion. How merciful of them.

&amp;#x200B;

(p7-11)

Even E-level (women who attempted an escape) and restricted (high security level) female prisonsers are not routinely full strip checked but every male have to be. (p12). By restricted I mean :

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Those whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or national security, thus necessitating maximum security conditions. Offences that may result in consideration for Category A or Restricted Status include \[attempted\] murder, manslaughter, \[attempted\] rape, sexual assault, armed robbery, wounding with intent, kidnapping, importing or supplying Class A controlled drugs, possessing or supplying explosives, offences connected with terrorism and offences under the Official Secrets Act

&gt;If there are grounds to suspect (e.g. from CCTV footage or intelligence or from the way the prisoner is behaving during a full search) that a male prisoner has an item hidden in the anal area or hidden in the genital area then a closer visual inspection must be undertaken as part of a full search.

&gt;If the prisoner refuses to bend/squat he is disobeying a lawful order and, if appropriate, reasonable force can be used to make him bend/squat, or alternatively mirrors can be used to search the anal/genital area

&amp;#x200B;

Now look at this (p25-27) :

* Female prisoners, visitors and staff must only be searched by female staff.
* Male visitors, prisoners and staff may be rubbed down searched by male or female staff, but must only be full searched by male prison officers.
* Where a female member of staff objects to rub-down searching a male, managers must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that they do not have to carry out the search. It is usual for female members of staff to rub down search males unless the man has a genuine religious or cultural objection to this.
* Exemptions for male prisoners will only be permitted when the male prisoner has genuine grounds for objecting to being searched by a female member of staff. It is not sufficient that the prisoner would prefer to be searched by a male member of staff. In practice it is likely that prisoners will only be able to establish good reason for an exemption in cases where the practice has caused genuine distress.

There are more care for a female staff who doesn't want to search a male prisoner than when a male prisoner refuse to be searched by a female one.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only female are receiving favorable sentences under government policy ([https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-launches-dedicated-strategy-to-break-the-cycle-of-female-offending](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-launches-dedicated-strategy-to-break-the-cycle-of-female-offending)) but in prison their are treated as sub humans.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT : The procedure is so complex for men to refuse a female staff. They really do their best so that women's ego are not impacted by being refused or that creepy women are not deprived of the privilege of groping men.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If there are situations where a male prisoner objects to being searched by a female member of staff on grounds of religion those situations must be referred to the Managing Chaplain and relevant faith Chaplain or, where necessary, to Chaplaincy HQ where advice can be obtained from the National Faith Adviser for that religion. If the Faith Adviser indicates that this is an important aspect of the religion then an exemption on grounds of religion should be granted. Otherwise an exemption on cultural grounds (see below) may be considered.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On Cultural Grounds: Some male prisoners may have genuine objections to being searched by a female member of staff on cultural grounds. A cultural ground means an objection that arises from a sincerely and deeply held belief.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If a prisoner asserts reliance on this exemption he will need to be able to: (a) explain what the sincerely held belief is; (b) set out the reasons why he holds that belief; (c) explain why that belief means that he objects to a rub-down search being performed on him by a female member of staff. In many if not all cases, it is to be expected that the prisoner will be able to demonstrate that being searched by a female member of staff will be a cause of genuine distress.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A mere preference to be searched by a male officer will not be enough to constitute a sincerely and deeply held belief. Similarly reasons which are frivolous, or are intended to frustrate the efficient running of the prison, should be rejected.

Women who killed someone or tried to escape cannot be searcher without authorization. But for sake of efficiency, men should shut up if they do not want to be searched by a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It may be difficult to confirm the veracity of any cultural objection based on sincerely held beliefs. Probation reports and/or consultation with the prisoner’s offender manager, personal officer or wing staff may be of use. If the prisoner has made the request in writing, it might be helpful in addition to talk to him in order to confirm that the reason relied on is genuine and deeply held.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The request must be considered by a member of staff delegated by the Governor as competent to carry out the task. The member of staff delegated to consider exemptions must make reasonable efforts to determine the veracity of the request.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prisoners must be advised that their exemption will be kept under review and, should evidence emerge that they have deliberately misled staff in order to gain the exemption, then the exemption can be withdrawn

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Where staff are unsure if a prisoner has an exemption or not then the prisoner should be believed and checks made later. Prisoners who deliberately mislead staff by pretending to have an exemption may then be subject to a disciplinary charge (appropriate charge Prison Rule 51 (6), YOI Rule 55 (7) intentionally obstructs an officer in the execution of his duty, or any person (other than a prisoner / inmate) who is at the prison / young offender institution for the purpose of working there, in the performance of his work).

They even charge you for something as minor as lying to not get groped by women.

It is clear for me:

**As a male prisoner, being treated with dignity, respect and basic decency is a hard earned privilege. As a female prisoner, not being treated as a queen is a capital offense. Male prisons are the perfect place for female creeps to abuse men. We don't send female abusing men and boys in prisons. But we send female abusers in prisons so  they have an easier tiùe abusing men.**

Feminists fight to reform prison for women only.  They will straight up  do things, create policies and laws only for women, simply for the sisterhood. Time for us to fight for the brotherhood. 

Want to do charitable work with prisoners ? Only do it with men. Want to implement new rules and policies in prisons and justice system to help criminals ? Fight to implement it only for men and boys. Want to make donations ? Give only to men and boys. Want the government to add new services, support or methods in prisons, military, school, universities , etc ? Lobby only for men and boys.

Men need to understand : Women are shareholders of the society. Men the low qualified, expendable and replaceable workers of society. Women wait comfortably getting the fruit of men's sacrifice. Men don't get a share of the fruit of  their labor. Men don't gain anything by hard working and investing in society. Women are the one who harvest the benefits. It is time we start acting as workers : do the minimum and demanding benefits only for ourselves if they want us to keep working to maintain society.

770,t3_r8b350,Disturbing Experience I Had With The Empathy Gap,"A while back my friend and I were discussing women in the military. This was like 2018ish? Back when it was more culturally relevant. This was before women being eligible for the draft was even a part of the debate. It was simply whether or not a woman should be in the military at all, if an individual woman wanted to be.

We started talking about combat roles and whether or not a woman should be able to see combat. My opinion was yes, she should, as long as she could pass all the necessary tests (be strong enough to carry a wounded soldier out of battle, for example)

He said he didn’t think a woman should be allowed to see combat because he felt that it would be more demoralizing for soldiers to see a dead female ally than a dead male ally.

He then backtracked a little bit and said “but maybe not cause that’s like, “your bro”, or whatever”

I was dumbfounded.

It became clear to me that he assigned much more value to female life than to male life. That he would find a dead female soldier much more demoralizing than a dead male soldier, so much so that a dead male soldier is just “your bro, or whatever” but a dead female soldier is so unimaginable that maybe females shouldn’t even be allowed to fight at all.

This was a very eye opening experience for me when it came to the prevalence of the empathy gap.

I can imagine that if a significant amount of people feel this way it must effect the distribution of human rights.

Why the notion is far more toxic then masculinity can be?","""Toxic masculinity"" automatically assumes, that the problem is with masculinity, or some part of it, which is not true at all. The problem is not with masculinity, the problem is how a given society relates to men and boys. Therefore the term is inapplicable. Some societal expectations are toxic, not some aspects of masculinity. 

Men may be more prone to violence, but it's a very very small minority of the population who was actually born with antisocial disorder... Violence is a ""tool"" that can be used for good or for bad. ""Bad"" or ""good"" is not inherent to human beings. Wether someone turns out to be a valuable member of society or a fugitive, it depends on their upbringing and environment.

If boys and young man can not channel their masculine energies correctly, if they are not shown ways to use their violence for good, if they have no real life examples (eg. fathers) as to what does it actually mean to be a Man, they do not learn the importance of honor, the respect of others, how to control their emotions, their rage, their anger, how to behave in position of power, how to be humble, how to trait and deal with women, how, when and where they can show weakness etc. .. They will be vulnerable to corruptive ideas and lifestyle. Bad people are made, not born.

Single parent households are insufficient to ""produce"" healthy children, every single research shows that these kids will have numerous disadvantages, boys even more then girls.

We can not erase the ""bad"" side of masculinity nor should we, because certain traits ARE inherent, and by trying we are only going to produce a bunch of disfunctional men, full of confusions. We must tech boys how to be masculine and how to use it for good. We need more masculinity, not less. We must keep fathers around, we must find mentors and role models, we must have more male teachers. But before anything, the gender war must stop, and the use of inappropriate terminologies must cease. So instead of ""toxic masculinity"", let's talk about the ""toxic societal expectations towards men"".

In any case, the worst thing we can do is what ""we"" do today, wielding a crusade against masculinity on the basis that it can potentially turn out to be harmful, and as a solution we try to enforce feminine traits on boys and force them into an environment (school) which clearly doesn't suit their needs. ""We"" clearly can't resolve problems with masculinity by effeminating boys. ""We"" tried exactly that in the past decades, and virtually all measurable statistics show that boys are doing worse then ever. 

Further, the notion of ""toxic masculinity"" does not only harm boys. It harms girls just as much, because it causes (often unconscious) resentment, mistrust and dread towards boys/men and makes it virtually impossible for them to maintain healthy romantic relationships.

You might have heard people dismissing misandry as unimportant because 'there's no systemic discrimination against men' or the famous saying ""Misandry irritates. Misogyny kills""

Occasionally, you might hear that there is systemic misogyny, which may occasionally backfire against men occasionally. 

But is this true? Let's look at the facts

**The Law**

According to a very indepth review by Sonja Starr, she deduced that [Men get 63% longer sentences for the same crime.](https://repository.law.umich.edu/law_econ_current/57/) While it is true that men are more likely to commit crimes, it doesn't explain the gender disparity, which is alot longer than racial disparity, which means even an African American woman would get a shorter sentence than a white man. 

Men's troubles don't start there. [Men are more likely to be stopped by the police](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:344633/fulltext.pdf), and even when women are stopped, [we are less likely to be arrested](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235204000637?via%3Dihub). 

[Women are also less likely to be killed by the police](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585149/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-gender/). And overally, men are [90% of those in prison](https://www.prisonstudies.org/country/united-states-america), [98% of death row inmates](https://www.statista.com/statistics/199014/gender-distribution-of-prisoners-under-sentence-of-death-in-the-us-in-2009/), and [and 98.8% of those executed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women_executed_in_the_United_States_since_1976)

Now when we hear that African Americans are unjustly being killed by police at higher rates than white people, we rightly protest and accuse the police of discrimination. We also say that if African-Americans commit more crimes than whites it's due to systemic discrimination against them, but if men receive much harsher sentences than women for the same crime and sentencing history, isn't it systemic discrimination.

So, why does this discrimination exist? It's in part due to the ['women are wonderful effect'](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14792779543000002). Some have argued this is only due to women following traditional gender roles, but even when women are not, [we are still seen as wonderful](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00792.x)

Violence against women is seen as almost universally evil especially Western nations. According to research done by Richard B Felson, [people see violence against women worse than violence against men, especially if the perp is a woman](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.20323).

 Men are discriminated against even when they are the victims, [As criminals get harsher punishments  for killing women than for killing men.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v03n01_03) 

**Mental Health**

It's a well known fact that [men commit suicide more than women in every country in the world.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/suicide-rate-by-country) But what is behind this rate? People argue that since women attempt suicide at higher rates than men, it proves that women are the ones in need of help not men. But [men have a higher rate of suicidal intent than women](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8). It seems that many women could be making a suicidal gesture rather than actually wanting to commit suicide.

As a woman, I used to be suicidal but I was able to benefit from therapy, which is what most want.

Some also say that men choose more lethal methods, but this is also not indicative of men's suicide rate because [even when men choose the same methods, they still die more than women.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032711005179) 

Some say it is due to toxic masculinity, but even that has problems. First of all, if women were more oppressed than men, why would they commit suicide at a higher rate? Secondly, [91% of men who committed suicide did seek help before doing it](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=55305)

So, what is the reason? Well, [suicide prevention programs work much better for girls than for boys](https://archive.is/3MnuZ). 

This [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/15579883211014776) shows that men are dropping out of therapy prematurely because therapy was created with women in mind.

To summarize, if men all over the world commit suicide more than women, even when using the same methods, and men drop out of therapy because it doesnt suit their needs, than isn't it systemic discrimination?

**Physical Health**

Now, everyone knows that [women live longer than men in almost every country on Earth.](https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/life-expectancy/) But leave alone the fact that men are more likely to commit suicide, die at work (more on than later), die during a conflict (more on than later), drown, die from an injury, and die from child abuse, let's look at mens health. [Men are more likely to die from cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics), [heart attacks](https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/statistics), and even [coronavirus](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/05/15/covid-19-much-more-fatal-for-men-especially-taking-age-into-account/)

Despite all this, [women's health receives FOUR TIMES as much funding as men's health](https://prostate.org.nz/2014/01/men-die-earlier-womens-health-gets-four-times-funding/)

**Hate crimes**

Almost everyone agrees that gay men are oppressed to some degree. [But gay men suffer hate crimes more often than gay women do.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/28/anti-gay-hate-crimes-rise-fbi-says-and-they-likely-undercount/1582614001/) Other feminists say this is because lesbians are seen as 'sexier' than gay men. But even [transwomen are more likely to be victims of hate crimes than trans men](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-day-remembrance-advocates-honor-lives-lost-violence-n938401). The key here is that even though trans women are women, transphobes dont consider them women, they consider them 'men in dresses' and thus deserving of violence. While transmen usually say that people generally treat them with kid gloves when they find out they were AFAB (assigned female at birth). [Bisexual men endure more discrimination than bisexual women](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319092021/https://sci-hub.st/https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0164430). 

[72 countries have laws against homosexuality, but only about 40 have laws against female homosexuality](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/gay-relationships-still-criminalised-countries-report) So in 27 countries, it's banned for men but not for women. 

So if men are more likely to be victims of hate crimes, male homosexuality is punished more than female homosexuals, while trans women are being targeted because they are seen as men pretending to be women, doesn't it mean men are systemically discriminated against?

**Work**

You've probably heard that women make less money than men, and that is an example of discrimination, but the truth is that women choose more fulfilling and safer jobs than men. We also choose jobs closer to home, so we commute less, and we take less overtime and work shorter hours. [Here is a video explaining it all.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58arQIr882w)

According to this research, [men work almost twice as long as women in a week, do more work in a week even when unpaid labor is considered](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/). 

According to this study, [men are much more unhappy at work than women](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537197000109)

[Men are more than 10 times more likely to die at work than women](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/equal-pay-day-this-year-was-april-10-the-next-equal-occupational-fatality-day-will-be-on-may-3-2029/)

[Boys are more likely to be put in child labor than girls](https://www.compassion.com/poverty/child-labor-quick-facts.htm), and according to this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5161368/), the work they do is very dangerous and harmful. 

So, how is all of this systemic? Well, there is a general cultural and religious duty of men to provide for women. In Christianity as well as Islam, men are told (and sometimes harshly condemned for not) to provide for women, and our children. This leads to men choosing higher paying but more dangerous, less emotionally fulfilling, and farther away jobs so they can provide for women.

However, even though men are in a way 'punished' for choosing such careers by dying more on the job and being more unhappy at work, women aren't really 'punished' for our careers because we still [control most of consumer spending.](https://girlpowermarketing.com/statistics-purchasing-power-women/)

Which means that many men work punishing hours at a job they dislike and STILL benefit less than women. 

This doesn't even take into account all the concessions offices make for women, like breastfeeding rooms, worker maternal leave, etc

**Military**

Currently, about 60 countries have mandatory drafts for males but only 9 have mandatory drafts for women. In some countries, women serve for a shorter time, like in Israel, women service two years while men serve for 2.5 years. 

In some cases, [men and boys will be targeted in a military operation or massacre](https://web.archive.org/web/20150712192651/http://www.gendercide.org/case_srebrenica.html).

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement rates**

[Several countries still have a lower retirement age for women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_age)

**Homes and homelessness**

Men are more likely to be homeless in almost every country on Earth. 

Despite this, the vast majority of charity homes and most shelters are for women. 

So do men have an issue finding homes? [Well landlords and agents prefer women over men](https://archive.is/4t8qi#selection-543.715-543.1273)

So what is the reason for this? It could be that [people are less likely to respond to male suffering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597820303630)

**Education and parents**

[Boys are more likely to be physically abused than girls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448305/)

[Schools punish boys more often and more harshly than girls](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us0808webwcover.pdf)

**Rape**

[Men get raped at similar rates as women](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s12119-021-09901-1?sharing_token=m65pCyThui2c9pAR1hZm-_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6xCkTjCcB-N3k3sVm-u9GVGeImYXdoWaKDk2QUQ3-35X1Qn7n79DkYRliQPg8dfoRUCNruKQl5u8pNsBvjJ7Pxe-DTUmY-FC058LbEaYe8Mgnt4Vsk7YLOp3ZiXp6rxCc%3D), but rape is usually seen as a crime that only happens to women. Even religions rarely mention men as rape victims. Infact, [Only 3% of organizations that acknowledge rape as a weapon of war help male victims.](https://genderandsecurity.org/projects-resources/research/male-male-sexual-violence-wartime-human-rights-last-taboo)

Very few countries in the world acknowledge rape of men by women as a crime. 

**Domestic violence**

[Men and women go through domestic violence at similar rates](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233717660_Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment) and yet mostly all shelters are for women and domestic violence is seen as a woman's problem.

Given that men give more tax revenue to the governments than women do, it means that mostly men are paying for shelters that they themselves are not allowed to access. 

There is a remarkably sad story of a male domestic violence survivor who tried to set up a shelter for men, but he ran out of funding, and committed suicide: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl\_Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Silverman)

**Life satisfaction**

In most countries, [women report higher levels of life satisfaction than men](https://bigi.genderequality.info/#_data). Is it any idea why?

To conclude, men are discriminated against in courts, are not helped when they try to get therapy and end up committing suicide because of it, men die more from almost everything and yet women's health receives way more funding, men are targeted more for hate crimes, men work longer and harder to provide for women, and are responsible for less consumer spending, are drafted more than women, retire later, are more likely to be homeless, are discriminated against in homesearching, get punished more by schools and parents, are ignored when they are victims of rape and domestic violence, and have lower rates of life satisfaction.

That I am in utter and full agreement with.

&amp;#x200B;

What I do often see, not necessarily by men's right's advocates themselves is often the idea that if they hit you, you should have full moral license to hit them back as hard as you can, or even treat it like if you were punched in a bar give them a beat down for it. While a small part of me loves seeing stupid choices get rewarded appropriately, I don't necessarily agree with either of those two things in most situations. I fully agree you should have all the moral and legal right to defend yourself to whatever level is necessary. And I've done quite a bit of sparring against men and woman, I can attest first hand that the right size trained woman can hit a hell of a lot harder than many untrained men, but I still feel like the larger and much stronger partner, regardless of gender, though it's usually men for obvious reasons probably shouldn't use the opportunity to hospitalize the other person as retaliation for something that was inherently much less capable of causing them harm.

I've never been struck by a woman outside of training, though I have been threatened a couple times with violence in absolutely absurd circumstances by woman who'd probably have a higher risk of hurting themselves than me if they even tried. And as much as some woman who will use the fact that men won't retaliate as a guarantee when making threats or lashing out. The thought of hitting back with even a decent portion of what I'm capable of against someone who may have absolutely no idea I could hospitalize them with far less than I'm capable of  just doesn't sit well.

&amp;#x200B;

So in short of course I'm fully in support of whatever the level of self defense needed in the situation, but I can't agree with knowingly using the excuse of being struck to hurt someone far worse as a form of payback or retaliation. Perhaps I'm a bit hypocritical because If I'm punched by a dude 80lbs lighter than me I'm punching back with 100% and they're going to sleep or will be in the next few, but apart from them still being far more capable of hurting me than at least the majority of woman, I'm also not dating the person, and I guess that's where it's most uncomfortable, just as woman should  NEVER abuse the fact they can often get away with it to abuse their partner who is the absolute last person you should be able to be violent with. I question the man who could without hesitation strike their girlfriend or wife other than with the minimum needed to protect themselves.

Women, with some situational exceptions of course, but even then women can grow at their very own pace and even then, they have more societal autonomy about this than men ever will.

Consider the effects of a false allegation. Most false allegations will not lead to physical violence (unless friends/family act on vigilante justice), but it WILL cause long lasting damage to a person. Being falsely accused is deeply traumatizing. Being falsely accused includes a loss of self worth, self confidence, and damages a person emotionally, socially, and likely irreversibly.

French athletes have expressed disbelief over the acquittal of a coach accused of domestic violence against Olympic judo champion Margaux Pinot.

Ms Pinot **accused her partner and judo trainer** Alain Schmitt **of punching and attempting to strangle her during an altercation over the weekend.**

The Olympic gold medallist, 27, filed a complaint against Mr Schmitt.

**He was arrested but denied the allegations and was acquitted in court.**

A judge said there was **not ""enough proof of guilt""** for the prosecution to proceed when delivering his verdict in a preliminary hearing on Wednesday.

""A court is never there to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying,"" the judge said.

Shortly after the hearing, Ms Pinot tweeted a picture of her swollen face, marked by cuts and several bruises.

In one tweet, in which she alluded to her wounds and ""the blood strewn on the floor of my apartment"", she asked: ""What was missing? My death at the end, perhaps?""

""It was probably judo that saved me,"" she added in the tweet. ""And my thoughts are also with those women who can't say the same.""

Prosecutors have said they will appeal against the verdict. In court, they requested a one-year suspended prison sentence for what they described as ""very serious violence"".

In her complaint, Ms Pinot accused Mr Schmitt of assaulting her at her home in a suburb of Paris during the night of Saturday and early hours of Sunday.

She said she had escaped and taken refuge with neighbours, who called the police. Ms Pinot said she had been taken to hospital where she received treatment for several injuries, including a broken nose.

But Mr Schmitt, 38, appeared in court to deny the allegations. **He called them ""100% false"" and accused Ms Pinot of starting the fight, which he said had involved judo holds**, according to French reports.

French media said **bruises were visible on his face** as he described the incident as a fight between lovers. ""I have never hit a woman in my life, it's rubbish,"" he told the court.

His defence lawyer, Malik Behloul, disputed Ms Pinot's version of events.

**""With the strength that this man \[Mr Schmitt\] has, he is quite capable of doing a great deal more harm than that,**"" Mr Behloul argued.

Mr Schmitt was **arrested hours before he was expected to take over as head coach of the Israeli national women's judoka team.** But the Israel Judo Association told AFP news agency it had suspended all contact with Mr Schmitt following the allegations.

On Thursday afternoon, Mr Schmitt and Ms Pinot held separate news conferences to explain the circumstances of the altercation in more detail.

Mr Schmitt, who appeared to have a black eye, said he had gone for a drink before visiting Ms Pinot's home, where he intended to print documents before flying out to Israel.

The pair started arguing and Ms Pinot ""threw herself on me"", Mr Schmitt said. He described a violent struggle in which they banged into walls, a radiator and a door.

He denied punching Ms Pinot and said there had been a **""media lynching"" against him.**

But at her news conference, Ms Pinot disputed his account and accused Mr Schmitt of trying to ""make me look like a **hysterical woman""**.

Ms Pinot's lawyer, Rachid Madid, said he would seek to ""set the record straight in this case"" and gather additional information to support the appeal.

Earlier, some members of the judo community in France shared messages of support for Ms Pinot, including three-time Olympic champion Teddy Riner.

The president of the French Judo Federation, Stéphane Nomis, and female French judo star Clarisse Agbégnénou said they were shocked by the court's decision.

Ms Pinot has mostly competed in the women's 70 kg event for France. She has had a career decorated with medals, including a gold in the mixed team event at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and a bronze at the World Championships in 2019.",13.0

&gt;I married a proud Scotsman a year ago who often wears kilts. When we go out, women think nothing of coming over and lifting his kilt, which exposes him to anyone who has a visual advantage. These women scream with glee and then become physically aggressive with their hands. Frankly, I am shocked and horrified anyone would do this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why is there a double standard that women feel they can lift a man’s kilt to expose him and call it fun, yet the same women would scream sexual assault if a man lifted their skirt? Women need to understand that lifting a man’s kilt is sexual assault and should be treated as the crime it is. Now, every time a woman does it, we immediately call the police and report the crime. The perpetrators are then shocked and angry that they are being arrested for a sex crime for something they thought was innocent fun and games. Your column reaches many readers. With your help, we can help women understand that doing this is unacceptable.

&gt;“I am Scottish and because of that, I like to wear my family tartan kilt out for formal dinners. In Edinburgh I have probably worn it about 10-15 times and every single time without fail multiple women have come up to me and asked, “are you a true Scotsman?”, “Are you wearing anything underneath?”. To which I have given them a look of annoyance at which point they complained about me being no fun.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When I pointed out that what they were doing was harassment they just waved it off as being different and thereby not counting.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“On at least three occasions, women have taken it further and just gone ahead and lifted my kilt up because they wanted to “check for themselves”, to which I was very embarrassed and there was little I could do, as a man if I lay my hands on them, I will be seen as the aggressor.  
&gt;  
&gt;“No one of authority took me seriously over this and when I have spoken to other guys who I know who wear kilts the response from them was mostly just a grimace of resignation and it’s seen as something we have to put up with. It’s not something that anyone wearing a kilt should have to deal with.”

819,t3_r7602j,Roe vs. Wade and its effects on Men's Finances,"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. ^(\[1\]) Abortion is an issue which affects both men and women, and I think we need to be more concerned about the outcome of Roe v. Wade being challenged at the federal level.

Let's start by talking about the most obvious part: contraception. There may come a time when you have intercourse with a woman who is ""on the pill"" but it didn't work for some reason; according to Planned Parenthood, the most common reason why it fails is when people don't remember to take the pill. ^(\[2\]) Likewise, condoms work so long as they don't get mishandled, but NBC News published an article suggesting that people don't know how to use condoms properly. ^(\[3\]) ""Plan B"" pills have a 75% - 89% chance of providing the desired results, but results get significantly worse when women are overweight. ^(\[4\]) With this in mind, we can guess that contraceptives are subject to people understanding how to use them, and in this regard most people will be their own worst enemies. On this note, if she gets pregnant and wants to keep the child, he likely doesn't get any say in the matter.

Historically, ""...a woman's interests are unique when it comes to pregnancy. Her body and health are deeply affected by pregnancy, as is the course of her life, her ability to work, go to school and to prosper."" ^(\[5\]) In the modern age, these things are more important than ever, as a household is unlikely to be able to support itself on one income; having two incomes keeps most households together. In other words, if you live in a household which requires two incomes to stay afloat, and you have something which impedes your ability to maintain a household, this affects both men and women.

Naturally, the most obvious solution would be to choose ""abstinence"" but this doesn't account for rape, miscarriages, pregnancies which are dangerous to the mother's health, or the premise that I wouldn't be writing this post if my parents were capable of practicing what they had preached. Entertaining this premise, a brief filed by Texas Right to Life counters by declaring that ""women can control their reproductive lives without access to abortion; they can do so by refraining from sexual intercourse. The only time abortion is needed to ensure women's ability to control their reproductive lives is when a pregnancy results from non-consensual behavior as in cases of rape, or when a pregnancy endangers her life."" ^(\[5\]) Again, the ""Texas Right to Life"" is being a bit dense, if only because keeping a child parents can't afford to take care of isn't particularly productive. Also, if people were actually practicing abstinence, we wouldn't be having these discussions in the first place.

The government shouldn't have a right to tell you how to live your life, how to spend your money, etc. The government should support people making their own choices, so long as they are not infringing on the rights of other people. This issue affects men's finances and families, so men should also have a voice in this matter. Making abortions illegal means it will be more likely for women to get unsafe illegal abortions, men might become fathers when they're not economically able to support a family, and ""child support"" might be in more of our futures. If you want to see fewer ""single mothers"" in society, consider supporting Roe v. Wade.

821,t3_r74e97,Restrictions on paternity testing in New York State,"I'm mainly just venting, the restrictions are not new but I was only recently made aware of them.

Over the counter and online paternity tests are prohibited in the state of New York. In order for a man to obtain a paternity test, it must be referred by an authorized individual - either a physician, attorney, or judge. In order for the authorized individual to make such a referral, they require a valid legal or medical reason. Only paternity tests which meet the legal standard for admissibility in court are allowed, which are generally 2.5-3x more expensive than over the counter variants. This is despite even the worst quality OTC paternity tests being 99.95%+ accurate in establishing paternity. 


The kicker is that if the presumed father has not signed the birth certificate, then they are unable to provide their presumed child's consent to take the paternity test. Following from that, the mother's consent is required for the test to be performed. Even though it's just a cheek swab.


Essentially, men have no fundamental right to a paternity test in New York State. It is only made available in cases where there is a pressing legal or medical need. Even if the mother knows you're not the father, and has interests in direct competition with your own, her consent is still required unless you have already signed away your right to contest the issue of paternity. This is in contrast to every other state in the country, where you can just order it online for $100 all told and receive results roughly a week later. No courts, attorneys, consent forms, or bullshit.

I want to make a disclaimer to please read the full story before commenting, every detail is important and I really want to know if I did the right thing for myself and my son. This situation has mention of rape, incest, and false accusations, so if any of these are triggering to you, please beware. Also, this post is going to be extremely long. 

My family were good friends with another family in the town we live in. One of the daughters of this family is my little sister’s age, and they got pretty close so I knew this girl since she was young. We will call her Nicole. Nicole’s father had older sons from a previous marriage, one of these brothers I hadn’t met until I was close to this family for a couple years because he lived halfway across the country and worked the majority of the year on a boat on the ocean so he didn’t call them often either, therefore I didn’t know too much about him. We will call him John. Fast forward to 2017, when he made a surprise visit to his family and ending up deciding to stay for a while. Long story short, we met, ended up falling in love, and got married in the next year.

This is where things get sticky. For a short period of time, John and I stayed with his dad who we will call Luke, his stepmom who we’ll call Amanda, and their kids which included Nicole. Just to be clear, Nicole and John are half siblings. Nicole was 16 at this time, I was 20, and John was 23. John and I were staying in a spare bedroom until we moved into our place. During this short amount of time, things started getting weird. Nicole seemed to be really happy when John and I first got together, but that quickly changed when I started staying with them. She would be completely fine when it was just us hanging out at the house, but as soon as John would come in from work her demeanor and attitude towards me would change immediately. She would get short with me, give me the side eye often, and even make snide remarks about me under her breath or in a “joking” manner to other people. Along with this, she would be up John’s arse all the time. She was constantly all but begging him to take her on “brother-sister dates” as were her words, not mine. She even told me once that she didn’t like that I was staying there, because it was “her house” and “her brother”. At the time, I had addressed this with her mom, Amanda, and she brushed it off because he had been gone for years, and she was a teenager so emotions and hormones run high. It did hurt my feelings though, especially because our families were close long before any of this. And when John wasn’t present, Nicole and I got along fine.

This is when things get even weirder. During the time we were staying there, she started stealing my bras and underwear. I confronted her about this, and she said it just got mixed up in laundry. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, even though it kept happening, until my wedding night lingerie set went missing. I knew for a fact it didn’t get mixed up in laundry because it wasn’t something I regularly wore, and I had just seen it the day before in the back of my dresser drawer. Of course, I found it in her room. I told John about it, he seemed grossed out and disturbed and we brought it to Amanda’s attention. Again, it was brushed off. She kept saying her daughter isn’t a liar, it got mixed up in the laundry. I was frustrated and disturbed and Nicole was acting pissed that she got caught by me, but also glad her mom took her side so she didn’t get in any trouble. She continued to steal my underwear. Things got even weirder. She was constantly touching John in some way, whether it be leaning on him, sitting on his lap, having her arm on the back of his chair, hugging him and not letting go, literally any time she had the chance to put her hands on him she would, even in the smallest and most subtle ways. Then, she kept coming into our room at night and wanting to lay right in between us. Sometimes she would sit there and knock on our bedroom door on and off until midnight and both of us would get frustrated because we wanted to go to bed, we had work in the morning. Sometimes she would knock and come in with an excuse that she needed to get something, but instead would talk to John and not even acknowledge me, if she did she would be short and hateful. Sometimes she’d act like she was saying goodnight, would go to give John a hug, and then just lay her head on his chest and rub her thumb on his bicep or somewhere. It was weird. I thought it was weird, John thought it was weird, everyone thought it was weird but Nicole was very meticulous about being very subtle about acting like this in front of her mom Amanda. I brought everything to Amanda’s attention just for it to be brushed off and excused for whatever reason time and time again. John tried to talk to Nicole about it, but it seemed like the more he tried to set boundaries, the more she wanted to cross them, especially when it came to me. John also talked to Amanda and Luke both about it, and again, it was excused. One time late at night Nicole knocked on our door then immediately opened it before we had a chance to respond. John and I were having sex, as couples in the privacy of their own bedroom do, and Nicole just stood there at the door and then started talking to John like she was absolutely pissed. She said, “john, really?!?” in a hateful tone, like how dare you have sex with your wife. John was like “wtf? Why are you standing there? Get out!” She refused to leave. Keep in mind he was on top of me at this point, we’re both naked under the covers, and I’m pissed too. We’re both stuck because if we get up, Nicole is going to see us both butt naked, he keeps telling her to leave, but she refuses to. John’s sister in law was staying there that night and got pissed on our behalf (she had seen how Nicole had been acting for herself) and got Nicole to finally leave. The lock on our door was broken so the next day we went and got a new doorknob with a working lock. That night when she knocked and immediately tried to open the door before we could answer, only to find out it was locked, she got absolutely furious. She wouldn’t acknowledge me for days, and had an attitude with John. Again, we tried to address it, only for it to be excused. 

Fast forward, we finally get to move into our house. I’m pregnant at this time. Nicole is pissy with me as always, and mad that John won’t be living in their house anymore. So she became persistent in other ways. She was very demanding that she get to go on a “brother-sister date” at least twice a week, but in reality she would try to get him to hang out with her alone every single night. Sometimes he would, sometimes he wouldn’t. Then John started acting weirder and weirder. He became more distant, starting hanging out with Nicole more, and then I noticed that their entire text message thread on his phone was completely deleted. I knew they would text, she was blowing up his phone most of the time, always sending him kissy faces and hearts and things of the like, but when I saw that he didn’t have a thread for Nicole in his messages at all, my alarms bells went off some. Keep in mind, hindsight is 20/20, and these were people I loved regardless of the weirdness going on because I was close to most of them for years. And ofc I loved John, he was my husband and father of my child. So  please keep in mind that as I’m telling this story, ofc it sounds very cut and dry but when I was knee deep IN the situation, I had rose colored glasses on and wanted to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. I didn’t immediately put two and two together. Anyway, back to the story. I asked him about the lack of messages, he said he deleted them because they got into an argument and both said things they didn’t mean so he deleted it because he didn’t want to look at it. I was naive and believed him. I told Amanda about it, she brushed it off as per usual. 

Fast forward again, Nicole and John are hanging out more than ever, I voice my concerns and frustration to John, he starts brushing it off too, as if “that’s just the way Nicole is.” I start feeling like I’m crazy. They would even go hunting together alone at 4am sometimes. I was frustrated and growing weary of all this, plus had a new baby by this point, and a good heavy case of PPD, so all my focus was on my new son and trying to fight my way out of this mental &amp; hormonal battle. Due to this I stopped paying as much attention to the weirdness going on. I just couldn’t keep up with it. I was exhausted. One time we were at their brother’s house, and that day John had been particularly “lovey dovey” towards me that day. Nicole was trying to do anything she could to be the center of his attention, even as far as kicking him in the back of the knee when his back was turned to her while giving me a kiss. Later on we sat down to eat, Nicole is blowing his phone up and watching him across the room. I glanced over at the texts she was sending, and there were three in a row that went like this: 
“Fuck you”
“🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼” 
“I’m so done with you and all your fucking lies”
I pulled him aside and asked him what she is talking about. He claimed he didn’t know, that she just gets “crazy” like that sometimes. I was naive and exhausted enough to let it go, even though my alarm bells were going off, and I was so beaten down and tired of this shit, plus everything else going on. I still told Amanda about it though, she made Nicole apologize to John for being rude to him but that was the end of it, no further discussion. 

This is where things get REALLY sticky. 

It’s early 2019 now, by this time Nicole is 17. I start noticing changes in Nicole. She’s cranky a lot more than she was, she’s gained weight, she’s breaking out and wearing baggy sweats even though it’s getting warmer out. I start suspecting she’s pregnant, so do a couple other people in the family. I talked to John about it, he got worried- I brushed that off myself because yeah, if my 17 y/o sister is showing signs of pregnancy I’d be worried too. I talked to Amanda, who had surprisingly been worrying about the same thing, and she gives Nicole a pregnancy test. John and I are sitting in the living room, along with the SIL mentioned earlier. We hear Amanda from the bathroom say, “oh my god, my baby is pregnant!” Then Amanda comes out of the bathroom, comes up to John and starts saying, “how dare you!” I was confused. SIL was confused. Then Amanda starts yelling at John, “YOU RAPED MY DAUGHTER, YOU RAPED MY DAUGHTER!” She brings Nicole in, and says to her “tell him Nicole! Tell him what he did to you!” Nicole said “yes, bubba, you had sex with me.” Then everything clicked for me. I was in shock, because even through all the weirdness, I never thought that they had had sex. Amanda keeps dropping the R word. John leaves the house. Me and SIL are standing there in shock. Then I ask Nicole myself, “did he RAPE you, or did you have SEX with him?” She looked at me like a deer in the headlights. Before she can answer, Amanda tells me I need to back off, that she is a victim of rape. Nicole stays silent and just looks down. Amanda calls the cops, does all the talking to the cops and Nicole is pretty much silent the whole time, not saying anything and avoiding eye contact with me and SIL. Amanda takes Nicole to the doc, turns out she is already 5 months along. Amanda goes full force with charges against John, all while Nicole stays silent but is guilt ridden and everyone knew it. But Amanda simply would not accept anything other than rape as a cause to this pregnancy, despite everything that had been brought to her attention previously. 

Fast forward. John is arrested for rape and incest. The baby is born. I stuck around Nicole and Amanda because I loved them like family long before I ever met John, but inside I have growing anger. Still, even throughout this whole legal process, Nicole was being weird. The baby was only a couple weeks old when John had a court hearing, one that neither Amanda or Nicole needed to be at. But they went, and TOOK THE BABY. WTF. If my brother forcibly raped me and I chose to keep my baby, there is no way in hell he would ever lay eyes on it… John eventually took a plea deal and was sentenced to 25 years for second degree rape and incest. The only physical evidence held against him was the baby’s exsistemce. Everything else was Amanda’s word, not even Nicole’s herself. Nicole had to write a statement but never mentioned force, resistance, anything like that. It basically consisted of where they would go to have sex. 

I start hearing people talk around town about how they would act even publicly when I wasn’t around. There is security footage of Nicole rubbing her ass all over John’s dick in the local convenient store. People around town have told me that when they saw Nicole and John together they acted like they were in love and some even assumed they were a couple. My anger towards both of them grow, but especially towards Nicole because regardless of the fact that I’m hurt and betrayed by John, rape is not something to lie about or to falsely accuse somebody of. Rape isn’t taken lightly in prison. I couldn’t make myself believe that she was held down and forcibly raped because of all the other evidence that tells me it was something more along the lines of a “relationship” between them. I couldn’t contain my anger any longer, so I completely cut ties with everyone. Nicole, Amanda, the entire family. By this point my divorce from John was finalized and I hadn’t spoken to him in months. I couldn’t help them live out this lie any longer, and I was extremely hurt and betrayed and I knew for a fact I couldn’t speak to any of them about this on a realistic honest level. They started wearing this situation like a proud badge of honor. They soaked up all the attention and pity that came with it. They parade the baby around, even though the baby has severe medical issues- won’t ever talk or walk, etc. because of a rare genetic disorder that comes from incest. And they make me out to be a horrible person for not sticking around them any longer. 

Ever since I cut ties with them, Nicole has been stalkerish towards me. She will drive by my house often and smile and wave in a smartass demeanor, she will stop at the stop sign in front of my work and just sit there for 20+ seconds, and do that 4-5 times within a 20 minute block of time. Amanda does similar things too, but also is constantly trying to contact me to try to change my mind and acts like everything that happened prior to finding out Nicole was pregnant is irrelevant. I’m sick and tired of being made out to be a completely rotten person when the whole story isn’t being told, and since I don’t go out of my way to try to tell people what really happened because I don’t feel the need to convince anyone. 

So please, tell me. Am I the asshole for cutting ties and not believing the R story?",35.0

So, in English. Machismo means ""strong sense of masculine pride"". First result on google, and from my experience I haven't seen it used in any other way. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

But in Portuguese... Machismo (different pronunciation btw) means ""a behaviour expressed by opinions or attitude from an individual who refuses to accept equality of rights and duties, favouring and praising men over women.""

Now, some of you might be asking, ""damn, that's bs, but what made you talk about this now?""

And I'll answer that question!! Very recently saw a post on instagram (random meme account reposting a tweet) that said ""the female urge to not believe a damn thing that a man says""

I didn't think much of it at first, until I realised that the account itself had added a comment in support of it... So I looked down again. **Every single goddamn comment** was praising what had been said. Including men. Reading them genuinely made me feel sick. I really can't understand how this behaviour is still being romanticised by most people online. I digress.

I can no longer take anyone who calls themselves a feminist seriously. Realise that the name has been tainted if you really know what you're talking about and simply start a new movement. It's a punctured tyre that's never getting patched up. 

Extra (and final, I promise) note: The definition of feminism directly contradicts itself. You can't be ""for equality"" and then always assume that the victim is always female and the perpetrator is always male. That's just... wow

I was just watching the episode where Castle is seeing his daughter Alexis off to college and it dawned on me something I had never consciously realised about why I like this show so much.

Although Castle is shown as an over grown man child, he is a really good man. But most importantly it is shown through the series how good a father he is. It’s something that is rare in modern television series.

But not only that, earlier in the episode Alexis got really upset after Castle announced his relationship with his long time partner. He thought Alexis was worried that he was replacing her, however she admits she’s upset that her mother wasn’t there to see off her at College, and she is never really there for these events in her life. However she could always rely on her Dad to be there.

Honestly, I have never seen anything like that in TV before. It’s so weird how heavily that realisation hit me.",44.0

861,t3_r6bvok,Need to get this warped perception fixed: vasectomies are NOT used for birth control. Despite what many media sources portray.,"I’ve seen this sentiment countless times from anecdotal encounters to the media. From personal in person discussions to comments on reddit (particularly more radical feminist circles) to fictional media to news outlets and debates I keep seeing this incredibly *wrong* notion that vasectomies are akin to IUDs (intra-uterine device) used in women for birth control. In terms of preventing unwanted pregnancies they can be seen to both be highly effective with &gt;99% efficiency. HOWEVER, there is this incredibly *wrong* picture that a vasectomy is easily reversible in the same way removing an IUD restarts regular ovulation cycles. Per NHS data in the UK and references therein: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/vasectomy-reversal-nhs/

Vasectomies are not *easily* reversible. Already after 3 years, there is a ~25% chance you will never have a child after getting the procedure done. After this the chance only decays further. Perhaps to some this is an acceptable risk but I think for the majority of men (particularly those not yet fathers) this an unacceptably high risk. For this reason vasectomies should *not* be viewed as a form of birth *control* and only as a semi-reversible form of induced sterilisation. They are for fathers who know they don’t want any more children or men that are positive they never want them. Not as a male form of contraceptive, period.

This is sort of an off my chest because in many instances if seen posts on feminist subreddits or r/relationships where men and women alike treat it this way. It needs to stop.

Edit: for the semantics, I mean non permanent, casual, birth control. Couple comments saying that since it’s sterilisation it is technically in the definition of birth control which is true. Though personally I’m not keen on this definition philosophically because control implies you have control over birthing and not birthing, you can control becoming sterilised but not the other way around (since there’s a *relatively* large chance it can’t be undone). You effectively lose control when this happens, so getting one (especially when your older) is to relinquish control. Same goes for tying the Fallopian tubes. But yeah it’s technically permanent birth control if that’s the definition.",252.0

Men are constantly told finding a girlfriend is so important, and it seems to me that homosexual women are much less afraid to come out then men. Partially because getting girls is such a huge part of life to men, I’d say (not all) but a lot of straight guys have a harder time seeing a gay guy as one of the guys then for women to see lesbians as one of the girls. (Even if the gay guy doesn’t act in a stereotypical manner.

A lot of anonymous forms for gay men are full of ones who still say they will never tell anyone. I’ve also met several men who only tell other gay people and strictly keep it a secret otherwise.Yet I can’t keep track of how many girls I’ve known came out. There also the fact that people seem to have a harder time believing that a man can be bisexual, I’ve met men AND women who enjoy sex with men AND women. I’ve also met men and women who just had a phase where they claimed they’re bi.

There’s also the fact of representation, thetons  of current kids cartoons have a prevalent lesbian character. Some background characters are gay men and there’s some instances where it’s acknowledged once but nothing comes of it.a few of these shows have a lesbian main couple but there’s only one kids show I can think of with a male on male couple in the main cast. Homosexual women still have the struggle of a few homophobic people and having to tell there families but I’d still say societies less accepting of gay men.

This isn't because we are changing the opinions of the people that attack our sub, it's because from an outside perspective people see us and extreme feminists as hate groups, but when they come here or see our page posted elsewhere and they see that the feminists that attack us resort to insults and personal attacks but we don't and remain civil it improves their opinion and image of us, it shows them that we are serious about what we believe in and that we should be taken seriously and not thought of as a hate group.

Paralegals can legally prepare divorce forms for you, and they can tell you where those forms need to be filed. Paralegals can also tell you how to serve divorce forms to your spouse, and help you fill out state-specific forms for modifying child support or alimony.

Things Paralegals can’t do

Paralegals can’t give you legal advice. They also can’t go to court and advocate for you the same way a divorce attorney will. If you are experiencing a fairly simple, uncontested divorce, you can save money by using a paralegal instead of a divorce attorney.

If your divorce is highly conflicted, with issues such as a custody battle or large assets to split, a paralegal is not something you want to consider. Their knowledge of court procedure and state divorce laws are limited, which makes them less valuable in a high conflict situation.

How to Find a Paralegal

As with a divorce attorney, you should not contract with a paralegal without first doing research into their background. Check with your Better Business Bureau for any complaints, and ask prospective paralegals about their experience and education. Making sure your paralegal is qualified is imperative when using one in place of a divorce attorney.",13.0

Like you would never see a broke man who works at McDonalds dating a supermodel (Unless it’s in a movie lol). So both genders are judged for something more than the other. And also why the hell is it called the “beauty standard”? Isn’t that just another word for pretty. Like isn’t the whole idea of a man asking out a woman is that a man looks at a woman that he finds attractive then goes up to her to talk to her. Why would a man approach a woman he doesn’t find attractive. “Conventionally attractive” is also another term that irks me. And you never ever see a pretty woman complain about how bad the beauty standard is or whatever. Also women claim the beauty standard was created by men. But what’s funny is that they say they don’t try to look pretty for men while simultaneously trying to fit into this so called beauty standard that was apparently created by men. And they use this as a reason to not pay for dates. They say that since they spent so much time and money to look pretty for the date we should pay. Like I am totally fine with paying and so are many other men, but stop trying to fight the “patriarchy” and benefit from it at the same time lol.

903,t3_r57ae7,Retraction by the APA of their harmful traditional masculinity guidelines,"Back in 2019 the APA published guildelines on how to deal with men and masculinity. These guidelines were pretty much in line with the feminist narrative on toxic masculinity which overemphasizes feminine behavior as a solution for all of men's problems and emphasizes masculine behavior as their cause.

The APA didn't go as far as use the term ""Toxic Masculinity"" choosing instead an easier to defend ""harmful traditional masculinity"". However, the sources they provided did not support the claims made  in their guidelines, it was ultimately recognize that their guidelines were scientifically unfounded and they issue a retraction (that they hid in some corner of the internet).

The only reason I know of this is because of a youtube video from a psychologist (or psychiatrist) I watched over a year ago. I can no longer find the youtube video and I cannot find any evidence of the retraction either.

I didn't do 100% due diligence when I watched the youtube video. So it is technically possible that the retraction was fake news. But I doubt it.

Does anyone know where to find the retraction or youtube video I'm talking about?

I think that archiving this information is extremely important because it represents two things:

1. Evidence that the APA was full of shit so anyone in Academia still trying to use it as evidence of ""toxic masculinity"" should be embarrassed into oblivion.
2. Evidence of the anti-male activism in influential institutions.

And recently women have been complaining a lot about this. So to all my Marvel fans reading this, isn’t the whole point of superheroes to look big and muscular. Like you wouldn’t read the comics or watch the movies if every man like looked like Steve Rogers before the super soldier serum lol. And neither would women. And same goes for the female superheroes. Like we want to see attractive women on screen. That doesn’t mean we objectify women. And these days a lot of women are saying stuff like Black Widow was too sexualized. Like I admit Scarlett Johansson has faced a lot of sexism but the reason she was casted is to appeal to the male audience. It’s the same with Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth but they were casted to appeal to the female audience. Now when you mention this they say that the scenes of Thor and Captain America showing muscles are male gaze like what? That’s bullshit. 90% of the female viewers wouldn’t watch marvel if it weren’t for those scenes. And these characters have been drawn this way since the comics. And the women still go on to say stuff like oh but that’s for the male gaze because it represents power and blah blah blah. Like of course the comics were drawn to cater to men because 50 years ago literally no woman read superhero comics. Now I’ve literally heard women say “Omg I don’t know anything about this superhero bullshit but Chris Evans is so hot”. But on the internet they will lie and tell you that they are only attracted to “feminine” male characters like Loki. And if a man dare say he finds Scarlett Johansson hot, he will be crucified.

911,t3_r4z30n,Wikipedia's page on Gender inequality in Thailand : Mention opportunities for women in military but not the two years male only conscription,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_inequality\_in\_Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality_in_Thailand)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Thailand has always offered military roles to Thai women, some 54.55% of women represent the National Human Right Commission and 10% of the National Reconciliation Commission. Thai women have been empowered to serve in the military, assigned roles as negotiators, mediators, and facilitators, as well as involvement in security operations. However, they still remain excluded from playing active roles in armed conflict.  

In Thailand, men's can be conscripted from 6 months to 2 years, depending on educational attainments: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal\_Thai\_Armed\_Forces#Conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Thai_Armed_Forces#Conscription)",64.0
912,t3_r4xdlq,"An apology: I'm sorry, members of men's rights. As a man, for years I have been ignoring you, I internalized the feminist depiction - ""wife bitters"", we all have, and what you were pointing to kept growing, until it reached almost all of us, now we understand. I'm so sorry.","I feel that I owe the founders and members of such forums as this one an apology. I am 44, married. The first time I realized that there are some men protesting men's condition, was through a bus window. I must have been in my early twenties and saw a graffiti, ""rights for men in family courts"", bad handwriting, not even a proper sign - black spray. It was somewhat alarming to watch, I imagined a poor family and an illiterate man frustrated of everything, not knowing how to deal with reality and bureaucracy and spilling it hopelessly on the walls of a central bus station. The handwriting had the urgency that creates a sense of tragedy, but of the kind occurring to hopeless lives, that we all imagine boiling around us in prisons and mental hospitals and make us sorry but absolutely sure it's none of our business - it's ""the system's"". I would see these graffiti every few months or years and it was just added to the overall sadness that industrial zones and train stations lay on you. Then at some point, in my thirties, now married, through a conversation with my wife about something related to women, she mentioned there were men who object feminist actions, and this was the first time I realized there's a ""category"" for this, that it's not just random graffiti. I asked her, ""what do they want?"" and she said, ""You don't want to know. They are murderers who killed women"". I was horrified. I didn't know how to understand this, I imagined convicts who try to organize behind bars to justify their crimes instead of admitting their brutality and serve their time, I was scared by the concept and this shaped my attitude for the coming years.

I have no idea where my wife got to know about such men's groups activities, she is extremely empathic to women and to women's issues but by no means an ideological feminist, she doesn't even call herself a feminist (or anything in particular regarding women). Years past, and about seven  years ago I started from time to time to see in newspapers men discussing ""men's issues"". This was baffling. Most of all, I was repulsed. This has insulted first and foremost my male confidence and male dignity - if you are a man, then just deal with your problems instead of complaining. The very notion of men writing this way was humiliating to read. As if so powerless that their only way to reach what they need is begging society to acknowledge their ""problems"". What ""problems""? My problems as a man were not getting laid for half a year or being turned down by a girl I fell in love with - not prostate cancer, custody and sperm deceptions - how is that considered men's issues? I'm a man, if you want to talk about my issues as a man then great - let's talk about girls throwing you to the rain after having an orgasm alone on you, this is what I had in life, what these columnists were writing about was definitely not the issues I'm having! I felt that it's hypocritical - that men don't really have any issues as men, only as humans, and that this is an attempt to compete with women in a weakness and vulnerability contest. Very unmanly. And I had no idea this could be somehow related to those graffiti by ex-convicts and murderers.

I did watch the Red Pill, but I was preoccupied with responding to what men were saying there. I had no argument with how feminists were depicted  - since I was  20 I had this feeling that some feminists are not being honest about what drives them and are in fact motivated by violent urges, and the film confirmed what I already knew, but as for the men, except for some very disturbing descriptions of family court decisions, suicides, and a rape case by a woman of a disabled guy that shocked me, again I felt it is not me they are talking about. But then came me too.

In me too I was lynched personally, for simply criticizing me too as going too far. Following the lynch I was harassed at work by feminists. I had to leave that place. I was estranged by women who I thought were my friends, and turned out to be ideological feminists. I was banned. Work that I worked 20 years to reach was discontinued. I read violent hate speech in newspapers and when I expected a response - as done whenever hate speech and violence appear - it never came. As if some things occurring around me, can never be criticized no matter how deeply they violate the principles of society. Murder included. Me too made something become clear - men can be attacked, discriminated against, hurt, even murdered by women, but no one will report it or talk about it. Which made me ask - so it's not that abuse and discrimination of men doesn't exist, it's just never reported and monitored so nobody knows about it? I never questioned the data about women being hurt by men - but women are discussed and hurting them is objected. Could it be that just like there are women hurt and abused by men, there is also such a male group hurt by women, only this group in not allowed to receive the  same treatment - reporting it, educating, and this is why I don't know about them?

I started digging. I was amazed at what I found. Every statistic I knew about women turned out to be exaggerated compared to the studies, sometimes 20-fold (like ""one in 5, 4 , 3"", in fact 1.7% were raped according to studies), and the equivalent data on men downplayed or literally suppressed. The data showed clearly that in each sex there's a group hurt violently by the other sex, but that these groups are about the same size in each sex, and that the prevalence of perpetrators is the same in both sexes, and it started to look like feminism and a society driven by it, have been taking two steps - describing the minority of women hurt by men as all women, and hiding the more or less equally-sized minority in men hurt similarly by women, so a picture of ""one abusive sex"", ""one abused sex"" was formed (and used to perpetuate the downplaying and overplaying, causing society to be trapped in a loop of self-reinforcing ignorance - confirmation bias at its worst feeding itself endlessly to the level of replacing reality with a falsehood). It suddenly struck me that what I'm seeing in me too - battering men, but then no response appears - is not at all new, it seems that me too only amplified it and made it more explicit, and only then I started asking myself, what actually happened to that guy who sprayed a graffiti at a central bus station, was he the illiterate, ex-convict, women-killer spilling madness on a wall, or, me? A person who was wronged but found out there will be no place on earth that will allow him to say what happened to him? Because there is some force, apparently powerful, that prevents anything related to one half of humanity being sometimes hurt by members of the other half, being said, known, responded on, corrected.  Until with nothing else to do and no one to say it to he sprays it on a wall. Perhaps those articles in newspapers on ""men's issues"", weren't saying anything I could relate to, because, they weren't allowed to? Because in order to say at least something, they had to approach it with care, not to upset a censor?

Then finally I had to ask myself: if this had been going on for years, men being hurt or discriminated just like women, why couldn't I see it. Why couldn't I try to listen. Why, am I, so blind. And this was my answer: because it was difficult for me to identify with other men. I couldn't listen because they were all men. and I understood I'm not special - no one listens to them. Until one is hurt directly by what they are trying to point to - then, he understands. And comes here. As I came. I think that in such forums, you will find almost only those who were hurt personally. And here is my apology: for years, maybe decades, you have been trying to explain to society what had been done to you and about powers in motion that create in our society injury and injustice. We including myself ignored you. Despised you. Blamed you. Until what you were trying to point to reached such proportions that it exploded as a hate movement affecting millions more - now that we are hurt ourselves we come to you for advice and sympathy. Now we understand. I am so sorry for how we treated you and abandoned you. They say men don't cry enough? Well, I'm crying now.",568.0

918,t3_r4s7g9,Men's rights Censorship by social media,"There has been several forms of censorship enforced men's rights and larger manosphere content online. There has been de-platforming, banning content, arbitrarily flagging of content as hate speech, shadow banning content and comments, de-monetization and monetisation of man hating  groups ( YouTube Originals). This is not indicative of free market platform business.

In my view, Section 230 needs to be amended. Section 230 protects social media platforms from any liability for their user's posts. Mostly because platforms are free market place and the users are personally responsible for their actions. 

Social media needs to either act as a platform with no responsibility and no editorial rights OR act as classic media with editorial rights and take full responsibility for everything being published. 

They shouldn't be picking and choosing their obligations as a free market platform, whatsoever. Social media is currently the public square of this age. Currently, social media wants to control the narrative by which they are not a free for all public forum and their protection under section 230 should be revoked, in my opinion.


Edit(After 9days): 
There are several comments claiming platforms are private businesses and they can do what they want. This is for more understanding.

Giving free access to all ideas is the VALUE PROPOSITION of Platform business model, for the users. And platforms don't make money directly from users(Private Individual's account), mostly. 
Having access to a very high volume audience for advertisement is the VALUE PROPOSITION for the Customer (Companies selling products). And that's where they make the money. Hence, if Platforms don't censor the content it will not affect their Revenue stream and their business.",640.0

I receive SSI , when I was working child support still garnish 538 from my SSI and if I am working they are taking out 200 a month including the SSI they take monthly. 

Now I frankly don't care about the money even if it is make me broke but it's the time I want with my daughter. When I try to speak to my daughter it's too much of a distraction and I know she feels uncomfortable due to everyone around her. If that's not the case she either in her grandma house where everyone is loud and still can't talk to her due to her eating, or she went to bed. Don't matter what time of the day there is a barrier to speak with her..

During the start of COVID surge in the states I had my daughter  for the summer we bonded and as any kid she acted out when she left my presence. I asked for her for the summer of 21 she was upset due to my daughter getting back home due to the surge. States where going in locked down. So In Ohio I did not have a workers pass to leave the state due to medical reasons. So I explained to her mom she have to leave PA due to the lockdown it was a 4 hour drive. It was a big deal for her. 

Well this summer she was in Pa with her mom and her mom's ex fiance. 
I was not aware she was in PA, nor did I not mind but I could have drove four hours to get my daughter but she refused. So during the summer it was difficult to speak to her, like any other day. My ex girlfriend during the summer text me and told me her fiance at the time just got hit my a car. My first comment to her was ""you text me about a man I don't know and don't care about but can text me or call me back so I can speak to my daughter?"" Her response was fuck you. I left it alone afterwards. 

Now she from the start want to aborted my child, I ask her to keep her! I made a promise to care for her and raise her! She did not want her from the start. She kept her, once she went back to work I took care of my daughter full time. I taught her how to walk, speak, play, and understand complex words and know what they are! She caught on everything I showed her very fast. She was with me 24 hrs a day...
 Now she basically lives where her grandma Monday to Friday in another part of town while her mother travels both ways everyday passing her house so she can go home and rest. So my daughter can not spend time with her own mom but the Grandma.... I have the time to take care of her I can raise her. But what's the point of paying child support to the mother I could give it to the Grandma instead.
Or give me my child? I will happily take her and not ask for support. I just want to continue to do my job as a father and a promise to her as I fought for her not to be aborted.  How can I use this information when we go to our first trial I was waiting for 2 years already? What is your opinion or output about this situation. I can't afford a lawyer  and we go to court on Jan .5. thanks for everyone response ahead of time.",25.0

Mass generalization of men is almost encouraged or seen as ok, and it just grinds my gears a bit. Saying men ""only care about sex"" will not get you labeled as a sexist, won't get you labeled as a celibate. I read a post recently where a man was rightfully complaining about a woman bailing on him on a date. He said she went to the bathroom... and never came back and blocked him on everything. 

The majority of all responses was ""she was scared and you are evil"". They took his post history which had pornography on it and used it to shame him, only creeps look at porn! unless... uhhh its a woman who is watching it that is fine, shes a queen and do not dare shame her. 

In real life one time, a group of guys I knew were going to a party and had a girl with them, I wanted to go, as I've never been allowed to go to a party before, and this girl said ""no, I don't want him coming with us!"" she ordered the men to not allow me to go, she has a vagina, and therefore is commanding all the men. She told them I'm ""creepy looking"" and so on, the funny thing is women will read this and say ""oh yeah creepy looking?! that means YOU ARE CREEPY!"" when it is just an observation of my appearance literally, judging me 100% on my looks. 

They told me I couldn't come because ""I'm scaring the girls away!"" so they took her and the next day detectives were looking for them all. 

Why? 

They raped her. 

If I was there I wouldn't have allowed that to happen, in fact, id of called the police myself to not allow such a thing to occur. Yet, she persisted that since I was ugly, I am a creep. 

All these men now as we were all underage at the time and sex crimes aren't dealt with harshly enough are adults and free, they have girlfriends, still have random hookups that I hear about, and everything else. 

If I even mention how I notice these monsters get sex and I'm not allowed, the women of reddit will say that ME thinking about sex is a turn-off. That women HATE sex. I'll inquire about this, curious as to why they have random hookups if sex is hated... they will say ""no no... we just hate sex with YOU!"" as if they are keeping sex from me lol, and even saying if a man gets to have sex, he must be better than me at a fundamental level. 

Although pedophiles on to catch a predator were like... married half the time! Had kids! So this theory of theirs is saying that these disgusting people are somehow better than me or just able to lie and manipulate women so much that they ""trick them"" into giving sex out. 

Male sexuality is demonized left and right, if a man posts about wanting girls on reddit or wanting sex and is frequent on porn subs posting images of his cock, women call him gross, and desperate. 

If a woman does it, posting images of her playing with herself, shes allowed, shes a goddess and cant be shamed. 

Me wanting a relationship with a woman that includes sex is seen as sick and evil. I don't want a dead bedroom guys... is that bad? The women tell me, yes. Because it means I want sex. 

Women call me creepy, sick, gross, ugly, I'm an easy target. I am all alone and have no friends or family. I am alone on all holidays and nobody texts or calls me. Nobody cares about me. 

So.. you can attack me, harass me, shame me. Im so ugly and disfigured looking that everyone just thinks its hilarious. But they are projecting how they feel about men in general on to me. 

I believe they hate men so much that they see me as an easy target to throw all these generalizations they have and hate they have on me knowing I cant do anything about it. I am not hot enough for them to care about me as a human. I am not rich enough or powerful enough for them to have consequences over it. I am not clever enough to destroy them in an argument. So, they bully me about it. 

If you ask ""do most men enjoy sex with women?"" everyone will be like ""well duh!"" but if you ask ""what about women? Do women enjoy sex?"" you get met with the oddest shame and criticism that is possible, ""well all women are unique and different and even questioning this is sexist and shame on you and..."" it goes on and on. Generalizing men is ok, even attempting at all to generalize women even at a purely reasonable level is just... shamed.",169.0

I believe my Artistry is the vessel that will bring Men’s Issues into mainstream conversation.

I saw a post recently about someone organizing a Men’s March. Please do not be offended, I 100% respect you and am not trying to be mean at all, but I don’t think that’s going to work. I don’t think we can copy and paste the tactics of other groups because we are unique in that we’re not allowed to show weakness. Society won’t take typical tactics seriously because they’ll view them as a display of vulnerability.

It’s wrong and sexist but we’ll have to “Do it like Men”. We need our own playbook.

The only way I’ve seen men effectively call women/society out on their B.S. and address male specific problems is through Art. Stand-Up Comedy and Music, pretty much.

It’s because you can display weakness but still do it from a position of strength because you’re making good art about it.

I am a Hip-Hop Artist who talks about Men’s Issues on a deeper level than everyone else. My music is less polished than famous artists because I have to do everything by myself AND have a day job, but my artistry is on point and I have infinite talent.

We just had International Men’s Day. A lot of people posted here calling out Google for not having a celebratory homepage. I didn’t see it mentioned anywhere else on the Internet.

Imagine if by this time next year I have 100,000 followers on Instagram and I make a post asking why Google didn’t make one. Imagine I talk about it in an interview. 2 Years from now I have 500,000 Followers, Etc. Etc. Imagine I reach that level and beyond and I’m using my platform to shed light on these hypocrisies. It would gain actual attention from press, politicians, the public, etc.

I’m not claiming to be some Messiah that can fix all of your problems. I’m not promising I can transform society and change everybody’s mind (Because I Can’t)

What I AM promising is to talk about male issues in my music, interviews, etc. and try to drag them into the Overton Window so that they are discussed more publicly and regularly.

Please give me that opportunity and honor. Please Support me by streaming my music and following me on Social Media.

if you can, give me as much statistics, data, reasearch, studies, and things like that, that are international (world wide true) that we can use to our project, and give us the sources u will help us push this cause

give us some unknowed-to the public- issues, and again, SOURCES.",26.0

A girl poisoned 17 people by mistake (she ""just"" wanted to kill the husband to be) to escape arranged marriage. Yes, arranged marriage is bad but people are defending the girl despite the fact that she killed 17 innocent people (INCLUDING CHILDREN) and the fact that her would be husband was in the same situation as her...so he was also a victim of the arranged marriage. 
Just don't go there if you aren't mentally stable right now because it's one of those ""log off from the internet moments"".

P.S. - there's more people involved and the girl wasn't a child. Here's the story in the news:

941,t3_r405bb,So a weird thing happened,"I, 45M was down by the seaside/beach. It was a cloudy but warm day and the tide was high.

Kids were jumping off a small pier. It looked awesome, they were having the time of their lives.

Up to 30 would walk out at at time in different groups and leap or backflip off and float 150ft in to the beach.  I took a photo of the pier from the beach.

My father in law a couple of days ago had said 'they're not allowed to do that, its illegal'

I walked out the pier looking for signs banning jumping from the pier of which there were none. At the end of the pier there were tiny signs (5 inches) saying no diving - makes sense, so you don't break you neck.

I got my camera out to take some photos of the scene and maybe grab a cool pic of them jumping.

Being quite a drop there were no little kids they were all 12+, boys/girls and some young men, maybe older brothers.

I watched for a few minutes (&lt;5), and a group of older kids moved away from me to the other side of the pier. I had my phone out but hadn't taken any photos and hadn't directed my phone towards anyone, did not look directly at anyone and mainly watched people jump and plunge into the water. At this stage I already thought I wouldn't/shouldn't take any photos as I wondered if these kids thought I might be filming/taking photos of them to tell rangers/police about what others think is not permitted.

I started walking slowly back to shore and a teenage boy says 'hey mate have you got kids here?' I said, 'no why is that?'  Now I was worried that they thought I was taking pictures of kids.

He ran off. I stopped at the bottom of the pier to have another look around and three of the bigger boys (1 man I guess) surrounded me, one directly approaching with his camera into my face, the biggest blocked my exit from the pier and said ""you're not going anywhere till the police arrive"".

2 of them were visibly trembling with anger (?fear) I asked what was up and said I was just enjoying seeing people have fun since not much is allowed these days. They said 'bullshit, you were taking photos of kids and girls' 'he doesn't even have any kids here' I calmly said I wasn't and thought it was great that they could still jump the pier.

'Show us your phone' Obviously I was under no obligation too, but I also had nothing to hide, so showed them that there were no photos. I hoped this would be enough to diffuse if I remained calm and didn't argue or run off.

'Go to the recently deleted!' one of them yells (not that i'd had time to delete nor do I even know where that folder is, but *they* did). Nothing there obviously. Note that they had obviously watched me this whole time and I hadn't even been on my phone let alone been able to delete.

'Where's ya hidden folder then?!"" I just told them that I didn't even know there was one or how to do it...

They find the empty hidden folder, I told them that I honestly was just enjoying the scene and am sorry it made them uncomfortable. I'd seriously not even looked at the girls, just marvelled at one teenage boy do a backflip into the ocean. I had no sunglasses or hat so couldn't hide my gaze or line of vision. It was just bizarre. But they were obviously affronted by me, and I was scared shitless of them!

Thankfully they backed off, and actually shook my hand and apologised 'But you can see where we're coming from right? (I guess an overweight middle aged man can't enjoy the seaside..... They weren't to know that I'm also married with children and had a respected job)

But what if they hadn't backed off? What if I'd reacted differently? and they'd attacked me, or held me until police arrive - that would be great trying to explain to passers by and wife/family.

Is reality so warped now that people feel it is there right or obligation to confront strangers about perceived indiscretions with threats of violence and/or police?  While I can see it from their point of view, is it not my right to enjoy the seaside as a man or anyone and take some scenic photos without being accused of being a paedophile and nearly being subject to a citizens arrest and police involvement. What would have happened if I hadn't cooperated or argued back - been assaulted/detained for committing no crime?

Are these kids also so indoctrinated of their own rights and need for consent for anything that they will react aggressively to perceived threats - if i'd resisted and they'd assaulted me they would have been the ones in trouble. I'm sounding like and old man....

TL:DR Enjoyed watching people jumping off a pier, had my phone out and was accused of taking photos of young girls, nearly detained/beaten up/had the police called on me.",166.0

A lot of the comments are basically laughing at her misfortune. 

I don't find any of them funny. I still think that the majority of people find men's suffering a more palatable target for humour, but this post tells me that it is also popular on reddit at least to make women's suffering into humour.

I don't tend to find jokes about people getting hurt funny so I find it upsetting when people make them.",20.0
