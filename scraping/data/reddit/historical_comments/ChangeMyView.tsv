8z55c	No one espouses "trickle down", the term was coined as a dig at Hoover's engineering degree. The joke being that he knows that water trickles down but he doesn't realize that money trickles up. The whole thing has been a dig for a century and doesn't really have theoretical defense since it is a straw man position designed and intended to be easily attacked.  The big issues with taxes is that very often they do things that they aren't intended to do. Corporate taxes are a poster child for tax incidence. What is tax incidence? Well, it's who *really* ends up paying the tax. But, I hear you say, corporations pay the tax, they send in the check. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter who mails in the check it only matters who is out money. In the case of corporate taxes it is the consumer who is made to take the first bite of the shit sandwich. Companies who can get away with raising prices to account for the higher tax do so, yeah the company writes the check but it is the guy buying the stuff who is paying. If they can only raise prices so much or they are selling luxury goods and walk away if the price rises at all they turn around and make employees eat it. Sometimes it's obvious, like pay cuts or layoff, but it's usually something far more subtle like shifting to less expensive benefits or not hiring replacements when someone retires or quits. While companies usually have the power in these situations they don't have all the power, particularly when workers are highly skilled, hard to replace, or well organized. Then, and only then, do the shareholders have to eat what remains. Fifty years ago it was the Bloombergs of the world, but now an increasing proportion of that is workers again since the shift from pensions to 401(K) and other defined contribution schemes workers own ever larger proportions of publicly traded companies, which means that they're getting hosed twice.  That "getting hosed twice" issue is why Capital Gains Taxes are a thing. Capital Gains are Income. I would like to see them taxed as Income. But, as long as Corporate taxes are a thing you have the money being taxed as profit for the company and then immediately taxed a second time as income for the shareholder. They argued that this was unfair, and set up a lower rate for capital gains. I would love to see Corporate Taxes done away with altogether and Capital Gains taxes as income. Not only would that only hit the Bloombergs (and also people with non-tax advantaged retirement savings), but corporate taxes are riddled with loopholes and accounting conventions and all sorts of ways to cheat that simply don't exist in income taxes. You'd be taxing the same money at a higher rate with fewer loopholes. I see that as an unqualified win in the way that adding entirely new taxes wouldn't necessarily be.  I would love to see things streamlined. A VAT with the express purpose of raising money. VATs have a history of working well as designed and not changing behavior much. Luxury taxes or a tax intended to punish the rich for buying expensive toys or to keep people from buying things damaging to their health, never raise nearly enough money. The rich simply go and buy from overseas, which utterly destroyed the American yacht industry in the early 1990's. Ironically, it was Bush Senior who pushed for and passed it, but it is an object lesson that it would be good of us to not forget. The poor will simply turn to tax evasion to get their tax-stickerless cigarettes, which only feeds organized crime  and cut into the revenue such schemes always claim but never deliver on.  An additional Land Value Tax, something that taxes the land a house is built on but not the house itself, would go a long way to taxing the rich. Let's face it, rural land isn't worth much. Individual lots in suburban neighborhoods only have value if they're hooked up to municipal water and power. It's the people who have large holdings of urban land or massive estates that would end up paying most of this. That's a fair proxy for wealthy people, and would miss the poor completely. Because it's not a traditional property tax (which taxes the value of the house as well and the land) it would have a much smaller impact on farmers and retirees who own their own homes.  Wealth taxes, where you just take X% of the money of rich people, would never generate long term wealth the same way as making them recognize all income as income and taxing the land they aren't using effectively. If you look at European examples of "let's just tax rich people" or "let's just tax the stock market" you see a long history of failure. Those are very poorly defined ideas that are basically impossible to implement in a functional way.  If you want to improve social programs there's a simple way to do it. De-silo them. Instead of giving people tokens that can only be used on food and vouchers that can only be used on rent and a charge account that can only be used on health care, just give them straight cash. People are, generally speaking, smart. Given the information and raw cash they can more accurately allocate the aid given to them to match their needs than Congressmen who have never been poor, or are trying to give them what a hypothetical average person might need instead of what they need. You need far less fraud investigations, oversight, and bureaucracy this way. Because you don't care if this dollar is going to food or housing you don't need to arbitrarily enforce rules about what they "should" be spending money on. The needless pearl-clutching about how people on public assistance spend their money only bogs down everything and siphons billions of dollars already earmarked to addressing these issues into needless tail chasing. To be sure, we do need *some* enforcement and having good quality workers running a good quality infrastructure to ensure that no one is slipping through cracks or gaming the system unjustly, but we can cut the bullshit about people pouring out bottled water to convert food stamps into rent money at a rate of five cents on the dollar.  Moreover, I *like* the idea that there is an alternative to the government when it comes to doing big projects. I don't like that it's a handful of rich folk who can do things or not on a whim, but I hate the idea that there would be only one possible way to address climate change or the risks posed by polio or whatever. Whenever there is only one individual or group who has complete control over something then they have outsized power. I don't like the idea of giving the government unlimited power over anything that costs more than a couple of middle class family pooling their rainy day funds could manage. Ideally we would have a bunch of nonprofits and community groups that exist for pooling large sums of wealth to do amazing thing to better reality for everyone. Rich folks are already an alternative already in place, largely by tradition and accident, so I don't want to destroy them and default to giving politicians complete and unquestioned dominion over everything yet, I want to see more pools of wealth that are more responsive to the needs and desires of people generally.  It's a shame that the corporate structure has collapsed onto just the one default form. Having more employee owned (like Publix Supermarkets), customer owned (like REI), depositor owned (like credit unions), or dedicated to a purpose corporation would be wonderful. Those old-school subscription clubs where everyone would chip in a dollar to make community improvements and invest in everything from the Golden Gate Bridge to the USS Texas (a battleship) would be things that I would love to make a comeback. After all, if there were non-government solutions to problems that require a big ass pile of money then I would be much more eager to "eat the rich" as some others have posited.	1583440807.0	fjl6e6m	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl6e6m/
kdxwo	> I believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD.  How do you propose that this is done? You should note that billionaires do not earn billions, they own things that are worth billions.	1583432915.0	fjksax6	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjksax6/
15lkta	Mike Bloomberg is exceptional even among billionaires. He is the 9th richest person in the world, and the 6th richest in the United States. The 18th-richest American has less than half of his wealth, the 37th-richest American has about 1/5th of his wealth, and almost everyone below that is a single-digit billionaire. Your argument that Bloomberg's "effortless spending" on the campaign means that all billionaires should have much higher taxes is suspect, because the vast, vast majority of the 607 U.S. billionaires have nowhere near his level of wealth.  I don't mean to use these numbers to argue that taxation of the ultra-wealthy is unfair or bad policy, but rather to show that arguments for higher taxes on high-net-worth individuals should not be based on the behavior of Mike Bloomberg or any other ultra-ultra-wealthy person. All data comes from Forbes's [Billionaires 2020](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/) list (which is either super interesting or super depressing, depending on your perspective).	1583438765.0	fjl2oym	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl2oym/
3bqod5t	[The Laffer Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve) is a loose economic theory that describes the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. In short, both 0% and 100% tax rates would theoretically result in no tax revenue. At 0% you collect nothing, and at 100% there’d be nothing to collect since people would have no incentive to generate income if they can keep none of it. While this curve isn’t really something you can measure or predict, it does tell us two things:  1. Changing tax rates will affect the amount of taxable income.  2. At some point increasing the tax rate will actually cause a decrease in tax revenue.  Mike Bloomberg decided to dump $500 million into the American economy to fund a short-lived presidential campaign. That decision led to an increase in tax revenue as most of that $500 million ended up paying the bills for the employees at any of the likely hundreds of marketing agencies, production companies, promotional material manufacturers, and Bloomberg campaign offices. People should be praising this type of spending. If it was the norm trickle-down economics might actually hold water.  Now Mike Bloomberg could have also decided to say fuck it and move to Japan, taking all his wealth, spending power, and taxable assets with him. Anything could have prompted such a decision, like say an egregious tax hike on the fortune he earned for himself. In that case, an increase in tax rate would lead to an increase in tax revenue... for Japan! If you are going to tax the rich—*especially* if you are going to tax wealth—you better make sure the additional tax revenue you gain from the people who choose to keep their wealth in the country offsets the tax revenue you lose from the people who pull out. There’s a lot at stake when you’re talking about individuals who are paying hundreds of millions in taxes already.  This is not to say that the tax rates should drop or even remain the same and no, the ultra wealthy would not experience truly ill effects from a tax increase. However, you can’t just say tax the ultra wealthy out of existence, because if you’re too aggressive the ultra wealthy would disappear before you could tax them, leading to *extremely* significant ill effects for the rest of us.  Edit: for all of you calling me retard and bootlicker, let me be clear... Just because the Laffer curve is often erroneously used to argue for lower marginal tax rates does not mean we cannot learn something from it, and **we should raise marginal tax rates for higher income earners** because we are almost certainly tens of percentage points away from the “peak”. My point is that we can’t just blindly tax away in some quest to eliminate billionaires as quickly as possible. And for those who struggle with nuance I sincerely apologize.	1583441903.0	fjl8e25	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl8e25/
3vlej	He's the 9th richest man on the planet.  That's such an incredible outlier.  He doesn't represent any particular group, very well, certainly not enough to extrapolate "because of Bloomberg, then wealthy people could pay more in taxes".  Even those comfortably in the 1%, or even 0.01%, or even 0.00001%, could not have spent what Bloomberg spent.     While I fully agree with tax reform, particularly on capital gains (I think income should be income, keep it simple), extrapolating anything from major outliers, is a large mistake.       Secondarily, he was paying about 50% more to his campaign staff, and injected that $500M into the US economy.  Economically, I'm always happier seeing someone spend their wealth, than funneling it through the government.  Bloomberg bought exactly 0 bombs.  He killed exactly 0 civilians on foreign soil.  He paid well above standard wages for similar work in other campaigns, and he made it rain.     Think about that for a second, if you give $1 extra to the government, some fraction of that dollar is buying the next Predator drone that will unleash a Salvo on some Yemeni farmer, and kill he and his family.  No thanks.	1583437892.0	fjl14jm	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl14jm/
sd5dc	There are a lot of good points here already, but I just want to point out that people are viewing the $500 million dollars as “wasted money”. It wasn’t wasted- it was spent on exactly what Bloomberg wanted it to be spent on. He knew that winning the nomination was not a certainty and he made a calculated bet using his own money. All of that money went to thousands of people who worked on his campaign or designed his ads or sold him ad space. There was a fair exchange of goods and services. That’s what money is supposed to do.	1583451723.0	fjlpuca	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlpuca/
v9hmb	I'm mainly challenging your belief about arguments against higher taxes being propagnada. It’s not, lots of non billionaires share genuinely held small government beliefs. most people in the libertarian camp just are just generally opposed to taxation and government growth. I've spent a lot of time in libertarian circles, it's more about being pro-small government then saving billionaires a few million dollars on their taxes.  Certain media outlets i.e Fox talk about trickle down. That's conservatives, On the libertarian side there is very little talk about trickle down, its more about the principal of taxation and the reduction of bloated government spending.  The version of the American dream you mention is a strawman. Very few conservatives or libertarians go around saying hard work will make you a billionaire, or that current billionaires worked hard for it. I don't think that rhetoic actually exists on the right as much as you think, I hear it mainly as a talking point for the left.  I fundamentally disagree with your last point. Throwing money at things is not always the solution. The US spends more per capita on education that most other countries, the liberal answer to our education issues (which are numerous) "well we need to increase spending". Why? We already spend more, clearly government spending isn't an answer in and of itself. Having worked in government most of my life, and in the military as a reservist, I've witnessed so much inefficiency and special interest spending, it’s incredible.   My main point is that increasing taxes does not work out to better funding for x,y, and z. Bloomberg's 500 mil would be lost in burecreacy and the return on investment for taxation then spending is not there.  I simply don't see the reason to continuously take more from billionaires who pay taxes on many levels, to funnel a few extra million of their dollars through an inefficient and sometimes corrupt burecracy in the vain hope for a marginal if at all existant benefit of some social program or another.	1583444633.0	fjlda9d	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlda9d/
178yqv	I think the issue isn’t whether they can afford it, it is more the mechanism of how you go about do this.  The super wealthy don’t just carry a ton of cash, everything is in assets and securities, etc.  It is really tough to implement a wealth tax because a ton a subjective accounting needs to take place.  Let’s put it this way no country (even those with stronger regulations) have ever been able to implement a pure wealth tax effectively.    So now we try to think creatively and let’s say raise long term capital gains which is 15%.  That could work, but that also detrimentally affects everyone who saves for retirement not to mention if you tax it too high, you create an incentive for folks not to invest (idk know where this inflection point is, but someone can clarify).    So now you get to things like Value Added Taxes, but there is strong evidence to support that this is regressive in nature.   So these are some of the very real issues with implementation.  Not to say that this is impossible to overcome, but none of these things would generate the type of revenue needed to make true social change.	1583441636.0	fjl7whi	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl7whi/

3v2z55yf	I think before people like you make claims and suggestions you really need to understand in detail a few important definitions like net worth and wealth.  Someone can have a net worth of $100,000 but only have $5 in their pocket. So how do you tax that? You take shares in their company, a company already paying taxes? Do you think the government should start owning private businesses? Do you think there should be no private businesses? What?  Very, very few billionaires have a billion dollars. That is the difference most don't understand and it's why claims of 'tax the rich!' make no sense and are very rarely said by those who have degrees in finance or economics.	1583454198.0	fjltnul	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjltnul/
a9ory	Bloomberg has donated 8.2 billion through the Giving Pledge.  So his money likely has gone to help communities, where his money can be focused for good causes.  What do you think the government would do by taking more of his money?  Maybe buy a few more F35's?  Maybe give Ukraine a little more money?  The problem isn't taxation in the US.  The problem is spending.	1583432954.0	fjksdkk	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjksdkk/

6u9vt	I'm not sure I can contest "the rich could pay more in taxes without problem" because that's pretty vague and I think it'd be hard to argue a 1% hike in income tax above some very high threshold would cause anyone a problem.      But Bloombergs campaign is *absolutely not* proof of this.      First, anectdotal evidence is simply the weakest form of evidence, there's no reason to believe the one person you've selected as an example is indicative of the whole population you've identified.      Second (and this plays off my first point), Mike Bloomberg is *far* richer than even most Billionaires. He's not really indicative of other rich people. If Trump's own claims about his net worth are to be believed, Bloomberg is still *nearly twenty times* as wealthy.      To be in the 1%, you need to make something like $430,000 a year. That's a lot, but that's not remotely similar to Bloomberg, and a lot of those people probably would actually see a noticeable drop in lifestyle if their taxes were increased significantly.	1583439288.0	fjl3mlx	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl3mlx/
5btjp	Mike Bloomberg is one of the single richest people in the country. He's not even really representative of the rich; he's in a class of a handful of people who couldn't count their billions on all of their own and their best friend's fingers and toes.  I actually agree with you that tax rates should be higher; I just don't think Bloomberg is a good example. He has a *thousand* times more wealth than the level at which Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax would've kicked in; my own net worth is literally closer to that threshold than his. To say we should raise taxes on millionaires because of Bloomberg is like saying you should raise taxes on millionaires because of **you.**	1583441234.0	fjl75vz	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl75vz/

N/A	**Wealth Tax**  Edit:  [https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/#Intro](https://taxfoundation.org/wealth-tax/#Intro)   Bernie is a huge proponent of the Wealth Tax, which sense considering his position on wealth inequality. A wealth tax is problematic for two reasons, its complexity and flight. Firstly, how exactly would wealth be quantified? How would assets, such as art, that are not available on the market be measured? How would you measure the wealth of a company that makes no profit due to re-investing the money? There are many questions that Bernie doesn't seem to answer.  Next, Bernie's wealth tax is extreme. His proposed tax is 2-4% from 32 million to 1 billion, 5% until 2.5 billion, 6% until 5 billion, 7 percent until 10 billion, and 8% on anything over that. Most of the wealthy have their money invested in assets, real estate, and stock, so they will be forced to liquidate their assets in order to pay this tax. This can be extremely concerning for them, and frankly, being an American citizen isn't worth losing the majority of your net worth, so many billionaires will just renounce their citizenship and flee, which in itself is disastrous for the economy.  The wealth tax also discourages international companies from expanding into America, since the sheer taxes would lead to a net loss in revenue. So all in all, a wealth tax is extremely damaging for the economy, which is why its been repealed in the majority of countries it was instituted in. The countries that do have it, on the other hand, reduced the rate until it is insignificant at <1%.  The best way to fight wealth inequality is through the [Land Value Tax](http://www.landvaluetax.org/what-is-lvt/).	1583439740.0	fjl4gci	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl4gci/

4mpi6gkb	Bloomberg is somewhere close to 60 billion dollars and he spent less than 1% of his own money on his campaign. I think that was a decent gamble to take. That money got circulated into the economy as it should be and most of the money he owns is already being circulated through the economy. Taxing him more would hinder him from spending big or starting businesses, that would kill the economy and make things harder for poor people resulting in hundred thousands of jobs lost.	1583439641.0	fjl49uv	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl49uv/
blbrv	Your entire argument is based on taxing something that will cease to exist if you attempt to tax it as behavior is amended to alleviate tax changes. Furthermore the effect of disincentivizing growth through attempting this would negatively impact the economy and make the US less globally competitive. If you want to get wealth from those who have earned it carrot works more effectively than stick. Philanthropy, endowments, charitable donations, etc. can all be heavily incentivised without punitive taxation that reduces growth. The problem isn't how such taxes negatively affect the rich, it is how such taxes negatively affect economy.	1583445598.0	fjlf9j2	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlf9j2/

5uo39o6p	I don't understand why they should be taxed more. I understand a billion is a lot but why does that mean that their ability to save or invest or (insert method) should be highly taxed and go towards things for other people? Equal tax, sure, but I don't know why they should give more. I'd personally not be OK if I had spent my life intentionally trying to earn that much cash for whatever reason and then getting stung with more and more tax just because I have more assets or cash. Some people just want to have lots of money. Other people like and know how to make lots of money so they do. A lot of people simply don't save and spend money on silly things. I've had colleagues earning double the money I was making and still coming in and asking for a cash advance because they're out of cash meanwhile my partner and I have a hefty amount saved for people who earn roughly $27k per year.

38qlzxxs	Of course you can tax billionaires more money in taxes. Why you'd want to do that is ridiculously short-sighted, however.  Look at any country that "equalizes" wealth by taking everything from everyone. How many billionaires do they have? Well, usually, they have one or two. Guess who they always are? That's right, the national leader (who also happens to be dictator for life) and one or two other top cronies. In the meantime, everybody lives in miserable poverty, there's no innovation, the economy is dead and the country is usually on the verge of economic collapse.  The one cohort of the population that can both afford excessive taxation and move anywhere in the world that they want to is the last group of people you want to tax into the poor house. It sends the message that you want to punish people for their success which leads to people refusing to invest in your nation and scares away those who already have billions. They take their money and run *because they can.*  And besides, what exactly are you going to spend *their* money on, anyway? I mean, you're effectively legalizing theft by the state in the name of misguided moral principles but apart from that, the richest people are *already* paying the majority of your taxes. That's why flat taxes won't work. There is no number that works for all people but there is a point where people just say, "Screw this." Do you blame them? Yes, of course you do but we all know that you'd do the exact same thing because that's what everybody else does. France tried it...didn't work out so well.  And why do we care if the rich can keep some of their money? Well, apart from the fact that stealing from anybody is wrong (and when you start going on about taking the overwhelming majority of peoples' money, it stops being tax and starts being spoils) who is going to spend the money on those R&D centers, factories, offices, etc.,? Yeah, you think it'll be somebody but no, actually it turns out it's not. They take their money and put it somewhere (anywhere) that you can't touch it. If that means Vietnam gets all that investment then that's what that means and since that's what happens, it really isn't a very good idea.	1583443366.0	fjlb141	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlb141/

4fv1q	Bloomberg spent $500 millions, but somebody also made $500 millions too: TV stations, newspapers, hired consultants, campaign people, etc. This is a bit out of ordinary expense, but to make the point that you can take billions out of economy to put them in social programs is not a good thing for people who would not get those funds either for their consumption or for investment.  You could make a case that social programs are more important than the press or temp jobs created by such expenditures. It is a morality issue, but not how you think, who should decide how to use the money: the people who made them or the people who didn't?   Also, keep in mind that usually billionaires don't do what Bloomberg does, they usually invest the money that usually end up growing the economy and making things better for everybody. Reducing the funds available for investment, for the "next" things might sound great "why not give money to the poor" but then who's going to build the next Tesla, SpaceX, etc if you decide that people like Musk are too rich and don't "need" that much money and instead they should pay for food and health care of the poor. (I'm for universal health care and higher taxes for the rich, but it's also a matter of degree)	1583442654.0	fjl9qye	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl9qye/
kq4pv	What Bloomberg spent on his campaign is just under ~~.01%~~ 1% of his net worth. If you make $30,000 per year, that's the same as you spending 300 bucks. Most proposed tax increases on the wealthy are anywhere from 50-90% and while this seems like a lot of money that could be put to good use, consider how much the federal government spends already.   The budget for 2020 is currently 4.89 trillion. That's $9 million spent every minute, half a billion per hour, $13 billion per day. And around 30% of that money goes toward welfare programs already.  I'm not here to make any statements about whether or not bloomberg or any billionaire needs/deserves what they have but the federal government spends more than the entirety of Bloomberg's net worth every 5 days. In fact, if we confiscated all the wealth of every single US billionaire, all that money still wouldn't fund the US government for more than about 10 months.  Do I think that Bloomberg's $500 million would have been better served somewhere else? Of course I do. I just don't think giving that money to a system that is clearly bloated and wasteful is the correct way to accomplish that.  Edit: 1% not .01%	1583459463.0	fjm1k5c	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjm1k5c/

83c1d	Let’s ignore whether or not we should raise taxes on the rich and focus on your reasoning.  Your claim “ Bloomberg spending 500 Million of this 50 billion worth shows he can afford to be taxed at a higher rate” Well 500 million is 1% of his net worth. So at BEST you can only justify it as increasing his tax rate by 1%. However if we are only going to look at Bloomberg then I think your takeaway is actually backwards. Bloomberg only spent 1% of this net worth on running for president. This is probably ridiculously low compared to everyone else. I’m sure Pete B. Spent a lot more than 1% of this 100,000 net worth. So he has a lot of money to piss away in terms of real dollars, but maybe he does not in terms of percentage of wealth.    Now I don’t mention this to dissuade you from your taxation ideas, I just don’t want you using this one action by the be person to shape you option on a whole group of people.	1583439776.0	fjl4ioc	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl4ioc/

If the USA decided to heavily tax the ultra wealthy, they would make moves to not base their corporations in the USA.

21xz9qg0	So two issues with this-  \*1 - Our government takes in a lot of money in taxation. Taxes were cut on people and businesses and [revenue went up.](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-tax-revenue-3305762) It didn't go down, as many people suggested, it increased.   How? When people and businesses have more of their own money to invest and spend the economy thrives, as it has. Unemployment shrinks, as it has. Lower taxes cause a boost to the economy, and as we have seen can cause an increase in revenue.  The government doesn't need to take money from the wealthy, because the government would just throw it on the dumpster fire that is US government spending, and because it does more good in the hands of the people who earned it.  \*2 - If you own a business that brings in $333 million dollars per year in revenue, you will likely be valued at $1 billion in value. On $333 million in revenue, a good company might clear $20 million in profit.   &#x200B;  With the proposed wealth tax, the owner of that company would be taxed $80 million on maybe 420 million in profit.  &#x200B;  That is the reason we don't tax wealth, it gets COMPLICATED.	1583439413.0	fjl3ux0	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl3ux0/

N/A	A major problem, probably the biggest problem in my opinion, is the message it sends to billionaires. By targeting them, they perceive this as hostile and can move to other countries and make other countries richer. Having billionaires is a good thing for our country, as opposed to them moving their assets overseas. The reality is this world is a big competition between countries and billionaires have so much money they dont give a shit where their address is, its the exact same lifestyle for them. This isnt to say we should eliminate their taxes, but not specifically targeting them is likely beneficial for our country.	1583439770.0	fjl4iaz	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl4iaz/
ghxga	If you are arguing that the "price of being President" or some other government official should be lower, I heartily agree with you.  I think those offices should be much less powerful, and have less ability to regulate, less ability to tax, less ability to control interest rates, less ability to bail out multinational corporations....  > Certain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and  would be detrimental to those below them due to "trickle down" effects.    Your use of the phrase 'trickle down' shows that you are misunderstanding the point of taxation and the wealthy.  The point is not that reducing taxes on the wealthy allows them to buy stuff, which stimulates the economy.  The point is that reducing taxes on the wealthy provides more money for business people to start and expand businesses.  It's not about buying a motorcycle that pays a month's wages for a motorcycle builder.  *It's about expanding a motorcycle factory that pays ongoing wages for 100, or 1,000 motorcycle builders and other workers.*  And, as if that wasn't enough of a benefit to society, the increased supply and increased available technology of motorcycles (or towels, or televisions, or toaster-ovens) decreases the price, increasing the amount of quality of life for all consumers.	1583439819.0	fjl4ljl	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjl4ljl/

1sy99ko7	Your whole point is completely missing theirs (edited because I'm a lame-o who didn't read your post closely enough. It seems you mostly said the same thing as me!). Nobody has EVER claimed that the wealthy class couldn't afford higher taxes. That's not part of the argument at all. The argument is that wealthy people shouldn't HAVE to pay a higher tax. Of course billionaires can afford to pay higher taxes. I doubt even they would say that they couldn't. What they would say though is that they earned their money just as everyone else did, and shouldn't be punished for it.  &#x200B;  I'm in the boat of thinking that billionaires shouldn't exist, and people with millions of dollars have a responsibility to help others with their money. I think we should tax the super wealthy, and we should give poor people better benefits. I think -I- should pay higher taxes, being a very solidly middle class individual, if it means giving better benefits to those who need them.  &#x200B;  I'm saying all of this because I want you to know that I'm totally on your side, but I think that your point is inherently flawed because it doesn't address the actual issue they have with taxation.	1583443946.0	fjlc2j6	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlc2j6/

mm9g7m6	" I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point."  I mean yeah it is, but also no, the line between wealthy individuals and small/med size business owners can actually be surprisingly hard to define when you look solely at income. You may be taxing someone who "makes" more money than you but is really actually poorer than you because they devote the entirety of their income into their business - that involves workers wages, costs of doing / growing a business, emergency costs like flooding, fires, injuries, things breaking etc.   Now Bloomberg and Jeff Bezos don't exactly fit into this category, but at the same time they do...  radically changing the  tax system will mean radically laying off people and more likely than not, hurting the people who aren't in the Jeff Bezos / Bloomberg bracket. The middle class bears the brunt of downsizing costs because your company (big or small) no longer gets as nice of a tax break.  Furthermore its erroneous to presume that we as a country can just tax ourselves out of bad situations. government spending needs to be smarter, and realistically more money needs to be put in the hands of the working middle class. One way to do this is by systematically increases the minimum wage along with inflation - not in large spurts every 5 - 10 years when the public gets mad, but in a controlled gradual way that wont disproportionately hurt smaller business's. Another way is to give more power to state and local governments but thats another tangent..	1583444522.0	fjld36u	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjld36u/

10yoqz	I’ve seen some great comments on who actually pays taxes, but I can try and throw my hat in to explain why taxing the nuts off of rich people, though seemingly a great idea, may (probably will) have lots of undue consequences that could be astronomical.  For simplicities sake, we can use hyperbole to see how taxing the rich is possibly dangerous. A base assumption a lot of people have about billionaires, especially people who are fully behind a wealth tax, Is that they’re evil leeches who don’t get rich through their hard work, but rather through a little luck and a lot of labor exploitation. And whether or not that’s fully true (I think it is) is a whole different issue, let’s just assume billionaires are all evil swine who don’t care about anyone else’s well being. If you levy a wealth tax at them, they don’t have to lose a dime of profit.  All they have to do is charge more and pay less. We can fund a m4a program by taxing the rich, but then suddenly everything else costs more and your paycheck is smaller. A mass wage cut is improbable, but the untrarich may want to edge themselves back up to the levels of money they used to make, so over time prices will creep up and wages will creep relatively down.  I think that the fix to this is to break up the oligopolies that own so much. Theoretically, tax cuts and tax hikes on the rich or anyone would have a net neutral impact on society, but that’s a very robotic way to look at things, not factoring in greed or panic or any other human emotions. But the closer we get to having infinite competition, the better life will be for the average person.  But back to the question, even though mike Bloomberg pissed away so much for so little, that was his choice. Currently the average guy has very little bargaining power compared to the billionaire class, so when the cost is forced on them, they might be itching to retaliate is subtle, yet extremely destructive ways.

Think about that.  10 people have enough money to give $2000 to every working-age person in the US and would still be insanely wealthy.	1583446319.0	fjlgq8v	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlgq8v/

l8jr8	\> I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point.  That may well be the case...however, the fact that "...**the ultra wealthy in the US can afford a higher tax rate with no ill effect on them**" is not in itself a rationale for taxing them. This strategy plays right into the "tax and spend liberals" trope that some conservatives like to use.   While I'm not a conservative, I believe that balancing government inefficiency and waste on the backs of the ultra wealthy is the quintessential case of "two wrongs don't make a right."  This is why Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders' public policy plans were non-starters for me. The assumption was that we'd tax more to increase public benefits.

zrg2m	This view doesn't really make sense, with regards to the arguments of taxation.  The argument isn't about things like how hurt the rich are. The issue is how the system reacts to those taxes. The biggest thing is that you're comparing spending half a billion dollars with its confiscation.  Bloomberg chose to put that money up, so he willingly signed up for whatever happened because of that spending. Taxation is much different. Were the money taxed, rather than used at his discretion, he (and others in his situation) would look at ways to minimize and offset those tax increases.  This is why businesses meet tax/cost increases with things like cheaper production costs and layoffs. It's why the passage of Obama are had employers suppressing full-time employees' hours to avoid healthcare obligations.  Bloomberg could easily afford to volunteer his wealth over to the government and charities and such, but he chooses to use it to do things like enrich his political allies.  Then you get to things like other commenter said, where there is generational and long-term wealth. It is quite different to say you want to tax the top earners when the wealthiest of people are carrying legacy wealth, rather than being paid millions like a CEO.  All of that said, the issue comes down to the values of society. People like to earn, keep, hoard, and use wealth. They, to me, have that right. Bloomberg has the right to funnel his own money into his own campaign. What was proven is that you can't simply buy the candidacy like he tried.  I'm not of the opinion that we should be legislating the morality of economics. It removes the free will and decision making of humanity. There becomes a "rule of law" that determines the right thing to do, and feels arguably like legislated religion--deciding to put laws behind what is and is not acceptable to earn or own or how to use your money.  The issue isn't what the government is owed to squander (which is how most government programs go). It's that there are two large, problematic schools of thought that society needs to address at its core--that insane levels of wealth hoarding are to be desired and praised and that many people who do more don't deserve the fruits of their labor because of people who land somewhere between disabled, disadvantaged, and and disinterested in working as hard.	1583447253.0	fjlijvz	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlijvz/
7gddb	With regards to the comment about the rhetoric about working hard to be wealthy one day, that’s actually kinda true and you don’t even have to work that hard. If you have control of your finances and can invest $100 a month from 25-65, at 12% interest you’ll have about $1.2 million dollars when you go to retire. Obviously there are people that can’t start that early and can’t afford to spend $100 a month on non-essentials, but I think most Americans can afford this kind of investment and more.   Doesn’t totally address taxing über wealthy people, but I think still an important aspect of this conversation.	1583447377.0	fjlisa4	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlisa4/

Do I sell 30% of my shares each year to cover the bill... slowly eroding my share of the company I started until I have effectively nothing left?  What happens if the market crashes or my business falls on hard times. That $2B could turn into $200,000 dollars pretty quick... but since I had to sell so much of my share to fund the tax bill, I don't have $200,000, I have $20. Cool... cool, cool, cool.  See, people are already taxed when they sell stock. Taxing their net worth doesn't work.	1583447734.0	fjljf9k	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjljf9k/
2h4sflez	“...I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point.”  Way to Ad Hominem so you don’t have to actually defend a position. I am what could be considered lower-middle class. I might have a million dollars to my name total including assets and I have an argument against taxing “them.” Bill Gates said ”It’s not your fault if you are born poor but it is your fault if you die poor.” What has Bloomberg done that makes it justifiable to tax him more? He makes more money, but who is to say that it is not because he didn’t work for it. Maybe instead of complaining about how much a hard-working business man makes you can do something about your own financial situation. Money doesn’t just get handed out to a select few, they earn it and you can too. That is what is beautiful about this country. Maybe you won’t become a billionaire but you sure as hell can raise yourself out of poverty in this country no matter your circumstances if you have the grit and skills.	1583447774.0	fjljhmc	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjljhmc/
gxjrp	The question has never been if they can afford it, everyone knows they can afford it. The question is it morally right? If you and your two brothers wanted to rent a cabin together would it be fair for your two brothers to ask you to pay more just because you have more? I personally am more than willing to help my friends pay for a nice dinner when they can't bit the moment you make it a expectation it goes from being a nice gesture on your part to a presumptuous entitlement on their part.   The only way for the rich to get taxed more without being unfair is a percentage tax across the board based on what people make, which unless I'm mistaken we already do that. Everyone pays x% supposedly. The problem is not that taxes are too low, the problem is that the government doesn't know how to spend money and that the rich get away with tax evasion on the regular, which of course neither of those problems are solved with higher taxes.	1583447789.0	fjljiiu	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjljiiu/

zgmfq	While I agree that we can raise taxes on the wealthy, I don't think this line of reasoning is sound.  Someone spending money on something that is non-essential, but important to them is not proof that they have too much money.

N/A	Although I don’t deny the inequality in wealth in the US, I think your premise is grounded in misunderstanding of what it is to be “worth” something. Yes, Bloomberg is technically a billionaire, but he cannot just go to his bank and withdraw half of that worth. It’s “symbolic” in that he owns, for example, stocks/funds that fluctuate in worth by the hour on the market. Hell, if the stock market completely tanked tomorrow, 1929 style, Bloomberg wouldn’t be worth nearly as much as he is currently.  A lot of these folks, including others like Steyer, made money by investing, and not via shady dealings (at least as far as I know). They made their money the same way that your 401k/IRA accumulated worth over time. I don’t have much in my 401k, but if you look in my net worth, you’d think I’d be able to take out much much more money than I actually can.  Anyhow, people should be able to do what they want to do with their money. Bloomberg wants to buy ads? It’s no different than Sanders running ads in concept (the only difference here is who paid for the ads). Hell, Bloomberg funding himself lifted the burden of donations from his supporters that other candidates beg for daily. Being mad at Bloomberg for using his money to buy ads is like a person in a lower income bracket than you complaining that you bought groceries at Whole Foods instead of at Aldi.	1583448131.0	fjlk308	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlk308/

The argument for not taxing the rich exorbantantly is   A) they wont pay it cause of loops holes, or simple leaving.  And   B) if done to the extreme it disincentivises production and work because no money will be made. This crippling the economy.   As and example it is at 100% tax you can agree someone would lose interest in trying to do anything more and this would stop trying to grow their company. (Important note the economy is not finite, one person having more does not mean another has less.)   Is you want to have the ultra rich pay morr than they are now.

5nrn7ft7	Over the years I've thought about this a lot.. The money we make should be based on a few things: how smart you are (or how knowledgeable about your industry), and how hard you work. Now these things break out into a lot of different other qualities that make someone more or less valuable to a community but these are the 2 kind of main things you have that should help you be more successful. The average american's net worth is $76,200. Jess Bezos is worth $121.1 Billion.... Now ask yourself is Jeff Bezos 1,589,238 times smarter than the average american? Did Jeff Bezos work 1,589,238 times harder than the average american? No. Jeff Bezos is rich as hell because he had the right idea at the right time and the made the right choices for his company which led him to where he is. Does he deserve to be 1,589,238 times richer than you for an outcome that is almost assuredly 99% luck with .5% above average intelligence, and .5% above average work ethic?

Except you stand to make way more back from a presidency than you do an xbox, percentage-wise.  Edit: I was thinking an Xbox at launch which was $500, now it's down to $300.

What if I told you that large corporations like GE not only do not pay, but routinely get billions of dollars of taxpayer money in the form of credits ?  Would you start to understand that the rates are not the problem ? Simplify the code, eliminate the loopholes, then you can make an accurate assessment of rates. Raising rates on the wealthy (who end up not paying a penny more) is just an excuse to also raise rates on the middle class, the only difference is the middle class doesn't have an army of lawyers to get them out of having to pay.

122bij	It will be far more for people like Bloomberg. Bernie plan forsee 8% on 10billion+. that wouldve been ~10 times the amount. Also while I have absolutely no insight in Bloombergs financials its very likely that he didnt liquidate 500mil of his assets. A big majority of his wealth comes from Bloomberg LP which he didnt sell a part of (I think things would be public) so 500mil is a huge chunk of his other assets which would be dumb financially to liquidate. He probably took loans or sold some kind of bonds for most of it and backed it up with his assets so he will be paying back most of it over multiple years.   The major problem I have with taxation on networth is that its just not right to do so. People like Bloomberg would lose control over their own company bc of that. Imo everything that I own is none of the states business. tax income and realized capital gain but if I own something I should not worry to lose it.	1583449585.0	fjlmhjj	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlmhjj/

83p6l	It's not that, as in your title, we care about the ill effect it has on billionaires, it's that we care about the ill effect it could have to the economy. So what effect does it have?  If Bloomberg spends money, as in a campaign, then someone is *making* money off of him. It's not that his money disappears into a vacuum, right? And when he holds onto it, where is it? It a big bin somewhere? No, it's *invested*. Investment is very important.  So, the question becomes whether it's better off to tax more of that money, and funnel it into Government. And...yeah it might very well be, to a certain degree, and economists argue about the degree, and what the right amount is. There are disagreements about tax policy in the economic world that I'm not going to solve for you here and now, but suffice to say most economists would agree we should be taking more, but probably not as high as the Bernie proposal of 70%.  What we can do is realize that concepts of "They can afford it", or "It will have no ill effect on them", or even "it's not fair", do not really get to the heart of the economic question. The question is what works better. (It's also about how we want to measure 'better' - What if one tax policy is better for people in the short term, but takes away from added growth for people in the future? What if productivity and growth and progress aren't always aligned with what we view as more 'humane', how much trade-off do we want do to with that? Etc. But often, most people will agree on some fundamental measurement of 'better'). It looks like the Trump tax cuts don't work as well as a higher tax policy, on a few levels, so we should probably do something better. We don't know for sure, but that tends to be what most experts think. So, that's all there is to it.	1583449874.0	fjlmy0a	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlmy0a/

1wb3wmn	Yup, there is no natural trickle down but without control there is a trickle up effect, because the ones who takes economic advantage have ressources to reinforce theur position. But i don't think a blind high taxe is a solution, because rich will fight to avoid it. We should think about oriented taxes that offer tax shelter for donation or investment in things like ecology or local social and cultural structures. Taxes must be a tool to lead toward practices that truly benefit to society.  As an example, there were ISF in France (Tax on Wealth), that could be avoid with donations to associations. Our neoliberal president removed it, that lead to a massive fall in amount of donations.

5fs5psej	It's about how you tax it. Tax their capital gains and income! Do it! Please!  But I see a lot of people pushing the financial transactions tax - Bernie people mostly, since the FTT is a solution to pay for M4A - and similar taxes that *look* like they would raise revenue, but wouldn't.   If you do things like tax individual transactions, or tax equity regardless of whether it's liquid (another Sanders idea), you end up having knock on effects that will harm the middle class. For instance, FTT would take a percentage of all stock trades. But algorithmic trading, which plays off of teeny tiny inefficiencies, would end up costing the firms money. Congratulations, you have ended algorithmic trading and destroyed jobs.   So tax them more, but do it in an intelligent and targeted way. Tax the gains they make, and you can raise revenue without punishing them for doing things that create wealth. That way, you can take some of that wealth and do something for the rest of the country.	1583450603.0	fjlo2xl	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlo2xl/
cfl4z	It’s not like the money that Bloomberg spent on his campaign is disappearing into oblivion. That $500 million is going to the people and corporations he employed. Those people and corporations spend money on things every day and then that money repeats the cycle.   The gap between the wealthy and the middle class is huge, don’t get me wrong. But I feel like before we start taxing the ultra wealthy more, we need to reform government spending. The government spends billions on projects and infrastructure and nothing gets done. Remember when the US paid ISPs billions to build a nationwide fiber optic network so the entire country would have a great internet connection and the ISPs built basically nothing? The government just throws their money around like nothing and doesn’t reciprocate when the job they paid for doesn’t get done. That needs to be fixed first and foremost.	1583450653.0	fjlo5rq	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlo5rq/

cchw9	The simplest rebuttal here is that Bloomberg's campaign was unprecedented and extreme outliers shouldn't be the basis for tax policy. You could easily apply "Bloomberg campaign" logic to marginal tax increases on the lower and middle classes if just one single example of wasteful spending is sufficient to justify a tax hike.   From an investment perspective you could also argue that $500m was just a small, isolated error in an otherwise strong performance. He is almost completely self-made and created a financial and software juggernaut from scratch, his work generated untold billions of dollars in value for the US economy and his firm has created thousands of well-paying jobs with good benefits. Keep in mind $55bn is the value of his assets, not his income, if Bloomberg has generated so much value for the US economy and typically achieves incredible returns on his investments, the US govt. would be foolish to start demanding he give up assets in the name of wealth equality - if they just leave him alone and stick to taxing income they'd get more money anyway!  Alternatively you could point out that the dude has donated over $3bn to John Hopkins and given far more to philanthropy. Given the US govt's track record on spending, isn't it better that Bloomberg is spending that money on a good cause rather than handing it over so that Lockheed Martin can use to bomb civilians in some 3rd-world country?   //All of these arguments have some common fallacies baked in but contain valid points as well, none of them are my sincere view on tax policy.	1583450760.0	fjlobm3	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlobm3/

N/A	I get the  distinct feeling that people like Bloomberg run a campaign not to win, but to act as a distraction to stop people focusing their attention towards the most worthy candidate. They're all "The Establishment", and they're putting together a disinformation, distraction and doubt casting campaign deliberately to assist other campaign's attempts to win/maintain the status quo, making it essentially just the one campaign with many facets.	1583450936.0	fjlolnp	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlolnp/

4pz7e2hc	In Canada, they implemented a tax on the very wealthy that was supposed to generate a few billion in extra revenue for the government. In reality the government lost revenue because the rich worked to avoid it and ended up moving wealth overseas.      Every time there is a change in the flow of money, people will adapt to this change. The ones that are the most able to adapt will do so in a way that benefits them. The ones that are less able to do so simply cannot and are at the mercy of those who do change. Therefore top down changes in the flow of money tend to effect the poor disproportionately because they cannot adapt to the change.     Incentives that benefit both parties are more beneficial than sudden tax increases. That is, if you accept that people can control their own money.	1583451147.0	fjloxgc	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjloxgc/

2wggxjuc	I would like to point out that one of the main arguments against taxing the rich is that the government should not be able to control people’s lives, not necessarily that they can’t afford it.   Ex. I believe that all people should have to pay a percentage of their money in taxes for basic protection from the government. However, past that I believe that each person has the right to decide how they spend there money. Not to mention that most of the billionaires in the US are also some of the biggest contributors to charity.  Therefore, I believe we should be supporting and promoting billionaires involvement in charity rather than promoting a government that takes their money and forcefully gives it to the less fortunate.	1583451771.0	fjlpx53	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlpx53/

c0aqp	>earning/worth more than 1 billion USD  * There's a big difference between income vs net-worth. It's like the difference between velocity vs displacement. They are two very different concepts, and it's important to distinguish between them. E.g. a professional athlete who earns a billion dollars per year but spends a billion dollars per year (such that his bank account is 0) has a much higher standard of living than a retired senior who has 0 income beside social security but has a billion dollars in the bank. * Bloomberg's net worth is not sitting idly in a bank. It's more likely invested in the assets of companies. The equity is illiquid. He can't just sell-off half without effort or consternation.  >can afford a higher tax rate with no ill effect on them  &#x200B;  >While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes,  The purpose of "accruing large sums of money" is precisely the financial freedom/security to spend a portion of it with no ill effect. If we take "no ill effect, therefore raise taxes" to its logical conclusion, we ought to raise taxes until a certain threshold of expenditure *does* have an ill effect. Which defeats the purpose of a wealth generation. Taxes were not originally intended to punish the wealthy, they were intended to raise public funds. The problem is not the slippery slope, but the focus on punishment rather than a focus on the actual impact of economic policies on the public and the financially distressed.  **N.b.** I'm harping on this not because you said the words "can afford a higher tax rate with no ill effect", but because the post conspicuously omits mention of any specific tax (or class of taxes) with which to *ground* a discussion of an ill-effect. Maybe consider what you actually want taxed (e.g. bank account? property value? total assets? salary? dividends? capital gains?) and maybe put a number on it (e.g. 10%? 90%? 50%?) and at what bracket. The sub would then be in a better position to discuss the economic consequences, ill or benign.	1583451949.0	fjlq73x	t3_fdziov	t3_fdziov	/r/changemyview/comments/fdziov/cmv_mike_bloombergs_campaign_is_proof_that_the/fjlq73x/
