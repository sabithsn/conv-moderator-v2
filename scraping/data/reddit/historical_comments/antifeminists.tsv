**Almost half of total rapists are women.**

This is a 2012 research paper using data from the U. S. Census Bureau's nationally representative National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Within the sample of 43,000 adults, of those who affirmed they ""forced somebody to have sex against their will"", 43.6% were women and 56.4% were men.

**Men get raped more than women do, both heterosexually and homosexually.**

The CDC tends to find slightly more male victims of ""forced to penetrate"" than women ""rape"" in the NISVS research, which is a large part why this information is generally unknown, the rape of men isn't considered to be rape by the bulk of academic literature. This also doesn't mean that women are the very slight majority of victims either, the CDC numbers put's that at ∼80% of ""forced to penetrate"" perpetrators are women, and ∼95% of forced penetration is perpetrated by men, which means men are still being raped at a higher rate, both homosexually and heterosexually.

(CDC Graph on all four national NISVS studies).

**Men experience ""forced sex"" in relationships more than women.**

Here is a 2007 survey investigating sexual coercion in romantic relationships. It used a sample of 7,667 university students (2,084 men and 5,583 women) from 38 sites around the world. It found that 2.8% of men and 2.3% of women reported experiencing forced sex in their heterosexual relationships. (Table 1 and 2 on pages 408 and 410 respectively).

Instead of admitting that illegalising abortion has counterproductive effects, Republicans are compliant to these changes and prefer to pertain to a false 'feel-good' reality.

Furthermore, what I mean by ""counterproductive"" is not only is the abortion rate slightly higher in restrictive countries ([37 versus 34 abortions each year for every 1,000 women aged 15 to 44](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/abortion-worldwide-2017.pdf)), but the rate of maternal deaths is also higher, including mortality from unsafe abortion procedures which jump from 1% in non-restrictive countries to 37% in restrictive countries, as stated by the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/article_unsafe_abortion.pdf) review of abortion laws.

You're right about the drug legalisation comparison, although I'm not educated at all on that topic. As far as I'm aware, it falls under the idea that prevention and tackling issues at the root cause is the best solution of a prevalent issue in society. This is proven in regards to abortion.

>  This law is, of course, bullshit. It should be clear that a miscarriage can happen without any fault of the mother. Only an intentional and active termination of pregnancy should be considered as abortion and of course this has to be provable.

The issue is contentious because most women who seek unsafe abortion procedures do so by inducing a miscarriage. Natural miscarriages are literally referred to as ""spontaneous abortions"".

If the Republican party cared about reducing the abortion rate outside of moral inconsistencies, could you explain to me why they advocate against the social safety nets and policies that greatly reduce abortion numbers across the US? Republicans (and most pro-lifers) are against universal healthcare, comprehensive sex education, contraception, paid paternity leave, better access to mental health professionals, and funding for low-income families. The pro-abstinence and anti-birth control movement is founded by conservative Christians (and pro-lifers). A few inconsistencies that Republican pro-lifers display are listed below:

1. Republican states and parties advocate for restrictions on family planning, including ending state-federal Medicaid family planning expansion programmes, and support the defunding of family planning centres, such as Planned Parenthood. 

https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-family-planning-funding-restrictions 

https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-services 

2. In October 2017, the Trump administration made it much easier for an employer to exclude contraceptive coverage from any health plan it offers to its employees and their dependents. One regulation allows any employer–non-profit or for-profit–to exclude some or all contraceptive methods and services from the health plans it sponsors if the employer has religious objections. Most of the state laws that expand contraceptive coverage offer exemptions as well. 

 https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/insurance-coverage-contraceptives 

3. In 2009, Colorado began offering teens free IUDs without parental consent, and within eight years, teen pregnancies dropped by 54% and the abortion rate fell by 64%. For every dollar spent on the programme, the state saved nearly $6 in labour and delivery costs, child-care assistance, and food stamps, and in total saved taxpayers of Colorado nearly $70 million. The programme was eliminated and initial funding ran out in 2016 due to the Republican party refusal to authorise funding.

Abortion is a political issue and a powerful one at that. It has the ability to unite and move entire voter demographics, unlike virtually any other issue. The pro-life movement was founded to unite evangelicals and religious communities around one issue that they could then use to capture their vote. This is abundantly clear due to the fact the pro-life movement wasn't prominent until the 80s, nearly 10 years after Roe v. Wade was decided. Evangelical and political leader Randall Terry used the issue of abortion as a unification movement to rally evangelicals around Republican policies. Fighting abortion is what almost every Republican and conservative have in common so it evidently serves as a unifying factor that keeps them voting for the goal of outlawing abortion, which seems to never come. Why is abortion the issue of choice and not the topic of an issue like increasing access to contraception? Because being pro-life is easy. It's easy to tell a woman no. It doesn't cost any money, and you feel good because you have this false reality that you're saving human lives despite the fact that illegalising abortion only drives women, majority who are low-income or minorities, to resort to unsafe alternatives that put them in danger and don't actually lower the abortion rate. They don't advocate for policies such as increased access to contraceptives, mandatory paid maternity leave so women don't feel that they are being disenfranchised for having children, universal childcare which allows women and families as a whole to raise their children with less financial hardships, improving the education system which includes sex education as well as universal healthcare which would, with many other benefits, eliminate the insanely high price to give birth. They don't support those policies because those require time and money and frankly, that's not what interests them. They don’t care about the lives of the unborn, they just want to continue this unification movement that has united evangelicals and conservatives for decades. Overturning Roe v. Wade would end the fight that’s united religious conservatives for decades. Please name me one other policy issue in which the Republicans advocate for saving human lives. Healthcare? No, they’re against universal healthcare, have consistently advocated for cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, as well as tried 70 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act which despite its serious flaws, protects those with pre-existing conditions, and is obviously better than the lack of alternative they have provided. How about Military spending? Nope, they’ve advocated for greater military funding which goes to bombing other countries and creating more terrorists. How about immigration? Absolutely not, as they’ve supported policies like family separation and extended the maximum amount of time people can be held in cages from 72 hours to weeks on end which has resulted in the deaths of 24 migrants during the Trump administration. What about police brutality and racial justice? No, once again, conservatives never fail to justify the deaths of unarmed black people at the hands of law enforcement."

>  There is nothing forceful about a woman having sex with a man in consent. Thus getting pregnant after voluntarily sleeping with a man, of course, has nothing to do with rape.

This statement above is highlighting your lack of understanding of what reproductive coercion or rape is. Impregnation as a result of rape is seen in two ways:

1) Reproductive coercion by pressuring your sexual partner into becoming pregnant, refusal to use contraception, or using threats of violence or intimidation.

2) Stealthing by removing a condom or lying about use of contraception or sterilisation, or birth control sabotage by discarding or tampering with contraception.

3) Pregnancy control such as controlling the outcome of a pregnancy against someone's will by coercing a partner through use of pressure, threats, or violence to continue or terminate a pregnancy. 

*""The term reproductive coercion is used to define a range of perpetrator pregnancy-controlling behaviours. These behaviours can include birth control sabotage (where contraception is deliberately thrown away or tampered with), threats and use of physical violence if a woman insists on condoms or other forms of contraception, emotional blackmail coercing a woman to have sex or to fall pregnant, or to have an abortion as a sign of her love and fidelity, as well as forced sex and rape [1]. In these circumstances, pregnancy can be used as a tool of control, and a sign to a perpetrator of violence that they have power over their partner’s body. Reproductive coercion is an easy and effective and cowardly way of manipulating and controlling a woman by limiting her autonomy over her fertility and reproductive health and choices.""*

https://www.childrenbychoice.org.au/factsandfigures/reproductivecoercion

>  Why is it then that I know women who never slept with a man except with their husband? Just because you cannot imagine to wait until marriage (or until a relationship comparable to marriage) does not mean that it doesn't work.

Generally, conservative Christians who don't believe in premarital sex marry young. They're also the primary demographics driving up the divorce rate. Not every woman or man believes in marriage or waits until marriage, because this is a religious concept. Many married couples never want children, so this is another attempt at a false equivalency. I have discussed in a previous comment why advocation for abstinence is ineffective and shouldn't be taught in the education system.

>  I actually am not that religious as you might think I am. I mainly mentioned this examples to point out that women need to accept the way their body works and thus their role in society that comes with it, it doesn't matter if it's due to God or due to evolution.

I am a born and raised conservative Christian. People like you are why I am no longer religious and am now agnostic. I don't want anything to do with a regressive belief system that sees women as biological properties. A woman's role in society isn't to be forced to give birth against her will. This is an extremely reductive and misogynistic belief that you are pertaining to. Religion is the cause of all immorality against anyone who isn't a straight white male. It's discriminatory.

>  The problem with you feminists is that you are jealous of the male body and the possibilities that come with it for men.

Why are you assuming I'm a feminist?

I'm not jealous of the male body. I think that's projection. Men's rights activists are always preaching their envy for a woman's ability to abort her pregnancy due to their biological high-ground with no say from the man.

>  Therefore, you try to convince yourselves that you are equal to men in every way or develop a superiority complex and want to force society to believe that.

Women are equal to men, just not in the sense that you're thinking of. We have biological differences, correct, but equality doesn't mean we are identical.

>  It would be healthy for you if society would once again recognize and take into account the weaknesses of women and if it would once again give motherhood enough respect, appreciation and support.

The amount of misogyny in a single comment is amusing, I have to say. Now I remember you. You were the same man arguing that a woman is a man's property in a previous comment of yours.

Conservative Christian values are harmful. You aren't benefitting society by oppressing marginalised groups; you're worsening society. Purity culture relies on a misogynistic trope, as does Christianity. These are known as regressive views for a reason.

In my belief, those who are pro-life are either religious, uneducated, or a mixture of both. Conservatives are usually deontologists. They believe that the morality of actions is determined by the action itself and not the outcome. Therefore, deontologists would not pull the lever in the trolley scenario because by doing that they are intentionally killing someone and that action in a vacuum is morally wrong."

Reproductive coercion is an easy and effective and cowardly way of manipulating and controlling a woman by limiting her autonomy over her fertility and reproductive health and choices.&quot;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it then that I know women who never slept with a man except with their husband? Just because you cannot imagine to wait until marriage (or until a relationship comparable to marriage) does not mean that it doesn&#39;t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, conservative Christians who don&#39;t believe in premarital sex marry young. They&#39;re also the primary demographics driving up the divorce rate. Not every woman or man believes in marriage or waits until marriage, because this is a religious concept. Many married couples never want children, so this is another attempt at a false equivalency. I have discussed in a previous comment why advocation for abstinence is ineffective and shouldn&#39;t be taught in the education system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually am not that religious as you might think I am. I mainly mentioned this examples to point out that women need to accept the way their body works and thus their role in society that comes with it, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s due to God or due to evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a born and raised conservative Christian. People like you are why I am no longer religious and am now agnostic. I don&#39;t want anything to do with a regressive belief system that sees women as biological properties. A woman&#39;s role in society isn&#39;t to be forced to give birth against her will. This is an extremely reductive and misogynistic belief that you are pertaining to. Religion is the cause of all immorality against anyone who isn&#39;t a straight white male. It&#39;s discriminatory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with you feminists is that you are jealous of the male body and the possibilities that come with it for men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you assuming I&#39;m a feminist?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not jealous of the male body. I think that&#39;s projection. Men&#39;s rights activists are always preaching their envy for a woman&#39;s ability to abort her pregnancy due to their biological high-ground with no say from the man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, you try to convince yourselves that you are equal to men in every way or develop a superiority complex and want to force society to believe that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Women are equal to men, just not in the sense that you&#39;re thinking of. We have biological differences, correct, but equality doesn&#39;t mean we are identical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be healthy for you if society would once again recognize and take into account the weaknesses of women and if it would once again give motherhood enough respect, appreciation and support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amount of misogyny in a single comment is amusing, I have to say. Now I remember you. You were the same man arguing that a woman is a man&#39;s property in a previous comment of yours.</p>

<p>Conservative Christian values are harmful. You aren&#39;t benefitting society by oppressing marginalised groups; you&#39;re worsening society. Purity culture relies on a misogynistic trope, as does Christianity. These are known as regressive views for a reason.</p>

<p>In my belief, those who are pro-life are either religious, uneducated, or a mixture of both. Conservatives are usually deontologists. They believe that the morality of actions is determined by the action itself and not the outcome. Therefore, deontologists would not pull the lever in the trolley scenario because by doing that they are intentionally killing someone and that action in a vacuum is morally wrong.</p>

But IMO strict anti-abortions laws should be installed nevertheless.

No, you don't agree with me. You believe in counterproductive abortion laws that negatively impact women's health as opposed to the proper procedures that act as a long-term solution to the abortion rate. I've explained in a previous comment how abortion restrictions provide little to no effect. 

>  But they should be. Of course it's not a fully developed human being yet but it will be one. For me life begins with the fertilization of the ovum

I understand that the pro-life movement sees the fetus as an individual person with rights. For argument's sake, let's say that science and philosophy has determined that an unborn offspring is recognised as an individual person by law that's worthy of all the inherent values of human beings.

My question to you is, how do you determine whether a fetus is more deserving of human rights that no person in our country possesses?No person has the right to life at the expense of another person's bodily autonomy. Hypothetically, if I crash into someone with my car and they require a blood transplant, I am not legally obligated to provide them with my blood. And for argument's sake, I'll provide another example, too. If I give birth to a child tomorrow and that child requires a bone marrow transplant or a kidney dialysis, I am still not legally obligated to donate my bodily organs even if my refusal to sacrifice my bodily autonomy results in my child's death. Why? Because everyone has the right to self-govern. Everyone has the right to consent to medical procedures. 

So I'll reiterate my point; if you believe a fetus is recognisable, by law, as an individual person with the same fundamental human rights as the woman that it resides in, this doesn't validate your pro-life stance, because no person has the right to impose on another person's bodily autonomy even if it results in their death.

>  I do however agree that it is difficult to draw a line here since at the very beginning the embryo is in fact little more than a few cells, without consciousness and pain sensation. But this changes drastically during the first weeks and at the latest when the baby can react to stimuli, when it has a heartbeat and when the brain and thus consciousness is developing, one should legally recognize the embryo as a person, regardless the fact that it cannot survive without the mother's body until shortly before birth.

Most of the qualities of life you describe here only exist within a fetus at the earliest of 20-24 weeks, which currently reflects our constitutional law on when abortion is determined as immoral and a fetus should be granted rights.

>  WTF? I am schocked that you think this way. Getting pregnant and caring for the embryo in your body is what a woman's body is made for

I'm shocked that you believe a woman should be reduced to her biological state and should have her bodily rights infringed upon based on primitive and outdated thinking. A woman's body is made for much more than the act of being an incubator to human life.

>  A fetus should have the right to ""use"" the mother's body just like children have the right to be cared for.

I wouldn't doubt if you're also against safe haven laws based on this statement alone.

>  This is why we call it murder. It's just like refusing to breastfeed your baby and then saying it was not your fault when it dies due to ""lack of viability"". You are proof that pro-choicers are insane.

Pro-life individuals rely on an emotional appeal of sensationalism to evoke an arbitrary response. Your definition of murder is false, and you've provided me nothing more but a false equivalency for two reasons:

1) A woman can waiver her guardianship at any given time upon birth. She is not forced to care for a child she does not want. However, if she takes upon guardianship, she is agreeing to care for that child, therefore any lack of care would rightfully constitute as neglect. She has a choice, here. Something you're advocating to take away in regards to abortion laws.

2) This is a poor example of bodily autonomy because the child is not imposing on her bodily rights. This is another example where a woman has a **choice**. She can voluntarily use her body to breastfeed her child, or she can voluntarily use formula to feed her child.

>  How is it a red hering fallacy? What do you mean? I know we don't live in a conservative society this but I think conservative values are superior to this degenerate liberal society that we have nowdays.

Evidently not if you think we should regress to a 1950's society where women and minorities were oppressed and you believe women should be reduced to property based on their biological state. Conservative values are desirable by white straight men because they highlight a time when white straight men were most privileged. Do you think it's a coincidence where the outcome you're advocating for in regards to abortion laws negatively affect women but have zero repercussions for men? Why do you think incel culture thrives around the manifesto that we should regress to a 1950's conservative society? I'll allow you to think about that for a second.

Those groups seem to attract the actual worst, most broken and stupid people much like the lgbt community, they attract broken people looking for something to cling to.

I'm glad you're not like that though. But surely you've noticed within that community the acceptance of female doms but the demonisation of male doms?

And in the polyamory community omg. Bro, they have an actual web page the length of a small book that i was linked to talking about how bad male female couples looking to add an extra female are. They're called unicorn hunters. There's absolutely nothing wrong with looking for a man to add as an extra or included as a full equal but it's seen as abusive when they search for a woman.

Like, do you think that it is fair for an 80 years old man who has nothing to offer to a woman, to want a 20 years old girl?<br/>
It&#39;s just not right for the OP guy to want a relationship, where he has little to nothing to offer, while the women has a lot to offer him, and at the same time to reject relationships with women who he thinks are on a similar boat to him. (These women are still out of his league, but that&#39;s a different question.)</p>

So, for the last 13 years of my life, when i was 4, i joined this school, have been here since that time, and well, i was the most emotional boy, like i used to cry lol, i noticed guys bullied me more, girls didn't like me, throughout my life... (Although when things got too far, i used to break my shell and used to beat up 4-5 guys back alone, though very rarely, otherwise i used to feel sad to hit them...), Girls also falsely complained to teachers (just so their seat partner could be changed, coz I was not into their books lol)

Well, when there was not so bitchy girl, she used to talk nicely (very rare though for such a girl to exist in modern era)

Well, now last year, 202, i said Fuck it, i need to change, so I went into no Fap, took the red pill route, improved a lot now though (4-5 last months online i did improvement, and last 1-2 months were offline school, i used the tactics learnt)

Well, now things are very calm though (still rough, but drastic improvement from the early days)

Now, i sir at the back of the bus (with extroverts), and there are these girls, who have tons of boyfriends, and they ditch them, i now sit (i will change and see the other side when i will talk to the ones I hate the most)... Now they ain't so bitchy too me (but yeah they call me depressed, probably because i don't talk much unnecessarily, also their talking topics of cringey instagram and the boyfriends they ditched are so bad, i feel to puke someday lol)

But they make fun of other people, i sadly, have to play along and support, only so that they don't target me again (i have been sad since school, now not in this high school phase)

Sad to see, these girls are the most rich and beautiful ones, and the boys they make fun of, are not so handsome... I feel sad, as i am basically not improving, i am instead pushing back the people, of whom i was once a part of...

Feels sad... I know how those guys feel... Thus still i don't hangout with girls, i don't have any female friends (those i had, 1 or 2, have left school)... Thus i don't talk, let's see though.... 

Irony is, despite this bitchy behaviour, the school and the country has the guts to still put up boards on female empowerment...

And also i noticed, the boys may have groups still (even the sad ones)... But those girls, who ain't so rich, ain't so smart, ain't so beautiful, are instead very silent in nature, such that, i have never even heard them say anything... Such is the effect on em... They don't talk much to others... (My crush is like those girls, thus also hard to talk to her lol)

Clearly shows feminism is a tool to multiply the already existing benefits of rich and beautiful girls, and also demeaning all men and the poor women (a few whom they don't like)

Lemme guess, you were also bullied by other girls, and you might have some nice male friends (maybe even more buddies than female ones) ???

If yes, well, i have talked to 10 or more different antifeminist women of different age groups and countries, all faced the same...

<p>So, for the last 13 years of my life, when i was 4, i joined this school, have been here since that time, and well, i was the most emotional boy, like i used to cry lol, i noticed guys bullied me more, girls didn&#39;t like me, throughout my life... (Although when things got too far, i used to break my shell and used to beat up 4-5 guys back alone, though very rarely, otherwise i used to feel sad to hit them...), Girls also falsely complained to teachers (just so their seat partner could be changed, coz I was not into their books lol)</p>

<p>Well, when there was not so bitchy girl, she used to talk nicely (very rare though for such a girl to exist in modern era)</p>

<p>Well, now last year, 202, i said Fuck it, i need to change, so I went into no Fap, took the red pill route, improved a lot now though (4-5 last months online i did improvement, and last 1-2 months were offline school, i used the tactics learnt)</p>

<p>Well, now things are very calm though (still rough, but drastic improvement from the early days)</p>

<p>Now, i sir at the back of the bus (with extroverts), and there are these girls, who have tons of boyfriends, and they ditch them, i now sit (i will change and see the other side when i will talk to the ones I hate the most)...

Do you go to the gym? Are you in shape? I'm guessing not (neither am I, btw). Go to the gym, get a trainer (or watch videos on youtube about gym routines), you will get in shape in less that 6 months and you won't even believe how good you'll look.

Do you eat healthy? Maybe you do, but if you dont then start, less sodas, less junk food, more protein and more vegetables.

Where do you meet women? Online? Just stop, the online world and the real world are vastly different things. Go out, go to a mall, sit down and just chill, when you get comfortable enough talk to a woman, it doesn't have to be a big ass conversation just start simple, ask them what time it is, where's a random store (even if you know) thank them for their answer and move on, that's just to get more comfortable talking to them. Then you can move on to actually starting a conversation, NEVER WITH SEX ON YOUR MIND AS YOUR GOAL, if you think you click then invite them for a coffee or ask them for their number, if they refuse THATS FINE, doesn't mean they're bitches or feminists or spoiled, that's completely fine, we all have different preferences, just try again and eventually one of them WILL take that coffee. From there its just behaving like a human being, after that coffee you can call her the next day and ask her to go see a movie, respect her schedule, maybe she can't go that week and guess what? THAT'S FINE. Everything will be fine my brother.

I know you're gonna be tempted to say ""bro I tried all that, I even read this book and nothing worked"" to that I will say: I dont give a fuck, try again. If you fail then fucking try again, and don't lie to me, you've never had a regular routine at a gym either so just try to do what I'm telling you, Im one of those men in the ""20%"".

Her brother (my husband) thought it was life in general because she did mention how she was reading Quran and how she believes that it also talks about women having a certain place/job and men having a certain place/job.. she mixed up the two things (work environment/patriarchy/me too/men not being able to look at women without thinking sexually and an Islamic home life and the male patriarchy/husbands & fathers being the household leaders).
They ended the conversation three different times but her inability to not “win” a conversation and just shut her mouth made her keep bringing it up. 
Then they moved on to how women dress in the workplace- which is a a touchy subject for her because she is one of those girls that thinks a bra top is acceptable but then wonders why men are looking at her. (Duh! You’re half naked and have a nice body!) This is something that upsets her husband and they have had fights about it. Yet, she loves that her husband is such a strong willed and protective Afghan/Pashtun man. (Again, duh, that’s like playing with fire and gasoline. Maybe don’t dress that way and then post yourself online and you won’t cause problems but *HE* is the problem..) 
yes, the Quran says we are equal and we have the same rights as men. We pray behind the men because, let’s be real here… if a woman is standing in front of you and then bends over, aren’t you going to look? Yes! Then you’re distracted from prayer because you had a woman’s ass in your face!!
The other sister brought up Cuomo and how he had done whatever he did with all those women to which I replied that “if they don’t like their work environment they should quit or say something when it happens!” Which she took as me telling her to quit her job and how she would never tell her daughter how to dress!
Well that made her scream at me/my husband which then triggered him to be done. 
My husband went downstairs away from her to our kids.. she tried to come charging downstairs to continue on and I stepped in front of her and said “my kids are down there..”
She then continued on about how she believes that I am fundamentally wrong about men being able to change their ways. That they will be able to not look at women sexually no matter what they wear and it shouldn’t be a problem. I straight up asked her why women pray in the back behind the men and she wouldn’t answer because she knows and if she says why, she would sound like the hypocrite she is. (We are Muslim, I am American but a convert and they were all born into this and Afghan.)

She berates her husband to her family. He isn’t good enough.. he smokes weed.. she was “patient with him finding a new job for two weeks” and then got upset that he wasn’t doing enough. (he left a very well paying overseas job to be with her!)
He makes six figures but what more can he do for her? She bought herself a nice car and the post was ridiculous “teach your daughters to be an engineer, not marry one”… 
She started a whole Instagram about female tech domination but again, wonders why her husband is upset with her attention seeking behavior. She said to me in front of him “How do you just put up with so much crap being married?” I could never imagine saying that in front of my husband to my sister with that much vengeance.
She can do no wrong. She is perfect. It’s everyone else in her workplaces that have been the problem and not her. (If everywhere you go there is a problem… you’re the problem.) it’s really sad, she’s incredibly smart and could do something really good for young girls wanting to get into engineering but she is so consumed by this chip on her shoulder that she really has placed there on herself…

I could go on.. if you’re bored and have Instagram, I can send you her name lol

TLDR: Every single awful feminist ideal that you read on here, are her beliefs and she is straight narcissistic/never wrong and women apologize too much so she’s perfect. 💁🏼‍♀️"	[]		0		False	False	[]	False	"<div class=""md""><p>She brought up the “patriarchy” but was talking about the work environment, how it’s always men that she has a problem with at work.

3annhzka	mm but to be fair, in the context you said their always needs to be proof, there was no female victim, just a dude.

flgd5	Cause, generally, men don't accuse women of sexual assault. This is largely a female exclusive problem. Men are the ones falsely accused of sexual assault exponentially more than women, and the men who might end up coming out saying anything against a woman are looked at like they're lying, lucky, or a loser. We don't hate women; we hate people who lie about us, especially when there is tangible legal recourse for the men when it happens.	1605986397.0	gd3ghlu	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gd325y3	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gd3ghlu/

6x07vhfy	No. False rape accusations are a fucking heinous crime that ruins someone's life whether it's proven false or not. As a society we currently have no way to punish criminals adequately besides prison. Personally I believe that rapists and murderers should be put down, and I still believe in the equal punishment. I understand that's extreme but the idea that it's fine to let someone ruin another persons life and get away with it is indescribably stupid in the best case scenario. So we put them in jail. And the paying of court fees for forcing someone to pay to defend themselves against a false accusation that can and almost certainly will ruin their life is a given	1605914038.0	gczpsij	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gczo27q	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gczpsij/

1e4dz6cd	They're both horrible things to endure. Unfortunately, people and especially feminists tend to dismiss the harm it causes. A Time magazine article argued that falsely accused men can "gain from the experience." In many cases, even family turns against the falsely accused.   If you're rich and powerful, it isn't necessarily fatal, but most people aren't. I've known numerous rape victims and in some cases, it still affects them even now. However, false accusations aren't shrugged off and forgotten, either.	1606029045.0	gd6h6j2	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gd4ba2s	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gd6h6j2/

Do you know what it’s like with the all men are rapist narrative that is going around, like if you get off rape then you are a rapist who got off?

The idea is that prosecuting false reporters would stop legitimate reporters from coming forward.

2jydja15	The extrapolation is based on unsuccessful rape allegations being as high as 95% in some countries. Where I am it’s about 85%. So on that basis it can be assumed that the 85% who were charged and not convicted were because the allegations were false. We know that they do not pursue false allegations so that the statistics for false allegations have almost no meaning at all and are certainly not indicative of false reporting so must totally disregard that statistic apart from the anecdotal instance that false reporting is a real thing.	1617579449.0	gtecbuk	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gte8txw	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gtecbuk/

agtuygkl	Rape is often a he said she said situation and therefore is hard to solve.

2jydja15	Well we do know that 85 to 95% of rape allegations that are prosecuted are unsuccessful, it’s very likely that they are unsuccessful because they are false.	1636094835.0	hjdxp47	t3_jxxz5f	t1_hjdx7u6	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/hjdxp47/
2jydja15	Where I am it’s not possible to report a woman for rape because it’s a gendered argument that requires that a penis is inserted, So a woman not having a penis can’t be charged with rape. That way only men can be rapists. Other gendered law are male assaults female. This is used to make it appear that men are the ones responsible for domestic violence. The internationally recognised Dunedin multi disciplinary study suggests that women are close to if not equally likely to be violent and slightly more likely to assault in a sexual way than men.	1617579927.0	gted5xz	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gtebzjy	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gted5xz/
2jydja15	Unfortunately because the legal definition is clear as to guilty and not guilty we have to be clear that a non conviction is on the basis that a rape was not proven. This is the problem with the all men are rapists and violent narrative that has been set down by the misandrist agenda. If you are saying that 5% of rapes are false reporting then you are saying that the rest are rapists that got off. This simply is not true because as already explained there is very few cases being prosecuted even when there is a clear motive such as the girl was dumped by her partner and she revenge reported him.  The system itself doesn’t prove innocence because a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. That is the basis of the legal system so there is no onus to prove innocence, let’s not confuse that with guilt either.	1617580897.0	gteev0f	t3_jxxz5f	t1_gteci2u	/r/antifeminists/comments/jxxz5f/perfectly_said/gteev0f/
2jydja15	I think we would all like to see the statistics on false rape allegations being proven false, I would be all for prosecuting all unsuccessful rape allegations just to find out.

Contrast that with "hardly any men assault women", which is closer to the truth since only a tiny percentage of men commit violent crime.  The feminist argument that the phrase "not all men" is used to refute the claim that men in general are dangerous is in itself an example of the way they try to manipulate language.	1615697896.0	gqve1wa	t3_m4maz6	t3_m4maz6	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/gqve1wa/

2jydja15	I see this type of thing all the time with women ranting about narcissistic male abusers and wonder if they know that it is most likely they have borderline personality disorder that they are even attracted to a narcissist in the first instance and if they can find one they will try to make their man as narcissistic as possible. It’s even more funny when you realize the a BPD will literally try to drive the NPD to kill them so when they say they were beaten and abused they basically got off lightly. They usually don’t mention their own history of self abuse or cutting either. And literally the bit they hate the most is that they were the cause of the violence in the first instance but take no part in accountability and expect all men to be accountable for this statistically low occurrence.	1615754807.0	gqxwaer	t3_m4maz6	t3_m4maz6	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/gqxwaer/

You becoming a racist isn't the fault of black people though, it's your own for letting an isolated experience be generalised to an entire demographic of people.   Most phobias are irrational.

N/A	Except it's not most men, it's small portion of men.If you do research into how many people are potential victims of rape and how many of them are committed by men and divide that by the population of men in the u.s. you'll find that about less than 20% of the male population are rapist.	1622761630.0	h0i09th	t3_m4maz6	t1_gsu7qau	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i09th/
ao6k6ruu	Men are afraid of violence and being killed by other men. Women are afraid of being killed by men. 97% of women have been harrassed, most of them from 12+. The system defends men, third world countries praise rapists. In Africa girls are mutilated for the mere fact they were born female. In Argentina there's a femicide every 12 hours, and a rape case every 2hs. We are killed because we are women. Men don't die because men hate them. They don't die because of their sex. It's not a competition. We have been mistreated, tortured, underestimated and abused throughout our existence and we still are. Women are less likely to be victimized on the street? Yeah, maybe because in third world women are killed in their houses, on the streets, in schools, and in the usa, they still need to walk with self defense to not get kidnapped, killed, harrassed. Get out of your bubble.	1622761530.0	h0i02ks	t3_m4maz6	t1_h0hz5tn	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i02ks/
ao6k6ruu	Lmao, not you saying it's not okay to be fearful. Right, let me just forget the fact that I fear mean because in my country and in every single country around Argentina we are killed everyday. Right? Because that's really logical. I can just forget that I fear being killed. And if not killed abused. If not abused, harrassed.  You sound stupid. Read what you just wrote again.   You really think saying "Don't be scared" to a women from a third world country is going to make sense? Fucking delusional, I'm done. "it's not okay to be hateful to an entire population". Then fight for woman's right and prove us that there are men who will stand up for us in feminism. Because so far it seems that there's rapist, men who aren't rapist but harrass us and men who don't do that but say "Yeah, just don't be afraid".   Do something then if you are so annoyed that we are afraid of men.	1622763431.0	h0i3vg2	t3_m4maz6	t1_h0i3aot	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i3vg2/

N/A	But see here's the thing women are statistically less likely to be murdered by a man in first world countries so I think it's quite weird to be telling women that is okay to be afraid of all men because they're likely to be killed by a man which isn't true okay and considering what a lot of women consider to be harassment nowadays I'm quite sure that these claims of being harassed all the time by men are quite exaggerated for example a lot of women seem to believe that being checked out,being flirted with, and being asked out on a date is harassment which is the stupid okay.	1622761928.0	h0i0v57	t3_m4maz6	t1_h0i02ks	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i0v57/

ao6k6ruu	Yeah, you only care for first world countries only clearly. Just Google how many girls have been harrassed and abused. https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures   1 in 3 women globally.    https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102269/argentina-number-femicides-month/  Women are killed by men daily. This is the situation most countries have.   So stop competing and comparing situations. Men die because of men. Women die and live in fear because of men. We need feminism because of men. You want to save men from dying? Great, make your own movement. There's no point in putting down feminism that fights for women and throw a tantrum because 'Men also die'. Then make your movement, protect men from other men. If you only bring up the fact that men die, to tell women "They shouldn't be afraid", you don't care that men die, you only care about invalidating the fact that we live in fear.   When 1 out of 3 girls are harrassed and abused we can't have the luxury of doubting which men is the good and which one is the bad.	1622762771.0	h0i2kln	t3_m4maz6	t1_h0i0v57	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i2kln/

60qc1y0g	You proved my previous argument. Everybody is afraid of that. Funny thing is if you would have asked me my answer would have been very different. So again our experiences are different and I absolutely do not understand why you try to take the experience away from people who you  don't understand and whose experiences you cannot live and therefore not know.   If you're afraid of walking on the streets you can do like women do: take a self defense course or learn a martial art; carry pepper spray; avoid empty streets and walking alone at night.   You're too young to be a Red Piller. I hope your path takes you somewhere else.

N/A	But that's not the problem I have with feminism my problem is that feminism is telling women that it's okay to be overly fearful of men as a whole which is wrong and you wouldn't be keeping the same energy if a man said that men have the right to be fearful of all women because of the horrible things committed by a small population of women. I hate people who think it's okay to view an entire group of people in the same light which is what you were saying you were saying that it's okay for women to be wary of all men and it's not I don't care what you say.okay yeah most violent crimes are perpetrated by males but the thing is that statistic doesn't show that the majority of the male population are perpetrators of heinous crimescause it doesn't.	1622763404.0	h0i3thi	t3_m4maz6	t1_h0i2kln	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i3thi/

N/A	Okay so I got a question most perpetrators of infanticide  which is when you murder a baby are women. Most statistics show that most perpetrators of neglect are woman. Do you think it is okay for men to be overly fearful of all women and assume that all women are potential baby killers and will neglect their children also just so you know I'm using your logic right which is that  it's okay for women to to be fear for of I've man and assume that all men are potential rapists that that's why you been arguing right.	1622764370.0	h0i5rfa	t3_m4maz6	t1_h0i4d96	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i5rfa/

It’s physically impossible to be alone when I’m a 6’3” white guy living in Asia. Nice try assuming that women don’t line up to gobble my misogynist cock tho. Fun times indeed.

ao6k6ruu	Sure you can assume that, I can assume men are toxic too if I want to, but that's not something that bothers me. Compared to all they've done it's not really a big problem for us. And about infanticide, if you can show me some facts validating what you say I'd appreciate, because I'm from Argentina and there's no such problem as infanticide. But there is a high rate of kids, babies and little girls being raped by men.	1622765031.0	h0i73cv	t3_m4maz6	t1_h0i6qeu	/r/antifeminists/comments/m4maz6/the_fact_that_this_got_800k_likes_disgusts_me/h0i73cv/

4uzasxrs	Oh really? They want to fix these? Pity, but "wanting" to fix issues does not solve them.  You know what feminist groups have managed to do though? They've managed to legalize domestic violence against men in the UK. They've shut down proposals for female conscription, because "that's not the kind of equality they want".

Just because black people are oppressed it means we can't also fight for the rights of other oppressed minorities? you clearly did not read the sub's description. It's not to oppose. "This sub is not hate agaisnt women, it's pointing out issues and raising awareness". I'm sorry sir/ma'am. But it sounds like you prefer to care only about one side instead of fighting for the best of ALL.     And also, that's a fine ass edgy joke you made there. Very bad.

Feminists have managed to legalise domestic violence against men in the UK. They have managed to ruin Depp's career upon accusation, but remain silent on Heard's conviction. Feminists have managed to shut down proposals of female conscription, because "that's not the kind of equality they want".

Feminism is advocacy for the rights of women to be equal to that of men.  Some outliers go further, but that's the core of the movement.  Just like we shouldn't characterize MRAs by far nexk-bearded incels. Why can't we all advocate for injustices in every group of humans?

Making up lis about rape cases is very serious and is defamation. Rape can be a pretty hard crime to prove, and is the crime with the highest rates of false reporting. The claim that men are getting off with rape, even if their is evidence is just a bare assertion, and falsehoods like this spreading leads to society reducing due process for accused men.   This feminist resorted to the incel smear, becaue they knew they had no counter argument. They go caught spreading misinfomation, so they lashed out. This is not a free speech issue.

I know the two countries he's talking about are India and Israel; it's legal for women to rape men in both of those countries and feminists are the reason why. In the US, feminists have also made it so official rape statistics don't include female-on-male rape. Feminist rape statistics like "99% of rapists are male" are based on [feminists like this](https://i.imgur.com/knGdnLf.png) who believe that a woman forcing a man to have sex is not rape.   No offense but you obviously don't know very much about feminism, I would suggest spending more time here and on other subreddits and ask questions.

4uzasxrs	Yes, no one is on Heard's side. But his career was ruined for an year. He was removed from the casting of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, following the backlash after the allegations. Later, Disney stopped their plans for their sixth Pirates film, because Depp was under so much hate and controversy. All this after an allegation.  What happened after Heard was convicted? Nothing! She won 7 million dollars in their divorce settlement, and had no opposition. She was casted for Aquaman without any doubt in the producers' mind. Get this - there is not even a fraction of the backlash against Heard compared to Depp.  And [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets) you go. Domestic violence was given a gendered definition after feminists called it a gendered issue. Would it be right to give relief checks to only families of male victims of workplace accidents, because men form a majority of workplace casualties? Then why can only women be abused under the new bill?  That's bullshit for so many more reasons, the main reason being that men form 40% of DV victims in the UK.	1591757532.0	ftjoi1m	t3_gz0wxt	t1_ftj351x	/r/antifeminists/comments/gz0wxt/he_be_spittin_straight_facts/ftjoi1m/

ftqdg	I couldn't find any information that shows bills like the ones you describe have been made into law.  In fact, the only references I find to these crazy conspiracies are on some far right MRA websites. Nothing even from official sources like the Israeli government.  So the claim is shaky to begin with.  Secondly, there is no evidence these schemes were pushed by feminists.  Men the world over believe women are the weaker sex and to believe they are incapable of rape fits with a chavuanistic and macho attitude.  It's pretty clear these cultures are very patriarchal and feminism has very little impact in these countries.  So that bunks your connection between these "laws" and feminism.  Just because something appears anti-men doesn't mean feminists are behind it.  It can just be stupid backwards patriarchal culture.  Third, statisticians the world over always caveat data that says 99% of rapes are driven by men by saying "reported rapes".  Thats like believing the US military when they say rape in general isn't a problem. Well...it's because they're not well reported.  Similarly, female to male rape is under reported.  You couldn't find me a single official statistic that doesn't caveat their language this way.  No offense, but your opinions seem pretty unsubstantiated and you obviously don't know very much about feminism.  I would suggest you spend more time backing up your claims and less time on this echo chamber of a subreddit where the term "fact" is used more loosely than when we talk about what Trump says.	1591727756.0	fti3rj7	t3_gz0wxt	t1_fth4op5	/r/antifeminists/comments/gz0wxt/he_be_spittin_straight_facts/fti3rj7/

We are talking about the fact that feminist researchers do not consider it rape when women force men to have sex.

This isn't about an "echochamber" this is something I have personally experienced. But what do you know about feminism? Have you ever done any research beyond reading a dictionary? We just established that you had no idea how feminists get their rape statistics or the fact that feminist researchers still do not consider it rape when women rape men. Did you know that NOW fought against father's rights? Did you know that the president of NOW in the mid-70s was driven out of the movement because she supported father's rights? Did you know that feminists opposed International Men's Day? Did you know feminists pushed the Duluth Model and the idea that only women are victims of DV? Did you know that feminists opposed MRAs when we tried to help male victims of DV? Did you know the world's first battered women's shelter was started by an anti-feminist MRA, and that feminists protested her once she tried helping male victims too? Did you know that Canada has a "feminist" foreign policy where they give almost all of their foreign aid to women and girls? Did you know that the Men's Rights Movement was started by feminists? Do you have any idea why MRAs started to become anti-feminist or do you still think it was just a backlash against women's rights? Do you know anything about the history of MRAs and feminists?  No you obviously don't because you're the one who's been living in an echochamber.

6nwgm8q5	MRA isn't about fixing relationships between men and women. It's about reclaiming civil rights for men.  Redpill, PUA, and MGTOW are not focused on civil rights. They focus on teaching men to jump through the hoops that women have created for them in order to cling to their relationships - to be the emotionless strong man breadwinner women want. It's an embarrassment that men subjugate themselves like this.  They encourage strong-man posturing and a self-defeating individualism that leads to exactly these kind of comments: just lay low, toughen up, and let society fuck you.  It's good for members of any group to criticize it and to call its mission into question at times. Questioning things leads to growth and insight.  We're not here to study the bible.

16live0e	Thank you for your sensible argument. Is there anyone who focuses on fixing the relationship between men and women? :(  I agree with some of what you say. But there are a few misconceptions. PUAs are the only group that focuses on trying to get into bed with women.  Both Red pill and MGTOW advise you to stay away from women as society will always take the woman's side and the law is completely biased towards women, so she can easily screw you over with a few words or tears. MGTOW actually advocates building yourself to be a better person which is definitely a good thing.  I have been on both sides and I have noticed while MRAs criticise them for being too extreme (because they have given up), they criticise MRAs for being too soft and basically begging for rights and wanting to be treated like women when instead they should make men be accepted for what they are.  But at the end of the day, the sad part is that media in general just paints all of them as neckbeards/incels who hate women.  Try mentioning men's rights to your friends and see how quickly they react and try to shut you down. I don't understand how simply advocating for rights for men is somehow hating and oppressing women. Heck, even pointing out how society uses men and treats them as disposable is in no way misogynistic.	1591689030.0	ftgf806	t3_gz0wxt	t1_ftgdu4y	/r/antifeminists/comments/gz0wxt/he_be_spittin_straight_facts/ftgf806/

6nwgm8q5	Sure, PUAs are just trying to get men in bed with women by "passing their shit tests" and develop covertly narcissistic traits, which just turns men into weasels.  As for MTGOW and Red Pill, but there are plenty of YouTubers that emphasize relationships, and some are just outright rebranding traditional conservative ideas. MTGOW advocates against marriage, not necessarily relationships. There are plenty of MGTOW folks that brag about their body count, which is just another form of strong-man posturing. There are Red Pill dating strategies, too.  I've been mentioning male rights IRL for years, and everyone reacts differently. Some people actually respected me more for being honest and not sucking up like a male feminist. It's limiting in some ways. It closes some doors, but it doesn't close all of them. In fact, it opens a few.  As a man, most people don't actually care about your actual beliefs. They just care about your status. Status can protect you in some ways, but it can also make you into a target. If you make enemies, people will try to tear you down no matter what beliefs you are open about.	1591710884.0	fth5fm0	t3_gz0wxt	t1_ftgf806	/r/antifeminists/comments/gz0wxt/he_be_spittin_straight_facts/fth5fm0/

3vugy7h2	My real life first cousin did this many years ago, had sex with some guy then was afraid of her parents' and conservative neighbors/townspeople slut shaming her and claimed it was rape. That poor innocent guy was sentenced to some years in jail, I don't remember how many but he's out now I think.  My cousin on the other hand was traumatized for a few months because she had to talk about it and lie at court, then she got over it and continued being a total harlot. Using the rape victim tag she broke free of her conservative parents' control and fucked to her heart's content at college. Since then she walked out on a wedding on the wedding day, got married to another guy and divorced after having a child and now dates a much younger guy while her mother looks after her child.

One big problem behind so many false narratives involving oppression and alleged injustice affecting one group and benefitting another is the nonexistence of responsibility for one group of alleged victims alongside an unfair expectation from the alleged oppressors.

4zsa85wi	you don't get my point do you? it's not about funding, it's about individual preference. Most people that watch sports prefer male sports so the most watched will bring in more. same way female models earn more than male models, because brands prefer females. they have more roles and therefore get paid more than the male models, it's not rocket science.	1592709777.0	fvi6kig	t3_gv3gi5	t1_fvfgyrq	/r/antifeminists/comments/gv3gi5/in_a_nutshell/fvi6kig/
