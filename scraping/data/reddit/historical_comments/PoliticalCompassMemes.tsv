5x18yjze	The argument would be that they still have representation, even if they are not yet an elector of that representative. The difference between this scenario and that of the colonies is that the latter simply did not have representation in the British Parliament; there was no Lords from the Americas, and the Commons drew no Members from the colonies. It's not that you couldn't elect your representative, but that you had no representative to advocate for your community at all.  &#x200B;  If we interpret representation to be someone you voted for, then surely those who lose in an election ought not to pay taxes? They likewise do not have representation insofar as they could not select who represents them.	1590649697.0	fs2dag3	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2dag3/

The elected officials for an area are *supposed* to represent the interests of all their constituents - which is why the census counts *people* not *voters*  But politics in the US has devolved to only representing the interests of those who voted for you, and fuck the rest.	1590651281.0	fs2f26o	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2f26o/

N/A	They aren't taxed. Single returns have standardized deductions of \~12,700, which young people have too.

163hgc	I have a thought in a similar vein about the draft. Now really we should abolish the draft, but if we keep it, in addition to it being gender-equal, people should only have to register after the first Congress takes session after the first even-number year election that person is entitled to vote in. So for example, if you turned 18 after the 2016 election, you wouldn't have to register until January 2019, after the 2018 election which was the first you could vote in. That way the person has at least some ability to exercise consent before potentially being sent to their death. Of course this kind of assumes wars have to be approved by Congress, which isn't how it is in practice.

N/A	Meanwhile every accountant sees the 800 problems that this would cause.  If this were true, mega wealthy families would distribute fuck loads of money to their children and not pay any tax. This is why children are taxed at higher rates. If you want the rich to pay virtually no tax, then by all means, let's implement this policy.  If children had the same tax rates as adults, wealthy individuals would distribute money to their children every year. Technically it's the child's but the parents could argue that it's to cover expenses to pay for the child (School equipment, the time spent on them picking them up/dropping off, etc).   It sucks, but I do not think that avoiding tax on children would be practical.  You could say "but just exempt dividends and trust distributions" - then the child would just be a contractor, or employee. You would then ban children from being able to do contracts for money, but that would cause issues with people I personally know (which implies it's fairly common). You ban children from being employees? I'm sure a 16 year old would rather pay tax than be exempt from a job.  You could implement a test to see if they're being paid appropriately for the work being done, but that would be an uphill battle from the start and a *huge* drain on the system, holy shit the effort it takes to verify this already for partnerships is crazy high.  It sucks, but honestly, it's there for a reason. SMH reddit.  Not a single person here has thought critically about this and has instead just gone along with it in agreement. I agree with u/paulddraper about felons though. That would likely be a better starting point than minors.	1590637861.0	fs1xj8e	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1xj8e/

579varnv	Well if you don’t want to pay taxes, I think you also should not enjoy the benefits of government spending that comes from taxation. Your parents claim you as a dependent on their tax return and in some countries, the government gives your parents childcare benefits of hundreds monthly.  Also if you don’t pay taxes, then police shouldn’t protect you. Schools shouldn’t educate you, if you don’t want to be a part of the system.	1590639729.0	fs20cxo	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs20cxo/
