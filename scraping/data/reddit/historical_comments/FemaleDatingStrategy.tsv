N/A	Wow I really appreciate this as that is such a negative narrative that I see among my older age group. Like we 'let ourselves go' intentionally and completely disregards a vast majoritu of us solely responsible for child rearing, home management, usually also working FT, and perhaps by our ages battling health issues. It is sad. And they like to throw in the exception not the rule stories of women they know who "dropped babies" and got those bodies back immediately, too. Even some shady male coaches are somewhat realistic in saying to plan that the woman you marry and have babies with likely will go up a dress size naturally. (They still suck also yet at least they are telling their audience to be somewhat realistic about what child birth does to our bodies)	1622050651.0	gzjemiq	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzjemiq/

I haven’t cried since well before I moved out.   My friends told me how pale and sad I looked, how my eyes became sunken in, how much weight I was losing. I’m happy the chapter is closed.

rdiu0	I'd like to give some context. The lady in the picture is honeypreet insaan.  She was born to parents who followed a new age Indian guru. The guru introduced her to the son of a high ranking politician and matched them. As an adult woman, she was adopted by the guru and she became his favorite daughter. She worked as a director, producer and other roles for the wacky Guru's wacky projects. The guru was then arrested for raping to of his young female followers. Honeypreet came to the limelight after she escorted him to the investigation organisations headquarters.  Her husband (the politician's son)  made claims that honeypreet and her adoptee father actually had sexual relations.  He later apologised but the guru definitely tried to push her in the limelight. It is speculated he was trying to train her to take over his cult.  Later his cult members rioted and killed a lot of people when he was  convicted for rape and it was thought that honeypreet orchestrated these riots. She was arrested. The first picture is her posing next to the guru and the second is her mugshot in jail.  The memes were made against her because people hated the guru and his cult members then.  Meme's still sexist tho.	1622081982.0	gzladt3	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzladt3/

b9nfp72p	Statistically, unmarried (never married) women are the happiest demographic. Unmarried men are the unhappiest. Married experience less depression and addiction, and they live longer than their unmarried counterparts. *The exact opposite* of all of that is true for married women. Marriage is literally the worst thing so many women can do to themselves.   And yet men still think they’re the prize and like single women must be so miserable without them. Not only do women not need them, but they’re far better off without them	1622061396.0	gzk4dvp	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzk4dvp/

houv1en	I hate when men post women photos for meme's.  The difference in photo to me is happiness. Its scary men don't care about how depressed and sad she looks and more about her not wearing makeup/dressing up all the time. They wonder why women divorce more than men.   The fact that men expect us to look like dolls 24/7 is gaslighting. Any man who has dated women for certain amount of time knows we don't wear it 24/7. So what if women dress down when married when women are considered lucky if we get men who dress [this](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.shopify.com%2Fs%2Ffiles%2F1%2F0053%2F2224%2F4211%2Fproducts%2Fblue_white_1200x1200.jpg%3Fv%3D1556746073&f=1&nofb=1) way let alone something nicer.

84o9i8oi	She looks like someone who's in a refugee or concentration camp. That is so sad and how do they not get that she looks like that because of what her husband did to her and has put her through? Men are so blind to this stuff it's heart-wrenching and frustrating on levels I can't even put words to. I feel like it's pointless trying to talk to them at all. Even if you are completely logical and cite all kinds of facts and what women have been going through for the duration of human history they will still find some way to blow you off and blame everything on you.  I feel like I'm at the stage of my healing process right now where I have to let go of the hopeful illusions/delusions I've had and deal with the reality that I've always known but really look at square in the face that most men are just absolutely completely horrible and the really truly good ones are anomalies.  It's also stunning to me to think how many men think that if they're not beating or straight up violently raping their wives that they're not hurting them in any way. This meme clearly shows otherwise. my heart breaks for this woman and I hope she's in a better place right now or that she is able to get to a better place and be happy and feel alive and vibrant!	1622073241.0	gzktoqd	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzktoqd/

1o7m7q4i	Since I’ve been divorced (beginning of 2018), I’ve moved around a bit and have had to update my drivers license both times. The most recent DL pic and the DL pic I had taken right after the breakup are literally like night and day. When I first compared them, I loved that I looked much happier and healthier in my recent one. On the other hand, I was sad bc I allowed myself to become so unhealthy and miserable during that marriage. My skin had no color, my eyes had bags under them, I was easily 50lbs heavier, I had a noticeably forced smile... At that moment,  I decided I most likely will not re-marry. I have been my happiest as a single lady. Meeting a HVM would be the only reason I’d change my mind.	1622096382.0	gzlwpju	t3_nlkkof	t3_nlkkof	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzlwpju/

Her passport photo from then versus now is like two different people.	1622055805.0	gzjr0q8	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzj9bq2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzjr0q8/

84o9i8oi	The ways that men find it funny to torture us and taunt us and do a variety of other things to make us squirm and be uncomfortable absolutely blows my mind.  A wife is always always always a reflection of her husband and his love and how he treats her, whether it's good or bad!	1622073856.0	gzkuzbs	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjc2gv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzkuzbs/
N/A	Yes. I see a lovely wife who looks physically exhausted. Her husband is not making sure she is rested and has the funds to maintain as best as she can now. And that is sad. My mom and dad have been married nearly 50 years. She has always been a homemaker. He makes sure she has whatever spending money she needs for her Estee Lauder, perfume, haircuts, facials on holidays, and replacing clothes. He buys her a new purse every Christmas and full perfume set. Sometimes she finds 2 3 new ones she likes and buys all of them. He writes down sizes for her Winter clothes and will go to the store to surprise her with new ones. They are modestly wealthy Dave Ramsey types and he makes sure he provides whatever she needs and has money. (She doesnt like to go to the bank anymore now that she is older and so I watch him when I'm over sometimes put money in a drawer for her and he asks if there's anymore she needs if she has other things she wants to do that week).

kh0i2	Men always like to tell me how much more they get hit on with a wedding ring on but really, I know it is so much more than that. They are probably looking good because their wives are taking good care of them, picking out nice clothes for them, telling them to get regular haircuts/shaving, feeding them well, watching the children while they go to the gym, etc.	1622056526.0	gzjsqrb	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjkm5z	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzjsqrb/

They'd often say they wanted a woman who they could go out for meals with and she'd eat anything. I have several food allergies and I get sick if I eat certain foods, I've adjusted to it and it's mostly not a big deal but several men I spoke to clearly saw it as a negative thing, as if I've chosen to have these allergies. One guy was mean saying he thought what I had 'would be a nightmare' and he was apparently very glad he didn't have the same allergies. Meanwhile my ex used to get nasty about what I ate, accusing me of eating too much when I was rapidly becoming underweight due to the stress of dating him. I'm a great cook so they all missed out lol. I don't want to date anyone who is mean about me having allergies, it's the opposite of being a loving and supportive partner.	1622060547.0	gzk2dno	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjgyns	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzk2dno/

10lcgk	Oh gosh this is very true. Speaking of sense of security... I once befriended a guy when out at a restaurant bar waiting for friends, who I read as gay. I'm not usually off in this dept. Not to be offensive or judgy or anything, but I felt more comfortable just chatting with him and making plans to hang out again sometime because I saw he wasn't gonna try anything. We met up down the line and talked about art and everything and I was still getting some of these non straight signals. Nope found out down the line he actually wanted to date me. I've given up on making new guy friends, they always try something even knowing I'm in a relationship. They do this to themselves. We can't just be nice and friendly ffs.	1622080719.0	gzl879p	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzku1a9	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzl879p/

I was a junior bridesmaid once,and the bride(aunt) wanted me to come with a full face of makeup and waxed legs. 'Luckily',I got away with curled hair, waxed legs, high-wedged shoes and trimmed armpits.

v4qqb	The funny thing is, I watched documentaries with people who wears makeup all the time, some even to their sleep and they look... older and greasy. That makeup can't hide how tired they are and how skin just wants to do its thing but being constantly blocked. So unless you have a team of professionals for continuous touch up, you will never look "perfect". Bare-faced people actually look younger and fresher.	1622087350.0	gzljsgj	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjmt2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzljsgj/
84o9i8oi	Oh my goodness I'm so sorry! I wish your grandmother would have told you how beautiful you are without that stuff and that you don't need it!   I would love to see women celebrate their natural beauty more! The makeup these days looks like getting ready to go deep sea diving for your face and I cringe when I watch the videos of women making themselves up because I feel like they're covering themselves up completely, meaning you're no longer seeing their actual beautiful face. You're just seeing makeup, almost like a mask. Sometimes it makes me want to cry and I know that might sound silly but I would like to see women showing off their natural beauty more! And if using makeup, just like bare minimum stuff for some extra pizzazz, for enhancement, not covering up. 🥰	1622073386.0	gzktzsn	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjmt2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzktzsn/

84o9i8oi	I cannot upvote this enough! This a million bazillion times infinity plus one! It's the absolute truth! And I am so happy for you and your marriage! That's the way it should be! Jane Austen has a great quote where she says if you both seek to make each other happy then you will both end up happy! 🥰🤗  I know this example isn't the same but it just shows when people treat you well you respond better. So years ago I took a job as a nanny through answering an ad in my local paper. It sounded great & amazing but once I got the job I was in for a very rude awakening! I found out that several of the things listed in the ad were actual lies or misrepresentations & they ended up overworking me. Everything about the whole situation was just a big mess. I loved the little boy & I loved the little girl too but the little girl was very spoiled! I also got paid the least amount of money out of all the nannies in the area while I had the most duties. On one of my heavy duty days I was assigned to change the water in a flower vase--last on my to-do list because everything else was more important. So I was in the mud room doing a bazillion loads of laundry when the mother came in holding this vase & she was seriously pissed! She chastised me for not changing the water in the vase & said, 'You know, we hired you to make our lives easier.' I have no words! In spite of everything I did not change how I was with the kids or how I did my job for the duration.  All that said, this is how I learned it's better to go through a nannying agency--they make sure the families are on the up & up & same thing for the nannies. Families get a good nanny, nannies are taken care of properly & paid well! Second job I had was a temporary fill-in till the mother's cousin was to come down. I don't know if that family made as much money as the first family or not. It was a live out job whereas the other one was live in. But they paid me WAAAY better than the first family! They paid me time & 1/2 if I worked on days off as well. The mother literally only wanted me doing things for her 2 young boys. She was still nursing their 6-month-old so she needed help. But because this family was so sweet with me & I just loved the mother & the kids so much I did anything I could to help her out around the house even if it wasn't part of my job. Part of me probably would've done it anyway cuz that's just how I am but it really made me want to more!  That's how it is when women get love poured into them! 🥰🤗	1622087687.0	gzlkc86	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzlfng2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzlkc86/
N/A	The mistaken thinking in this is assuming that these kinds of men WANT to be happy... no, they are often miserable narcs/sociopaths/abused-child-turned-abusers who aim to make you feel the kind of misery they feel all the time.

e6r4g	its crazy. my grandma had a really hard life and is pretty stupid, probably not officially low IQ but kinda close. has a huge issue with like caring about what other people think of you. growing up she shit on everything i did cause i was into skate boarding and didnt dress as girly as my other cousin. really reinforced the bullshit 'im not like other girls' stereotype for me growing up. even now she refuses to believe that i'm happy because i dont have a husband. like i have a professional degree, somewhat high paying job, a beautiful penthouse apartment, buy everything i need and most of what i want, have great friends and other family member relationships, am into a few hobbies, and she'll be like 'what about a man'. meanwhile her and my grandpa have absolutely hated eachother for 10 years and treat eachother pretty shitty. from the outside/male mindset/her mindset im a crazy cat lady and thats all that matters.  also as i have moved up in my career she will shit on me and be like 'really, you can do all this, you think you can handle living there? etc' and when i push back at how i succeed in everything i do and havent failed before, why is she acting like i have?(note: this is because i currently have no problems working 24/7 on tasks and i only take reasonable risks) shell be like oh well im just scared cause you live alone. one time i hung up a bunch of plants and was proud of how nice it looked and sent pics. everyone compliments it and shes just like omg you did that yourself please be careful.   i just 'grey rock' her and give her little info about my life. i love her and have tried so hard with her, shes made some progress in her behavior but shes still a miserable person and i dont have time for misery   end rant	1622060121.0	gzk1czr	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzjyvvh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzk1czr/

5vhe0zcp	It's weird isn't it? Several of these men were much more bothered by my food allergies than I am. I often forget I have them, it's only if I got to restaurants that I remember other people eat a lot of other things but restaurants are usually very helpful and have several things I can eat. And otherwise I make nice meals at home and try out new recipes etc. I guess these men want 'hamburger and chips with a pint down the pub' type women and see me as being too difficult because I can't and won't eat that type of food. I think it's because they know that they'll have to be more tolerant and try out different foods if they are in a partnership with me and they don't want any sort of change.	1622077276.0	gzl1wtk	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzkn7bs	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzl1wtk/

All seafood tastes and smells awful to me, the hours of diarrhea and vomiting were just reinforcement to not eat the stuff. I'm not missing out on anything since even seafood places offer other protein options.  But because my throat doesn't close up, I don't have/need an epipen, and because I never had any testing (my body's response in the first place is all the testing I need thanks), men seem to think it's not a legitimate issue and that I need to PROVE to them seafood makes me sick!!!!! 😡😡😡  If I'm going to purposely trigger severe gastrointestinal distress for someone, it will be at home, for myself, with some expensive whole milk and a pan of home made brownies.	1622118364.0	gzmn7p8	t3_nlkkof	t1_gzl1wtk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/nlkkof/oops/gzmn7p8/

And from what I've heard the bros don't grunt and throw things down like the ones at Max Fitness (never been so wouldn't know).

We would even relax in the whirlpool after and chat. I got into great shape and it was wonderful.	1616703720.0	gs7pkdw	t3_md66ux	t3_md66ux	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs7pkdw/
zelor	I could care less about seeing a gut here and there in the wild....just stop staring at me, assholes. That's why I  love yoga classes. Scotes think it's too feminine to join in, and woke bros join but realize they have to try harder since flexibility is more of a female attribute, and they tend to quit.	1616709065.0	gs81f0a	t3_md66ux	t3_md66ux	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs81f0a/

1673gu	THIS! I went to PF yesterday and was using the hip adductor machine. I began to notice that any time I looked to the side during my rest sets, a middle aged man was watching me intently. Any time I happened to glance in that direction we would lock eyes.  I moved machines, and he conveniently moved machines as well to one that was across from me and just kept staring at me! I moved machines again, and he repeated the same process and maintained the creepy eye contact and staring. I was so freaked out that I went to the first floor to get away from him.	1616707110.0	gs7x6v1	t3_md66ux	t3_md66ux	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs7x6v1/

N/A	Male behavior is abhorrent. If they act like mindless, mannerless, depraved creatures, why should we treat them any different? It fills me with rage to see how many women in this thread have suffered disgusting male behavior while trying to work out. Why don’t they get it?? We don’t exist for their enjoyment in fact, most women would probably be happy to only interact with men once every Thursday, provided they were in a safety box with a leash.	1616725341.0	gs8xglo	t3_md66ux	t3_md66ux	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs8xglo/

3nhes4sa	I gave up on going to my little apartment gym alone because of this shit. And the “stop dressing slutty” male brigade can STFU. My friend was leered at while in hijab and loose jogging clothes and said she’d never go to the gym alone again either.   An old man grabbed my elbow without permission and told me I was using a machine wrong and was going to “help” teach me...I hadn’t even started using it yet. He wasn’t even working out! He was eating a sandwich and talking on the phone when I came in.   He didn’t take me seriously when I moved away from him until my now-husband showed up; then I guess he thought, oh, she is some man’s property. 🙄 He kept questioning if my husband is my personal trainer...seems he couldn’t believe he was my BF, maybe because we’re an interracial couple...who knows? But regardless, the old creep only left me alone because of another man’s presence. Disgusting. When I left, he was slamming weights down and making a racket on the floor, which was above the manager’s office. I reported his scrotatious behavior to them because I knew they had banned another guy for inappropriately touching their staff. Yes, men actually go to the gym and try to grope the apartment staff in front of everyone, usually by asking for “hugs.”	1616708938.0	gs8155f	t3_md66ux	t3_md66ux	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs8155f/

5j89om9r	99% of men who use gyms fall into one or more categories:  * Creep and spy on women * Sweat all over the machines/benches and never clean them * Never re-rack their weights, leaving them for everyone else to either trip over or remove before you can use the bench  Very few men treat the people and the equipment at the gym with respect. In other words, they act the same way at the gym as they do at home. Probably another way to vet a man while dating. 🤣 Does he clean up after himself? Does he stare at other women? Is he willing to listen to advice or otherwise accept help from a woman at the gym?  When I still used the gym I went at slow times (weekdays after 8pm and weekends after 3pm) to avoid as many men as possible. Or I did group classes with mostly women (yoga, pilates, kickboxing). Now I get most of my exercise outside or using my home gym.	1616704648.0	gs7roi7	t3_md66ux	t3_md66ux	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs7roi7/

9mccjcq0	Sometimes even female only gyms don’t stop creeps. I was taking a women’s self defense class and a homeless man went up to the window and started touching himself while we were stretching. Watching us. I’m not sure I was the only one that noticed but I let some employees at the shopping center know after I was finished with class.    I thought I was in a safe space because the class was all women but creeps will still try to invade our spaces.   I used to also go to a local gym that had a small women’s workout area, thats one of the reasons why I joined. But when men would workout in the area no one said anything and the rules weren’t enforced. Sometimes I’d see them staring at women while they did their squats. Men ignored the signs that said women only.  It didn’t matter that the gym was huge, had tons of equipment and was 2 stories with tons of male dominated space and better equipment. Men still felt the need to be in the small room just for women.   There was also a time when I was at that gym and was about to get dressed in the locker room. The women’s locker room. I overheard a man talking to his female friend. A man was literally in the women’s locker room like it was nothing.	1616713199.0	gs89x0m	t3_md66ux	t3_md66ux	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs89x0m/

5dmz7k4g	Omg same. Except I noticed this one single time in my life. And I wasn’t even at the gym.   I was at my little sister’s HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. I was maybe 22 at the time and the ceremony had just ended. Hanging out by myself in an empty-ish portion of the convention center hall when I get approached by this older man. Grey hair, suit, the whole thing that screams “I’m a dude in my 50s and enjoy watching freshly 18 year old girls walk around in semi-formal attire with their families”.  I don’t remember the conversation but he made me uncomfortable despite the politeness of the conversation. I remember him saying either his daughter or niece had just graduated (!!!), asked me some personal questions that I answered vaguely, while he just stood their smirking and smiling something greasy. I somehow got away from the conversation to rejoin my family.   Minutes. Minutes later I see him standing about 30ft away from me taking pictures of me on his phone. In a very non discreet way. I’ve never felt so dirty while having done nothing wrong.	1616725295.0	gs8xdiu	t3_md66ux	t1_gs7pfrk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs8xdiu/

6pejr7kd	I make a point of looking at people who are likely to perv (read: LVM looking guys). I've always felt anxious going to the gym, been going for years and in every single gym there's been a scrote harassing me during a session. I've been sworn at for moving away from someone, had guys follow me around and conveniently always be behind me on the machines, grab the weights from me to "help" me put them back.. name it. I can be running on the treadmill and always have to glance around to watch out for disgusting LVM leering and/or filming. I have to change my session numerous times.  Guys who look like this (unattractive, middle aged, beer bellied, disgusting dress sense, no hygiene) literally ALWAYS perv too. Of course the attractive young guys can be inappropriate too, but if I'm around a guy like this he always starts staring shamelessly.

mx5npgj	That sounds like so much fun! I'd love to lift with nuns. Not enough women go to the weights section of my gym, but I've been seeing more since it opened again. I always feel more comfortable lifting when other women are around.  About two weeks ago, I was in my little hiding corner where I like to do free weights because it's not directly in front of the mirror, and this random guy comes over. I thought he was going to ask me for one of the dumbbells I was using. Instead he stopped to tell me, "I didn't mean to stare, but I thought you were my ex. You looked at me." Man, I can't see for shite without glasses or contacts, so I had no idea what he was even talking about. It was super creepy.	1620585014.0	gxitu51	t3_md66ux	t1_gs7pkdw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gxitu51/

88zmpwbq	Laws for video and/or  audio recording depend on the state in the US. I think it's illegal in most places to film in bathrooms and locker rooms or take unconsented shots of naked people. Private business can add further restrictions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography_and_the_law   Generally it's legal to film or photograoh in public spaces. In some states audio recording without all-party consent is a felony but you can videotape anywhere in places that don't have an expectation if privacy. In some states you can audio record anyone without consent.   The reason I don't support a sweeping ban in public filming is because people wouldn't be able to record police violence. Also as a former advocate for domestic violence,  audio and/or video recording violent abuse/threats was one of the main tools we'd recommend for victims to file charges, win lawsuits and get orders of protection. I think women should  be able to surrepticiously record harassment at work. There were also a slew of cases of disabled children being violently abused by staff in schools and institutions that were exposed because parents planted recording devices in their kids'clothes or backpacks. Since about three disabled individuals a week--mostly children-- are killed by staff in schools and institutions accirding to a very old study by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis (1989, and nothing has improved since),  any means of protecting children should be legal.   But I'm all in for women-only gyms.	1616729412.0	gs94qn0	t3_md66ux	t1_gs8xuml	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/md66ux/why_are_males/gs94qn0/

The full list of dealbreakers is much longer for me, but trying to elicit pity is now my #1 red flag that I'm dealing with a loser (at best) or a predator (at worst).  Healthy people want to impress you and be seen as competent. Losers and predators have nothing worthwhile to show you and they know it, so they try to hook you with pity. It's like a Trojan horse. If you fall for it, they'll gain access to your inner life, destroy your boundaries from the inside out, and take you for a ride.  When I was a pickme, I fell for pity a lot. Now I can't tell you what a turnoff it is. My libido instantly dries up and I think the person is an asshole.	1624982118.0	h3g9nc3	t3_oa6s4m	t3_oa6s4m	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/oa6s4m/please_share_stories_of_some_weirdly_specific/h3g9nc3/
