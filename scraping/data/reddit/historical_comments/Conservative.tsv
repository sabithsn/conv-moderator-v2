This isn't going anywhere else.  *Edit to answer many comments defending the rioters: I understand that we have achieved nothing peacefully, everything has been losses for decades. It's painful, honestly. But if this doesn't start a war, and we win it, it will just hurt right wingers. And I don't see a war happening, nor I want one. A great man once said: "but what can we do? Get together, get working and inspire other people like yourself". That's the way to win imo. Being the best, and inspiring others to follow us. This won't inspire anyone. I'll be glad to read your thoughts.  *Edit 2: Thank you so much for the award!	1609969598.0	gicmnym	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gicmnym/

2zkgg0	I'm curious about what other conservatives think of the videos recorded at Capitol Hill that show two things:  1. Capitol security pushing barricades out of the way, with no pushback to rioters, thereby giving the rioters access to the building  2. Once inside, the rioters chatting nonchalantly with Capitol police and one rioter even taking a selfie with one  None of that makes a lick of sense, especially given the violence that erupted after. It's the U.S. Capitol, a historic site where (sometimes) important work is done for this country. You would think it would be heavily guarded and with great effort with a protest in process. Yet, it seems the people guarding it weren't doing their job not only to the best of their ability, but AT ALL.	1610097648.0	giixpip	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/giixpip/

15of7uqn	This really set us back. A bunch of young hot heads just screwed us over. Senators and representatives that were going to object to the shady electors totally reversed stance after this happened. These morons just couldn’t sit tight and see how the process went before they lost their cool. And, now, nothing at all will be done to address the issue or secure future elections.   It’s pretty unfair. The left has been burning and looting and vandalizing cities all year and those in power didn’t care to do anything about it and the powers that be and the media even claimed it was justified. Both Biden and Harris made statements supporting the riots. But, this is now the biggest calamity to ever hit America. And, that kind of one sided crap is wrong.   But, the world isn’t fair. Sometimes you have to deal with unfair, stay calm, and work to achieve your goals. If you’re not on the left, you simply can’t hope to go off halfcocked and think it’s all going to be ok.  The one thing the right had going for it was that, although we are deplorables and racists and fascists, we didn’t go around busting crap up. We were rational and law abiding people.   Now, we are all going to be condemned by the actions of a small portion of the people that went down for the protest. And, since we aren’t the left, no one will say it was justified or mostly peaceful ( although, it mostly was; especially composted to what went on all year).  I’m pretty pissed at these people for screwing us up because they just couldn’t keep their cool and stay the course long enough to see if congress was actually going to do anything about election security or not. I hope they’re happy knowing they threw us to the wolves	1610006166.0	gielku3	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gielku3/

N/A	The best perspective in regards to this I found from /r/GoldandBlack:  ____________________________________  The most startling thing about the commentary surrounding this is the lamentation of scaring elected officials and damaging a government building as if that's the cornerstone of what makes America great. By comparison, it was a fringe, unacceptable position this summer to condemn the destruction of small businesses which **literally are** what makes America great - enterprising people who support themselves and their families by serving their communities.  And of course by "over the summer" I mean in regards to BLM protests. That's not even beginning to touch on the government response to the pandemic. That's a similar scary parallel where it has been viewed as virtuous to rat on your neighbors for trying to make a living or having a party, closing others' businesses via threat of force is the status quo, and a non-elected government official who outright lies to the American people was celebrated as a hero.	1609991242.0	gidy1iy	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gidy1iy/
