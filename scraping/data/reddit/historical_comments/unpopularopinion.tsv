je1ip	People are already criticizing Jada. The difference is will Smith is a huge celebrity while Jada isnt. So if he did something questionable of course it would get lore attention.   If Jada were more famous the backlash she would be getting would be a lot larger.   Also the reason people are making fun of Will Smith is because he is a sex symbol and icon, so no one would ever imagine his wife cheating on him.	1594811475.0	fy4t1cf	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy4t1cf/

4kkb2vq8	Lmao another "men are victims" post with zero merit. As if plenty of high profile men don't cheat on their women all the fucking time, people don't care. Jada was slut shamed all over when the news came out so I don't know what rock you're living under, then again you can't acknowledge the truth because that ruins your narrative. And like many others have said, there have been rumors of them having an open marriage for a very long time. I believe those rumors to be true. Even if we believe their story, they BOTH say they felt their marriage was over at the time and that they were separated. That's not cheating either way you slice it.	1594815750.0	fy4ybmc	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy4ybmc/

Men know that men ADORE their children.  Get ready to be triggered. in the USA.  The number 1 abusers of children are drumrollll single moms.  The number 2 abusers of children are, suprise, the unrelated boyfriends of the single moms. Biological fathers are at the very very bottom of the list for abusing their children.

bueoe3g	They have an open relationship. Will and Jada both have been living the promiscuous, swinger type life style for a long time. The only difference in this case being that Will didn't know about or condone this specific relationship, or something to that extent. They have a godless abomination of a "marriage", and with all the starving kids in Africa and whatnot, I just don't have enough fucks to give about either one of them cheating on each other. lol They invited this kind of toxicity into their marriage by engaging in that sort of lifestyle. That whole family is fucking weird. Polyamorous relationships are dysfunctional, especially when children are involved. Also, I doubt getting cheated on hits the same way when you own a 30 million dollar home on 400 acres and can fuck all the beautiful twenty-something year old women you want, any time you want. lol Absolutely no one should be surprised that there was infidelity in this relationship, I know I wasn't.	1594801108.0	fy4imd4	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy4imd4/

5w442vef	Will HAD stepped out on Jada, though. Years ago he was carrying on with a woman that he just happened to appear in the same place with more than one time. The Smiths BEEN had this sort of relationship. That it‚Äôs just now being openly spoken of is really mostly because Alsina got in his feelings and spoke about him and Jada in interviews.	1594816120.0	fy4yu34	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy4yu34/

4bczbqus	Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but Jada did not cheat on Will. Will asked for them to spend some time separated and told Jada to go make herself happy without him. They talk about how they were temporarily separated when this happened.  For the record I do think it was fucked for her to have a sexual relationship with a 23 year who was coming to her for help with his severe mental health issues. But I see soooooo many people slamming her for ‚Äúcheating on/betraying‚Äù Will and thats not what I got from the situation at all. Yes it might still hurt you but if you tell your partner you want to separate and they date someone else they aren‚Äôt cheating on you.  Also they straight up said that Will was also having a relationship with someone else, but they never had to publicly address it because his other partner didn‚Äôt make a freakin‚Äô music video about it like August	1594817283.0	fy50inu	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy50inu/

1oxiijk5	I was under the impression that she didn't cheat? I believe they both acknowledged that they were separated at the time. Either way, no one should be making fun of him.	1594818119.0	fy51t0w	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy51t0w/
t427m	I downvoted because this isn't popular or unpopular. Frankly, I don't really care that she cheated, and wouldn't care if he cheated.	1594818254.0	fy520pa	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy520pa/
2nyvbdmv	I‚Äôm pretty sure Will has had relations outside their marriage... I remember a long time ago reading an interview where she talked about how amazing he was so she understands why women want him and that he‚Äôs a man and as long as she‚Äôs the one he comes home to then she‚Äôs ok with it or something....	1594818410.0	fy529gx	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy529gx/

4oqbvvex	Didn‚Äôt they both agree that they were not together when it happened? I mean it‚Äôs still pretty crappy to bang someone else while you‚Äôre taking a break from each other but I wouldn‚Äôt consider it cheating. I thought the whole reason this was aired is she felt guilty not that it happened, but about who it was with.	1594818774.0	fy52uca	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy52uca/

3jjpib1x	Every single incel memer on the internet seems to be using this incident to qualify that women are never happy, even if they‚Äôre married to Will Smith. Instagram and Facebook has been full of randos with misogynistic posts the last few days. Do I remember this wrong or did these two actually go on record saying that they had an open marriage?	1594818812.0	fy52wid	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy52wid/

4pofob35	I dont agree, everyone is supporting him (which I find great), I didnt saw anyone making fun of him, and also I dont think its cheating, I read that they were at a bad point in their marriage and Will gave his blessing to the relationship, idk if where I read it wasnt a reliable source but it was one of the first sites to pop up, so I dont think that you have investigated before posting	1594818947.0	fy534bw	t3_hrivbj	t3_hrivbj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hrivbj/if_will_smith_had_cheated_on_jada_the_internet/fy534bw/
