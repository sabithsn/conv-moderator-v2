14kf4u	NTA  This is a recurring theme here on Reddit, people do not consider themselves thieves:  > Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset. Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said "my daughters aren't thieves!!!  They seem to be under the wrongful impression that to be a thief you *have to* wear a mask and carry a crowbar. But theft is:  **Theft** is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. -- [Theft - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft)  This is literally what they have been doing. Taking stuff that wasn't theirs. And the rightful owner incurred a loss.  Sammy, who is your *guest*, sounds like an AH:  > he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart   While this is probably true, it is none of his business. And doesn't change a thing. If you steal from a store then the store owner could just get more stuff, but nobody (should) considers that to be an excuse.  > [he said Zoey] shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this "defect" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.   Instead of talking to his kids, he *blames the victim*. "We took her stuff, because *she* shouldn't have said stuff. It would be better *my kids* had *her* stuff! Ugh!  > He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.   Not only does Sammy refuse to teach *his* kids not to take other people's things, he also considers *you* to be a bad parent. Even *if* you were incorrect in how you raise your kid, even *if* it would be better if your daughter shared her make-up, he is in *no position* to demand it, and his daughters, who are *guests in your house*, should follow reasonable "house rules".  Your wife is choosing her brother over her daughter (and you), and hasn't thought things through. What if they next go through *her* things? What if Sammy next goes through her underwear?!? Where does it end? Expecting people not to go through other people's stuff in perfectly reasonable. Sammy is an entitled ass.	1625317269.0	h3wzvps	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wzvps/
7ni0ll7	NTA  Your daughter doesn’t feel like she has any privacy or respect in her own home and you gave her a lock to give her back her privacy. You tried talking to your wife, your BiL and your nieces and that got you nowhere - if your daughter has to accept 3 additional adults living in her home, they need to accept her very reasonable boundaries of not taking and ruining her things.   Good for you showing your daughter you respect and support her.	1625316126.0	h3wy7le	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wy7le/
m1enf	NTA. Don't back down. You are the only one sticking up for Zoey. If her cousins want to use expensive makeup, give them your wife's. I guarantee she won't appreciate sharing anymore.

25anuh27	NTA  Good on you for standing up for your daughter, your wife, BIL, and his daughters are TA  Your wife’s arguement that this is preventing them from “spending time” with her is completely invalid, they go into her room **when she isn’t there** and take her stuff. Besides, they can “spend time” together in the living room or wherever else  Your BIL is ignorant, MAC vs Walmart has no comparison. Calling your daughter a “defect” is rich from a man who’s adult daughter’s steal from a child. Perhaps he should fix this “defect” in their personalities  Stand your ground, this means so much to your daughter, you cannot fathom. Wife needs to stop enabling BIL/cousins bad behavior, she’s essentially picking them over her own husband and daughter, but I’m certain she doesn’t see that	1625316525.0	h3wysc4	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wysc4/
8mx5fxum	NTA  >my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff"  His daughthers are in fact thieves because there's a thin line in between stealing and borrowing and that is our bestie CONSENT.  His daughters don't ask yours for permission on whether they can take something from her or not. They help themselves into her room, into her cabinets/closet, take whatever they feel entilted to, use it however they want even if they drestroy it and then IF SO your daughter might see the object they stole from her again.  You are being an amazing parent and Zoey will forever be grateful for having her back the way a parent should. Whereas, your wife... I don't know if it's the fact that those are her brother's daughters or if she just doesn't care about people getting through her daguther at whatever cost just to steal her property and damage it.  ^(Also, funny how it went from "my daughters aren't thieves" to "my daughters just wanted to spend time with yours and now they aren't allowed to do so :(".)	1625316666.0	h3wyznp	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wyznp/
89j1kycq	"I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do"  I think you need to think ahead with this situation. You are your daughter are already uncomfortable in your own home. Your wife is upset. You need to do what is right for your immediate family before it puts even more strain on your relationship.  I think you need to get them to leave before it gets worse. It doesnt take much imagination to see how it could.  How uncomfortable do you have to be in your own home before something snaps? This is not a tenable situation. You have a right to feel safe /comfortable in your own home and anyone that militates against that is playing a dangerous game.	1625316841.0	h3wz8wa	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wz8wa/
4hn5gdg8	NTA.  Normal behaviour is asking to borrow stuff and respecting a persons decision if they say no. You don't walk into other people's rooms without permission, 'borrowing' without asking is Stealing.   And good on you for standing by your daughter.

9rzh9zta	NTA.  Good for you for standing up for your daughter. The lock should stay. There would be no need for it except that the girls are thieves.  The adult girls should pay your daughter back for the makeup. She saved for it. They stole it.    Time for the rest of the family to take a turn at helping BIL out.	1625316474.0	h3wypsr	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wypsr/

5b3qzmb2	NTA. As someone who had a “family friend” move into our house “temporarily” when I was in middle school. You did the right thing. The “family friend” who moved in with us, was only supposed to be there temporarily, until he got himself an apartment. Lived with us for 4 years. He only moved out because my parents eventually separated and divorced, while he was still living with us. So for the last 4 years that my family, was a family, we had some guy, who my sister and I didnt even like, live in our home.   Do yourself and your family a favour and give a timeline that they have to move out by or you will be taken advantage of and it might ruin your marriage.	1625317265.0	h3wzvhq	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wzvhq/

4zvjys94	NTA.   All teen girls don't steal each other's stuff and ruin it because they've never been taught basic respect. Only asshole teen girls with asshole parents who enable them do this.

jrrlgy4	NTA.   They are disregarding her boundaries after repeatedly being told what these boundaries are. You have allowed her to enforce these boundaries in the only way that seems to work with them.  As a female myself I know that the make up I use is some of the most expensive due to serious skin issues (allergies and dermatitis) so I don't share and have never shared my make up one of the quickest ways to get an infection is using someone else's eye make up or mascara. Thank you for having your daughter's back and showing her that no she is not being a bad person by asking for and enforcing boundaries	1625316269.0	h3wyf19	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wyf19/

4kmo12	NTA. Your wife harbors someone who tells you that Zoey has a "defect" in her personality for buying an expensive make up kit,  that's the kind of thing that has people thinking about divorce.	1625316270.0	h3wyf27	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wyf27/
12n6d8av	NTA, but wow, I'm shocked that your wife cares more about appearances and her brother/nieces than her own daughter. Giving her own child the silent treatment? That's just insane to me.

7wkj5yr1	You did the right thing with the lock. You opened your home to these people and they are disrespecting you and your child. I’m sorry your wife is not on your side, but your first obligation is to protect your daughter and your home, valuables and all. It was a $60 makeup kit this time, next time it will be worse.   The cousins are not your daughters and you don’t owe any of them the right to take, use, and destroy any of your family’s belongings. Hopefully they will take the hint and leave as soon as possible. But you did nothing wrong and I hope eventually your wife will understand that.

cdb9ufqg	NTA. Borrowing requires permission. They are entering her private space and removing her personal items without permission. Which is the basics of breaking and entering so your BIL might want to work on their personality flaws.   This is your house and your rule is that they may not go in your daughter’s room and take things. If their dad is not ok with the house rules, he’s welcome to get his own home. Oh...wait....

48lk5f10	NTA. The cousins aren’t borrowing. They are stealing. Borrowing is when you ask permission for something and then return it in the same condition in which it was given.  Saying that your daughter should not be spending so much money on makeup is just a distraction/deflection from the fact that they they took her property and ruined it.   As far as the lock…it is not keeping cousins from spending time together because clearly they are entering the room when your daughter isn’t even there.   These are all deflections from the fact the his daughters are thieves.	1625317281.0	h3wzwea	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3wzwea/

50ebd8c6	NTA. This is not typical teenager behavior unless they have been poorly raised without learning respect for the belongings of others. If you "borrow" something, it is with the permission of the person who owns the item. These girls are terrible guests and should not be allowed to help themselves to anything OP's daughter has in *her* room. She is also a teenager who needs her privacy.

Growing up, I hated when my cousins came over because always made a mess that me and my sister had to clean up because our mom yelled at us, even when we didn't let them nor caused the mess.  Keep the lock up and stand your ground.  And DON NOT tolerate your BIL insulting and demeaning your daughter when his own are acting like brats, at 18!  No wonder his wife left him.

9isbz5po	NTA  Reading this made me really happy for Zoey.   I’ve recently realized that part of why I, in my 30s, have such issues with boundaries is that growing up, I wasn’t allowed them.

2t8tpudy	Nope, I definitely feel you're more or less in the right here.  Borrowing stuff without permission is not borrowing.

3kyqs27h	NTA  When you take someone's belongings without their permission, that's called stealing. Not borrowing. Maybe print that out on a large sign and give it to your BIL and his daughters. Actually, give that to your wife too.  The whole girls of that age do these things is bs. Girls of that age who give each other permission may do those things, but pretty sure that's when it's okay from the person who actually owns those things. Your daughter has made it clear she does not want to and everyone needs to respect that.  Your wife needs to start thinking about your daughter's feeling instead of of just her brother and  nieces. She definitely needs to stop throwing out the family card and how others will dislike you. You are already doing more than anyone else would so if anyone says anything, they are welcome to welcome the BIL and his daughter's into their home.  Your BIL and his nieces need to appreciate that you are letting them stay at your house when others would not and get their heads out of their proverbial behinds. If not, they can give you the silent treatment while living somewhere else. He also needs to stick to parenting his own kids instead of passing some bs judgment on to your parenting and your daughter when it's his daughters who can't respect someone else's privacy and property.   You and your daughter are doing enough by simply not demanding the BIL and his daughter's get out and instead simply getting a lock for her room.

83um7fzj	NTA, but all others in this story (sans Zoey) are. It is her home where she is supposed to feel safe and you should not feel compelled to treat your nieces as good as your daughters while your wife treats them better than her daughter.  I presume you know the proverb "your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on my part"? Well, a discomfort at how she is treated in her own home DOES and SHOULD constitute a reason to kick your BIL and his daughters to the curb on you and her mothers part.

43s8kvpg	NTA.  Evict her brother.  Your wife can leave with them.  You need to protect Zoey.    1. Your wife is T A for continuously dismissing Zoey’s feelings and letting Zoey be hurt repeatedly.  Your wife is choosing her brother over Zoey.  She’s also enabling the cousins’ behaviour by having no repercussions for their STEALING.  Your wife is destroying Zoey’s mental health and their relationship.  2. BIL is T A.  He’s selfish, entitled, and a bully.  It’s obvious why no one would take him in.  He puts his feelings above everyone else’s and enables his daughter’s stealing.  He’s a bad parent and uncle.  3. The cousins are T A for stealing and then throwing a fit when they can’t steal anymore.  They are not borrowing.  They are stealing and destroying property.  Please do the following:  1. Tell Zoey you love her, support her, and will keep her safe.  2. Tell her that her Mom, uncle, and cousins are all the wrong and that she did nothing to deserve this behaviour.  3. Tell Zoey that her privacy matters and she is right not to give her cousins anything that they want.  4. Tell Zoey that you’re going to leave the house with her or kick out BIL.  Either way, you’re going to keep her away from them.  5. Tell her how proud you are of her working and saving for her makeup.  Surprise with a gift card so she buy a new and some more.    6. Get her counseling.  Most of all, her Mom turning her back on her when she needs her the most is going to be hurting Zoey the most.  A counselor needs to help her heal.	1625320194.0	h3x4njb	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x4njb/

8qa6n98a	NTA - But your problem is with your wife. Your BIL shouldn't have any opinion at all about how you run the house he's currently living in for free.

csnrygu5	NTA  Nieces, BIL, and also, sadly, the wife of OP, are the AHs.  This particularly sticks in my craw:  ''my wife shamed me....saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters..."  Why?  They are not his daughters. I think people often go wrong by starting with a proposition that isn't true, but, supposedly, under some ideal set of conditions, perhaps should be true. This isn't even a "blended family"/step sibling situation, so why the conflation?  These girls are his nieces, not his daughters, and the fact that they are now living in his house doesn't change that. OP and his wife do not have the responsiblity for raising these girls, BIL does. And OP and wife don't have the authority that goes with that, either. Perhaps, if all three girls WERE sisters, OP and wife could find some other way to deal with this, that doesn't involve locking doors against theft within a household. But OP and his wife really have only indirect authority over the nieces, through the BIL, if at all. And given the attitude of BIL, even that is dubious.  The girls should be treated exactly as what they are. Cousins that are staying at the house, most likely on a temporary basis. They should be treated with respect, of course, but it is not disrespectful to lock them out of a room from which they are habitually stealing, apparently with their father's OK. Really, as the OP makes clear in his last par, they, and BIL, are lucky this is all that he is doing.	1625320257.0	h3x4rh5	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x4rh5/

8zttver0	Okay, so I see several issues here. And you're NTA in all of them.  * Regarding the lock, you absolutely did the right thing for getting it, and you're doing the right thing in making sure it stays there. * Regarding the lock part 2 and your nieces now being unable to spend time with your daughter (according to your wife), I presume the lock is only locked when Zoey is out of her room? So, how does your nieces ability to enter your daughter's room when she's not there impact their ability to spend time with her? Not at all, that's how much. Your wife is an AH for trying to blame-shifting here. But then, blame-shifting and victim-blaming seem to run in the family, don't they? Because that's what your BIL did by declaring your daughter shouldn't have the make-up in the first place that his daughter ruined. * Regarding not having your wife's back, you're still doing the right thing. Because she should have her daughter's back, which you do. She's clearly in the wrong here. However, you need to have a serious talk with your wife. About how badly your BIL's and nieces' presence in your home impacts you, your daughter, and your relationship with your wife. I mean, her giving you and your daughter the silent treatment for protecting her(self) and her belongings is very high up there in the realms of unreasonalbe, if not toxic. * If your wife stays unreasonable and "upset" with you, I'd seriously suggest that you make sure your nieces know where your wife keeps her make-up, her jewellery, phone cases and whatever else they may be interested in. I'm pretty sure she'll sing a different tune pretty quickly. Especially if you make sure she can't use your common money (household money or the like), but only her personal spending money to replace the stuff your nieces steal/destroy.	1625322038.0	h3x7yg0	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x7yg0/

He definitely T A.    Have the same conversation with your wife again, without anger and when emotions are slightly cooled.  She needs to realize that **she can't expect a 16 yo to switch gears from being an 'only' to having her space invaded and accept cousins as instant siblings.** Remind her that her standing up for his kids over her OWN CHILD will haunt/hurt their relationship.  She needs to see things thru her daughter's eyes - not thru the eyes of her sibling.  (she may have some weird feelings of protectiveness if she's older or want his approval if she's younger).   Tell her if she doesn't become her daughter's advocate, SHE is making the choice for BIL to leave.

I don’t know why us girls to though a stealing phase (super common) but it’s horrible when they do it to people that are their family or friends they’re supposed to care about.

Clearly you are NTA and your wife, her brother, and your nieces, most definitely are.	1625320113.0	h3x4ibu	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x4ibu/
6yuw2o8c	NTA!!!Why is it that people are so willing to look the other way on bad behavior? Your wife really ought to be ashamed of herself for not advocating for HER daughter instead of her brother's daughters.  Let's get one thing straight. You both allowed 3 ADULTS  to move into your home. Your wife needs to understand that.  You say that other family members wouldn't help and so now you're stuck in a bad situation.  Did anyone ask your daughter how SHE would feel about this? Because clearly your wife, uncle and her cousins don't seem to care how she feels about her things being ruined and taken since they did.  Instead, they are willing dismiss the cousin's behavior because "that's girl stuff" or the makeup kit she saved for "is too expensive and adult" for her.  Well, apparently it wasn't too adult for his adult daughters to ruin.  In some places this is grounds for arrest too. Your daughter is a minor and they aren't.  And they are taking and destroying her things.  I would have a come to Jesus conversation with your wife.  I would indicate that you know she wants to help her brother and his kids, but she is forgetting that her priority is her own daughter.  Her taking sides and defending them is damaging her relationship with her own child because she has been bearing the brunt of their bad behavior.  She is allowing 3 ADULTS to bully and demean HER CHILD because she is so invested in her need to help her brother. And, you need to work on a plan and a timeline as to when they all need to get out.  Unless things change drastically, they are GUESTS in your home and they should act like it. And you are perfectly within your rights to send them packing if they can't shape up.  I am honestly appalled at your wife's behavior. She seems to think nothing of your daughter's feelings and disappointment and wants you to think of her cousins as YOUR daughters. Well, do that then. Make them buy a new kit for your daughter. Hold them accountable to their behavior and mete out discipline when warranted.  If they don't like it and don't comply, and keep wreaking havoc, get eviction papers ready for the girls and your BIL. Keep records of everything with dates and times in case you need it.  If anything else goes missing or other types of behavior like you've described occurs, see if you can press charges. And if you get them out of the house, change the locks.  I don't know the circumstance that prevents your BIL from being able to at least find his own apartment for him and the daughters, but I strongly suggest this be made part of the conversation as well.  Moving in  cannot be the long-term and permanent solution for his issues. u/OnlyInQuebec9	1625322042.0	h3x7ynr	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x7ynr/

lqdjz	Is Zoey even "borrowing" things from her cousins?  If not, it's not the "typical teenage makeup and clothes swapping" that your brother thinks it is.  "Borrowing" without permission is stealing.  Technically, Sammy's daughters ARE thieves. Sammy is enabling them, and deflecting his enabling and their entitlement onto you.  Bravo, OP, for standing up for Zoey when all the other adults in the house won't.  WTH is with your wife, BTW? It seems that her family already knows what's up with Sammy's family, and that's why they won't put them up.  NTA, but Sammy and is daughters need to go "borrow" someone else's stuff.	1625323985.0	h3xbj1o	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xbj1o/

8mhhvuaj	Definitely NTA. Also, he should stop pretending he knows anything about makeup either, because it's actually kind of easier to apply "natural" looking makeup with nicer makeup than it is with cheaper makeup, so his logic makes no sense. He implies you are letting your daughter look older than she is for "untoward" reasons (sense the sarcasm), but nicer makeup isn't gonna make her "look older" (except maybe in the sense that she might look like a more experienced makeup artist when she has nicer and easier to use products)	1625319203.0	h3x2xj5	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x2xj5/
cu3ymyaa	Why doesn't your BIL go buy his daughters the $15 one from Walmart then? And ASKING for permission is the difference between borrowing or stealing. They don't ask, they just take, it's stealing. If I were you I'd start doing that to my partners stuff. Just ruin her things, take them, hide them etc. TBH as soon the BIL said that about my daughter after his daughters clearly have the defect he would be out of the house.	1625320192.0	h3x4nfu	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x4nfu/

Plus your daughter is a single child (from what I understand).

9jmna	Yes, girls do share things AFTER ASKING PERMISSION. Jerk sisters, cousins, friends don't. Especially expensive makeup. That is a hygiene thing too. You're not supposed to share any makeup. I would make them pay for a new set. Your wife and BIL obviously grew up with no respect for people's things or boundaries. This is all on them. I'm guessing they are rent/bill free too, which makes their behavior even more atrocious. If no one on their side took them in, there is reason. Probably because they are disrespectful and "takers". Fuck them. Give them a due date to move out. Ten months rent/bill free is plenty of time to get their shit together. Does he have a job? Time for him to move the fuck on. You're not the asshole here.

45p9w4	NTA. This is only “normal” behavior when all people involved agree that it is okay. Zoey obviously does not think this is okay, and she has every right to feel that she AND her belongings are safe and respected in her own home. You seem to be the only one respecting that. She deserves safety and privacy. If you want to try to smooth the whole issue over, simply focus on the fact that she deserves privacy, period. Let Zoey have her own voice and let her say she also wants the lock on her door, if she feels comfortable doing that. I don’t know how to make your wife understand, but your BIL and his daughters don’t need to. You don’t have to explain anything to them, you don’t owe them an explanation. You have done the right thing, end of story.   Edited to add, just in case it matters that I am not also a teenager, I’m a 44f mother of two 20-somethings. They always had locks on their doors growing up. Not on purpose, just because that’s the way our house was, but they were allowed to lock their doors, and they were always allowed to CHOOSE who they wanted to share with and WHAT they wanted to share. I always refused to play that “you have to share with everyone” bullshit. That is not respecting your children’s agency.

But your job as a parent is to stick up for your kids, so keep doing that.  You asked the other girls to stop taking her stuff, and Zoey clearly doesn't want them taking her stuff. Zoey shouldn't be REQUIRED to "spend time" with her cousins, especially if they're taking her things; she deserves to have autonomy and control over her space and belongings.

94u551xk	NTA  Remind everyone, kindly, that Zoey and the twins have not yet established the kind of relationship where they share everything. And maybe they will, maybe they won't either way it's ok. They were not raised together for the last 16 years. This is new for everyone and finding compromises is important for everyone.  The twins grew up sharing everything, your wife and her brother and whatever other siblings they have also likely grew up having to share a lot. Zoey grew up not having to share anything, it sounds like she is an only child. Again there is a place here for both sides to compromise, it is an important life skill.  This whole situation is new for everyone and it takes time to find the right balance. This is a blended family situation and it takes time and effort by everyone to make it work.  Your wife needs to see that there is a difference between how she was raised and how you both are raising your daughter. Also, why should you treat adult nieces that you didn't have any raise or influence over as your own?   Your (AH) BIL needs to see the same and also not insult your daughter! In the same breath he said both she's too young for nice makeup and the same age as his daughters so she shouldn't be upset. Pick one, and also STFU.   Your daughter has boundaries, you are helping her maintain them with a lock. Sometimes that is what is necessary. It gives her the option to spend time with her cousins or not, and feel that she has control over when that is.  I'm sure Zoey really appreciates that you are on her side and that you understand that this whole situation is difficult for her.   No one would be told that it's ok to let people take from you or ignore your limits. Even family.	1625324011.0	h3xbkpx	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xbkpx/
4vts199o	NTA AT ALL.  This is NOT normal teenage girl behavior. This is disrespectful brat behavior. I would NEVER have gone into my own sister’s room, much less a cousin, and taken her things. These two are legal adults yet everyone around them refuses to teach them to respect other people’s boundaries and valuables.   Your daughter should by cheap, low quality make up because Sammy’s daughters are disrespectful, selfish jerks who ruined Zoey’s things? Um. No. Sloane owes Zoey $60 and owes you for the price of the lock you were FORCED to install. I can’t even imagine using someone’s m.a.c. palette without permission, much less mixing colors on it. Best case scenario Zoey can scrap the top layer off and salvage the underneath but she’s totally right, Sloane damaged it significantly because now all of the colors will smudge and turn shades of brown. I would lose it if someone did that to my palettes. It’s so rude.   Teenage girls borrow things with -permission-. They -ask first-. It’s a running thing in books and shows and films that teens and 20somethings who borrow items without permission are being rude and it makes them unpopular with their peers precisely because it’s Bad To Do That. The fact that Sammy and his ex didn’t teach their children to be upstanding humans with basic decency isn’t your fault or Zoey’s.   Your wife needs to consider whether being a mother or an aunt is more important to her because the way you both handle this moment will be ingrained in Zoey’s mind forever - she’ll remember that you defended her autonomy and privacy and that mom said it’s fine for people to invade her space and take her things. That is going to be something that she recalls all through her life because how you act is more meaningful than what you say. Mom is encouraging Zoey to tolerate people making her feel unsafe and uncomfortable and that is a terrible thing to teach a child. It impacts their entire self perception at that age, it tells them that friends and partners who take what they want without permission are the normal ones and she’s the one who is wrong for wanting to set limits. It impacts how easily you cave to peer pressure, how quickly a no is coerced into a yes from a boy/girlfriend in the future. It isn’t just today, with how you both deal with her cousins - it’s how she views her needs and rights regarding her body and her things. Mom may not realize that but you’re teaching Zoey that she can say no to people and mom is teaching her that sometimes people taking from you is just the way life works.	1625325778.0	h3xew7k	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xew7k/

rjlt8	Let's compare what these people say with the actual facts:  1. They say the cousins are not thieves and that it's normal for girls of the same age to borrow each other's stuff. The fact is that borrowing requires consent. Consent was not given, quite explicitly so. That makes it stealing. The cousins *are* thieves. 2. They say Zoey should not buy expensive makeup kits. The fact is what Zoey spends her own money on is none of their business. 3. They say the lock on Zoey's door keeps the cousins from spending time with Zoey. The fact is that the lock keeps them from entering her room when she is not in there.  The fact is that this is not at all about spending time with anyone but about having unrestricted access to Zoey's stuff. 4. They say you are babying Zoey and are overprotective. The fact is that you are exactly the appropriate level of protective while you are harbouring thieves in your house.  All in all, this sounds like a textbook case of gaslighting to me. Instead of accepting blame for being/enabling unapologetically thieving offspring they are trying to shame you for seeing things as they actually are and acting accordingly.   To be honest, I don't know why you even tolerate any of them in your house, as for me stealing would be an immediate disqualifier, especially given that they are accepting no fault for it. And at this rate this very much includes your wife. You (and Zoey, obviously) are NTA. The rest can pound sand.	1625328279.0	h3xjnmw	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xjnmw/
1fub5cmu	NTA  I have an abundance of sisters, and when they "borrowed" my shit without asking growing up, they got in trouble. I had a job and saved up and bought myself nice things, and if they touched them without asking, they got grounded and had to replace what they took. I had a pretty shitty childhood, but even my parents respected personal property and stood firm on respecting it, and my siblings and I shared bedrooms, and we all shared one tiny bathroom.   Your wife and BIL are huge, gaping AHs here. They are defending the shitty behavior of two entitled girls over the completely reasonable request for basic respect from you and your daughter. I genuinely hope your wife sees this and gets a reality check, because what she's doing is not ok. How she's treating her daughter is not ok.	1625331466.0	h3xpu3a	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xpu3a/

le7h4	NTA  I am glad to see that you are defending your daughter and her rights to privacy and to have her own things. Your wife’s insistence on your daughter taking a back seat to her brother and his daughters is troubling. Why are they so upset over a lock?  Is it because they feel entitled to Zoeys time and things and don’t believe they Zoey has a right to decide who she spends time with or who she decides to share her possessions with?    Your nieces have been taught that no one is allowed to say no to them so this learned entitlement will just get worse.   You and your wife need a long talk and possibly marital therapy about boundaries and being a united team instead of her putting her brother and his spoiled monsters first.	1625320098.0	h3x4hdj	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x4hdj/

brrdzoh	I can see it clearly. Firstly big time NTA I’ve dealt with relatives and cousins like this all the time. Sammy sees a way for his daughter to have nice things without actually buying it for them and is trying to justify it by blaming your daughter.

730i00yc	NTA.  Your daughter should feel comfortable in her own house. Her belongings should not be borrowed without permission and she has every right to be upset. A lock is a good compromise- she can feel that her possessions are safe whilst her cousins can stay.   Don't forget THEY are the ones that breeched her trust. Family or not i would be livid if someone took or used my things without asking.

bcdblux1	NTA. It's not "borrowing " if she doesn't ask. That's stealing. An apology is the LEAST she could do. She needs to pay your daughter for what she damaged.

4vpq073f	NTA  To be perfectly honest, if I was in your situation, I'd straight up tell my wife if she loves her brother and nieces so much that she is willing to risk her relationship with her own daughter then she can get out and leave with her loser thieves of a family. That it is your home and your daughter and if they aren't willing to show some common decency (wife included) then they can get out. Your bil have the audacity to imply there's something wrong with your daughter's personality when him and his kids are essentially charity case? Straight up throw them out. Not your responsibility.

15q1a9	NTA - and from someone who was the kid who didn't count, who never got any privacy, whose belongings were given to everyone else,  Thank you for standing up for your daughter. Seriously, in 50 years your daughter will still remember how you stood up for her.  Shame on your wife.  Her attitude and actions are bordering on abuse.  In 50 years that will be remembered too.  You may want to prepare yourself that your wife and daughter may never be as close as they were before this.  I could just be projecting though.  I think it's time you started talking about a moving out timetable.  And asking your wife which family she is going with, because at the moment her priority isn't on yours.

9o54ucxo	NTA. Sharing is one thing --but they never asked permission.   AND YOU SHOULD NEVER SHARE EYE MAKEUP. Professional artists (should) clean and sanitize brushes between applications. Sharing eye makeup can cause someone's normal eye bacteria to get in your eyes --and your eyes don't like it at all. Stys, pink eye, and general irritation can occur quickly.  That's if your daughter WANTED to share.   The twins are thieves. They are taking her personal belongings. They took her school computer. They ruined her makeup.   Your daughter doesn't feel like she has privacy or any form of security in her own home. Keep the lock on the door after they move out. She's a teenager *and* deserves privacy and respect.   As for your wife --tell her if the twins need to share that much, they can borrow her things.

3tndsfdn	I’m sorry, maybe this is a cultural or regional thing so I don’t want to get too insulting if your wife and her family and their views. But where I’m from, NONE of this is normal. You should not view the twins “as daughters”—they are guests in your home and have grossly outstayed their welcome. Teenage girls do not always “borrow” each other’s stuff, not to this extent. It’s not borrowing if you don’t ask. And your BIL deflecting by insulting your parenting and judging what your daughter buys with her savings—that’s just unhelpful and irrelevant.

1o81rtx	NTA, and honestly it’s weird that your daughter didn’t have a lock on her door before this IMO.  She’s 16, what if she were naked in her room?  What if she were doing something intimate?  Would you or your wife be ok with walking in on her like that?  Would you be ok with her uncle seeing her nude?  Teenagers are entitled to privacy.  Your wife is being incredibly childish and it’s not a good sign that she isn’t willing to parent with you as a unit and is shunning you and her own daughter over something as completely normal and not at all entitled as wanting privacy in her own space.  I’d be having a serious discussion with your wife about her priorities and why she thinks it’s appropriate to put her brother and her nieces’ wants over the very real needs and (TBH) basic human rights of her own daughter.  It doesn’t make any sense that she claims this is limiting the girls’ time together as if they can’t spend time together in other rooms of the house, especially if they were going into Zoey’s room when she wasn’t even there to take her belongings without asking.	1625322325.0	h3x8hq1	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x8hq1/

8xzze10n	NTA, the twins are 18, not children. Your daughter is much younger and the twins  rather than being an example or supportive older cousins, they instead are stealing from a kid.

I was in a similar situation (moved in with my fiancé and his two teenagers who I quickly discovered had NO boundaries), and his dedication to enabling his teenagers’ stealing my things was the end of my engagement. I don’t mind sharing, if things are taken care of and returned. He saw no issue with his kids stealing my expensive things, destroying/damaging them, and then guilted me when I started calling out their entitlement/setting boundaries. I’m so much happier out of that situation! It sucks to have no one on your side. Stay strong and have your daughter’s back, even if it means you moving out with her.

6bo08p7p	Let me get this straight, your wife refuses to defend your daughter and allow her cousins to take advantage of her? That poor girl, saving money to buy something that really meant a lot to her to only have it ruined. The only Ah's here are your Wife, Bil, and nieces. Your Bil should be teaching his daughters to respect other peoples stuff regardless if they are family or not, they are guests in your home and should act as such. They have no right telling you what you can and cannot do in your own home. As for your wife she should have been speaking to her brother to set and establish boundries. Do not take the lock off, your daughter has been asking them to respect her things and they refuse, it's seems like bullying and right now they are emotionally abusing her with silent treatment and guilt for not letting them use her stuff, the worst part about all this is that her stuff doesn't come back in good condition and your wife is extremely dismissive of your daughters feelings. OP, you're a good father, you seem to be the only dependable parent that's taking up for your daughter and taking her feelings into account here and she will always appreciate and remember that. Continue to put your foot down, if they are still giving you trouble over this, then it's time for them to find other living arrangements.

5g3lq0sj	NTA   This is about your daughter's things being stolen from her room without her consent or permission.    This is about her personal privacy being violated and being dismissed as "Teenagers"   This is four grown adults (your wife, her brother and his 18 year old twins) ganging up on your daughter.      You have every right to want him out of your and your daughters home. More importantly your wife needs to be on the side of her husband and her daughter.      OP it sounds like you need to talk to a divorce lawyer to see what your options are as well as get a card from a therapist.  It's time to tell your wife she has enabled her brother and his brats behavior long enough. That this is not just your home but Zoey's too and she has more of a right to it than her brother and his brats. That you've tried to be reasonable, you've tried to be fair and you've tried to compromise. Now you're left with two options. Hold up a card in each hand but don't tell her what they are. In one hand will be the divorce attorney's card tell her by choosing this hand she's choosing her brother and his family. By choosing this hand she's also choosing to leave with them as soon as possible and contacting someone for all her legal needs. You've already talked with someone and she'll need this card for her own legal actions. In the other hand is another card one for a therapist for counseling for you both. By choosing this hand she'll agree her brother as well as his children need to be out of the house before the end of the week and not be welcomed back. She'll enforce boundaries with her family as well as apologize to your daughter for causing her stress and allowing other to violate her rights. She'll also agree to individual counseling for herself as well as apologize to you for allowing your rights to your home to be disrespected.     Let her know that if in anyway shape or form if Zoey's room becomes compromised while she's away or you both are you will be getting the police involved in making sure her brother, his kids and her are all out of that door and criminally charges will be brought up against her brother as well as his kids.      Reinforce Zoey's rights as well as yours and make this your hill worth fighting for OP.

He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.  NTA. If it were me, they'd all have been out after this. To enter somebody else's home and disrespect them to this extent is unfathomable; on top of that, he has the audacity to tell you how to be a parent to your child when it's absolutely not his place, and in this case, he's brutally wrong.	1625329353.0	h3xlpnf	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xlpnf/

77avnwn2	NTA. Your in-laws behaving like entitled little brats (their dad included) are TAs. What type of 18 year old young women don’t understand having their own space and things? Ruining makeup palettes is “toddlers being toddlers” behavior, not 18 year olds. They’re college aged. Helping yourself to your roommate’s personal items will get checked and corrected quickly. Your wife gets an honorable mention here for not respecting your concerns, not respecting her daughter’s feelings and comfort in her own bedroom, and not making her family respect you all’s home and rules. Bless you for just putting a lock on your daughter’s door and not sending the trio packing.   Seems two things need to happen:  1. you should address the concerns about your wife’s action/inaction regarding your home and your daughter. This can happen later, once the dust has settled;   2. A move out date needs to be established, 30 days or less. 10+ months is too long for a grown man to be laying up in another man’s house arguing with him about the rules of his house. The longer he is allowed to sew discord, the tighter and harder to remove those stitches will be. He and his adult daughters (AKA roommates) need to collect their coins and their belongings and get a place of their own to fill with all the Wal-Mart products they can afford. Your wife may be angry, but it’s better to be angry in the moment and remain happily married than to be toxically oblivious and shocked when your own marriage is full of resentment and mistrust.	1625341606.0	h3y98yj	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3y98yj/

cimdnv5l	Somewhat normal girl behavior to borrow each other’s stuff IF THEY ARE CLOSE and respectful of what they take.. which doesn’t seem to be the case. (Make up is like paint. Mix them and they are damaged)  Stand. Your. Ground.  This is a teaching moment for the girls that  1) you don’t let people walk all over you 2) respect for others and their property  3) guests respecting the owners of the home they have been welcomed into in their time of need.. 4) how a strong MASCULINE Man (yourself if you keep standing up for your daughter) is supposed to be. (Which also will help her choose a better partner )  I would say sit everyone down and go over the house rules... reminding the guests that they ARE guests, that you did not have to welcome them into YOUR home, and if they refuse to follow the rules, they are free to leave.

45mcu165	NTA. Yes, girls often borrow things from each other. Borrow as in asking the owner for permission to take something and then give it back in the same condition and as in respecting the owner if they say no. The twins are actually thieves because they take Zoey's stuff without asking. Would they just let Zoey grab their stuff without their permission? No, they wouldn't ! Your brother-in-law should have punished Sloane and made her buy a new make-up kit. Also, it is not sanitary to use other people's beauty produtcs so even if the girls liked sharing stuff, make-up should not be shared. Your wife should have your daughter's back.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***  My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago. His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.  Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.   Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying. I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!  Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset. Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said "my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this "defect" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is. He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.  I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from "spending time" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.  She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.  Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

4ddmwcww	Big NTA. On the contrary I would like to thank you for standing up for her and her right to privacy. No matter what the age of the other girls are, they have no right to take things away from your daughter without her permission. Your wife and brother in law are enablers for promoting this form of entitlement.

5tdn59qi	NTA. And I honestly don’t understand why teenagers doesn’t already have locks on their doors. Specially when someone is stealing their stuff.   It’s just cultural difference, I know. But I got my own keys since I was 12. Maybe even you ver because if someone was sleeping in my house, such as my brothers friends, cousins, one of my parents would tell me “don’t forget to lock the door”.

Your wife is an A H for enabling her brother and his brats, and for not sticking up for her daughter.  The fact that no one else in his family agreed to take them in should have been a major red flag. They must have known how horrible they are.  Give them notice to move out. It’s been 10 months already - that’s plenty of time for BIL to get a new place. He’s taking advantage of you at this point.

3zjkleqz	This is NOT normal teenage behavior. I am an identical twin who shared a room with my twin growing up. We NEVER “borrowed” (I am using quotes here since what Zoey’s cousins are doing is theft) each other’s belongings. We always asked permission. Please share all these responses with Zoey so she does not give having a lock another thought. She needs that lock to protect her property and privacy. Also show this to your wife. She is behaving terribly to your daughter and should be ashamed. Lastly, it is time for the BIL and his daughters to leave. Give them 60-days notice. One year is certainly plenty of time for them to get their act together (the daughters are 18, they can help Dad with getting a place).	1625321673.0	h3x7a7w	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x7a7w/

c9c9nrek	Ugh I’m tired of this “girls share everything” trope because #1 it implies that we are SUPPOSED to share everything just cuz we’re girls, and if we don’t, we’re “bitchy”. and #2, it teaches those girls that they can just walk up to anyone and take their stuff. You are most definitely NTA. Your wife is probably just trying to keep the peace with her brother and nieces, or at least I’m hoping that’s why she’s so ok with this. I would do the exact same.

5q8lvr8u	NTA. You're the only one sticking up for Zoey and she will remember this for a long time, and she needs somebody on her side. Stick to your guns!  Yes, teenage girls borrow each others stuff all the time — with the consent of the person they are borrowing it from. Sounds like these cousins don't care for or repsect Zoey's boundaries and this Sammy is enabling that rather than telling his kids to do better.  If they want expensive stuff? Let them have your wife's makeup and she'll soon change her mind about "sharing." (In quotations because it's not sharing if zoey is not okay with it.)  Personally, I'm also appalled with your wife. Her brother was shaming her about her daughters "defect" because she saved up and bought expensive makeup? And she didn't say or do anything? Not cool. If anyone tried telling me to fix my defective son, they would be both out of my door and our lives before they could even blink. Zoey isn't defective, you're doing an amazing job at sticking up for her, keep at it!	1625322071.0	h3x80o1	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x80o1/

bowdosma	NTA and good on your for teaching your daughter that she's allowed boundaries and that you'll back her up. You've got twin older girls who probably are used to sharing nearly everything because *they* are twins. Your daughter is not and has never been a part of their twin-relationship and arrangement. Twins often have a different relationship than other siblings. And, you can't force a sibling relationship. The harder you do the worse it will get and it's two against one in ugly teenage girl games. Being family doesn't mean you don't get to have boundaries.  Maybe a qualified family counselor can help your wife see the necessity of letting your daughter have boundaries with other people? (Some states don't even require a bachelor's degree to become a "licensed" counselor- hence my caveat.) I'm all for being generous. But, there's no reason the cousins couldn't buy their own $15 Walmart kit instead of ruining something their cousin saved to get. There are things you don't share without express permission and makeup is 100% one of them as it's a hygenic item!  We have four daughters (3 adopted). And all four have experienced trauma. The first thing an abusive person does is manipulate away your right to say no or have boundaries. So, what did we learn were *the* most importants things - complete bodily autonomy and autonomy over personal belongings. We don't make them even hug *anyone* including ourselves or family.  I can't imagine the sheer homelife shock your daughter has been going through suddenly adding a second family into your home. Then, to be told, she doesn't have the right to her own things or to feel secure in her own home? So, seriously, good on you for backing her up.	1625322479.0	h3x8rox	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3x8rox/

Also your BIL acting like a 16 year old wanting and using expensive makeup is somehow a defect is totally weird. He's just upset that you're standing up for your daughter while his kids are being brats. Also 18 year olds are adults, they should not be ganging up on a 16 year old and taking her stuff.

6wa5rn1	This is one where I would show the post to your wife. She's being backed up by her brother but hundreds of internet strangers care more for your daughter than she does right now and she needs some perspective. You are a very good Dad.

awpnpt	Absolutely NTA. You’re supporting your daughter and also showing her that her own boundaries matter, which for a 16 year old girl is so very important, and for her to know you’re standing up for that will mean the world to her.  Your wife is totally wrong and needs to stop allowing Zoey’s cousins the benefit of the doubt; it sounds more like they want to spend time with her possessions, and not her.

vuzic	NTA.  Girls borrowing each other's stuff is wearing a dress for the night, swiping a bit of moisturizer or shampoo, etc.  It's not taking electronics and ruining makeup kits.  And for BiL to shame Zoey for having saved up and bought nice stuff is ridiculous.

16gjcuqs	NTA  What were they like before the divorce?  I’m not saying their behavior should be condoned, but I do wonder how much of this is out of the norm for them bc of the divorce. If this abnormal behavior, then perhaps acknowledging it for what it is could be a different way to open them up to how they’re currently behaving. I think the lock was a first step to let your daughter know you’ve got her back - she’ll never forget what you did for her. Next, show her that there’s still room for grace and understanding … up to a point though.	1625324222.0	h3xbypw	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xbypw/

czd37go5	I did something very similar for my daughter, because my son with special needs would constantly go into her room without permission and take things(not stealing, he just doesn’t understand boundaries).  I don’t understand your wife’s defense of the nieces against her own daughter.  They seem incapable of understanding ownership.  Borrowing only exist with permission, otherwise it’s theft.	1625324310.0	h3xc4ho	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xc4ho/
4z56rros	NTA.  First off, your house, your rules. Period. That should be the end of the discussion, but let’s keep unpacking.  Second, Sammy is a trashy parent raising trashy children. I’ve spent the night at friends houses 100+ times and outside of using the bathroom or getting a glass of water manners dictate you ask permission for other things like grabbing a slice of pizza or getting a soda.  Third, you did not escalate this, and your wife isn’t even backing you up for backing up your daughter. This should have ended the first time you asked those rotten kids to respect your daughters privacy and belongings.  Sammy needs to get his act together and get an apartment. As far as trying to shame your daughter for what she spends her money on, he can bugger off. It’s her money, she can put it in a pile and burn it if she wants. Maybe Sammy should focus on his own ability to earn some money so he can raise his kids.	1625324372.0	h3xc8oi	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xc8oi/
gcg3b	NTA.  You should also buy your daughter a lock box to store her valuables in in case she forgets to lock her room.

wv47ukk	NTA - Borrowing is when you go to the owner and say "Hi, can I borrow x". Stealing is when you go into someone's room and take their stuff. Vandalism is when you take stuff and damage it. Your wife, her brother and his daughters need to learn the difference.  They have no right AT ALL to take your dd's things and ruin them. If it was so important for his children to have makeup why did BIL not go down to wallmart and get his children makeup instead of expecting your 16 year old child to buy it for them?  Your wife is completely out of line, your child is old enough that she is entitled to her privacy and entitled to ownership of her own things, your wife is stripping her of both and giving priority to a pair of careless thieves.  As well as the lock I would suggest you need therapy or something with your wife because if this keeps on and these 3 are still here you may find Zoey is going to want to move out the second she hits 18 just so she can be treated with respect.	1625324441.0	h3xcdc9	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xcdc9/
8u3me	NTA  Your wife needs to step carefully with Zoe here. It sounds as though her brother and his kids can do no wrong and she doesn't give a shit about how her daughter feels about it. This is the kind of shit that teenage girls remember and hold as lasting grudges.	1625324914.0	h3xd991	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xd991/
y7t9n	NTA  A few things caught my notice and I thought I should point this out. Since your wife and your BIL grew up together, there's maybe a much different dynamic there. She may have grown up with that sort of treatment/normalized it. So, of course she's going to defend it.  &#x200B;  That being said, make up should not be shared. It's not good for anyone health-wise. It can cause breaks outs or even infections. And make up costs money. It doesn't matter if it's $15 or $60. It wasn't their money/item to mess with.  &#x200B;  Now-- something that REALLY caught my attention. Did your BIL try to slut shame your daughter? It sounded like it.  > He said "my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this "defect" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.   This does not sound flattering. While I understand he was attempting to protect his children, he accused your daughter of attempting to appear older. (appeal to older individuals maybe?) And while your wife is angry at you for the sharing non-sense, where was she when THIS was mentioned? And how is it shameful for your daughter to be wearing this make up but not his girls?  &#x200B;  No.  &#x200B;  If your wife needs to hear anything, say this. "I get it. You maybe had a different childhood from me where sharing things like this was okay, but we know more now. It's unhygienic for them to be taking make up. Your daughter doesn't feel safe in her own home. She feels like she needs to look out for missing items and that can be distressing. I just want her to feel safe and I'm not willing to prioritize BIL's feelings over that."	1625324925.0	h3xd9zd	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xd9zd/

32plba7v	NTA. Borrowing requires permission, something these girls did not have.  Your daughter is 16 and entitled to privacy in her own home.  You let these people into your home and they show you and your daughter 0 respect.

N/A	OP, Im confused, is this your house, or Sammy's house?  Why are you tolerating such disrespect from a grown man? Because he's your wife's brother?   Grow a pair and kick him out on his ass.

zem3w	NTA. Why are these entitled AH's still allowed in your house again? If your wife thinks this behavior is acceptable then 1) the apple doesn't fall far from the tree and 2) you have bigger problems than entitled in-laws living in your house. Kick them out.

3k549rzr	NTA. A lock on their cousin's bedroom door does not affect the lives of the twins unless they have business in that room, which they don't. On top of that, borrowing stuff from someone requires getting that person's permission first which is a step they consistently skipped over when taking your daughter's belongings. On top of all this, your BIL pulled a DARVO to blame your daughter for how her property was damaged/destroyed by her cousins.   The twins have consistently behaved poorly with regards to your daughter's property, so of course they've been denied access to it. This isn't a hospitality issue. This is a basic boundaries issue, and the boundaries are "don't enter someone else's bedroom without their permission"  and "don't take someone else's belongings without their permission." If your BIL refuses to teach such basic concepts to his daughters, then a simple door lock will do it for him.	1625326289.0	h3xfukw	t3_ocx94s	t3_ocx94s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ocx94s/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lock_on_my_daughters/h3xfukw/
