I dont understand why people so concern with Ukraine all of a sudden. It's the poorest country in Europe by choice, corruption is the meaning of life over there.  In 1991 when Ukraine gained its independence it had second largest economy in Europe and got sold out and robbed by their own people blaming Russia.  Look at the gains of Poroshenko he multiplied his wealth 18 times during his 4 years presidency.  Let Putin take it back who cares

How about we stop arguing about how many years he's going to be living off your taxes and just let the victims families put him infront of a truck they simply refuse to operate safety.   In a country without courts, he would have been ripped apart on the side of that road, and if you were a member of the victims family, you wouldn't have said shit as it happened.  A selfish asshole killed 4 people to save some money. 0 years in prison, just stone him with the chunks of cars he used as brakes.   110 years? 10 years? How about being forced to eat a meal with the survivors.  There is a no justice system, there's a legal system.

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.

Truth:
Hey I've seen this one before

Prediction:
What,    It’s not just about vaccines.  It's about the vaccine. 
I is not a conspiracy theory. It's a fact of life. I don’t see it that way.
It it's not a conspiracy but it's a conspiracy.    It's not just about the conspiracy. It's about the fact that the conspiracy is a conspiracy and that it's part of the conspiracy to divide the world.

I tried to think of some smart ass post to get upvotes. After that, I just stared at my phone for 5 minutes. This isn't even funny anymore; it's dangerous. Who would have thought that massive advances in technology and accessibility would lead us towards a new dark age of ignorance? It's hard to be optimistic in a world shared with people like this, to whom words like fact, proof and evidence no longer mean anything other than what they want them to.

Bro it's MY car not yours.  I own the car, I make the rules, no smoking in my car.  I do not have to let you smoke in my car just because you want to.  My right to not breath the poison gas supercedes your right to make the poison gas in this case because it's my personal space you're invading not the other way around.  Don't be selfish and think that the only rights and freedoms that matter are your own, especially because they are in direct conflict with mine and others.  Are you one of those conservative in name only people who does the "rules for thee but not for me!" bullcrap?  You just stated that loving thy neighbor isn't a conservative tenant?!?! Holy crap that's backwards, do you actively hate your neighbors then.  What happened to real conservatives???

Truth:
The sooner we can do away with this whole "white isn't a race" mindset, the better.  I've seen the video of them harassing the guys at the ASU Multicultural Center and they were spewing that racist, dehumanizing garbage throughout the whole encounter.

Prediction:
I    I don't see why anyone would do that.   You have to be responsible for your own actions.  I'm not saying you are not responsible.  You are not.
I i’m sure you’re trying to get away with it, but I’d be surprised if you were.
I.  I don’t know why that is, but it’s not.  They’re not claiming that, they just want to make a point.

So she was charged FOR assaulting police, not charged WITH assaulting police.   Words make a difference to people who know what they mean. Real good example of Dunning Kruger here, thinking other people are stupid because they actually attribute a higher level of literacy to you than you actually possess.

Truth:
If a poor response consists of deconstructing her personality and hypocrisy, as well as calling her out for avoiding discussion by snarkily dismissing any and all criticism, then I don't know what a proper response would be.

Only ppl I know who died of covid didn’t get vaccinated. Go figure lol but y’all will say that’s a lie or just ignore it

Truth:
Its spin because it was never mentioned until after it failed to do its 1 job, which was stop the spread. It failed so it switched to prevents severe illness or death. This is not a vaccine its a therapeutic.  No other vaccine lets this much of the thing that it was created for continue to spread. That was called vaccine failure in the days before covid not “breakthroughs” if the other vaccines we have were this garbage we’d still see measles and mumps smallpox on a daily basis.

Prediction:

I don’t know why.

I didn’t get my second dose, but when I went back to college they told me I had to or I’d have to get tested every week and I thought “what the hell, I already got the first shot, what’s one one more?”  Got an email two days ago that we will have to submit to weekly testing if we don’t have a booster, or face disciplinary action. I can’t even get the booster until March.   The whole thing is just bullshit at this point. I’m 21 and healthy. I probably didn’t need the damn shot in the first place. They’re just going to keep making it more and more inconvenient until you can’t function without it.

Truth:
Biden was 100% wrong here. But that does not mean it was a conspiracy theory considering from day 1 we were told by experts that not only would people still get covid but that some of them would still get hospitalized and die. We were all told repeatedly it would lower your chances of dieing

Everyone Omar is ISIS with lips! She’s a joke and in the end she has no power. Everyone is waking up to realizing Islam is a joke! I’ve read the whole Koran and it’s a laughable hilarity of contradiction lol and if we are arguing who holds the ownership of where the Dome sits? It’s not even close. The Jews have had that land for thousands of years before Islam was even an idea…the whole religion is a joke…why is Jesus’s name mentioned more than Mohammed in the Koran? Exactly 25 times when Mohammed’s name is only mentioned 4 times…why is the only woman named in the Koran Mary the mother of Jesus….reading it makes it clear that plagiarism and hypocrisy were the motivations of the writers of the Koran…Mohamed couldn’t even read or write for crying out loud…give it time, Omar will be a cold fart in the wind

Enough with the reactionary garbage.

I mean, the number and effects of election rules that were changed (many of which were done in an unconstitutional manner) were definitely enough to change the course of the election. They vastly expanded the number of mail in ballots while decreasing the ability to verify they were sent in legally. In states that are decided by only a few thousand votes, that level of uncertainty is very disturbing.

There are a lot of Rinos like you. On Jan 6, my very Republican uncle was watching the news, turned to me and said “there goes trumps chances of ever winning again”. The funny thing is , if the RNC just pivots slightly to the center, and has more sane, responsible moderate-conservative candidate , I believe they will wipe the floor with Biden. But if it’s trump , trump jr or anyone who appears extreme, people are going to play it safe and stick with Biden

Truth:
It's fine, everyone knows COVID doesn't affect the liberals because they're just smarter.

Prediction:
I is not the same as the other guy.
What, I think it’s a safe bet. If you want to go to the polls, you just need to go online and see the polls.
The...  I’m not saying that the Democrats are evil. But they are. They aren’t.
________________________________________________________________________________
Uhh, they do have the ability to ask. I don’t know if it’s entirely appropriate for them to weigh in like this, but they absolutely can weigh in.  Also, executive branch? The President doesn’t have any more control over the Supreme Court than the legislative branch (actually, they have less power)

Truth:
Yeah, I get that, but if someone was choosing my rights for me and forcing my hand I would not think about it for a second.

Prediction:
I I don’t think it’s a coincidence.   I’m not sure how it happened, but I do know it was a coincidence, and it was happening.  I think it was really a coincidence that they did it.
I is just a joke.
The, i'm not saying it was a conspiracy, but it was just a conspiracy.

Truth:

Prediction:
I is it a joke? Are you saying that? I'm saying that’s a joke.  
I,    What’s the point?
I is the only one who has ever been accused of a crime.    You can't be accused of anything.

The OPs title literally says they were charged with assaulting police

Truth:
Oh, he’s back. Unfortunately.

Prediction:
I’s a liberal. I don’t think so. I’m a conservative.
What, that’s a joke, not a joke.
I.    It’s not that hard.

I....
So.    I don’t know if it’s a coincidence.

Plus the lawyer just said he had performed community service. It sounds like he never offered proof, nor did the judge ask for it. I've seen the lawyers lie many times to get low bail. "Your honor, he is supporting his wife and 3 children. He has a fulltime job. He has lived in the same community since birth." The reality is something like this. He is single. He is a fulltime freelance drug dealer. He just arrived last month from south Chicago.

Truth:
Yes

Prediction:
I,    He is a racist.   You don’t have to know him to be racist. He is not racist.
I is not a racist. He's a liberal. He is a conservative. He supports the right to vote. He’s a liberal, a conservative, and a liberal Democrat.
It they are a bunch of idiots.   I’m sure they’re just lying.  It’s not like they are trying to spread the lies.  They’ve been lying for a long time.
________________________________________________________________________________
Biden's enthusiasts came from the media, paid influences, and social media platforms. Turns out if you run a coordinated 4 year propaganda campaign to make someone into Hitler 2.0 and have all intelligence agencies feeding disinfo to fuel the flames the enthusiasm can be outsourced. Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes. Now they just have to hope nobody notices 500,000 people have died over the same time span under their "leadership"

Truth:
But Republican bad! Why can’t you see that??

Prediction:
I, I don't know if they would get the idea if we tried to get out of it. I don’t know.
What I’m not sure if she’s talking about this but if she is, she has a right to be so.

Prediction:
I   You know I'm a republican.    I don't think I'm the only republican. I'm just trying to get along with the Democrats.
It    I am so glad you are a Republican and I think you should be ashamed of the way you are.   You are an idiot and you should not be voting.  You should not vote.
It, I'm not saying that it's a conspiracy, but I'm saying that I think it's just a conspiracy. It's not.

How Reddit that you get downvoted for sharing the truth lollll

I.    I have a friend who is a Republican and she is a Democrat.
It’s a good thing I’m not a doctor.
No are you sure?

You know the author of this article is a propagandist right? She’s literally worked for Russian state run news.

Truth:
Fucking weird, dude.  Especially when you're abandoning your post to party it up mask-free in Republican-land.

Prediction:
I is a liberal, a liberal. She's not a conservative. She’s a liberal Democrat.
The’s not like that.
I is a socialist. She's not a socialist, she’s a liberal.

The administration never changed hands because it was a fraud! Stop the steal!!!

Truth:
Fortunately "suck my fuckin balls" means the same thing now as it meant when this whole thing started, so there's little confusion when I tell them to "suck my fuckin balls."

Prediction:
I.    I’m not trying to be racist.  I just want to be a good friend to the people I love.
I’s not sure what the reason is. I don’t know.
I, I think it’s a bit ridiculous.

It's far more deranged to think the elitist con artist was a good President.

Truth:
And Trump right?

Prediction:
I is the only way to get a grip.
It is not true.   I have a lot of respect for the right to be a citizen.
I didn’t know that.

How long are we gonna play this game man? How long are we gonna pretend that gender and sex aren’t real? Western civilization has somehow gained so much access to knowledge that we no longer are willing to understand the most basic aspects of what it is to be a human. When are we going to stop letting people make believe their entire lives and then attack others when they won’t play along? I’m sick of it.

Truth:
its just that most of the people participating in this mass psychosis tend to be left. I can tell everything about someones political views on a variety of subjects based on whether or not they wear a mask when they are in a car alone or outside jogging.

Prediction:
I....
I is not a racist.
The is the way it is.

Prediction:
I is it a conspiracy? I don't know.
I’m not saying that the US has a problem with the internet, but it’s not like it has the ability to shut down the internet. It’d be a shame if it didn’t.
I’s a liberal. I’m a conservative. I don’t believe in the right to discriminate against conservatives.
________________________________________________________________________________
You mean republican politicians (asshole). Fucking clown show America 😂😂

Truth:
Because they are going to flip the script and blame trump for all of it when he’s up for re-election, and in a few years all the lib’s mask lines on their faces will be gone and they’ll say something like “wearing masks is just another form of white supremacy and Trump was the one who started it al” that’s after information gets “leaked” that the vaccines were more dangerous than COVID, of course. It might not go down that way, but it’s just something I could see happening, since the 20s are the dumbest time in history to be alive.

Prediction:
I.    You’re not a moron. 
I it’s just a bunch of stupid shit. I’m not saying that it was a joke.
I is a total lie. I don't get it.

I don’t get me wrong.  I’m a big fan of it. I like it, but I don't think it’s that simple.    I just like it.

RemindMe! 6 months

Truth:
Replying to this one because it has the least amount of partisan drool on it.   No opinion of either candidate being offered here, just penned the original comment to try and make the point that neither side seems to hold "being the bigger person" in high regard anymore. When Trump came into office, the conservative mantra was anywhere between "Respect the office, even if you don't respect the individual" to "He's the President, DEAL WITH IT!".  Fast forward to 2020 and our Political Memory Loss Syndrome has reduced to us to no better than the other side. At this point both sides of the aisle are saying the exact same things about one another, and yet both still believe they're right and the other wrong.

Prediction:
I is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.
I’m not going to lie, I’ve been talking to a bunch of people.
I, you are just an idiot.

Didn't you hear? They changed the definition of vaccine again to "any injectable solution which increases your bodies ability to pay Pf!zer"

Truth:
I mean, 99.8% of people or something like that survive. Yeah, I still don't know anyone who has died from covid. Many don't and never will. I know an old friend committed suicide last year during lockdown... So there's that...   I don't think that covid is a conspiracy or anything and I am indeed vaxxed but I won't support mandates with these kinds of numbers. Life can be hard. Tough decisions have to be made.

Prediction:
I’m just saying. I’ll be honest with you.
I, I'm not saying that you can’t do it, but you have to.

The test cannot distinguish between the flu and Covid = true.       Covid is the flu = not true.       Ah, clarity.

I’m a liberal. I’ve always been liberal.
I..
I you’re just saying that?

Stupid hillbillies think they will face invasion like ww2 because they have been fed paranoia and they do not know what is going on around the world. You wont even feel anything just a flash, then you and your guns melt into thin air.

Truth:
Always difficult to do so, because when you make them highly available at zero cost, someone's gonna ruin it for those who actually need em.  We can get them at the library, but they are gone in  an hour or so after restock.  Cannot even buy em in the stores at the moment.

Prediction:
It is so pathetic.
If is that a thing?
I is not a conspiracy theory, it’s a fact.

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm  That’s a link to a study finding 90% effectiveness of preventing infection. That’s some pretty good evidence (since 90% is way higher than other very effective vaccines in the past)  https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccine-effectiveness  There’s a link to a cdc page that collects studies that show vaccines are highly effective at preventing infections and hospitalization

Truth:
She said what she said and she’s not gonna take it back or apologize. She’s to prideful for that, while her state kicks people out from restaurants for not having vaccine cards, she’s able to enjoy her vacation. She’s to stupid in seeing the irony of this.

Prediction:
It don’t be surprised if they’re not right.
One’s not a conspiracy theory, it's a fact of life.
I’s a good thing.   I’m not saying the vaccine is 100% safe. I think it’ll be safe.
________________________________________________________________________________
I'd still hit it.

Truth:
Trump can't win again for the same reason that he won the first time. He's very polarizing, and very obnoxious, and we don't need that this time around. We just need someone with intelligent fiscal policy that moderates can get behind. People hard to the right will vote for whoever isn't blue, age kept hard to the left will never vote red.  We simply need someone who can beat a senile old man and look calm and collected doing it.

Prediction:
I. I’m not saying you’re a racist, but you are a racist.
I    I don't think so.
I is the only way to get to the bottom of it.

Wait wait wait. You mean the single deadliest day in American history? The INSURRECTION?! You're telling me that it wasn't as big a deal as the left says it was? You're obviously a white supremacist with that kinda talk.

Truth:
I think 10 years is very fair.  I wish there was a way to split up the 100 years that were commuted to the execs and folks who were equally responsible

Prediction:
I, I have no problem with that, but I'm not sure I'm going to change anything in the future.    It's a waste of time and money.
It it's just a question of being polite.
I.

Truth:
100% true. Talk to any transplant in the US and you'll find out they came here due to stagnant wages, no motivator for success, no innovation.   Especially in tech, us pays 3x more.

Prediction:
I is not a bad idea.
I.    It’s not like I’m saying that.  The truth is, I‘m saying it’ll be the truth.
I don’t think it’s fair that the only thing we’re talking about is how the world is being hijacked by the left.

I also love how during the inaguration when they showed a picture VP Harris' hometown they referred to it as her "ancestral village". Pander more why don't you.

Prediction:
Oh that's why he's so popular.    He’s got to be the one to explain why the left won’t do anything to stop the left.
You is a lie.    I'm not sure why they would do that.  I don’t think they’re lying. 
I.    He is the one who is trying to change the way we do things.  I know he has a lot of people who are trying to do that, but he is doing it to try to change our world.

Common errors in comments are ignoring that conservative judges have dismissed the election-based lawsuits on the merits.  Why is that?

Truth:
This is what happens when you tell people they can't be racist on the basis of their race

Prediction:
I.   I’m not sure why I thought it would be a good idea to try to get in touch with the state.  I think it’s a bit of a waste of time to do that. 
Who’s not a typo.
I,  I’m not sure why they’d want to change the law.

You're right, it's not political. Why are we putting those struggling with a mental disorder on pedestals while shooting down those that speak the truth?  Enabling those with such disorders instead of correcting them is doing them a disservice. They'll never know reality if everyone continues to cater to their fantasy.

If this fucking idiot runs again you might as well hand the white house over to the Democrats right now

Truth:
You literally used a what aboutism without any evidence. How do you know Hillary isn't a lizard person? There is no way to answer your question. In philosophy it's called "proving a negative" and a person demanding such a thing is intellectually bankrupt. This is why in our justice system we have "innocent until proven guilty". It means a position must be substantiated based on the evidence. Democrats and democrat allies have a serious moral problem when it comes to rapists and pedophiles. Saying "What about Republicans" where there is no such evidence is deflection and nonsensical.   Major institutions have a bias towards Republicans. If you don't like the FBI example. How about 90% of the media being leftists? Wouldn't they be all over any hint of a Republican scheme?

Prediction:
I.    I’m not saying that is the truth.  But it’s not.
What    I’m just saying that’s not true.   If you’re just saying this, I‘m saying it’d be a lie if you didn’t say that.  It’ll be a long time before you get to the point where you can just say that you don’�t want to hear about it.  This is why I think it”s bullshit.  You’ve seen it happen before.
I is a complete idiot. It’s been a long time.

Consider is a strategic concession. Previous incarnations of the left - I mean, they were about workers rights, yes? They were about the right of the workers to live as they wanted, right? They didn't want some intelligentsia douchebags telling them what was best for them?   Sounds an awful lot like a Trump supporter. Sounds like a populist. Who, again - love guns. Unlike the left, and those dirty progressives. They hate guns. They want to force people to be vegan and pretend to be "trans" when they are really crossdressers. The working people don't like that. They like guns. Freedom. People who don't crossdress in front of their children. They like populists.   You are populist now.

Truth:
To be fair, and I don’t like Joe, I didn’t read the transcript as him complaining- just pointing out the fact he can’t come.   People here seem hurt by it and super  defensive. Friggin  hilarious
