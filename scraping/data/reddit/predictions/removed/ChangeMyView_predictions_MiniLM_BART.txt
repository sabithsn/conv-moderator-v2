Lol what?! Almost everything is ‚Äúframed entirely subjectively by the human mind‚Äù thank you for the captain obvious word vomit. Humans have two genders that‚Äôs why we can reproduce. Your born one and can‚Äôt be the other.	So there is a concept of gender that isn‚Äôt so rigid as ‚ÄúEITHER you have all of these traits OR you have the other ones‚Äù"	<p>The biological sex of a human being is determined by its own intelligence. Not by anything else. Not even the fact that it has two genders. Not because it has a lot of vagueness to it, but because it does have a certain amount of structure and structure to it. It is not determined by anything other than what is human.</p>

>Quickly, for point of comparison what's the murder rate of the UK?  Respectfully, I don't care.	https://www.statista.com/statistics/283093/homicides-in-the-uk/	<p>The murder rate in the UK is 10.6 per 100,000 people in 2016, compared to the US‚Äô. That‚Äôs 1.6 times higher than the rate in 2000. The US has a much lower rate of murder than the UK. The UK has a high rate of child incest. The rate of suicide is 1.7 per 100K people. The difference between the US and the UK has been much lower since the 1970s. The increase in child incest is about 1.1 per 100k people. </p>

>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.	<p>But if those factors aren&#39;t involved, you can willingly drive drunk.  And, as a society, we ostracize such a person as consciously making an immoral act.</p>	<p>Anyways, I think it‚Äôs reasonable to say that a teen shouldn‚Äôt be allowed into restaurants because of their alcohol consumption, or because they‚Äôre too young to consent to an Uber. That would be problematic because the risks of alcohol are too great for young people to be able to consent. And yes, alcohol is a dangerous drug, but it‚Äùs not a dangerous one either. It‚Äôd also be irresponsible to treat alcohol as a dangerous and risky option, because it would remove the ability of young people from the equation. A teen can‚Äùt be trusted to

You're the one who took it to the extreme by saying things like " no one is below redemption " and " no one is truly bad"  and I doubt you could teach me anything considering you're sophomoric attempt at philosophy. Inability to use the correct spelling of words. And failure to distinguish between optimistic and pessemistic. Your argument and original post are based on absolutely nothing but semantics and your own arbitrary views and definitions  of morality and redemption.   I no longer wish to continue discussing anything with someone who would be blatantly intellectually dishonest and say such disgusting things may God have mercy on whatever remains of your soul.	<p><strong>‚ÄúOf all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#39;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be &quot;cured&quot; against one&#39;s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.‚Äù</strong></p>	<p>I don&#39;t think there is a single redeeming aspect to your view that is greater than the sum of its parts.

And there are lots of people that are very willing to go along with this path. I think there are many people out here who are not willing to take the path of least resistance

I agree w/ you.   There's very few policies which make the offer "you can save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a year and it won't detract from the quality of life a single living person." This is one of them.  And yes, maybe you're detracting from their life if they're creeped out about it before they die. If so, they can opt out.	No one lives well off 20 k a year. That person isn't saving or investing. That person doesn't have health care. That person is living on the margins."	<p>How many people are actually opting out of life saving measures?</p>
The Scientific Community legit one time accepted "Scientific" Racism as being true.  It wasn't just "fringe science" neither. It was in the mainstream and accepted as such.

exactly	EXACTLY	Iaphrase:
What do you think antibodies do? They fight virus ALREADY IN your system. You've already caught the virus. Vaccine generated antibodies or t cells are preventing you from getting seriously ill from it, dumbass. It gives your immune system a head start. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult...     I've heard several other idiots make this argument before. "If someone who was vaccinated tests positive, the vaccine didn't work."      Antigen and PCR tests test for the presence of the virus in your system, which nothing can prevent (except maybe wearing a mask, but i'm pretty sure I know where you stand on that too). Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.      It's incredible to me that it's been public knowledge for over a year that 90+% of people in the hospital with covid are unvaccinated and people like you still can't put two and two together.	The vaccine doesn't make you ""immune"", like in a videogame you're immune to a certain kind of damage. Even if you have the vaccine, the virus can still enter your body and live for a while. What the vaccine does is teach your body how to fight the virus, so that it can combat it more quickly and effectively. But the virus can still enter, you just won't feel a lot of symptoms. And that can be dangerous for other people who still don't have the vaccine - you can contaminate them. So for a while longer, even those who are vaccinated still need to practice social distancing, because while they don't get sick, they can make other people sick."	<p>The vaccine doesn&#39;t kill the virus, it does not kill it. If you have antibodies, you are not getting the vaccine. Vaccine does not protect you from the virus. </p>

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.	The increasing ""civilization"" in developed nations also coincides with a decrease in devout religious faith.	<p>I agree with the majority of climate change fanatics. They believe that the earth is going to get worse as a result of human activities, and the government will be responsible for it. They think that the death toll from climate change will be greater because of government actions. So, they are willing to do whatever they can to save the planet. They don&#39;t think that they can do it themselves. They have no idea that the end of human existence is in sight, and they think that it will be through the actions of governments. The government will do whatever it can to make sure that the

‚ÄúMommy, people get mad at me and say mean things to me when i say the n-word, but those black people can say it and nobody gets mad at them.

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamb	<p>You&#39;re starting from &quot;rape fantasies are bad and cause rape and other negative results (and by extension porn is bad and causes X bad things to happen),&quot; and you&#39;re trying to shoehorn anything you can anywhere you can in order to justify that claim being true. Your links don&#39;t prove it, they don&#39;t prove porn causes anything, and they don&#39;t prove fantasies cause anything. Those are positive claims that need to be specifically studied and controlled for, not hypothesized and pseudo-justified due to a blatant preconceived bias.</p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs important to understand that domestic violence is a big part of the problem, not just the problem itself. The fact that people are willing to pay for it is because it is a part of their job, not because they are afraid to do it themselves. The reality is that many people are unwilling to pay the legal costs of their crime, because they don‚Äôt want it to be seen as a crime, or because they fear retaliation from their employer for not doing their job. So, I think you‚Äôre right. The problem is that people will always choose to victimize

I 100% agree with you. Both teams should have 1 shot at scoring and each have OT time to play their defense/offense.	I'd much rather watch a hockey game where there is a scoring opportunity every few minutes. Scores don't happen as often, but potential scores do and one score could tip a game. It makes the whole game worth watching."	<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that if both teams are playing defense, the difference in the score is 1:1. If both teams were to score, there would be more of a difference in how the other team scored. If they were to make a defensive decision, both teams would be better placed to score. But if they wanted to make that decision, they could both have scored in OT. They could have scored if they had the extra man on the other side. If not, it would be fair to assume that both teams had more of an equal chance of winning. </p

lol okay Jim Cramer.	It's funny, because I am in this thread having a *very different conversation* with Op than I would be having with someone who seemed reasonable or informed.

I've been arguing this since Richard Spencer was sucker-punched in the head live on television on inauguration day 2017, while calmly speaking with a reporter.  People were all 'hell yeah!' at the time, too.  No one wants to listen, or have even the slightest bit of imagination about how normalizing it could come back to bite you.	<p><em>You cannot reach</em> the Richard Spencer type. You can&#39;t. They&#39;re not interested in fairness. They don&#39;t care about the truth. They don&#39;t and won&#39;t play by the rules. They want respect, they want civility, because it legitimizes them. How did Richard Spencer himself lose his platform and his relevance? Was he debated into submission? Shown the error of his ways? Did he repent on his views and become an activist for racial equality?</p>	>p>You&#39;re saying this is a fantasy, because it&#40;s not real life, but it is a reality, and it could be a fantasy. You&#37;re arguing that this is fantasy, and you are arguing that it is fantasy. They&#47;re talking about a fantasy where they&#34;re going to kill you in cold blood, or whatever, and then you&#50;re actually going to feel pretty good about yourself because you don&#59;t have to fear for your own safety. This is a very real possibility
I don‚Äôt think you will get an informed take that could change your view, as there really isn‚Äôt one.	I like the discussion in this thread but I don't think it's possible to deliver a satisfactory response to ""change your view""."	<'s the only way to change your view."
A small mistake, you said  *we've spent billions fighting terror*  When in reality it is closer to 8 trillion [source](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar).	>Yes. The cost was 2.3 trillion. You said we should spend it elsewhere instead of the military action. I pointed out the military action was a 3rd of it. I didn't deny the overall cost.	<p>I&#39;m not saying that the cost of war is $1 trillion, but I think it is worth the potential impact. And I&#37;m saying that because the cost is so great, that it is not worth the effort.</p>
No, you just asserted you were correct.	No, I was just making a rhetorical statement of sorts.	<p>I‚Äôm not claiming you‚Äôre wrong. You‚Äôve already proven me wrong. I‚Äôll repeat my argument again.</p>
What a load of shit. You're too embarrassed to admit you didn't read the article. I provided the relevant quotes yet you still deny I read the articles?   And now you bring in my sex to the topic. You're a disgrace and shouldn't be in this subreddit. Facts are your enemy.	<p>Like I said, I have no problem with the content of those articles and even agree with them, and your right, you don&#39;t HAVE to provide anything, but if you refuse to answer the question, I&#39;m just going to assume you don&#39;t know and can&#39;t find anything. It&#39;s not personal, if you asked me to prove how men have it worse and I sent 5 articles that explains that men also suffer sexism, you&#39;d quite rightly call me out saying &quot;that&#39;s not what you asked&quot;</p>	<p>You seem to be willing to admit that you did not read the entire article, and now you are admitting that you were the one who wrote it.</p>
Stop trying to pawn your shitty rehtoric off on "society" or what ever.  Reality isn't changing. You are not in anyway being forced or obligated to "pull down" anyone from history. If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here? Cause a "realist" would clearly see that your engagement in the discussion is 100% ideological motivated.	<p>Really, stop generalizing and judging billions of people based off of something you clearly know nothing about. It&#39;s just bigoted and bad form all around. It sounds like your entire concept of Islam is from far right, Islamaphobic memes. You keep throwing out random pieces of misinformation, like &quot;the 4 main scholars agree!,&quot; which doesn&#39;t make any sense, or &quot;well this Sunni school agrees this [it doesn&#39;t], so all the hundreds of scholars agree! [This isn&#39;t how that works]&quot;. </p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs fair to say that you‚Äôre being pulled down for the same thing. You are being dragged down for nothing. I don‚Äôt think that people should be dragged down because of the religion, but because people think that religion is inherently violent. I think that we should be able to control our own actions and not have them dragged down by the wind. </p> I‚Äôm not saying that people are ‚Äúpulled down‚Äù because they are not inherently violent, but I think you are trying to make sense of how people are thinking about things and not

Did you woke up on the wrong side of your bed? Chill my man.	<p>Edit: well anyways, it‚Äôs 3:30 Am right now so I really need to head to bed. I know that this comment thread did get a bit heated and I apologise for that, but it was an interesting conversation none the less.</p>	<p>I woke up on the wrong side of my bed. I think you must have been asleep for a while, I don&#39;t know why you woke up so early. Maybe you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, but whatever the reason, it was a wakeup call.</p>
ok mr honda civic. but when a they/them looks like a woman I will call her a woman BECAUSE SHE LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN. I DONT GO ASKING PEOPLE FOR THEIR PRONOUNS FIRST IF I WANT TO TALK TO THEM. If his or her name is male or female i will call her/him by male or female because I can not adapt to using broken fucking english. "They" is multiple people or things. I cannot say they is because that does not make sense	<p>Seems the author IS actually free to CHOOSE which pronoun they go by‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm not well-versed on the whole he she they them political correctness of everything, but I guess I‚Äôm a heterosexual male who identifies as a heterosexual male and I don‚Äôt know what my pronoun even is, like how can your pronoun be they? Isn‚Äôt that plural? Either way if people started calling me her or she or it or whatever It wouldn‚Äôt affect me because I‚Äôm not defined by other people, other people and myself are defined by me.</p>	<p>If someone says they are a woman, I will say they are. If someone says she/him by name, I&#39;m not sure why they are calling me a woman. If they say they were a man, then you&#37;re wrong. If you call me a man/woman, you are wrong.</p>
Annnndddd that's why this sub sucks. This isn't a good faith response to OP's actual view. You encourage the entire community to give these poor responses when you do it yourself.	<p>All in all, you clearly just enjoy picking at the low hanging fruit. Your pointless criticisms that serve not to change OP&#39;s mind, but rather to jerk yourself off. Honestly the mods should delete your response due to not addressing anything OP said, for not explaining clearly any of your responses, and for what, in my opinion is, making bad faith interpretations of OP&#39;s statements in order to score brownie points.</p>	<p>I think OP is probably the worst person on earth who has ever made a poor faith response to a criticism. I don&#39;t think you are the only person who has made poor faith arguments, I think you should be able to change your mind.</p>

Uhhhhh, wow. Yikes.	Oh, oh wow.	Whatp>I never said it was a rhetorical question, I just said it wasn&#39;t. I mean, it was an honest attempt to make sense of what I was saying, and I got that right as I was reading the comment. I&#37;m not sure why people would think that way, but it was one of the first things I said. I think it was just an attempt to get a sense of how others perceived me as a threat. </p>
This is obvious to me. Everyone here who disagrees is living in a fantasy world. When all the female records are taken by trans women another tune will sound.	<p>The point is that if any women world records were being broken by transwomen, it would have been on the news already. After all, thousands of top highschool male sprinters have broken the women&#39;s world record. Yet, we haven&#39;t heard anything about transwomen doing the same. If transwomen are really &#39;dominating&#39; women sports, then even a couple of them should have already done so. You can&#39;t claim something is real and simultaneously give excuses for why it isn&#39;t working out. That&#39;s just rubbish.</p>	<p>Trans women are not the only ones who are experiencing this kind of dissonance. If you don&#39;t understand how dissonance works, then you are likely to be hearing a lot of female voices screaming &quot;."
I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I‚Äôd go further and say that anime‚Äôs art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They‚Äôre blonde and brown and red haired, they‚Äôve got big eyes and pale skin‚Ä¶at bare minimum they‚Äôre drawn in a way that would not make one assume they‚Äôre Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They‚Äôre based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look ‚Äúwestern‚Äù.   I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs up with that. But cmon, you can‚Äôt blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different	>I'll like to point out that cultural appropriation is also a big double standard, while white Americans are punished for wearing dreadlocks, no one is criticising European anime lovers for using Asian culture elements. Or the movie Thor, or Coco. It's is wrong just in some moments.	<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that the majority of Asian American actors are white, but the majority are male. The majority of white actors are female. The exception is the man who plays a male character. The only way to change that is if the actor is white. So if the character is white, why are there so few white characters in the series? </p>
Agreed. IMO, samething for having a child. The world would be +1 point better.	<p>if I did have a kid, the only good reason I can come up with is the potential to raise a child and give them a better life than I had growing up.

No, you ignore 90% of it and strawman the rest.	In anyway, I will just ignore it, since it is an obvious strawman."	<p>Most of the strawman stuff you&#39;ve been saying is bullshit, and I&#37;m not going to repeat that. The point is that you can&#38;t be sure how many strawman stories you have, because it&#40;s not true.</p>
LOL, "not enough evidence to support a positive claim" does not equal "enough evidence to make a negative claim" you Muppet.	<p>But when all the &quot;evidence&quot; you do present is debunked then your claims no longer have any merit.</p>	< is not enough evidence to make a positive claim."
CMV: the Patriot Act should be expanded to include penalties for using ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Äù to mean ‚Äúits‚Äù.	<p>Even if it&#39;s specific to the people hurting the shooter and not an indescriminate attack it would still be subject to the same legal punishment under the OPs CMV.</p>	<p>The Patriot Act is unconstitutional.</p>
There is no difference between the two, (other than the obvious difference in genitals) male or female, you are forcibly removing genital skin, of an otherwise unwilling, non-consenting sentient being. Causing unknown amounts mental anguish, among being a completely unessicary cosmetic surgery on infants and adolescents	the only difference between male circumcision and female circumcision is the gender of the victim."	<p>If you choose to remove your genitals, you are not removing the skin of your own self. If you choose not to remove the skin, then you are making the choice to do so in the best way possible. Otherwise you are going to be committing suicide by giving birth to a completely different creature. If that isn&#39;t what you want to do, why not just do it yourself?</p>
I wanted to argue with you because I believed this was a place where people sincerely changed their views.  However after scrolling through the last few posts, I have to admit you are right. Even anonymously, reddit users care more about appearing right then finding truth. !delta	<p>The whole point of this sub reddit is for us to change your view and we can only understand your view based on what you write. If you base any part of your view on an obvious falsehood, people will jump on that. Its low hanging fruit. But you cant write out a view on one thing and then expect us to know what you actually wanted to talk about.</p>	<p>You‚Äôre being disingenuous here, you‚Äôve failed to share the full context of your discussion. I&#39;m not trying to deflect from criticism, just to show that Reddit isn‚Äôt the place for it. You‚Äôd be forgiven for not sharing the whole context of what you‚Äùre saying.</p>
Ok but pronouns are based on sex, not gender.   Because they aren't used to describe someone's feelings about what they are , they're used to describe what they are.	> Gender is like pronouns and stuff	<p> pronouns are based on your sex, not your assigned gender. pronouns are not interchangeable. pronouns have a certain meaning, meaning that people are assigned a certain sex. pronouns should be interchangeable, not interchangeable.</p>
That‚Äôs the bandwagoning fallacy - ‚Äúeveryone agrees with me, so I must be right‚Äù.    Science isn‚Äôt based on majority opinion. Objective facts don‚Äôt change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You‚Äôre as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the ‚Äúscientific consensus‚Äù by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever‚Äôs in power?    After all, it costs nothing to do the Hitler salute and look the other way during the genocides of millions.	In recent years, a lot of popular ideas have made us forget that. There's a lot of use of named fallacies as the road best road to logical thinking. But something being fallacious just means it's not NECESSARILY true. So people love to throw out ""Argument from Authority!"" to terminate a line of thought. But when we're talking about the kind of science we might argue about, very few of the big picture conclusions are NECESSARILY true, especially in the ways laypeople can discuss them. When we're talking about what's LIKELY to be true from our limited knowledge, recognizing expertise is important.	<p>I&#39;m sticking with my view that science is dead.  If you don‚Äôt change your view, then you are not doing science at all.</p>
And you sound like a braindead sheep. ‚ÄúHur dur I‚Äôm too dumb to know that public health is the highest importance‚Äù	Public health is *public*. It's all of us. So you say ""to protect themselves"", but you're omitting a major part of the puzzle.	<p>I&#39;m not saying public health is the top priority. The fact that there are so many people in the public sector that are not getting treated for it is an indicator that there is a real danger to the public.</p>

You are a big problem in this stigma	That ""stigma"" isnt as big a problem as they can easily choose but ok.	<p>I think stigma is a big part of how people perceive themselves.  I think it‚Äôs ingrained in most people, and I think that‚Äôll be clear from the beginning.  </p>
The DSM-V disagrees with you. Which is to say facts disagree with you. Sorry that you are more interesting in continuing to be engage with your bigotry than the clinical consensus.	Similarly, it's perfectly possible for a bunch of doctors to write a definition of autism or anxiety or gender dysphoria in the DSM-V and get that wrong. Indeed they admit they have: the reason it's the DSM-V is because there have been five versions of it, which have been updated every so often as the field of psychology evolves. When they published the DSM-V they admitted implicitly that the definitions in the DSM-IV were incomplete."	<p>The DSM-V does not agree with all of the points you‚Äôve made. It‚Äôs not a scientific study. It has been proven to be inaccurate. The DSM is not scientific. The only way to get the facts is to go along with it. You don‚Äôt have to go against it. </p>
What in the race realism is this shit??	So it really seems to me like there's no such thing as ""*actual""* race, because race is a concept that changes from time to time, moment to moment, and place to place."	<p>Race realism is not what you think it is. It is a form of artistic expression. It‚Äôs not a reflection of reality.  </p>

I specifically said ‚ÄúI dont know if this changes your view, but it should make you rethink where your biases are.‚Äù	<p>I don&#39;t think you can change my view if you have no context. I think you could change your view by saying he is not a fan of the current state of the art and that he is NOT an entertainer.</p>
Why are you discriminating against men? What happened to congresswomen?	As for men legislating, legislators don't know much about most of what they legislate. This is no different. A good legislator will seek guidance from experts, but unfortunately they don't do that enough. Gender has nothing to do with it and I think that's a crappy attitude. Female legislators can be just as ignorant.	<p>What is the problem with men being treated as though they are equal in sex?</p>

Looks like your redpilled my friend, all of the comments are just "well I bet you can't define this, or this, or this?" Completely changing the topic to something that has nothing to do with what a woman is. All there proving is they know less about definitions than we thought, as they list of a bunch of other words they fail to define through there truthless and fluid way of looking at the world. No principles, no definition s, no truth, just a pathetic way of looking at the world. Your starting to wake up. But because cmv requires me to disagree with you in order to post I'm just going to say some things I don't feel.  yOu s0 traaNs Phbic. Nazi!!!  Have a good day	<p>Feminism - has never been about your right to communicate an ill educated, harmful opinion, and consider yourself morally qualified to explain a female based issue to women. Read up, skill up, move on.</p>	<p>I think this is where you‚Äôre missing the point. Women are not defined by what they think we can or can‚Äôt do. We are defined by our definition of a woman, not by what we think we are. So why are you claiming that women are defined solely by what someone thinks we can do? </p>
Anyone who lies about being rape should be prosecuted.                They should get the same amount of time the person they accused would have gotten.               They should have to register as a sex offender for life.	Now, as a counselor I'm fortunate in that most of the time the situation isn't as serious as sexual assault, and I'm not in the business of reaching a verdict. When the accusation carries legal weight, the situation gets a lot harder. You're definitely right that we shouldn't convict on a whim. But that's not what ""believe the victim"" is about. It's about making it your *starting point* to assume that the victim is not lying."	<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that rapists should be imprisoned for life without parole, and any other type of crime (not just lying about it) should be brought to trial for rape. If they&#37;re convicted of rape, they should not have had to go through the appeals process. If convicted of raping someone, they would have had the chance to have their criminal trial reduced to a misdemeanor. </p>
100% agree	100% agree.	<% agree.
You are propagandized. Just like the nationalists who promote war based on their country is number 1.	<p>Unless the propaganda that you&#39;re fed is obviously self-contradicting or in contradiction with actual facts (that are known to you) you might end up in a position where you can&#39;t reasonably tell whether it&#39;s true or false. That is without access to outside information and credible sources. And in terms of war your chances to an outside perspective and a perspective on the outside can mean &quot;treason&quot; and be actively criminalized.</p>	<p>I&#39;m not saying the nationalists are the problem here. They are the solution to the problem. The only way to counter it is to have a strong nationalist presence in the country. That&#37;s why I think it is a good idea to have strong nationalist voices in the U.S. &#39);s first step in countering fascism is to oppose it.</p>

Don't be stupid. There's a big difference between being respectful and "friendly" and being "friends" with coworkers. They will throw you under the bus when they're cornered.	To give an extreme example, imagine being in Germany during the rise of the Nazi party. Would you be friends with an ardent supporter of the S if they were respectful in the manner they talked about it? After all, Nazis were just a political party, it's just politics. Shouldn't people be able to be friends despite political disagreement?"	<p>You are being treated as though you are a friend and not a coworker. I don&#39;t mean that as a polite way to talk to coworkers, I would expect that they would be treated as such. But I&#37;m not saying this is the case. It is a mutual respect and respect relationship. </p>

"I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.  That is not obvious at all. You are literally here, *in this post*, doing exactly that.	<p>This is offensive to you, because you believe you are depressed beyond your control... And so you are. That is exactly the point. That is the belief. I had this belief too -  I did not believe these kinds of ideas and opinions. Then I noticed, that they are true... And I dont have depression anymore. This is a self-fulfiling logical concept. If you dont believe me so much to the point of being offended by this notion, you logically have to stay depressed. If you are not offended by this notion, there is a chance you can start to believe me. If you believe me, you will not be depressed.</p>	<p>Let&#39;s put it this way: when X becomes ill, the symptoms of the illness are pretty much the same, and the symptoms are the same. So this is where we are going to go from here. If X becomes a disease, and X becomes an individual, then it is a natural part of life that we will be able to adapt to.  But if X became a virus, why are we going to do that?  Why are there so many people who are NOT accepting that X is a disease?</p>
Oh enlightened one. I've just learned another noble truth of which I had no prior knowledge. Criticism is not the same as insults. Who would've known? Truly you are blessed with knowledge.	<p>You have criticized others for choosing to remain ignorant.  Now that you&#39;ve been presented evidence from myself and others that contradicts your views, what are you going to do?</p>	<p>I think you‚Äôre right. Criticism is not a criticism. It‚Äôs a response to things you disagree with, not a response. </p>
So we should address people with the pronouns they identify with apart from you? Got it. Not like you‚Äôre trying to push some agenda at all.	<p>You said that we should stop referring to people with pronouns because it reduces people down to their genitals</p>	Ip>I&#39;m not saying pronouns are interchangeable, but pronouns can be interchangeable, and pronouns are a way to identify people. So, pronouns are not interchangeable. pronouns are just pronouns. pronouns have a way of being interchangeable, which is a good thing because pronouns are different. pronouns also have a lot of meaning and meaning. pronouns can also have meaning and have a meaning. But pronouns are also interchangeable, so pronouns are still interchangeable. Plus pronouns are gender-neutral, so there is a *lot* of overlap between pronouns.
Why even have weight classes if this is the logic.   Excluding females from male sports and vice versa is not sexist,, its common sense.	>Sports should be separated by size and weight, not Gender	<p>I&#39;m not saying there should be any weight classes for females. If there is, then it would be considered sexist to exclude females from certain sports.</p>
These chairs are the worst. So glad you called them out. I‚Äôm not particularly big and they are awful after just a few minutes. Must be even worse for larger people.  The chairs themselves are totally basic and ugly	I mean, the only thing I can say is that I think you‚Äôre doing a lot of internal damage to yourself. Your attitude is scaring people away, and you‚Äôre attributing that to things like height and physical appearance - please reconsider.	<p>I think the people who complain about the chairs are the ones who should be held accountable for their actions.</p>
Yep, you made a false equivalency that is totally out of line with what the, ya know, science, actually shows, you foolishly equated smoking mj with smoking tobacco.  Meanwhile, smart people will simply accept the data and move on. Cheers!  https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/01/98519/marijuana-shown-be-less-damaging-lungs-tobacco	Yes, facts matter.  Marijuana is not physically addictive like cocaine and caffeine.  Marijuana is psychologically addictive like exercise, gambling, video games and shopping.	<p>I don&#39;t think you should be saying that smoking weed is harmful to the public because it contains harmful chemicals, but I think you are making the argument that it is not harmful to society because it reduces harm. So if you are saying that because it is harmful, then you are actually admitting that the harm is worth the potential benefit. Not saying that it isn&#37;t harmful because it isn't harmful to people. Just saying that will not mean that people will stop using it as a preventative measure. So, I will say that you are being disingenuous here because you are

First, I said "perhaps you believe"? I didn't accuse you of anything.      I'll answer your silly question with another silly question:   Why don't lions kill other lions all the time if they DONT have the same morality that humans have?     Why don't dogs? Why don't parrots?     Is it because they fear an eternal punishment in Hell? Is it because they were bestowed with gift of morality?  No no, that's silly. Then why would humans not killing eachother be any measure of us being "special"?   You want to talk about non sequiturs?     Riddle me that.      And don't blame your inability to CMW as my fault?	2) You are different from a lion because a lion cannot be held morally accountable. They act on instincts, so whatever they do is neither moral nor immoral. You are someone with moral responsibility because you can choose actions with varying consequences.	<p>What makes a parrot so special is its inherent morality. If it had an inherent moral value, it would be considered one of the most exceptional traits of a human being.    If it were an animal, why would it have an inherent morality that is superior to that of any other?  Why would it be immoral to kill other animals?   Why should it be unethical to kill people? Because it&#39;s morally immoral?  Is it because it‚Äôs natural for humans to have a moral compass?  What makes a human exceptional is that it is a natural part of

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZML8mnpGd/  Yes it is a tik tok link because stuff like this is taken off main socials immediately, but I can send many more if you'd like. Are you that far in your hole that you don't know that hospital s classify a death as a covid death regardless of the main reason,as long as they are positive when they die?  Lol you are really telling me that the government and big pharma have no reason to lie. I bet you think they want all of their customers to be as healthy as can be too. Only the biggest lawsuits in history follow these companies get your head out of your ass.   Bet you believe that the flu took a year off too. You just keep repeating "safe and effective" and don't pay any attention to the fact that you were told you won't catch covid if you get the vaccine. Science isn't guessing what will happen it's experimenting until a result is consistent. Yes experimenting.  If you don't see a problem with medical professionals being censored and deleted off social platforms for simply offering a second opinion then you are too far gone.  No issues with not discussing the possible side effects like every other drug in history? Or the adverse reactions totalling more than all vaccines combined? Don't you think it's worth at least a discussion to make people aware of what they put in their body? Or are you okay with an outside source telling you and everyone else what to put in their body.   Herd immunity? You really still believe that? Every country that has hit the initial targets for herd immunity is no better than 2 years ago. I hope you realize how wrong you are someday because I know I will never change the minds of people like you   Oh the seat belt argument that's a classic.. I can take my seat belt off whenever I want to no matter the safety to others. That's the same as putting an unknown needle into myself that I can never undo?  They were never intended to stop transmission altogether? I recall hearing from the leader of the free world 	<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s <em>only</em> or even mostly a political issue. There&#39;s obviously a real pandemic going on. Rather that the vitriol directed at anybody who is unvaccinated was never a thing with respect to the flu, as far as I remember. If it was entirely apolitical I would expect that people would feel a similar way about mandating the flu vaccine. Maybe to a lesser degree given the reduced severity, but there should be <em>something.</em> Mostly what I&#39;ve seen - including this thread - is people supporting it for COVID vaccines but brushing off the flu because it kills fewer people. On a personal level I feel like, I dunno, if you&#39;re <em>that</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 600k people, you should be at least a <em>little</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 60k people.</p>	<p>Drugs are not classified as covid deaths. They are classified as dangerous. They do not have to kill people for covid. The government does not put people under the observation of covid until they die. So there&#39;s no reason to think that people are dying because of their covid exposure. The only reason people die is because they are under a false assumption. But even if they die under covid, they are still treated as dangerous.</p>
No, because black coffee is a description...so you're saying "you filthy black bastard" shouldn't be racist? Piss off troll.	>That‚Äôs a race then.

You're the type of sexist shit who raped me. You claim women cannot rape to justify your actions. You willfully ignore any science or data that disproves your position.   How many men have you assaulted? I'd bet money it's a non zero amount.	Its not rape, *she* definitely wanted it"" is the classic go to defense. I saw you mention in another comment that you would feel the same of the genders where reversed, so congratulations on being consistent at least. However, what you are doing here, is 100% defending rape.	<p>Men have been assaulted more than women. Women have been raped more than twice as many times as men. If you&#39;re saying that women are raped more often, you are being accused of being sexist. Women are being assaulted more often because their own actions are perceived as sexist.</p>
Whatever you say Tucker Carlson.	<p>And the right wing is learning. Tucker Carlson kept his job after his fuck ups because he knows the outage machine has ADHD.</p>	Ip>I say Tucker Carlson is not my friend, he is a fellow comedian. He is not a friend of mine. I don&#39;t believe you are aware of his fame. I think you are, in fact, unaware of it. I never said he was a friend. </p>
Plenty of people, myself included, have, and you just ignore, wilfully misinterpret, insult, and block us.	Personally since *everyone* has one and you can‚Äôt single any groups of people out by using it as an insult I don‚Äôt see it as the same issue. Again note I think insulting people is counterproductive anyway so I avoid it as much as possible.	<p>I think most of us would agree that you are willfully ignoring, or at least trying to do so. If you don&#39;t, then you are doing exactly what I said above. </p>
I think you need to read up on child development and brain development before you say stuff like this because you just sound stupid. Yeah kids are annoying, but they are small people processing the world around them and parents can only do so much to control their feelings and actions. If you really hate children so much, stay home, thats what I do.	<p>That being said, I do agree that it&#39;s being tolerated less and less, and that means that kids are growing up in a bubble. Once they grow up, they&#39;ll enter the real world where there exists assholes and people who have nothing better to do than to insult you. Kids absolutely do need to learn how to deal with people being mean or insulting, but kids also need to learn to <em>not</em> be mean or insulting.</p>	<p>Parenting is important to us as a whole, and as such we have a lot of control over our own lives and our own actions. As a parent, we have to make a strong effort to provide for our children, not just provide for them. The important part is making sure that they are happy and healthy, not punishing them for things they don&#39;t want to do.</p>
The fact that male erotica and prostitution are more popular among gay men than among women (despite the fact that there are far more heterosexual women than gay men) suggests otherwise.Women's erotica and porn  - erotic novels, series about relationships, etc.	Thirdly, the reason I imagine there's the double standard between men and women watching gay and lesbian porn is because heterosexual mainstream porn can fully cater for men. You could easily find almost any sex act involving a man and a woman catering for the man. So the only extra bit in gay porn is the gay sex. Conversely, as I already mentioned, mainstream heterosexual porn doesn't easily cater for what the women want to see unless they want the ""rough and male orientated"" sex. So then the lesbian porn is the easier to find, more sensual and female orientated option."	<p>I think it‚Äôs fair to say that female sex is more popular than male sex, and thus the authors of many sexually explicit works are more likely to write about women than men. So I think you should be aware that women are more accepting of male sex than men, and are more open to seeing female characters in their work. </p>
I‚Äôm not lying about anything, I‚Äôm calling out your abhorrent statements that you seem to churn out every day. When will you take responsibility for what you comment?	>Are you withdrawing my responsibility over others?	<p>I&#39;m not accusing you of lying, just accusing you for your actions.</p>
I'm only staying home because I currently have the Covids... But I would still go out on NYE if I didn't... And if I'm feeling fine by NYE, then I will go out.  Long story short, if your sick then stay home... If your not sick, then go out  Nothing to fear... The flu is way worse than the omicron	>If you're sick, stay home.	<p>If you don&#39;t want to go out with the flu, then don‚Äôt go out. It‚Äôs not about the virus itself, it‚Äôll be about the people you infect with it. The people who infect you with it are not the ones you infect. They are the ones who get treated for it. You are not going to be hospitalized for it, stay home with your family, and then get treated with the vaccine.</p>
I'm a bigot against something that doesn't really exist.  You are a bigot against women in the way you belittle their importance and their reality of existence.	Being against homosexuals, makes you a bigot.	Itp>I&#39;m not saying women are exempt from bigotry because they are not allowed to do so. The point is that women are forced to choose between being treated as inferior or superior because of their sex. </p>
So the women had it coming.  Gotcha.  Blaming the victim.	>A woman who gets raped shouldn't blame Men, she must blame other women.	<p>So the victim was the victim. The victim was not the victim, it was the perpetrator. So the victim had no choice but to go along with it. </p>
Oh of course of course. I'm not enlightened as you. That is why.	Thank you very much for this enlightened take.</p>	<'m not enlightened as you are."

I think you should rephrase your last paragraph in the best possible way to make it clear that you are not interested in hearing their arguments.</p>
TIL people are so desperate for things to complain about that they've turned to candy	>Candy is usually short for Candice.	<p>I hate to complain about things that people don&#39;t like, but I think it‚Äôs fair to say that candy is bad for people who can‚Äôt afford it.

I don&#39;t think you want covid to end. You just want revenge. We don&#39;t need this. So fuck off.</p>	<p>This is where you‚Äôre going to find out why he‚Äôs so insistent on lying to you. This is where I‚Äôm going to learn from my mistakes and learn from them. You‚Äôll be able to understand why people aren‚Äôt going to believe him when he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lying to them for years‚Äù. </p>
Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.   To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	<p>I think you don&#39;t understand it if you think the way he hasn&#39;t paid taxes for decades are the same rules that apply to everyone? Who gets offered their entire compensation in stock? The top 0.01%? What proportion of those can borrow enough against those stocks that they never have to sell and can afford to live like the top 0.001%? How is that the same rules that apply to everyone?</p>	<p>I&#39;m not saying Elon Musk is a billionaire, but he is not the only person who is doing this for the public good.</p>
I üíØ agree with you!!!	So yeah, I agree with you.	<p>I agree with you. You&#39;re being overly literal here.</p>
>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat. So way to win an argument by not even playing by the rules of this sub. Are you proud??	<p>As for vaccination, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs relevant whether you consider it a good thing. Others don‚Äôt, and they‚Äôre entitled to make decisions on their own reasoning unless you‚Äôre proposing forcing them. And I don‚Äôt think you can tell them what is or isn‚Äôt rational, because it depends on how they personally weight different concerns: for instance, minimising the likelihood of death from COVID might be less important to them than, say, taking a stance against what they feel is a politically objectionable programme. I don‚Äôt know - I can‚Äôt really give voice to their concerns because I‚Äôm not in their head, but I know many people are implacably opposed to it, and I‚Äôm not clear on whether you‚Äôre proposing forcing them or simply trying to convince them.</p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs fair to say that vaccine mandates have a lot of vagueness to them, and they have a big impact on the public.  But in the end, they are by no means the only reason people are against vaccination.  The vaccine is not the reason people oppose it.  So I‚Äôm not going to defend it, but I hope it helps people who want to get vaccinated and who are willing to take the steps to get their shot.  And if you don‚Äôt want to go along with it, there‚Äôre lots of people who can

Fuck off. You're a rape apologist. You deny women assault men.   You deserve worse.	But yes I said that these impacted women more.

Is this a cmv or a King of the Hill appreciation thread?  The creators clearly make Dale a stand in for anti government cranks in Texas, and from there his character's lack of understanding of reality amd knee jerk anti authority personality creates a lot of comedy.  He is a great character. No way i could change your view on that though.	<p>For the most part yeah. The TV hosts are exaggerated characters they play up to drive interactions and get publicity through controversy, and with politicians, especially at high levels, it&#39;s which guy do you dislike the least.</p>	<p>I think you are right. I think it‚Äôs fair to say that Dale is a great entertainer, and that his cult following is largely due to him being able to improvise and improvise in a way that makes people laugh out loud. He is also a great actor, and his ability to communicate with people who aren‚Äôt his own fans is very important to the story. I don‚ÄôÔøΩt think anyone is going to stop him from doing that, but I think you‚Äôre right. He‚Äôll be fine for a while. </p>

The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis‚Äôs could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don‚Äôt hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.  I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in a state where euthanasia is legal. Having seen the horror of final stage cancer looks like, it‚Äôs very comforting to know I have an option.	2) If euthanasia is legal to some extent, people can still choose not to do it for themselves because of their own beliefs, but if it's completely illegal, people won't be free to make that choice for themself, no matter what they believe.	<p>And if you die suddenly, it‚Äôs a very different story.  Why should people choose to end their lives prematurely?</p>

Yeah, it‚Äôs super great for children to have a mass shooter as a parent	<p>We have seen CHILDREN slaughtered in droves over the past few decades.

The idea that this country is going to sit down and have a conversation about it after the 11,000th mass shooting is blind naivety. </p>	Ip>Parenting is also not the solution to a mass shooting.

>No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow.  Fuck you. Eat a dick.  >Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.   >   >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  Learn how to read retard.	<p>I assert that being a pedophile means you have an &quot;urge&quot; and having an &quot;urge&quot; automatically means there&#39;s a risk. Now, defining &quot;high&quot; is complicated. Personally I think human sex drive is pretty strong so in my opinion it&#39;s &quot;high&quot; enough to be concerned. Just be happy that we&#39;re not in the world of <em>&quot;Minority Report&quot;</em> and we do wait for people to actually commit the crime before giving out punishment.</p>	<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that this person has been attracted to children because of their sexual interest. However, the reality is that the crime is more likely to be committed by someone who is sexually active, not someone who does not. So, the question is, what makes this person different from others? If someone does not sexually engage with children, why would they be able to harm them? If they do not, why are we punishing them for it? The answer is straightforward: because it is more harmful to them. </p>

They‚Äôre weak AF and grew up in a timeline with low interests rates.  By the time they‚Äôre in the mid to late 20s we might have double interest rates on mortgage for people with bad/ low credit.  Automation should be advanced enough to replace all the menial repetitive jobs.  Social media has created this illusion that everyone is living their best life‚Ä¶.   Covid 19 called BULLSHIT on everyone !! If it wasn‚Äôt for the government welfare programs many people would have lost everything.	Ultimately, we need to accept that automation is coming to replace some, probably even many, jobs. There's no getting around that. It's going to happen no matter what we do. We need to accept that and find ways to structure society to still allow everyone to get their needs met without forcing them to take poverty wages. This is where something like a federal jobs guarantee or UBI can help pick up the slack when the private sector lays people off."	<p>In a perfect world, everyone would be doing exactly what they described above.  The problem is that people are not doing their best job, they are doing their worst job, and it&#39;s not their fault.  We should be providing for everyone</p>

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‚Äòdebate‚Äô (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I‚Äôm going to guess that you‚Äôre in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you‚Äôre willing to let me know your state, I‚Äôm happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I‚Äôm critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you‚Äôve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn‚Äôt deserve it, you shouldn‚Äôt have been subject to it, and it shouldn‚Äôt have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you‚Äôve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.	It sounds like you've gone through a lo of awful trauma, and the things you describe sound like attempts at abuse and gaslighting, and not actual, real beliefs that people hold."	<p>I agree with most of the things you said. I hope this helps. But at least in the beginning, I think it&#39;s mostly self-help that you are going through this process. You seem to be going through a lot of therapy, and it seems to be getting better. And in the end, the therapy that you&#37;ve been going through seems to help a lot more than it did in your first few attempts. It seems to me that the therapists you‚Äôve been seeing have a lot less empathy and are more accepting of your own needs than many therapists.

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.	There is evidence to back up men performing better in many physically based sports than woman however there are not real studies as to WHY. We assume it is increased muscle etc and that is a reasonable assumption however when we close that gap significantly with hormones people still want to argue the other physical differences. My issue with this argument is there is currently no evidence one way or the other and literally every human is physically different in some way."	<p>The only difference between men and women is the percentage of players who are exempt from certain substances, whereas women are allowed to compete in other sports because of their sex. So there is no difference in the sex of the athlete. So if you want to argue that men are exempt, you can simply argue that it is not a difference. And if it is, then it is by no means a matter of sex. It is just a biological fact. If you were to point out that women are more inhibited in certain areas of the sport, you wouldn&#39;t be saying that men should be allowed to

You brought it to the extreme to try to win an argument that isn't an argument. Then try to mock me for having a conversation with different view points. I have pity for you.   We all know evil things have been done in this world. Gross and disturbing acts, things that make stomachs crawl but I am now convinced nothing was as bad as not having you aborted. Even with that being said, I'd be happy to teach you to comprehend what you read better because no one is below redemption.	>Instead I said that your arguments you are using to prove that killing is evil are not working.

I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.	<p>I hate the switch controllers. The Playstation 2 dual shock controller is the greatest controller ever made. It fits nicely in my hand and all the buttons are in convenient locations. There&#39;s a reason why USB controllers nowadays typically copy the PS2 controller&#39;s design, and the later generations of Playstation controllers saw minimal change.</p>	<p>The problem is that when you try to use the Xbox controller, it feels a little too heavy for me to grip the stick with my left hand, so I have to lift my hand to grab the controller. </p>
Stop being pedantic, OP's argument is pretty understandable and you dufuses are trying to catch them on a pointless technicality like a shitty lawyer.	>That's just being pedantic.	<p>I&#39;m not trying to sound pedantic here, I&#37;m just trying to make sense of what OP&#38;s point. I don‚Äôt think you can actually grasp the meaning of the word, I think you could argue with that. I think OP &quot;agree with the gist of the argument, but you are trying to conjugate the meaning by portraying it as mere semantics. I know OP will be upset with me if I try to explain it to her, but I don't think she will be offended by my condescending tone.
Op is arguing in bad faith, they agree that it‚Äôs not offensive to them, but then state that they don‚Äôt speak for all white people.  You can‚Äôt change their mind because as they said, they don‚Äôt speak for all white people. This just a dude with hot take trying to get karma.	And let‚Äôs even suppose that you‚Äôre right (which you‚Äôre not because the argument is a racist hasty generalization) that whites don‚Äôt like talking about race. Your solution is to have a forum dedicated to hating white people and make fun of them? That makes no sense. If anything, seems like a good way to make whites resent other races."	<p>I&#39;m not saying they&#37;re not offended by white people because they don‚Äôt understand the meaning of the word, but because they are offended by it, they can&#47;t change their mind. So, yes, they are insulted by it.</p>

I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society). Sure, gender might be important to you, but what will that bring in the end. Ask yourself that.	Everything I say here is in the context of the acknowledgement that Gender is a social construct and that it is possible for it to outlive its usefulness. I don't think we're there today and won't be there for a long time, but it is what I advocate for."	<p>You are right. The idea of gender is that it is irrelevant to society. It is not about what you think or feel. It‚Äôs about how society functions, and how it functions. So I&#39;m not saying that you&#37;re not interested in what happens to you. I think you should be mindful of this. Your view is that society functions in a certain way, and you should not feel inhibited by it.</p>

You whine more than a kid at a restaurant.   You don‚Äôt own the world, you‚Äôre not owed a child-free restaurant any more than parents are owed a night out with their family.  Go to a different restaurant or work somewhere else if you can‚Äôt handle it.  How are parents supposed to teach their kids how to act in public if they never bring them out in public?   You‚Äôre evidently child-free, so why don‚Äôt you go enjoy your water in a place that doesn‚Äôt allow children?	I addressed this argument. Are you also one of those insufferable people that think it's ok for a child to make a giant mess in a restaurant and the parents just leaving it behind because ""ThEy pAy pEoPLe to ClEAn""? That's the same kind of bullshit attitude.	<p>Parenting is also a completely separate sphere of existence from a person‚Äôs responsibility as a parent. If a kid can‚Äôt do that, why should they be treated as such? The answer is that the parent is not responsible for the kid‚Äôre actions, but rather the actions of the child. You are not the parent who has to decide whether or not to allow the child to go out with their friends, family members, or coworkers. The parent is responsible for ensuring that the kid is safe, not the other way around. And that doesn‚ÄôÔøΩt mean they should be treated
What is woman? As a human with the anatomical organs that make me a woman in your eyes this question is so ridiculous. Woman is everything and nothing. Woman is anything she wants to be. Just say you‚Äôre a bigot and call it a day bud.   I swear if conservatives spent a quarter of the energy they do on worrying if peoples genitals matched their pronouns, we would solve world hunger. But no you guys are more worried about a person being a different gender on the inside.	Most people are expected to be a man or a woman, this is gender. It have no basis in biology. You could very well socialize someone born male as a woman if every interraction this person have consider her to be a woman and this despite her male genitals.	<p>I think the gender we identify with is what makes us a woman. It is not what you think it is. If you identify as a woman, you are wrong. The gender you identify with will always be assigned as a male. So you are going to identify with the gender you want to identify as. And that&#39;s okay. I think that&quot;feminists are supposed to think that women are interchangeable. They are not supposed to be interchangeable. If we had a gender that matched the sex of the wearer, we would be able
There's a lot of people in this thread arguing about individual rights and government over reach as if they were still alive in this scenario and were safeguarding against tyranny. You're dead. You are no longer in possession of this bag of useful tissue. You are no no longer part of this decision making process. It should be up to the living to figure out how best to use this resource.	<p>Governments never handbag authority that has been even temporarily even to them by the people of the countries. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan government authority is the closest thing to eternal life we have on this planet, if the government mandates that sound good it‚Äôs a vaccine, they can mandate you to do anything they want to do with your body. Either governments believe in ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äú or they don‚Äôt. When they stop believing that you have an individual right to choose what goes into your bloodstream and what doesn‚Äôt, then individual rights do not exist anymore. This is not a slippery slope fallacy, and governments do this sort of thing all the time.</p>	<p>It&#39;s not like we are living in a fantasy world where we have free speech and the ability to make decisions without government oversight. We are in this fantasy world because we have the power to decide what we want to do with our lives. The only way to do that is to live in a real world where you have the freedom to choose your own body and not depend on government oversight.</p>
Don‚Äôt want to change your view, I agree	Absolutely.  That isn't the point I am making to change your view though.	<p>I don&#39;t think changing your view will change anyone‚Äôs mind.

I don‚Äôt see a single attempt to change your mind that isn‚Äôt clearly a case of ‚Äúno, I got fucked over, other people should, too‚Äù or ‚Äúthis world is tough and cruel [the one they didn‚Äôt choose to be born into], they gotta learn that.‚Äù  OP, I agree with you. No child chose to be born. In that way, every single hurdle they face is, at heart, the parents‚Äô fault. There are plenty of problems that bad parenting specifically creates, to boot. In the end, unless you can be 100% sure that some obstacle or problem a child of yours faces is PURELY their own fault, and not contributed to by you or the world YOU CHOSE to bring them into, you ought to help them to the best of your ability, until the day you die.  FTR, I have a 21 and 18 year old, so please don‚Äôt try to claim I don‚Äôt have experience.	<p>You‚Äôre right. Some parents are shitty. Real shitty. Some of us are doing the best we can. There is no manual or handbook that gets given to you when you‚Äôre discharged after giving birth. Most of us do the best we can, provide necessities, some wants, and lots of love. The younger generations are depressed because of their own actions. They are mostly disillusioned because they don‚Äôt have a good concept of reality, which is evident by your stream of conscious post here. None of us can change your view because you don‚Äôt want it changed. You came here to rant about how much you hate people with children. </p>	<p>Parenting is a process, and parents have to do whatever they can to make the child happy. So it‚Äôs not easy for kids to choose the wrong path. But having a kid is not easy. And if they don‚Äôt want to have that kid, or if they want to be the parent, they can. But as parents, we have to make sure that the child is happy and healthy, and that they have a loving and supportive family. So, in that way, the choice is yours. And as parents we can make a healthy choice for the child.  In that way

Everyone here acting like the rules don't **heavily** favor offenses in the NFL.  YoU hAd A cHaNcE tO sToP tHeM.  No shit? And the other team would have to stop them too if both teams were guaranteed a possession.	Football meanwhile offers so many variations it's not funny.  I've seen games where the opponent completely stops an offense from scoring, but then that team's defense drops a couple of pick-sixes and wins the game.  That's like playing a grandmaster.

There's always another option."	<p>The rule doesn&#39;t explicitly favor offenses, it just makes sense to have the other team do the same thing.

European here, just don't mutilate your children regardless of gender.	What you have to understand is that here in Europe, we don't mutilate little children like the 'greatest country on earth'. It's not a debate here. Doctors and medical organisations oppose it and there is no 'debate'. If you want to sit there and compare male genital mutilation to vaccines, you may as well be defending clitoral hood removal (female equivalent of foreskin). We see you as barbarians for performing this evil, but I prefer to educate rather than insult, and I always try my best to do that. If however, you want to insistent on entrenching yourself into your position and carry on defending this evil because you don't want to consider the possibility that a part of you was damaged before you could consent, or that you damaged your own sons, it's going to go about as well for you as everyone else who's done that, so you might want to get a preview by checking my post history regarding this issue."	<p>If you don‚Äôt want kids, you should stop mutilating them.

Got it, you're incapable of discussion.  Your only goal is to misunderstand arguments and then quote a somewhat related logical fallacy.

You seem like a logical person who is not willing to make logical arguments, which makes sense to me because logical reasoning is what you are doing here.</p>
You definitely caught me not checking your response though, I wish I had, it would have saved lots of redundant and useless dialogue. I should have known; the typical Reddit ‚Äòresearch‚Äô take is to directly google for data to support your conclusion, then browbeat with it with some superfluous grammar that suggests superior intelligence, then pray that no one reads it.  Or more likely, pray that if they do, they don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs implications and limitations that you weren‚Äôt able to grasp yourself.	You can't have a meaningful conversation if all your rebuttals are ""Yeah but this unnamed study I won't show you says you're wrong""."	<p>I&#39;m not sure why you guys are so insistent on just repeating your claims, but I&#37;m pretty sure it‚Äôs because you don&#40;t understand the concepts behind them, or because you have no idea what they mean. </p> I guess it&#38;s just as easy to criticize others for not understanding the nuances of their arguments when you actually do understand them, and then you can criticize them for it.</p>

I think the amount of people who buy that soul mate crap is smaller than you imply.   Most people are fairly practical in my experience.   &#x200B;  edit. Reading the comments here maybe I'm wrong. People are sappy and retarded.	<li>People really only have a small amount of mates, usually 3-20, pirates share to tens of thousands of complete strangers. There are many things in our world that are fine at one scale but not at a completely different scale. For example, sex with someone who&#39;s 6570 days old is fine.

I think your reading comprehension is to blame here but nonetheless: Google this discussion and you‚Äôll find countless more studies. HMU when you‚Äôre done reading those if this one wasn‚Äôt clear or sufficient for you.	Multiple other studies I linked do exactly that.

The phrase "gender identity" might be somewhat recent, but we have data about people identifying with various genders that dates well over a thousand years.  By the way, the term "constructive conversation" doesn't mean just lying down and accepting whatever factually false bullshit some random bigot on the internet throws at you. It is reasonable to continue the conversation without pretending as if the wrong transphobic bullshit you write was true.	Often these conversations stem from the question ""how do you know you're trans."" The first answer most people will give are things like ""I didn't align with stereotypical preferences/ ideas of (x gender people).""	<p>I think you are coming to the conclusion that the term ‚Äútransgender‚Äù is a misperception, and that trans people should be treated with the same respect and respect as everyone else. If you want to use the term to describe someone who identifies as different genders, then you should first check if that person identifies as either of those two genders. Otherwise, you are just playing along with the bullshit you‚Äôve been playing with all along. I&#39;m not going to attempt to convince anyone of that. I will try to convince you that your view is not as biased as others
I‚Äôm not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it ‚Äúthe problem of evil‚Äù, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world. Therefore, since there is undeniably evil in this world, god can‚Äôt exist as defined by the major monotheistic religions. It‚Äôs an interesting debate!	Maybe you can't believe in an omnipotent god, but maybe god isn't omnipotent and is only being described as omnipotent because the people who believe the stories of god use that word to describe him. Have we seen him try to make a stone he can't lift? Why does he have to be omnipotent according to our flawed language system that would make that paradoxical on purpose just to prove he doesn't exist? This entire argument that you need human words to describe superhuman entities and concepts in order for it to exist and make sense in your brain doesn't hold much water. Things can exist regardless of our words for them.	<p>The problem of evil is not that there is no God, but that there exists a finite number of human beings that can be created by God. The problem is that God can‚Äôt create infinite numbers of beings, which means there is infinite amount of evil in this world. God exists in infinite numbers, but there is finite amount of finite finite bodies that cannot be created. So God cannot create infinite infinite number of beings. So there exists finite number that are created by the laws of nature, and finite number we can eliminate. So the problem is not about God but rather about how we get there. And
Why would you think id find value in a CNN article when the two news orgs on the list I gave you are known for being not bias and are a gold standard for reporting?  Hence the primary reason in listing them in the first place.    Beyond that, its an article about how a few people feel.    Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....  There's a lot to bitch about, but diversity in the inner circle does not appear to be valid?  https://www.facebook.com/POTUS/photos/a-cabinet-that-looks-like-america/171170408292829/  1	<p>So you honestly think that CNN, MSNBC, NBC, etc. are center or unbiased? Maybe this was the case 20 years ago, but it&#39;s not anymore. If you think that the above are not left-wing, you&#39;re being either willfully ignorant or are behind the times. </p>	<p>I think it‚Äôs fair to say that the only reason they‚Äôve had so many staff departures in the last year or so is because they have more loyal staff members than they have loyal staff. They have a reputation for giving good reports, not necessarily bad ones, but they have a tendency to have a hard time keeping up with the news cycle. They seem to be losing trust in their own hierarchy, despite the fact that they aren‚Äôt actively trying to exert their influence over the media. They‚Äôre doing their best to keep their credibility up, and are doing it with a united

No. That's still being a selfish piece of shit. These aren't imaginary people. Those are real people that assholes like you are killing. And believe it or not, plenty of folks can give a shit about strangers. That's just you and people like that only care about people you know. That's kind of a staple for conservatives and libertarians. You don't give a fuck unless it's at your door.	Several times now, I've encountered strangers on the internet making flip passing jokey comments about killing themselves ‚Äì which seems to be exactly the thing and the sort of people you are dismissing ‚Äì and reached out to them privately, only to discover they were, actually, acutely suicidal and not under any sort of psychiatric care whatsoever, and, yeah, actually did need someone to rescue them.  Sometimes I've done this, and found out, they did have mental health care, and it was being dealt with ‚Äì but they were grateful to find out someone noticed and was looking out for them.	<p>I feel like you are being selfish here. You don&#39;t owe people anything. You owe them something. The person you owe the debt of their existence is yours alone.</p>
This is objectively the worst answer of all.    Saying you haven't done your research so you can't be at blame for making bad decisions is just awful, really bottom of the barrel mentality.  Everyone is accountable for their choices in life, being uninformed is no excuse.	The problem we have is people enjoying looking at situations with hindsight, having looked at all facts and spent many hours considering what the correct actions should have been. Rarely do they ever consider what information was available in the moment or what the instinctive reaction is to the situation, and even fewer seem to care about what the potential ramifications are for making the wrong call."	<p>The answer to your last question is: no. You can&#39;t blame anyone for bad decisions. You must be ignorant to make those decisions. </p>

I'll take this even further. It shouldn't be an option at all. Anyone who dies should have their organs available to someone in need, period. Why does anyone care? Just remove the entire thing from the driver's license and make everyone an organ donor. Done. Lives saved.	If someone wishes to mitigate that risk by not being an organ donor, that should be their choice."	<p>Don&#39;t be discouraged from donating organs. Don&#59;t go against the wishes of your family and friends by donating them to a non-profit organization.</p>  Why not just let people donate their organs?</p>
Failures in human memory are one thing, intentional malice is another. She lied about him being 100% the one responsible. She lied about him in her book. She lied about him having a record. She lied about him greeting her. What many of you believe about the police could be a lie as well. She has some mental illness issues going on and trying to downplay her vile acts call into question the quality of your character.	You witnessed a fairly serious crime.  Even without the cooperation of the victim, the police could move forward with a case against the guy based on the evidence of injury and your testimony and getting her out of that situation."	<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#37;s an act of selflessness, but I feel like it is an act based solely on the fact that she had no idea what was happening. She lied about her own mental health and suicidal thoughts, and then lied to the police about it.</p> She lied to them about it being her fault, and they are now accusing her of lying to them. She is not blaming them for it, she is blaming them solely on her own actions. She has no idea why they were so violent, she doesn&#38;t seem to be
Do me a favor. Pull up google maps and tell me where Ukraine is located relative to Russia. Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?  America is overreaching and attempting to extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, all the way to Russia's border, trying to drink Russia's milkshake, and retards like you think everything is going to be kumbaya and Putin is just going to let this fly.	Okay. Russia turns their attention to financing and building a working political relationship with Mexican cartels. They fund them so well that these cartels take over both de-facto and de-jure control of parts of Mexico. Russian forces legitimately and legally move into Mexico at the invitation of a Mexican state and given the green light by the Mexican federal government.	<p>It&#39;s not like Ukraine is independent from the rest of the former Soviet Union. It is not like Russia is trying to impose its will on Ukraine. The fact that Ukraine is not independent from Russia is not a reflection of how the former USSR viewed the country. It was a result of the Soviet reaction to the annexation of Crimea from the US. It&#37;s an example of how Europe reacted to the US withdrawal from the region. Europe reacted with mutual hostility. The US also backed the withdrawal of its diplomats from the country, which gave the Soviet Union the benefit of the doubt.

Logically you are correct  if it's offensive to do it to one culture its offensive to do it to all cultures. But the die hard sjws only care about nonwhite cultures being appropriated. Because cultural appropriation is racist and you can't be racist against white people because they have all the power. At least that's how my former liberal friends screamsplained it at me when I made tacos for my superbowl party.	<p>And even then, these SJWs usually don‚Äôt listen when people from the actual culture they are getting offended for tells them that it‚Äôs not offensive, since of course they all know better. </p>	<p>It&#39;s not about cultural appropriation. It&#37;s about how white people perceive their own culture, and how they perceive and react when someone disrespects their own identity. This is one of the main reasons why people think that black people are inherently racist, because they are perceived as inferior to white people, and that would be harmful to their reputation. </p>

Adding to what you said, I think it's pretty sad that nowadays people still consider good & evil in politics as being a thing.  &#x200B;  People still treat those conflicts as if they weren't just different empires trying to acquire more influence and territory over different regions.	Would it be fair to say that both sides of that conflict were worthy of being called bad?	Youp>I think it&#39;s sad that wars have ended, and that we have to go along with them to achieve their goals.

You deny it happens.    If millions of men are being sexually assaulted and raped by women each year, that is a "massive number."	My apologies, I misspoke, probably because my attention span regarding someone with zero capacity to address my points is dwindling. ***Women are literally 9 times more likely to be raped, than you are to be murdered as a man.*** As per statistics that I have ALREADY LINKED AND EXPLAINED	<p>I&#39;m not saying it is the case, but it is a fact of life that happens more often than not. And it is not the fault of men. It is the fault that women are victim blaming for things that happen to them. It‚Äôs just the way things are. Women are victim- blaming themselves for things they haven&#37;t done in decades. It doesn&#38;t have to be this way. Women aren&#47;t going to be raped by men every day. It happens more slowly than it used to be.

As someone who has been using a flip phone for the past 5 years, I can honestly say I'm not missing anything. I deleted my Facebook bought a flip phone and a Garmin gps. I can honestly say that I'm in a much better place mentally and I've been way more productive.	<p>The twist is that we&#39;ve hit the phone where smartphones don&#39;t improve that much from year to year. It used to be every year added a new crazy feature. Now the pace is slower. So no phone is <em>much</em> better then the competing or previous one. For example, the much hyped 5G functionality is useless for most people around the world (and definitely in the US) since there is so little 5G coverage right now.</p>	<p>I have no idea why people are addicted to flip phones, but I know that it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre constantly on their phone, not because they are doing something stupid or stupid, but because they want to be productive and not have to do anything stupid. </p>

To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.  You are chamging the premise previously agreed upon to win the debate, ie false premise fallacy.	I in no way deny systemic racism, just you're analysis of it. Systemic racism is the product of a class based society where inequality is baked into the social structure.	<p>I&#39;m not saying that racism is systemic, just that it‚Äôs a system.  So if you think it‚Äòs systemic racism, then you‚Äôre wrong.  But racism is not systemic racism.  And this is where you get the idea that you are being accused of being racist because you don‚Äôt understand the meaning of racism. This is because racism is a system of systemic racism that is based solely on one set of biases, i think you are seeing that in a lot of instances.  I don‚Äòt think that systemic racism is as systemic

Google exists Ok lets say a new reddit user wants to hide a post and sees the "hide" button. What is the most rational thing to do? 1. Press hide, sees post is hidden, thinks post is hidden or 2.

And yeah, I know you could just use incognito... But at that point there&#39;s nothing you could do stop those who use it xd. I mean, obviously there would be ways around it. It&#39;s a matter of making it less accessible, because yeah, nowadays an actual toddler could by pure accident end up watching a bunch of NSFW content. If you just make it less accessible to minor, they would have to be actively trying to access that content. And at that point the damage is already been done.
