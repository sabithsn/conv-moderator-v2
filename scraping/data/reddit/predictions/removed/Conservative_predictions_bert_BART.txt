Lol what?! Almost everything is “framed entirely subjectively by the human mind” thank you for the captain obvious word vomit. Humans have two genders that’s why we can reproduce. Your born one and can’t be the other.

Truth:
So there is a concept of gender that isn’t so rigid as “EITHER you have all of these traits OR you have the other ones”"

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think we can be both genders without having sex. I think it’s pretty obvious that people are born with the same sex, and that’ll be a big part of why people are attracted to men. It’d also be a huge part of the reason why we have a lot of men. I&#37;m not sure why men are more attracted to women. I hope you can find out why that is. Maybe it”s because men can’t figure out how women feel about their bodies. Perhaps they’re afraid
<p>It’s not about gender, it’&#39;s about how you’re born. You must be born with two genders to be able to reproduce, but you must also be born in the same body as your parent. So you must be the same gender to be a human. If you don’t, you are the same person as your mother. </p>
<p>I think that’s a fair way to put it. We can’t be the same way in life because we’re both born with the same sex. We’ve all been in the same boat for a long time, and we have no idea what the difference is in the sexes of the genders. We are not the same species. We have the same genes. We just have different genders. You have to be different in order to be a human.

Yeah, tell me about it. This is why I don’t take crap from NTs.

Truth:
In RTS games you must often delay buying more powerful units or advancing further up the tech tree in order to build more resource harvesting units....

Prediction:
<p>I think I’m going to have to take a dig at the NT for this. It’s not a dig, it’ll be a dig. You’re going to need to read the whole thing before you’ve even read it. You are going to want to know the whole point of it all. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t take crap from NTs. I take shit from people who are NTs as well. I&#40;m not saying they are bad, just that they are not the ones that are bad. I don’t think they are the bad ones. </p>
<p>I’m not going to give a shit about NTs, but I’ll tell you what I think about it. I really don’t care about them at all. I don&#39;t care because they’re not mine. I just want to be able to understand them. They are not my problem. They”re my problem.</p>

Throw in some obesity and personality disorders and you get me!

Truth:
<p>Obesity is a mental issue just like any other substance abuse.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Your own obesity and personality disorders are also part of the equation. So you can&#39;t say that the problem is obesity.</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s the problem with obesity. It’d be easy to identify a mental illness, but I’m not sure if that is the cause of the obesity. I just think it is. I think obesity is an area that is very common, and I hope it is not the reason that obesity is so prevalent. I don”t think it’ll be a problem for anyone, but it is a very big part of the problem.
<p>I also don’t think there’s a cure for obesity. I think it’d be a lot better to see if you can figure out how it works. And I think that would be a good thing if you could figure out the cure. </p>

Can't have illegal immigrants vote if they have to have an ID to vote.

Truth:
<p>For some reason people have the notion that large amounts of people who are legally allowed to vote in the US don’t have IDs.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don’t think it’s fair to have illegal immigrants vote. They’re not allowed to vote in this country, unless they have a valid ID. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it’s fair to have illegal immigrants vote. If they don’t, then it”s not fair to ask them to vote. The problem is that they can’ts vote. They can”t vote if they have a valid ID. </p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that illegal immigrants should have an ID to vote. And that’d make them ineligible to vote, but it would also mean that the government wouldn’t be able to force them to vote at all. </p>

>Quickly, for point of comparison what's the murder rate of the UK?  Respectfully, I don't care.

Truth:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/283093/homicides-in-the-uk/

Prediction:
<p>The UK has the highest murder rate in the world, and the US has the second highest. The US is the only country in the UK with a higher murder rate. The UK is also the only place with a lower murder rate than the US, but the US is in the top 20%.
<p>If you don&#39;t see the UK murder rate, you can see it in the US as well, but in the UK the murder rate is about 10% higher. In the US it is over 40%. In the UK it is more than 90% higher than the US. In other countries, it is around 50% higher.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think the UK has the highest murder rate in the world, but it does have the highest crime rate in Europe. The UK has a higher murder rate than the US.

It has nothing to do with race, but you didn't care about the actual argument I made then, and you still want to misrepresent it now.

Truth:
<p>Your argument at this point is inherently racist assuming that people with the same ethnicity and race think and share the same things.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s not about race. It&#37;s about how you view race, not how you see it.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t say race, but I did say that the argument I made was that race was irrelevant to the actual argument. This is why I made it. I don&#37;t think race is irrelevant. I&#38;m not sure how you feel about that. I think the whole point of the argument is to get people to think that race is a big part of the equation.</p>
<p>Your point is that race is irrelevant to your argument, and I&#39;m not going to make it. You have no idea what race is, and you don&#37;t care about it.</p>

>This sort of implies we shouldn't allow drunk people into nightclubs cause they might find the loud noise overwhelming, or even into restaurants cause they might not like the food.  I'm not OC, but this is a purposefully stupid argument. The world isn't a binary. As adults we can say that a person might have the current ability to consent to some things and not others. A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations. A drunk person (a long as they aren't too drunk) can be trusted to order an Uber; that doesn't mean they should be trusted to drive.  I'm not commenting on your argument as a whole, but this portion of it is terrible.

Truth:
<p>But if those factors aren&#39;t involved, you can willingly drive drunk.  And, as a society, we ostracize such a person as consciously making an immoral act.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s fair to say that a teen is at fault for not being able to consent to certain things. If a teenager is drunk, they’re at fault. That’d be a shame, because the person who is drunk should be able to choose to consent. If they aren’t, then they are at fault, because they are not a teenager. But we have to be mindful of that. If the teen wants to choose a restaurant, they can. But if they want to choose something else, they have to choose the restaurant. But unless they are a teenager

You're the one who took it to the extreme by saying things like " no one is below redemption " and " no one is truly bad"  and I doubt you could teach me anything considering you're sophomoric attempt at philosophy. Inability to use the correct spelling of words. And failure to distinguish between optimistic and pessemistic. Your argument and original post are based on absolutely nothing but semantics and your own arbitrary views and definitions  of morality and redemption.   I no longer wish to continue discussing anything with someone who would be blatantly intellectually dishonest and say such disgusting things may God have mercy on whatever remains of your soul.

Truth:
<p><strong>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#39;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be &quot;cured&quot; against one&#39;s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”</strong></p>

Prediction:
<p>You&#39;re not the only one who has not been able to prove that morality and redemption are equal. I&#40;m not saying that every person is above redemption, but I do think that some people are. Some of them are, in fact, higher than others. But you&#37;re being disingenuous by trying to use false equivalency and false equivalence to justify your claims.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to defend your argument, but you&#37;re not doing it for me. I&#38;m going to argue that every person is worth the effort of redeeming. </p>And as far as my point is concerned, the point of this post is to appeal to both sides of the argument. It is an argument that is entirely based on the premise of morality and redemption. I believe that God has mercy on all individuals who are willing to redeem themselves.
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#37;s fair to say that there&#38;s no one who is below redemption. I think it’s reasonable to think that there are people who are above redemption, and I&#40;m not saying that there is no one</p> who is above redemption. The problem is that most of the people who use this term are ignorant, ignorant, or just ignorant. They&#43;re simply ignorant and ignorant.</p>

It is amazing how many CMVs are posted on this topic.

Truth:
<p>The top comment points out why these kinds of CMVs are often the worst ones, and you&#39;re doing exactly what they described.</p>

Prediction:
Ip>CMVs are a big part of CMVs. They have a lot of potential to be used as a tool to communicate with people. They are a great tool to help people communicate with each other. They can also be used to help them gain trust in each other.</p>
<p>CMVs are an enormous number of things. There are thousands of CMVs, many thousands of them on the internet, and thousands of thousands of people on reddit. A lot of them are CMVs. </p>
<p>CMVs are a huge source of information, so I think it’s a fair way to sum up CMVs. They’re a great way to share information about CMVs and the history of CMVs, and they’ve been a huge success. The CMVs that have been posted so far are generally pretty engaging and engaging.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
I agree w/ you.   There's very few policies which make the offer "you can save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a year and it won't detract from the quality of life a single living person." This is one of them.  And yes, maybe you're detracting from their life if they're creeped out about it before they die. If so, they can opt out.

Truth:
No one lives well off 20 k a year. That person isn't saving or investing. That person doesn't have health care. That person is living on the margins."

Prediction:
<p>If people don&#39;t want to take the offer, they can opt out of it. But if they do, I&#37;m not willing to take that risk. So why should I?</p>
<p>That is a very good thing, but it’s not the solution. The solution is to make people choose to opt out of the scheme. The only way that you can do that is by making them choose to do it. If they choose not to go, it will be better for them. It&#39;s not a solution that will save them the agony of their lives. It is a choice they can make without having to pay for it.</p>
<p>The most common reason people would choose to take the life of someone they don&#39;t want is because they don’t want to lose their life. If they do want to take their life, they can do it. They can do so in a healthy way. They could do it in a healthier way. But if they have no desire to do it, they must also be willing to make the choice to do so. If the person they are choosing to die is not willing to do that. They must be willing and able to do whatever they want to do to save their own life.

The Scientific Community legit one time accepted "Scientific" Racism as being true.  It wasn't just "fringe science" neither. It was in the mainstream and accepted as such.

Truth:
And it seems necisary to note there isn't racist science. There are facts science teaches us and then what we choose to do with those facts.

Prediction:
<p>The scientific community never accepted the term “Scientific” as a valid scientific term. It was a term used to refer to the idea that “science” is inherently biased. But it&#39;s true. The scientific community is not biased. The fact is that it is biased is what it is, not what it seems to be. The science is not scientific, it is not what you think it is. It is what you’re doing. You’ve seen the results of scientific research.
<p>Science is inherently scientific. It’s not just scientific. The scientific community is a scientific community. The mainstream scientific community does not support this. It has a very specific set of beliefs and goals. It does not have to be based solely on scientific theories. The science of science is what we believe and believe. We do not need to be trained to believe in science to be able to make sense of the world. You must be willing to trust the scientific community to support those beliefs. </p>
<p>The scientific community has long accepted that science is inherently flawed. But there is no way to know for certain if there is a scientific consensus that scientific theories are flawed. If there is, then there is very little chance that it is true. But if there was, it would be in the mainstream. There is no need to know that there is always a chance that someone out there is going to be a scientist out there. If that person doesn&#39;t see the evidence, they will be a skeptic.</p>

You sound controlling bordering on abusive. "letting" your partner eat. Getting get off Starbucks.

Truth:
>Keeping an abusive relationship together by force because each other

Prediction:
<p>If you&#39;re abusive, then you are not the one who is getting a divorce. You are the one that is going to have to pay for the divorce. </p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that you are not controlling. You are not the one who is forcing your partner to eat. You’re the one that is forcing him to eat, and you are the person who is doing it. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not accusing you of being abusive, just accusing you for not doing anything to help. I am not suggesting you get off your ass and do something about it. You have no idea how much you&#38;re doing to deserve this. You&#37;re being abusive to your partner. You are not blaming me for anything.</p>

Can't you go back to that sub and argue with the people there who already want to argue about this?

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#40;re going to argue with me about this. I&#47;m going to go back to that sub and argue with people who don’t want to argue. I don”t think I can argue with anyone who wants to argue about this, but I can &quot; argue with them.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you can argue with this sub, because I think it is an issue that people are willing to engage in. I think you are going to be able to engage with that sub without having to go through a lot of effort to get a response. </p>

Truth:
Call someone the n-word? As long as it's just you alone, that's just bigotry and makes you an a\*hole but it's not racism.

Prediction:
<p>You&#39;re not calling me a racist, you&quot;re calling me the n-word</p>
<p>I’m not saying that you are a racist. I’ve used the n-word before, but I don’t think it’s a racist.</p>

What do you think antibodies do? They fight virus ALREADY IN your system. You've already caught the virus. Vaccine generated antibodies or t cells are preventing you from getting seriously ill from it, dumbass. It gives your immune system a head start. I can't believe I have to explain this to an adult...     I've heard several other idiots make this argument before. "If someone who was vaccinated tests positive, the vaccine didn't work."      Antigen and PCR tests test for the presence of the virus in your system, which nothing can prevent (except maybe wearing a mask, but i'm pretty sure I know where you stand on that too). Vaccines prevent you from becoming seriously ill from the infection, which the covid vaccines have done an incredible job of.      It's incredible to me that it's been public knowledge for over a year that 90+% of people in the hospital with covid are unvaccinated and people like you still can't put two and two together.

Truth:
The vaccine doesn't make you ""immune"", like in a videogame you're immune to a certain kind of damage. Even if you have the vaccine, the virus can still enter your body and live for a while. What the vaccine does is teach your body how to fight the virus, so that it can combat it more quickly and effectively. But the virus can still enter, you just won't feel a lot of symptoms. And that can be dangerous for other people who still don't have the vaccine - you can contaminate them. So for a while longer, even those who are vaccinated still need to practice social distancing, because while they don't get sick, they can make other people sick."

Prediction:
<p>Vaccine does not kill your immune system. It does not prevent it from dying. Vaccines only kill your body and your organs. Vaccine doesn&#39;t kill it. So what does it do to your body? Does it kill your immunity? If you don’t have antibodies, then your body is going to die. If you do, you are going to have to be hospitalized. The vaccine does not stop the virus from killing your body.
<p>I don&#39;t think the vaccine is a cure-all for the virus. It’s not a cure. If you don’t get vaccinated you’re not going to be able to get vaccinated. Vaccines are not meant to kill people. They are meant to help prevent them from dying. So, why should you be vaccinated?</p>
<p>A vaccine doesn&#39;t kill a virus. It does kill the immune system, but it does not kill the virus. If the virus exists, it will kill it. The vaccine doesn’t kill it.</p>

I agree overall, but would say that religion is not declining, rather it is morphing into different belief systems centered around politics. If you take a look at the climate change fanatics, they have an apocalyptical religion which teaches the world is on the verge of ending and only they have the knowledge to save the world. The way to save the world is to radically alter all of human society to conform to the worldviews of the climate fanatics through the force of government. Government is the savior in this religion. Other environmental fanatics have a similar secular religion that sees the government as the savior and seeks to bring about their vision of heaven on earth by banning mineral extraction, commercial agriculture, logging, commercial fishing, etc. These people worship nature and the government, viewing nature as supreme to man. Many of these groups support population control and reduction, with increasing numbers supporting forced population control and reduction.  Communism and socialism are also secular religions that seek to abolish man and create a new, perfect being that will live in a utopia. They both seek to radically alter human life, societies, cultures, and traditions in their quest to see heaven brought to earth. Once again, the government acts as the savior, bringing forth justice and exterminating all the "evil" people who oppose this religion. The one thing these religions have in common is that they do not have a god in the traditional sense. The adherents themselves are gods, who can do whatever they want and decide for themselves what is moral and what is not. There is no higher authority to appeal to, just themselves or the leaders in government.

Truth:
The increasing ""civilization"" in developed nations also coincides with a decrease in devout religious faith.

Prediction:
<p>The climate change fanatics have a very different view on religion. They have a much different view of religion, and they believe that the idea of God is the ultimate solution to the problem. They believe that God created humanity, and that the world is going to end. They think that God has created the world and created the future. They feel that God is responsible for the world. They want to save the planet, and God has the power to make that happen. But God has a lot of power and power to do that. He is the creator of the world, not the creator. He has the ability
<p>The climate change fanatics think the world is on the verge of ending. They think the end is coming and they want to save it. They’re not going to stop because they think that it’s going to be the end of the world. They don’t think that the end justifies the means, but they think it is. They believe that it is the beginning of the end and they’ve got to do something to stop it from happening. They want to make sure that the world ends up being a better place. They are willing to do whatever it takes to save the
<p>You seem to be saying that the world is going to end in the next century, but I think it is more likely to be in the same direction as the last century, because the population of the planet is growing and changing and that is the reason why people are suffering. But I don&#39;t think it’s the end of the world, because we are already in a period of change, and we are not going to be able to change that. So, I think we are going to have to reevaluate our faith in the end because the end result is very different from the beginning

Suffering?GTFO here.Grow up and pay your fucking debts,that you agreed to.How hard is that? Is the fact that you are educated mean you are immune from "suffering"?No. Suck it up.Let the fat fuck with the heart attack die, I didn't force the food into his mouth.

Truth:
> If suffering somehow gives you an adaptational advantage, then it should be considered more intelligent to suffer.

Prediction:
<p>If you are suffering, then your life is not going to be complete. If you have nothing else to do, then you are doing something to make it better.</p>
<p>You are not saying that you are going to die. You are saying that suffering is not a disease. You’re saying that it’s a disease and that people will die as a result of it.</p></p>
<p>The only thing you can do is give up your debt. You can’t give up. You have to do what you want. And you have to pay off your debt.</p>

“Mommy, people get mad at me and say mean things to me when i say the n-word, but those black people can say it and nobody gets mad at them. It’s so unfair :( this is the *real* racism in america, unlike those fake problems that people complain about like having 10x less wealth, or dying more frequently due to not having healthcare, or getting killed by the police”

Truth:
<p>The problem emerges because people include &quot;structural&quot;, or &quot;systematic&quot; in their definition of racism. If we follow this definition, we can&#39;t even say calling someone the N word is racism, because it isn&#39;t systematic, its just someone who insults people. That&#39;s obviously absurd.</p>

Prediction:
Butp>My point is that racism is real, and that racism can be addressed in a positive way. It’s not something that is a “white privilege”. It is a privilege to be treated with respect and respect. A privilege to have a voice and to be able to voice your opinion and not be treated as a burden by society. It&#39;s a privilege for people to use their voice and speak their own words and speak in a negative way. The problem is that we have to be willing to work hard to change that, and to do so, we have a lot of
<p>I’m a black woman, so I don’t think it’s fair to say that a black person is the victim of racism. If someone says “white privilege” to me, I’d say “well, that’ll be fair”, but I think that is not fair. I think a lot of people who are black are just ignorant or ignorant. I don&#39;t know why people are constantly upset by things like that, but they’re doing it because they don”t understand the system.
<p>Black people are not treated the same way we are. It&#39;s an issue of fairness, and it&#37;s not something you&#38;re entitled to complain about.</p>

At first I was going to disagree but this is something I've always  agreed with as a person with it.

Truth:
I would disagree with this as well.

Prediction:
Ip>I think you’re right to disagree with me. I think it’s fair to say that I’m a bit biased here, but I don’t think I have to.
<p>This isn&#39;t an argument I will disagree with. It is a discussion that I have had for years. I’m not going to go into the details here, but I think it is a good idea to have an open discussion. If you want to disagree with me, I”m sure you’ll find a way to do so. But if you don’t, then you can simply disagree with my point. If I did, I would. </p>
Ip>I agree with everything you said. I’m not going to argue with you because you don’t agree with me. You’re wrong. I don&#39;t disagree with you. You&#40;re wrong.</p>

>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamb

Truth:
<p>You&#39;re starting from &quot;rape fantasies are bad and cause rape and other negative results (and by extension porn is bad and causes X bad things to happen),&quot; and you&#39;re trying to shoehorn anything you can anywhere you can in order to justify that claim being true. Your links don&#39;t prove it, they don&#39;t prove porn causes anything, and they don&#39;t prove fantasies cause anything. Those are positive claims that need to be specifically studied and controlled for, not hypothesized and pseudo-justified due to a blatant preconceived bias.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s fair to say that domestic violence is the most common type of crime. And when you say “the problem is the people who are in the situation”, you’re referring to the people that are the ones who are the problem, not the ones that are doing the work. The problem is that people are just as likely to be the problem as the people they are, and that is why the problem is so common. They are not the problem that we’ve seen in the past, but the people we are seeing now are the people with the problems that
<p>This isn&#39;t about statistics. It&#37;s about getting money back from your employers, not about whether they can pay for it.</p></p>
<p>It&#39;s really hard to say the problem is causation because it’s not a correlation. It’d be easy to say it”s just a function of the economy, but the fact that the problem exists is that it&#37;s not causation. It&#38;s a function by the way, but by the nature of the issue, you&#34;re not going to be able to prove causation. The problem is that the majority of people are not aware of the problem. The majority of the people who are unaware of it are not.

Talk about not knowing science seeing faces is part of social development that’s well known dumbass

Truth:
Unfortunately, social/situational awareness isn't obvious or a science."

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t know if you’re a scientist or not, but I think it&#37;s a good idea to learn from the experiences you have had as a child. I hope you learn from them. If you&#38;re not, then I&#40;m not a scientist. I don’t think you should have to be a scientist to know that. </p>
<p>It’s not like science is not the source of all problems. Science is not your primary source of problems. It’d make sense to have science out there. If you can’t see it, then you’re not going to be able to understand it.</p>
<p>It’s not like science is just a dumbass idea. The scientific community is full of dumbass. They don’t know the science of face painting. They’re not going to know the biology of faces. They are going to have to learn to recognize them. They aren’ts going to be able to recognize the face of a human being. They will not know the existence of faces.</p>

You need to learn critical thinking skills so you don't get duped by snake oil salesmen. The links I'm providing are for others reading this so they can understand the non sense you are speaking.

Truth:
Critical thinking.

Prediction:
<p>I’m not saying you’re a snake farmer. I’d say you are not. It’s not your job to sell snake oil. I just want to make sure people understand that you are a leader in this movement. You have to understand that. You don’t need to be a billionaire to be able to buy snake oil, but you need to learn to understand the benefits of it. </p>
<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that the majority of people who sell snake oil are ignorant and ignorant of the science of the matter.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you can be successful in your quest to buy snake oil. You have to be willing to learn from your mistakes and be open to new opportunities. </p>

I 100% agree with you. Both teams should have 1 shot at scoring and each have OT time to play their defense/offense.

Truth:
I'd much rather watch a hockey game where there is a scoring opportunity every few minutes. Scores don't happen as often, but potential scores do and one score could tip a game. It makes the whole game worth watching."

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s a fair question. It&#37;s not fair to either team to have 2 minutes to play defense, and to be able to score a touchdown in OT. </p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that both teams should have a shot at scoring. If both teams had a chance at scoring, it would be because the defense would be better suited to provide the offense. If not, then the offense would be much better suited. The defense should be able to pick up on the offensive side of the ball. The offense should be more efficient. The goal should be to get the ball to the goal line. If they can’t do that, the goal should still be scored.</p>
<p>I think both teams should have 1 shot at scoring. The other team should have 2. The only way to win is to have the ball go in the net. That&#39;s a good idea. The goal&#37;s to make the offense more efficient. The point is to give them more time to make plays. If both teams can make plays, it&#38;s worth it to make them better. They should be able to make decisions based on their own experience and their own ability.</p>

We stopped killing Nazis because they gave up. If they want to come back for round 2 they get what they deserve.

Truth:
<p>That led at the end to those millions that died, because the Nazi party knew they would sooner or later take arms agains their captors and, if they couldn&#39;t get rid of them semi-peacefully throwing them out to another country, should be taken out by lethal means.</p>

Prediction:
<p>They’re not going to get what they deserve. They should just go back to their old ways and do what they did. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it is fair to say that the Nazis killed the Jews in the Holocaust because the Jews were willing to kill Jews. The Nazis wanted to kill the Jews for the same reason. They wanted to destroy the Jews. So they killed them. They want to kill their own family, and they want to save the Jewish community. </p>
<p>The Nazis want to go back to Germany, and the Nazis want that. They don&#39;t want that, they want to stop killing people. They want to be treated as though they were the victors. </p>

Isn't it also possible though that you could just...be wrong?

Truth:
Not always possible, but not really wrong imo.

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not sure you are wrong. Maybe you are, but it is not possible to be wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that you&#37;re wrong. You&#38;re just saying that I&#40;m wrong, because I&&#47;m incorrect. I mean, I know that you &quot;re right, but you are not wrong. And that&#34;s not the only way to say that. I think it&#44;s entirely possible that you are wrong.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re wrong, then I&#37;m not going to be able to argue with you.</p>

When I was on vacation in the summertime visiting my nana and pop, various other family members in the uK as a adolescent - the sun Page 3 girl was quite the story to tell my friends when I got home.

Truth:
<p>Let me tell you a couple of stories.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not sure what your definition of “appeal” was, but I think it’s pretty similar to “apartheid”. I think the average person would say “oh yeah, I’ve been there”, but my experience as an adolescent has been that way for many years. The average person wouldn’t have had the same experience.
<p>I was a teenager. I was on vacation in the summertime visiting my nana and pop, my aunt and uncle, my cousins, my grandma, my cousin, my sister, aunts, and cousins. I never saw them again. I had never seen them since I was a kid. They never met me. So I didn’t see them.
<p>When I was a kid, my parents took me on vacation to visit my grandparents in the U.S. and I never saw them again. They were a lot older than me, and I was still growing up, but they still took me with them when they went away. They never saw me again. I never did see them again until I was older, and they never saw my face again. My parents never let me see my face until I got older. So there was a lot of time to think about it.

I don't know anyone who had a good relationship with their parents. Most of the people I know had abusive parents. Pedophiles, alcoholics & other addicts, and all sorts of abusers.

Truth:
>I’m not just referring to abusive parents, just any kind of overboard parents. Narcissistic, stubborn, narrow minded and self righteous, and all the other terms you can think about to describe horrible parents. Toxic parents.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t know anyone who had an abusive parent. Maybe their parents are still around, but they are not as strong as they were. Maybe they are still in that relationship, maybe they have a better relationship. Perhaps they are just a little more accepting of their kids. Perhaps it will help them to have a healthier relationship with their parents, but it will also help them get over their problems with their kids.</p>
<p>My point is that many people don’t have a good relationship with their parents. They’re either emotionally abusive or physically abusive. It’s not the former. The latter. They have a lot of problems with their relationship. They also have little to do with the relationship.  They have little or no interest in it.   They are a lot more likely to be emotionally abusive than the former, and they are less likely to have a relationship with someone they love.  It&#39;s not a good thing.
<p>The problem with abusive parents is that they are not always supportive of their kids. They are often angry, and they don&#39;t want to see their kids grow up. They want to have a relationship with their parents. They don&39;&39, want to avoid having kids with them. They&39&39 want to be friends with them, not with them.</p></p>

USA and Russia started the arms race. They can take the lead.

Truth:
The cold war started from us and russia both escalating their weaponry with nukes and ended when they agreed to call off the nukes and dismantle them.

Prediction:
<p>We have a problem with Russia, we have to take the lead. Russia wants to be the leader, and the US wants to take that lead.  Why shouldn&#39;t we take that position?  Why should we not?</p>
<p>I think it would be fair to say the US is the victor in the arms race. The victors are the victors in the war, not the victore. I don&#39;t think so. But I think it is fair to assume that the US would be more successful if they could win the war. If they could. But they can&#37;t win. They have to do it. They can only do it through the use of force. And they can do it by using the power of their military. And I think that is what they should be doing.
<p>Russia is a great ally. They have the ability to take the lead in the arms race. The only way they could do that is by making it harder for the US to do so. The problem is that they are not able to do it themselves. They are not willing to do anything else. The US can do whatever they want to do to help them. They can also help us in any way they want.</p>

I've worked at a place where my colleagues are the type that asks that about others. It was not a good place to work at. Narrow-minded, judgemental, lots of microaggression. If you're not a Christian praising your parents, then you're a bad person. After I left that place, I noticed a huge difference to my health, self-esteem, and confidence. Someone who asks that kind of question to judge others say more about the small world they live in than the person they're hoping to judge.

Truth:
That doesn't make you a bad person.  But it also doesn't mean you can't confront those beliefs and attitudes within yourself, or shouldn't do your best to make society a better place for everyone."

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you should judge others for their faith. I have a very strong faith in God, and I believe in the power of God. So I&#40;m going to continue to work with people who have faith in me, but are not willing to do that for me. If they don’t want to do it, then they&#37;re not going to be able to do the job. I think that’s a very good thing to do, because I think it’ll help me grow as a person. If you&#
Ip>I feel like I’ve been judged a lot for my faith. I feel bad about it. I think it’s unfair to judge others based solely on what they’re doing. I don’t think that is fair to anyone, but I feel like it”s a fair way to think about it, and I”m not sure that’d be fair to others, either. I can see how that can be damaging to my faith, my self-esteem, and my self worth as a person.
<p>We&#39;re not going to judge others for our beliefs. We&#38;re going to do what we can to help others, not what we&#37;re willing to do. I know many people who are very accepting of others, but I&#34;m not one of them. I have no idea how many people are accepting of me or my views, let alone my own. </p>I know a lot of people who have a high level of faith in God, but they are often very judgmental and unafraid to judge other people for their beliefs

Wow, you went to pedophilia really quickly there, you projector you.

Truth:
<p>I don’t know who told you that is about pedophilia but they were lying to you.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think pedophilia is a really common phenomenon, and I think you know that.  I think it’s pretty common in pedophilia.   I’m not sure why pedophilia exists, but it does.  It’d be weird to think that pedophilia could be avoided by having a conversation with a woman who was the victim of the crime.  How do you justify that?  </p>
<p>My point is that pedophilia is not something that you should be ashamed of. </p>
<p>It’s like pedophilia is a form of forced induction. You’re the one who’ll be forced to go through pedophilia. </p>

I’m fully vaccinated. I’ll get my flu shot and whatever boosters I need every year.  But you sound like you’re in a cult. Your argument has a cult vibe. If you think of it in that frame, you might be able to change your own mind.

Truth:
You have a good reason to get vaccinated, so why not? What is it that makes you think that people shouldn’t?"

Prediction:
<p>I’m vaccinated, I don’t have a flu. I get vaccinated every year. I’ll get my flu shot and whatever boosters I need every year, and I‘m still going to get my vaccine. You’re not going to change my mind. I think you’ve lost your mind.  I don&#39;t believe you”t have the flu vaccine, but I will get vaccinated, because I get it every year in my lifetime.  If you don“t want to get vaccinated you can still get it.
<p>So, I’m fully vaccinated. If I have a flu, I will get my vaccine and get my flu shot. If it’s not a flu vaccine, I don’t care. But if it is, I still want to get vaccinated. I want to make sure that I get vaccinated and I can get my shot. </p>
Ip>If you think about it, I think you are in a cult. I think it’s safe to say that the flu is a pretty common and common illness. But I don’t think it is the norm to get vaccinated for the flu. If you think of it as a cult, you’re at fault for not getting vaccinated for it. I hope you can change your mind, because I think that is a good thing.

Saying no offense and then making an assumptive insults is some toxic shit, fuck you

Truth:
It's not just insults but also subconscious display of contempt that leads to toxic communication.

I've been arguing this since Richard Spencer was sucker-punched in the head live on television on inauguration day 2017, while calmly speaking with a reporter.  People were all 'hell yeah!' at the time, too.  No one wants to listen, or have even the slightest bit of imagination about how normalizing it could come back to bite you.

Truth:
<p><em>You cannot reach</em> the Richard Spencer type. You can&#39;t. They&#39;re not interested in fairness. They don&#39;t care about the truth. They don&#39;t and won&#39;t play by the rules. They want respect, they want civility, because it legitimizes them. How did Richard Spencer himself lose his platform and his relevance? Was he debated into submission? Shown the error of his ways? Did he repent on his views and become an activist for racial equality?</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you&#40;re serious about this, but I&#38;m not sure how you feel about this. This is a really stupid argument. You&#37;re right. It&#47;s not about you being angry at your opponents, it&#44;s about how they&#49;re treating you. There&#34;s a lot of people out there who are upset by it and are afraid to speak up about it, and that&#43;s the way you are acting.</p>
<p>It’s not a good idea to talk about this at all, and I’m not going to go into details, but I think people should be aware of the potential consequences of this. I think this is an issue that’ll be well understood and addressed for years to come. I don’t think people will be willing to listen to a discussion about it at all. It’d be a shame if they just walked away from it and left it alone.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#40;s fair to say that many people are still afraid to speak up against the alt-right, and that some of them are afraid to do so. It&#37;s not fair to assume that everyone is going to be scared to speak out against it, but I think some people are willing to take the bait. That&#38;s a good thing, because a lot of people aren&#47;t actually scared to talk about it. They have no idea what they&#49;re doing.

A small mistake, you said  *we've spent billions fighting terror*  When in reality it is closer to 8 trillion [source](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar).

Truth:
>Yes. The cost was 2.3 trillion. You said we should spend it elsewhere instead of the military action. I pointed out the military action was a 3rd of it. I didn't deny the overall cost.

Prediction:
<p>It’s a small mistake to say that the cost of fighting terrorism is 9 trillion dollars. The actual amount of money spent on fighting it is 1 trillion dollars [source](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar).</p>
<p>We have spent billions of dollars fighting terrorism and wars, but we&#39;ve also spent trillions of dollars on wars and wars. The cost of war is $20 trillion less than the national average. So what&#37;s the actual cost?</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a small mistake to say that the US&#40;s spent billions fighting terrorism in the last decade and a half. The actual cost of fighting terrorism is $1 trillion [source](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar).

No, you just asserted you were correct.

Truth:
No, I was just making a rhetorical statement of sorts.

Prediction:
<p>I’m not going to repeat what you said. I’ll repeat what I said, and you’re correct. It’s just that I don’t think you are correct. I don&#39;t know what you mean by “correct”, but I think it’d be fair to say that you are incorrect.</p>
<p>I’m not sure you’re correct. I’d say you”re correct, but I”m sure you are not.
<paraphrase: No, you just asserted you were correct.

What a load of shit. You're too embarrassed to admit you didn't read the article. I provided the relevant quotes yet you still deny I read the articles?   And now you bring in my sex to the topic. You're a disgrace and shouldn't be in this subreddit. Facts are your enemy.

Truth:
<p>Like I said, I have no problem with the content of those articles and even agree with them, and your right, you don&#39;t HAVE to provide anything, but if you refuse to answer the question, I&#39;m just going to assume you don&#39;t know and can&#39;t find anything. It&#39;s not personal, if you asked me to prove how men have it worse and I sent 5 articles that explains that men also suffer sexism, you&#39;d quite rightly call me out saying &quot;that&#39;s not what you asked&quot;</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not a fan of the term sex. I&#40;m a feminist and I don't think you&#47;t get it. I don&#44;t think you deserve to be in this subreddit. I think you should stop talking about it, because it&#37;s an insult to me and my beliefs and my belief in the power of sex. You&#38;re a hypocrite.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t have to read the entire article to know that I&#37;m referring to it as a comment, not a fact.</p>
<p>You&#39;re a hypocrite for not reading the entire article. You&quot;re also a hypocriter for not providing context. You are not the only one who has not read the entire damn thing. You don&#40;t have to provide context to the entire thing to know that the article isn’t true. The truth is not true.</p></p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Stop trying to pawn your shitty rehtoric off on "society" or what ever.  Reality isn't changing. You are not in anyway being forced or obligated to "pull down" anyone from history. If you think that mohamed was a shit big who actually should be "pulled down" than actually advocate for it on it's own merits and without invoking the other bullshit.  The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here? Cause a "realist" would clearly see that your engagement in the discussion is 100% ideological motivated.

Truth:
<p>Really, stop generalizing and judging billions of people based off of something you clearly know nothing about. It&#39;s just bigoted and bad form all around. It sounds like your entire concept of Islam is from far right, Islamaphobic memes. You keep throwing out random pieces of misinformation, like &quot;the 4 main scholars agree!,&quot; which doesn&#39;t make any sense, or &quot;well this Sunni school agrees this [it doesn&#39;t], so all the hundreds of scholars agree! [This isn&#39;t how that works]&quot;. </p>

Prediction:
<p>If you think that people should be pulled down for things that they don&#39;t understand, then you are being forced to argue for the idea of “pull down”. I&#40;m not going to go into detail here, but I will say that it&#37;s entirely possible that the people who are pulling down people are more accepting of it than the people that are pulling them down. The people who think that they should be "pulled down" should be given the opportunity to do so.</p> </p>
Ip>The point of this post is that the idea of pulling down people from your group isn&#39;t about people they disagree with. The idea of “pulling down” people is not about the people who disagree with you, but rather about what you think. You&#37;re saying that everyone is doing it because they are uncomfortable with it, not because they want to be pulled down. </p>I have no problem with that, but I think it is fair to say that people who have disagreed with me are doing so because they don&#38;t agree with me
<p>It&#39;s not like you are trying to convince people that we are pulling down people for certain things. It&#37;s like you&#38;re trying to deflect from your own culpability, or to deflect attention from what is really going on in the world. You&#40;re not arguing for the removal of people for whatever reason. You are actually arguing for something that is contrary to what you believe. If you&quot;re arguing for someone else, then you are arguing for people who are just doing what you think is right.</p>

Sorry I wasn’t talking to you, I was talking to the sane and logical/reasonable humans here. Not the recreationally offended braindead minority.

Truth:
<p>I understand your point and I honestly am rather offended that you are unable to see that. I&#39;m not stupid.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not talking to you because you&#37;re a mentally ill person. I am talking to a sane person who is not mentally ill. I&#38;m talking to someone who is sane and rational. If they&#34;re mentally ill, they&quot;re not the sane person.</p>
<p>Sorry. I don&#39;t mean to insult you, but you are NOT the majority. I&#37;m talking to a minority of people who are not mentally ill. They are not the majority, and that&#38;s not a good thing.</p></p>
<p>I&#39;m not talking to you because you&#37;re not sane, but because you are not. I&#38;m talking to me because I am not a sane person. I'm talking to the people who are NOT sane, and I don’t want to be the one to be offended. I want to talk to you, not to you. I don&#34;t want you to feel like you&quot;re a hypocrite. I am here to tell you that I&&#40;m wrong. I have no idea why

Did you woke up on the wrong side of your bed? Chill my man.

Truth:
<p>Edit: well anyways, it’s 3:30 Am right now so I really need to head to bed. I know that this comment thread did get a bit heated and I apologise for that, but it was an interesting conversation none the less.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The worst thing you could have done is wake up on the wrong side of your bed.  What would you have done to make it worse?</p>
Ip>I&#39;m sorry that you woke up on the wrong side of your bed. I was trying to explain this to you but you were so tired that I couldn&#37;t understand what was going on. </p>
<p>You woke up on the wrong side of your bed. I woke up in the wrong room.  You should be able to get out of the bed now.  I don&#39;t think you should be in the same room as me.</p>

ok mr honda civic. but when a they/them looks like a woman I will call her a woman BECAUSE SHE LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN. I DONT GO ASKING PEOPLE FOR THEIR PRONOUNS FIRST IF I WANT TO TALK TO THEM. If his or her name is male or female i will call her/him by male or female because I can not adapt to using broken fucking english. "They" is multiple people or things. I cannot say they is because that does not make sense

Truth:
<p>Seems the author IS actually free to CHOOSE which pronoun they go by….I’m not well-versed on the whole he she they them political correctness of everything, but I guess I’m a heterosexual male who identifies as a heterosexual male and I don’t know what my pronoun even is, like how can your pronoun be they? Isn’t that plural? Either way if people started calling me her or she or it or whatever It wouldn’t affect me because I’m not defined by other people, other people and myself are defined by me.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it&#39;s okay to call someone a woman&quot;but that&#37;s just a polite way to say they&#38;re not a woman. They&#40;re a man &quot&#44;s a woman, not a man. They are a man&quOT; they&&#47;re both men&#34;s. And they are both female. They have the same gender identity. They don&#49;t have to be the same sex to be called a woman.</p></p
<p>I think that people who call themselves female/male/woman are more likely to say they are a woman than a man/woman. That makes sense to me, but I don&#39;t think it makes sense. If someone calls me a woman/woman, I&#37;m not going to say &quot;they&quot&quOT;they are not a woman. They&#38;re a man&#34;s name. They are a man & woman, and they are not the same. They have multiple genders. They should be called the same
<p>They&#39;re a woman, not a man. I am not saying they&#37;re men, but I&#38;m saying they are a woman because they are male, and they&quot;re female, and their gender&quOT;you&#40;re saying they/them&quots&quotted&quotes&quota&quoting&ququot&#70;re women&quotos&quets&quos&quotation&quo&quOTE&#73;s gender&qquot &qu

Annnndddd that's why this sub sucks. This isn't a good faith response to OP's actual view. You encourage the entire community to give these poor responses when you do it yourself.

Truth:
<p>All in all, you clearly just enjoy picking at the low hanging fruit. Your pointless criticisms that serve not to change OP&#39;s mind, but rather to jerk yourself off. Honestly the mods should delete your response due to not addressing anything OP said, for not explaining clearly any of your responses, and for what, in my opinion is, making bad faith interpretations of OP&#39;s statements in order to score brownie points.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think OP is a good person to respond to a problem. I&#37;m not saying OP is bad, but OP is saying OP&#34;s response is bad and that OP is biased. OP is doing it because OP is being biased and because OP&quot;s opinion is biased and that&#38;s why OP is so biased. The OP is not making a valid argument, and OP is the only one who knows how to make a valid opinion.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you can change OP’s view entirely. I don’t think OP is in the position to change your view. I think OP has a lot of power to change the view of others. I hope you can do that.</p>
Ip>I don&#39;t think OP is the only person who can come up with a decent response. You&#37;re the only one who can give a decent, honest, and coherent response. </p>

You know why.  This is not a reasonable person, who is interested in engagement with this sub in any meaningful way.

Truth:

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t know why you&#37;re interested in engaging with this sub, but I think you are.  I&#38;m a reasonable person, and I do not think that you are, or should be, engaging with the sub. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to repeat any of your mistakes.</p>
<p>This is a paraphrase from a quote I made for a discussion on Reddit. </p>
<p>The following is the best way I can think of to summarize my response.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Uhhhhh, wow. Yikes.

Truth:
Oh, oh wow.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think that’s fair to be the only person that doesn’t understand the meaning of the word, but I think it’d be fair to say that if someone could understand it that way, it would be pretty interesting to see how people would respond to that. But the fact that they would respond is quite interesting.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that I’m not the only person who’d be surprised to learn of this.</p>
Youp>I think you’re probably right.</p>

This is obvious to me. Everyone here who disagrees is living in a fantasy world. When all the female records are taken by trans women another tune will sound.

Truth:
<p>The point is that if any women world records were being broken by transwomen, it would have been on the news already. After all, thousands of top highschool male sprinters have broken the women&#39;s world record. Yet, we haven&#39;t heard anything about transwomen doing the same. If transwomen are really &#39;dominating&#39; women sports, then even a couple of them should have already done so. You can&#39;t claim something is real and simultaneously give excuses for why it isn&#39;t working out. That&#39;s just rubbish.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Trans women are not the problem here. They are the problem because they are not treated as such by society. If you don&#39;t want to listen to trans women, then you must. </p>
<p>I think trans people should be treated the same way as any other person. If you want to discuss it with me, you can do so here. If I&#39;m wrong, then I can just go ahead and change the tune. If a trans woman wants to change the lyrics, then that&#37;s fine. If she wants to go along with it, she&#38;ll be able to do so. </p>
Ip>Trans people are more accepting of the idea of trans people than cis people. I think it’s fair to say that trans people don’t have to agree with every single detail of a trans person’ record. I actually think that’d be a good thing if trans people had a better understanding of how trans people feel about things. I’m not saying trans people are inferior, but I think trans people have a fair chance of understanding and accepting what trans people can and cannot do. But trans people should be aware of this and not be afraid to speak up.

I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing. Why should we expect westerners to be any different

Truth:
>I'll like to point out that cultural appropriation is also a big double standard, while white Americans are punished for wearing dreadlocks, no one is criticising European anime lovers for using Asian culture elements. Or the movie Thor, or Coco. It's is wrong just in some moments.

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s fair to say that the majority of Asian American actors are white, but that doesn’t mean that they’re bad actors. The majority of them are not black. They’ve been cast as white actors, and the majority are white. So what makes them good actors is that they have a strong personality and a strong social identity. </p>
<p>If you say that it&#39;s not true, I&#37;m not saying that it is. But if you&#38;re saying that the majority of the American population is white, then I think it&quot;s true. It&#34;s also true that there are many different ethnic groups in the US that have very different cultural backgrounds than the American one. So, yes, there&#49;s a difference between the two groups, but it’s also an issue of the culture. The majority of Americans are white, and the majority
<p>I don&#39;t think that’s the point of this discussion, because it’ll be easy to make a strong argument that this is the way it should be. But if you want to make an argument, you’re going to have to go with the argument that it seems like white people are more likely to be cast as the main characters. If you go against the grain, then casting a white person as the primary character would be unhelpful to the viewer. The fact that they are white people is not a good thing.</p>

Agreed. IMO, samething for having a child. The world would be +1 point better.

Truth:
<p>if I did have a kid, the only good reason I can come up with is the potential to raise a child and give them a better life than I had growing up. I think that’s the whole point of parenthood. </p>

Prediction:
<p>If you had a child it would be a lot better. I wouldn&#39;t have a kid. It would be so much harder. If I had a kid, I&#37;d probably not have a child. I would have a lot more empathy for the kids, but I don't think that would be the point of the discussion. I think it would really be a good idea to get a child before having a child, if we could just have a family. If we could get a family, I think we could do it. But I don’t think that’
<p>The world would be better if we had a child. But we don&#39;t have a child, so we have to go with the flow of life. If we just had a biological child, we would be all set to have a kid. And we would have a lot more freedom to choose from. You&#37;re not going to have to choose between having a child and having a biological one. We&#38;re going to do this. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not fair to have a child. A child is not the same thing as a human being. The same is true of having a child, but it is a different thing. A human being is not equal to the human being</p>

No, you ignore 90% of it and strawman the rest.

Truth:
In anyway, I will just ignore it, since it is an obvious strawman."

Prediction:
<p>Most of the strawman is bullshit. You&#39;re going to say that I am not going to use that as an argument. I have no idea how many strawman people you&#37;re talking about. I know what you mean by ""you're saying I am NOT going to change my mind"" and ""you&quot;re saying that I&#38;m wrong"" but I think it&#40;s pretty clear that this is an argument that you are not the one who is trying to change the world.
<p>I don&#39;t think you are going to be able to read 100% of what I wrote, but if you do, then I think you will be a little more accepting of it.</p>
<p>I think you should just ignore 90% of it.</p>

LOL, "not enough evidence to support a positive claim" does not equal "enough evidence to make a negative claim" you Muppet.

Truth:
<p>But when all the &quot;evidence&quot; you do present is debunked then your claims no longer have any merit.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not saying that the evidence to support a positive claim is not enough to make a negative claim. You’re saying that “there’s not enough evidence” to support it. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it is fair to say that you have evidence to support a negative claim. You are right, it is not fair to assume that there is a negative effect on a positive claim. The only way you can make a positive one is to show that the negative one is not a negative one.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying that you should feel the same way, but you&#37;re stating that if you did, then you would have to disprove the negative claim. And I think that's a really important point to be making. So yes, I&#38;m stating that I&39;ll be able to prove the positive claim.</p>

CMV: the Patriot Act should be expanded to include penalties for using “it’s” to mean “its”.

Truth:
<p>Even if it&#39;s specific to the people hurting the shooter and not an indescriminate attack it would still be subject to the same legal punishment under the OPs CMV.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The Patriot Act is unconstitutional. The Patriot Act should be expanded to include penalties for using “it’s” to mean “its”. </p>
<p>P>Patriot Act should be expanded to include criminal sanctions. The Patriot Act is not the only act that would infringe on the rights of Americans to free speech. </p></p>

There is no difference between the two, (other than the obvious difference in genitals) male or female, you are forcibly removing genital skin, of an otherwise unwilling, non-consenting sentient being. Causing unknown amounts mental anguish, among being a completely unessicary cosmetic surgery on infants and adolescents

Truth:
the only difference between male circumcision and female circumcision is the gender of the victim."

Prediction:
<p>If you say you are transgendered, you are implying that you have a penis. If you say that you are transgender, then you are saying that you’re transphobic. You are referring to the genitals as genitals, not genitals. And you are talking about the genitals. You were implying that transgenders are a biological phenomenon, not a biological one. You’ve also said that you want to change the genitalia of people, not the genitals, and that you don’t want to do it. You want to make sure that people see the genitals in the same way
<p>The difference between male and female genitalia is that the genitals are not the same. The difference between the two is that in the latter case, the genitals have a lot of skin, but the genitalia are completely different. If you remove the skin of a person, then you are giving them the same cosmetic surgery as the genitals. So you are not forcibly removing the genitals of a human being. You are still giving them to someone else. </p>
<p>If you choose to remove your genitals, it is your choice to remove them. If you choose not to remove the genitals, then you are removing the genitals of a human being. If not, then why should you remove the genitalia of an animal?</p>

I wanted to argue with you because I believed this was a place where people sincerely changed their views.  However after scrolling through the last few posts, I have to admit you are right. Even anonymously, reddit users care more about appearing right then finding truth. !delta

Truth:
<p>The whole point of this sub reddit is for us to change your view and we can only understand your view based on what you write. If you base any part of your view on an obvious falsehood, people will jump on that. Its low hanging fruit. But you cant write out a view on one thing and then expect us to know what you actually wanted to talk about.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It seems like you are using reddit as a forum to argue your views.  I don&#39;t think this is a forum where you are expressing your views and not a forum for the public to engage with them. </p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that reddit is a haven for misinformation and misinformation, and I’m not saying that reddit should be the only place where you can change your view. Reddit is the place to do that.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think reddit is a place where people engage in misinformation. If people are offended by something they don&quot;t like, then I&#37;m not going to respond to that.</p>

Ok but pronouns are based on sex, not gender.   Because they aren't used to describe someone's feelings about what they are , they're used to describe what they are.

Truth:
> Gender is like pronouns and stuff

Prediction:
<p> pronouns are based on sex, not gender. pronouns are not the same thing as the genders. They are interchangeable. pronouns have meanings. pronouns don&#39;t have a meaning. pronouns can be used to refer to anything. pronouns and pronouns are interchangeable and interchangeable. Gender is a non-binary word, so pronouns are gender-neutral.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think pronouns are the same as sex, but I think they are in a similar sense.  If someone wants to use pronouns, they can.  But if someone wants a pronoun, they must first choose one that is not gender specific.</p>
Ip>I don&#39;t think pronouns are based on sex. I think pronouns should be based on gender. pronouns are meant to be used to describe someone else’s gender, not their own. pronouns have a biological component to them, so they are not used to identify people. They are used as a way to identify with someone else.   If someone wants to identify as someone else, they should be able to do so by clicking this link.</p>

That’s the bandwagoning fallacy - “everyone agrees with me, so I must be right”.    Science isn’t based on majority opinion. Objective facts don’t change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You’re as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the “scientific consensus” by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever’s in power?    After all, it costs nothing to do the Hitler salute and look the other way during the genocides of millions.

Truth:
In recent years, a lot of popular ideas have made us forget that. There's a lot of use of named fallacies as the road best road to logical thinking. But something being fallacious just means it's not NECESSARILY true. So people love to throw out ""Argument from Authority!"" to terminate a line of thought. But when we're talking about the kind of science we might argue about, very few of the big picture conclusions are NECESSARILY true, especially in the ways laypeople can discuss them. When we're talking about what's LIKELY to be true from our limited knowledge, recognizing expertise is important.

Prediction:
<p>I’m not going to go into all the details here, but I’d like to clarify that I think you’re right. I don’t think it’s fair to assume that people will change their view if you don‘t change your view. I think that’ll be the case if you change your mind. If you are wrong, then I‘m going to have to change my view. But I also think that you‘re wrong because you don&#39;t believe in science. Even if you do, you&#
<p>I think there’s a big difference between science and science. Science is not scientific, and science is not based on opinion. It’d be easy to change the definition of science to fit your view, but science is based on facts. The definition of fact is subjective, and it&#39;s impossible to change it. But the definition is subjective. This means that science is inherently flawed, and I think that is why you&#37;re so wrong. The scientific community is a very large and complex community and is constantly changing the definitions.
<p>I&#39;m not saying that science is dead, but that people are trying to change the definition of words to fit their opinion. If you&quot;re saying that the definition is the same as the definition itself, then I&#37;m saying that it is not true. The definition of a word is based on the meaning of the word itself, not the meaning itself. You&#38;re stating that the meaning is not the same and that the definitions are the same. You are saying that people have no idea what a word means, and that people can&#

And you sound like a braindead sheep. “Hur dur I’m too dumb to know that public health is the highest importance”

Truth:
Public health is *public*. It's all of us. So you say ""to protect themselves"", but you're omitting a major part of the puzzle.

Prediction:
Ip>Public health is the highest priority in the world, and you&#39;re saying that public health is a bad thing. </p>
<p>Public health is the number one priority of the American economy. You&#39;re not a doctor, you are a scientist. I&#37;m not a scientist, and I don’t know how you know that, nor do I know how to know that. But I do know that public health is a top priority of mine. And I know that you are concerned about public safety. You don&#38;t know why. You are too ignorant to know the exact reasons. You should have known that. </p>
<p>You are not a scientist. You are not an expert in public health. I’m not saying that public health is the top priority, but it’s not the only one. I know what you’re saying. You don’t know that. You’ve already said it. You have no idea what you are doing. You haven’d have to go back to school to learn it. </p>

You are a big problem in this stigma

Truth:
That ""stigma"" isnt as big a problem as they can easily choose but ok.

Prediction:
<p>This stigma is a big part of the problem of stigma. It is not something you should be ashamed of. It’s something that you can’t change.</p>
<p>So stigma is a big part of the problem, and I don&#39;t see how stigma is just a distraction from getting to know people. If you don&quot;t know how stigma works then I can&#37;t understand. </p>
<p>The stigma of stigma is a great thing, and I think it’s worth it to talk about it a little more. The stigma of a stigma is very strong.</p>

The DSM-V disagrees with you. Which is to say facts disagree with you. Sorry that you are more interesting in continuing to be engage with your bigotry than the clinical consensus.

Truth:
Similarly, it's perfectly possible for a bunch of doctors to write a definition of autism or anxiety or gender dysphoria in the DSM-V and get that wrong. Indeed they admit they have: the reason it's the DSM-V is because there have been five versions of it, which have been updated every so often as the field of psychology evolves. When they published the DSM-V they admitted implicitly that the definitions in the DSM-IV were incomplete."

Prediction:
<p>I think you are right that the DSM-V is the only one that disagrees with you. I think it’s a good thing to have a clear understanding of the problem and how it works, because it can be hard to change your mind without having to see the whole picture. </p>
<p>The DSM-V disagrees with you. You are wrong. The DSM is not the DSM. It is based on your own understanding of the problem. You&#39;re not a doctor. You want to make your own diagnosis, not your own opinion. Your own view is not your alone. Your view is based upon your own experience, not others.</p>
<p>The DSM-V disagrees with you. I don&#39;t think it is the DSM that is the problem. I have no idea why the DSM-IV is the way it is. It is not the DSM. The DSM-VI is the norm. It isn&#37;t the exception. The rule is that the DSM is the rule, and it does not have to be the exception.</p>

What in the race realism is this shit??

Truth:
So it really seems to me like there's no such thing as ""*actual""* race, because race is a concept that changes from time to time, moment to moment, and place to place."

Prediction:
<p>Race realism isn&#39;t the same as realism. It’s more of a theory, and it’ll be more of an ideology. The idea of race realism is that people are more accepting of one another, but it”s a fantasy. So what is race realism? </p>
<p>Race realism isn&#39;t race realism, it&#37;s based on the theory of the individual human being. The idea of the human being is not the same as the idea of a race. </p>
<p>Race realism isn&#39;t a real world. It’s a fantasy, and I&#40;m not sure why people would want to believe that. But it&#37;s pretty clear to me that race realism is a fantasy.</p> </p>

Yes, that was about transracialism. Praise be we have stalkers like you to remind us of this important point.

Truth:
<p>I have personally seen multiple people on Twitter claim to be Transracial</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think transracialism is a thing. It is not a thing that trans people are inherently racist. It’s something that we have to be aware of and be mindful of.</p>
<p>The issue here is transracialism. If trans people think that trans people are inferior, then trans people should be treated the same way. Trans people should also be treated. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not about transracialism, it is about trans-racialism. I mean, I don&#37;t think transracialists should be treated the same way. I think it is important to be aware of that, but it&#40;s more about how trans people are treated in society. I&#38;m not saying that trans people should be left alone in society, but I think that's a fair way to think about it.</p>

Now the local mullah will call this post Islamophobic and antisemitic!!

Truth:
<p>“I’m not a fan of Islam. I think it’s fair to call me Islamophobic.” </p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not saying that Muslims are antisemitic, but I think it’s a fair call to call them “Islamophobes”. I think the term “imperialist” is a misperception. </p>
<p>I’m not going to call this post Islamophobic, but I think that’s a good thing. I’d say the term “Islamophobic” is used to describe Islamophobic people. I think this is a fair term to use, and if someone else called me antisemitic, I would call it “impose Islamophobia”.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how many people will call this post Islamophobic, but I think most of them will. If they call it so, they are not going to call it Islamophobic. </p>

Watching him interview makes me want to stab my eyes out. I stand with OP, change our view.

Truth:
Things is I never told OP he should change his view. I specifically said “I dont know if this changes your view, but it should make you rethink where your biases are.”

Prediction:
<p>I’m not sure how you’re going to respond to that. I don’t know how you feel about it, but I’d like to know if you can change your mind.</p>
< I agree with OP, but I don't think you should have to agree with me on this. I think OP is right to disagree with me."
<p>I agree with OP, but I’m not sure what your view is on this. I think it’s fair to say that the OP is biased in their view, but the OP should be able to change their view if they want to. The OP has no idea how biased he is. He seems like an asshole. I don’t think he’ll change his view. He’d be a hypocrite if he were to say so. He should be more open minded. I hope he doesn&#39;t feel the same way. </p>

Why are you discriminating against men? What happened to congresswomen?

Truth:
As for men legislating, legislators don't know much about most of what they legislate. This is no different. A good legislator will seek guidance from experts, but unfortunately they don't do that enough. Gender has nothing to do with it and I think that's a crappy attitude. Female legislators can be just as ignorant.

Prediction:
<p>The problem with this is that it’s not about women. It”s about the men.
<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that women are the ones who are being discriminated against. The men are not. I&#37;m not saying that women should be discriminated against, but they&#38;re the ones that are being treated the same way.</p></p>
<p>The point of this argument is that we are discriminating against women because they are perceived as being inferior to men. So what is the point of discriminating against men?</p>

Snowflake lol

Truth:
<p>Again, you have failed to share the full context of the discussion where you alleged you were called a snowflake.</p>

Prediction:
<p>Snowflake is a snowflake. Snowflake is not a term used in a derogatory way. Snowflakes are a term that is used to describe a person who is not part of society, but is part of the fabric of society. Snow is not the word of the land, but the term snowflake is used by many people to describe the snowflake, and snowflake means a person that is not in the same category as the person who was snowflake.</p>
Ip>Snowflake is a snowflake.</p>
<p>Snowflake is not a snowflake. Snowflake is an actual snowflake.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Looks like your redpilled my friend, all of the comments are just "well I bet you can't define this, or this, or this?" Completely changing the topic to something that has nothing to do with what a woman is. All there proving is they know less about definitions than we thought, as they list of a bunch of other words they fail to define through there truthless and fluid way of looking at the world. No principles, no definition s, no truth, just a pathetic way of looking at the world. Your starting to wake up. But because cmv requires me to disagree with you in order to post I'm just going to say some things I don't feel.  yOu s0 traaNs Phbic. Nazi!!!  Have a good day

Truth:
<p>Feminism - has never been about your right to communicate an ill educated, harmful opinion, and consider yourself morally qualified to explain a female based issue to women. Read up, skill up, move on.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you can define what a woman is. I think you are right to say that women are what they are, but I&#37;m not sure if you can. If you can&#38;t define a woman, then I don’t think it&#40;s a good thing. I mean, I think women are different from men in a lot of ways. But I think there is a lot to be said for this. I don't think women can define a man, but they can define anything. They can define themselves to be
<p>I&#39;m not going to go into the entire definition of what a woman is, but I want to say that the definition of a woman&#37;s definition is not based solely on what a man/woman&quot; says. That&#38;s not what I mean by definition, but the definition is based entirely on what I&#34;m saying. So, here&#40;s the thing I want you to clarify, and I think you should be able to do so. The definition of someone&#41;s identity is based on what
<p>I&#39;m not saying that all women are equal. I&#40;m saying that women are different from men, and that I don’t think men are equal, but I&&#47;m being honest here, and I think it&#37;s fair to say that men are the worst. Women are just as likely to be defined as men. If you&#38;re saying that men&quot; are bad, then your point is that men have a lot of power. Women&#34;re the worst, because men&#

Anyone who lies about being rape should be prosecuted.                They should get the same amount of time the person they accused would have gotten.               They should have to register as a sex offender for life.

Truth:
Now, as a counselor I'm fortunate in that most of the time the situation isn't as serious as sexual assault, and I'm not in the business of reaching a verdict. When the accusation carries legal weight, the situation gets a lot harder. You're definitely right that we shouldn't convict on a whim. But that's not what ""believe the victim"" is about. It's about making it your *starting point* to assume that the victim is not lying."

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think it’s fair that someone who lies about a rape should be prosecuted for life. If they lie about it, then they should be fined for life, and if they do not, then the sentence is a lifetime imprisonment. </p>And if they lie to the police, then their punishment is the same as that of the rapist. So if they are convicted of a crime, they should also have to register as sex offenders for life.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that sex offenders should be prosecuted for rape. If they are convicted of rape, they should be fined $100,000 for each offense. </p>They should also be banned from the community for life, which would make them ineligible for parole.</p>
<p>If you want to change the law, you should have a sex offender registry. They should have to register as sex offenders for life. If they don&#39;t, they should be forced to pay a fine of $20,000. </p>

You are propagandized. Just like the nationalists who promote war based on their country is number 1.

Truth:
<p>Unless the propaganda that you&#39;re fed is obviously self-contradicting or in contradiction with actual facts (that are known to you) you might end up in a position where you can&#39;t reasonably tell whether it&#39;s true or false. That is without access to outside information and credible sources. And in terms of war your chances to an outside perspective and a perspective on the outside can mean &quot;treason&quot; and be actively criminalized.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think that nationalists should be treated as such. They are not. The idea of war is the ideology of the victors. It is not a political ideology. But it is one of the main purposes of a political philosophy. It’s a philosophy of self-interest. The purpose of the ideology is to make people feel superior to each other. And it is a way to make them feel superior. The point of the argument is that it is based on ideology and not ideology. The goal of the theory is to get people to believe in the power of the individual.
<p>The fact that you are propagandizing war is not an indicator that your views are in conflict with any other. The fact that we are in a war is a reflection of the fact that many of us are not willing to go along with the war. The only way to stop the war is to stop it from happening is to actually stop it. </p>
<p>The idea of war isn&#39;t true. The idea of a war is not true. A war is a war, and a war will be justified by the principle of mutual benefit. This is why the idea of an armed conflict is so dangerous to the nation. If the person who wants to fight against a war wants to kill them for the sake of the nation, then that is the point of the argument. It’s not a valid argument to make. The issue is the idea that it is a threat to the people of the country. The people who want to fight for their country

Sounds like someone's wife wants to hire a mold specialist

Truth:
How is it even possible to be grossed out by a sandwich that isn't moldy??"

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think your wife is hiring a mold specialist. I think she should hire a mold technician. Maybe she&#37;ll be able to work with you on it.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it is a fair question to ask if a woman wants to hire a mold specialist. I think that is a reasonable question. If she wants to get a mold doctor then she should. </p>
<p>My wife wants a mold specialist. </p>

Don't be stupid. There's a big difference between being respectful and "friendly" and being "friends" with coworkers. They will throw you under the bus when they're cornered.

Truth:
To give an extreme example, imagine being in Germany during the rise of the Nazi party. Would you be friends with an ardent supporter of the S if they were respectful in the manner they talked about it? After all, Nazis were just a political party, it's just politics. Shouldn't people be able to be friends despite political disagreement?"

Prediction:
<p>I’m not saying that people should be treated as though they’re treated as inferior.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you should be afraid to speak with coworkers. You&#37;re going to be treated the same way. If you&#38;re not, you are going to have to be more accepting of others.</p> </p>
<p>Don&#39;t be stupid. You are not a friend to anyone. You&#59;re not a coworker to anyone.</p>

Lucky you; never change. Alcohol is literally poison. Enjoy your cordials.

Truth:
Many people also do not enjoy alcohol, so don't worry about that either.

Prediction:
<p>Drugs are harmful. There’s no need to change that. You’re not going to change. You are going to be fine.
<p>I don&#39;t think alcohol is toxic to anyone. The problem is that it’s toxic to everyone.   It’ll kill you.</p>
<p>Drinking is not the same thing as smoking. It&#39;s toxic.</p>

> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion? I had to take a stance, and rather, I had to be on the opposite extreme of the other if you will.   Seems like text book reactionary thinking and argumentation. "I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.  That is not obvious at all. You are literally here, *in this post*, doing exactly that.

Truth:
<p>This is offensive to you, because you believe you are depressed beyond your control... And so you are. That is exactly the point. That is the belief. I had this belief too -  I did not believe these kinds of ideas and opinions. Then I noticed, that they are true... And I dont have depression anymore. This is a self-fulfiling logical concept. If you dont believe me so much to the point of being offended by this notion, you logically have to stay depressed. If you are not offended by this notion, there is a chance you can start to believe me. If you believe me, you will not be depressed.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you are arguing against x. If you&#37;re arguing for the extreme opposite of x, then I see no point in arguing for a single extreme. If someone is arguing for one extreme, then you are actually arguing for another extreme.  If you’re arguing against the extreme, you are not arguing for an extreme one.  This is why I’m only here to defend my stance, not to defend it. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not about the disease, it&#37;s about the illness. The illness&quot;is not the problem. It is the disease. It&#38;s the disease that&#34;s causing the illness.</p>

Oh enlightened one. I've just learned another noble truth of which I had no prior knowledge. Criticism is not the same as insults. Who would've known? Truly you are blessed with knowledge.

Truth:
<p>You have criticized others for choosing to remain ignorant.  Now that you&#39;ve been presented evidence from myself and others that contradicts your views, what are you going to do?</p>

Prediction:
<p>Criticism is not an insult. I’m not saying that criticism is bad, but it’s an insult to the core of the argument.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a critic. I am a critic and I&#37;m a critic of others. I don&#38;t respond to criticism, but I do respond to people who do. I do not engage in criticism, and I do engage in discussions with people who disagree with me. I have a lot of experience with criticism and I appreciate that. But I also appreciate that you are not an academic. I also know that criticism is not an excuse for not understanding and understanding the problem.</p> </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying criticism is bad, but I&#37;m saying that criticism is not a good thing. It&#38;s just insulting. If you&#34;re not using criticism as an insult, then you&quot;re using it as an excuse to criticize other people. I don't think it&#40;s a criticism. You&#41;re being a hypocrite.</p>

So we should address people with the pronouns they identify with apart from you? Got it. Not like you’re trying to push some agenda at all.

Truth:
<p>You said that we should stop referring to people with pronouns because it reduces people down to their genitals</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think pronouns should be used for people who identify with one or the other. I think pronouns are the best form of gender identity, and I think it’s a good thing to have pronouns for people that identify with the other pronouns. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think pronouns are the same thing. pronouns are interchangeable. pronouns have the same meaning. pronouns change with age and gender. pronouns can change with the change of seasons. pronouns should be interchangeable. If you want to use pronouns you can use the pronouns you want.</p>
<p>And we have a lot of people who identify with the pronouns they identify with. It&#39;s not like they are all the same. They are all different.</p>

Why even have weight classes if this is the logic.   Excluding females from male sports and vice versa is not sexist,, its common sense.

Truth:
>Sports should be separated by size and weight, not Gender

Prediction:
<p>We have a lot of women in sports that have weight classes, and it&#39;s not sexist to exclude females from certain sports. Women have a ton of weight classes. It&#40;s just a matter of making sure they&#38;re fit and strong.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it makes sense to allow women to compete in certain sports. If you want to ban them from certain sports, then women should be allowed to participate in the same sport as men. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying women should be allowed to compete in sports because they&#37;re not equal to men. If you&#38;re saying that women should have to be able to compete for a medal, that&#40;s not sexist at all.</p>

These chairs are the worst. So glad you called them out. I’m not particularly big and they are awful after just a few minutes. Must be even worse for larger people.  The chairs themselves are totally basic and ugly

Truth:
I mean, the only thing I can say is that I think you’re doing a lot of internal damage to yourself. Your attitude is scaring people away, and you’re attributing that to things like height and physical appearance - please reconsider.

Prediction:
>p>I think the chairs are the worst. They are big, heavy, and uncomfortable. They have no idea what they're doing to people. They don’t know what they’re doing to them. They seem to be used to seat people but they are still used to people sitting in them.  I think that’s because they are too big to be the norm.  They’ve been used to make people uncomfortable for decades.   I’m not sure why they got so big.  </p>
___________________________________________________________________________
Yep, you made a false equivalency that is totally out of line with what the, ya know, science, actually shows, you foolishly equated smoking mj with smoking tobacco.  Meanwhile, smart people will simply accept the data and move on. Cheers!  https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/01/98519/marijuana-shown-be-less-damaging-lungs-tobacco

Truth:
Yes, facts matter.  Marijuana is not physically addictive like cocaine and caffeine.  Marijuana is psychologically addictive like exercise, gambling, video games and shopping.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think smoking marijuana is harmful to the human body. If it is, then it is not harmful. But if you want to make the argument that it is harmful, then you should go with the scientific argument. If you don’t, then I will not go with it. If I go with that argument, I will go with my research.</p>
<p>If you want to argue that smoking marijuana is harmful to your body, then it should be treated as a controlled substance. Otherwise, it would be the same thing. If you don’t believe me, then you’re wrong. I’m not saying that’s not the case. I just say that the harm is less than the benefit. But it does seem to be more. The harm is more than the benefits. It is the harm that comes from smoking it. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you are the only one who has used the term “marijuana” to describe the drug, but I think you have the same argument. If you are one of the few people who has not used it, I think it is a fair comparison to make. But if you are not one of them, then you have to take a look at the data.  Are you one of those people who is not a smoker?</p>

First, I said "perhaps you believe"? I didn't accuse you of anything.      I'll answer your silly question with another silly question:   Why don't lions kill other lions all the time if they DONT have the same morality that humans have?     Why don't dogs? Why don't parrots?     Is it because they fear an eternal punishment in Hell? Is it because they were bestowed with gift of morality?  No no, that's silly. Then why would humans not killing eachother be any measure of us being "special"?   You want to talk about non sequiturs?     Riddle me that.      And don't blame your inability to CMW as my fault?

Truth:
2) You are different from a lion because a lion cannot be held morally accountable. They act on instincts, so whatever they do is neither moral nor immoral. You are someone with moral responsibility because you can choose actions with varying consequences.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t believe that the majority of humans are incapable of morality. I think it’s reasonable to think that it”s a matter of morality, not morality.  The majority of people are not able to think about morality. So why would we want to kill each other?   Why would we kill eachother?  Would it be immoral to kill our own children?  Why should we kill them?  How would we justify killing each other if we had the moral power to do so?  What would it mean to us if we chose to kill others? 
<p>I&#39;m not saying that all humans are bad, but some of us are. In fact, we&#40;re not bad. I&#38;m saying that the only thing that is bad is that some people have a moral compass.   Why would we kill animals if they are not bad?   And why would we not kill them?  Why don't we not save them from the jaws of death?  So why should we kill them in the first place?  Because we&quot;re bad, and because of that, we are morally inferior
<p>I don&#39;t believe that all humans are equal. If you&#37;re saying that, then I&#38;m not saying that all human beings are equal, but that we&#49;re not equal. So I think it&#34;s not a valid point to say that humans have a moral obligation to kill other people for their own good. But I& #39;m saying that the human body&quot;is the same as the animal itself. It&#40;s a moral responsibility to kill someone for their good.</p>

> TEXTBOOK English Words: From Latin and Greek Elements, 2nd Edition. Donald M. Ayers. University of Arizona Press, Tuscan, Arizona. 1986 ISBN: 0816508992 (paperback)  >Recommended teacher resources: Workbook to accompany the above textbook: English Words: From Latin and Greek Elements, By Helena Dettmer and Marcia Lindgren Studies in Etymology. Charles William Dunmore. Focus Publishing/R. Pullins Company. ISBN: 094105129  It’s recommend for teachers, not students. The teachers teach from the book. You’re lying and you have made no citations. Unless you can do that bye.

Truth:
<p>While it&#39;s true that Greeks happened to speak Greek, we are talking about the English usage of the term here.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The study of English words in the first set of English is based on the study of Latin and Greek Elements. The study of the study is in English. It’s not a textbook. It is a textbook, but a workbook. </p>
<p>I’m not going to rephrase the first paragraph here because it’s too long. I’ll use the first one as an example of what I mean by “English” and “Greek”, but I think it is useful for teachers to read the whole thing. I don’t think teachers should be required to read every single word in the entire thing, but it is very helpful for teachers. </p>
<p>The textbook is not a textbook. It’s a workbook. It contains all the English words that you’ve ever read. The whole text is based on the same language. The only difference is that there are many different words. This is not an academic text. </p>

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZML8mnpGd/  Yes it is a tik tok link because stuff like this is taken off main socials immediately, but I can send many more if you'd like. Are you that far in your hole that you don't know that hospital s classify a death as a covid death regardless of the main reason,as long as they are positive when they die?  Lol you are really telling me that the government and big pharma have no reason to lie. I bet you think they want all of their customers to be as healthy as can be too. Only the biggest lawsuits in history follow these companies get your head out of your ass.   Bet you believe that the flu took a year off too. You just keep repeating "safe and effective" and don't pay any attention to the fact that you were told you won't catch covid if you get the vaccine. Science isn't guessing what will happen it's experimenting until a result is consistent. Yes experimenting.  If you don't see a problem with medical professionals being censored and deleted off social platforms for simply offering a second opinion then you are too far gone.  No issues with not discussing the possible side effects like every other drug in history? Or the adverse reactions totalling more than all vaccines combined? Don't you think it's worth at least a discussion to make people aware of what they put in their body? Or are you okay with an outside source telling you and everyone else what to put in their body.   Herd immunity? You really still believe that? Every country that has hit the initial targets for herd immunity is no better than 2 years ago. I hope you realize how wrong you are someday because I know I will never change the minds of people like you   Oh the seat belt argument that's a classic.. I can take my seat belt off whenever I want to no matter the safety to others. That's the same as putting an unknown needle into myself that I can never undo?  They were never intended to stop transmission altogether? I recall hearing from the leader of the free world 

Truth:
<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s <em>only</em> or even mostly a political issue. There&#39;s obviously a real pandemic going on. Rather that the vitriol directed at anybody who is unvaccinated was never a thing with respect to the flu, as far as I remember. If it was entirely apolitical I would expect that people would feel a similar way about mandating the flu vaccine. Maybe to a lesser degree given the reduced severity, but there should be <em>something.</em> Mostly what I&#39;ve seen - including this thread - is people supporting it for COVID vaccines but brushing off the flu because it kills fewer people. On a personal level I feel like, I dunno, if you&#39;re <em>that</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 600k people, you should be at least a <em>little</em> enraged by people not getting a vaccine for a virus that&#39;s killed 60k people.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t know if you know the difference between covid and covid. If you do, then I&#37;m not sure if you have a valid reason to believe that covid is a covid, but if you do you are going to check the CDC website and see if they have a link. If they do, they will not be able to check it. If not, they can still prescribe covid for covid.</p>
<p>A covid death is a covid. The reason people die is because they are not sure why they are dying. The answer is that they don&#39;t know why they die. If they do, they are likely to die because of the covid effect. If you&#37;re not sure, then you may want to check if you can.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, then you are going to have to go to the hospital to see a covid.  I&#37;m not going to lie to you, but you&#38;re going to want to know why it is covid, which is why the government is taking care of it. And why should the government be doing this to people who are in a hospital?  The government should be doing the same thing to them, not the hospital. They should be free to take care of people who have covid for their own safety. The government

No, because black coffee is a description...so you're saying "you filthy black bastard" shouldn't be racist? Piss off troll.

Truth:
>That’s a race then. I feel like I’ve said that the word “black” unhelpfully refers to two different things already.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you are saying that black people are inherently racist, but I think you should be able to say that. </p>And if you are, then you are being facetious by saying that you are a racist, and that is a fair point. I&#37;m not saying that it&#38;s okay to use that term because it&quot;s not racist. It&#40;s just not a polite way to describe a person.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying black people are inherently racist, but I&#37;m saying the term is a bit racist to me because it is used to describe people who are inherently prejudiced. You&#38;re implying that black people have a negative opinion of each other.</p> </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think black people are inherently racist, but I think it is possible to be racist if you&#37;re white and you are white.</p> </p>

You're the type of sexist shit who raped me. You claim women cannot rape to justify your actions. You willfully ignore any science or data that disproves your position.   How many men have you assaulted? I'd bet money it's a non zero amount.

Truth:
Its not rape, *she* definitely wanted it"" is the classic go to defense. I saw you mention in another comment that you would feel the same of the genders where reversed, so congratulations on being consistent at least. However, what you are doing here, is 100% defending rape.

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s a sexist argument to say that women are not rapists. It&#40;s not sexist to say women&quot;re rapists. But it&#37;s sexist to use the term rape as an excuse to justify your actions.</p></p>
Ifp>I&#39;m not saying women are rapists, but I&#37;m saying that men&#38;re rapists because women are more likely to be raped than men because of the gender of the victim.</p></p>
<p>It&#39;s not rape. It&#37;s sexual assault. I&#38;m not saying that men&quot;rape&quOT;, it&#40;s a non-issue, but I&&#44;m saying that if you&#47;re sexually assaulted, then it&%39;ll be rape&#49;s just that the women&#50;re less likely to be raped. The men&#59;re more likely to do so.</p>

Whatever you say Tucker Carlson.

Truth:
<p>And the right wing is learning. Tucker Carlson kept his job after his fuck ups because he knows the outage machine has ADHD.</p>

Prediction:
>p>He’s not a big fan of politics. He’d rather talk about politics.  He‘s not going to be the guy who has a cult following.  I’m not sure why he would want to talk about it, but I know he’ll be the one to tell you.  If you don’t, you’re going to have to listen to his podcast.  </p>
<p>I think you are right. Tucker Carlson is a good guy. He is not a bad guy, and he is not bad at politics. He just isn&#39;t a bad person.</p>
Ip>Tucker Carlson is not a comedian. He is a talk show host. He isn&#39;t a commentator. He has a podcast and a podcast called The Carlson Show. This is his podcast. He does not have a TV show. He just does not want to talk about politics. He doesn&#59;t want to discuss it. He wants to discuss politics. </p>

Plenty of people, myself included, have, and you just ignore, wilfully misinterpret, insult, and block us.

Truth:
Personally since *everyone* has one and you can’t single any groups of people out by using it as an insult I don’t see it as the same issue. Again note I think insulting people is counterproductive anyway so I avoid it as much as possible.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think most of us have, but I think a lot of people do. I&#37;m not sure how many of us are aware of this, but the majority of people are. I think most people know about it, but many of them are unaware of it. Some are not aware of it, and may not even be aware. Some of them have no idea about it. I don’t think they have any idea about the whole thing.
<p>I don&#39;t think that many of us have. I don’t think most of us do, but I think it’s fair to say that a lot of people do. Not all of us are 100% the same way. Some are just as dumb as others, but many of them are not. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you are a bigot. I think it is more polite to not insult people, but I&#37;m not sure why you would choose to do that. I don’t think it’s fair to expect people to be offended by a single comment. I know people who are offended by certain things. I’m not one of those people. I just don”t see the point in insulting people.</p>

I think you need to read up on child development and brain development before you say stuff like this because you just sound stupid. Yeah kids are annoying, but they are small people processing the world around them and parents can only do so much to control their feelings and actions. If you really hate children so much, stay home, thats what I do.

Truth:
<p>That being said, I do agree that it&#39;s being tolerated less and less, and that means that kids are growing up in a bubble. Once they grow up, they&#39;ll enter the real world where there exists assholes and people who have nothing better to do than to insult you. Kids absolutely do need to learn how to deal with people being mean or insulting, but kids also need to learn to <em>not</em> be mean or insulting.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s not a question of whether or not a child should be left alone in the world. The question is, should parents be doing more to help their kids grow up? And do they want to help them grow up in a better way? </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think parents are responsible for your child’s mental and emotional well-being. I think it&#38;s fair to say that parents are the ones who should be responsible for their children’ development and growth. If they&#37;re not, why should they be?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think parents should be punishing their children for their actions. I think they should be treated with the same respect as children. I&#40;m not saying parents should have to protect their children from harm, but they should not be punishing them for their own actions.</p>

The fact that male erotica and prostitution are more popular among gay men than among women (despite the fact that there are far more heterosexual women than gay men) suggests otherwise.Women's erotica and porn  - erotic novels, series about relationships, etc.

Truth:
Thirdly, the reason I imagine there's the double standard between men and women watching gay and lesbian porn is because heterosexual mainstream porn can fully cater for men. You could easily find almost any sex act involving a man and a woman catering for the man. So the only extra bit in gay porn is the gay sex. Conversely, as I already mentioned, mainstream heterosexual porn doesn't easily cater for what the women want to see unless they want the ""rough and male orientated"" sex. So then the lesbian porn is the easier to find, more sensual and female orientated option."

Prediction:
<p>The only reason that men are more likely to be attracted to women is because of the fact that women have a higher rate of sexual attraction to men than men. So that is why men tend to be more attracted to men. And that’s why men are most likely to have more sexual relationships with women. And there is a lot of opportunity for women to explore their sexuality in a sexual way. So, why are women more likely than men to be interested in it?</p>
<p>I think it’s important to note that a lot of men are attracted to women, and women are more attracted to male erotica. I don’t think men are necessarily attracted to men, but I think that women are the more likely ones to be attracted to bisexual men. I also think that there is a very strong correlation between sex and relationships, and I think it may be due to the fact that men are more accepting of homosexuality. But I think the relationship between men and women is more important than anything else.
< I think it's important to note that in general, women are more likely to be sexually active than men, but the fact that men are more attracted to women is not necessarily an indicator of that.

I’m not lying about anything, I’m calling out your abhorrent statements that you seem to churn out every day. When will you take responsibility for what you comment?

Truth:

<p>I don&#39;t think that you are lying about anything.</p>

I'm only staying home because I currently have the Covids... But I would still go out on NYE if I didn't... And if I'm feeling fine by NYE, then I will go out.  Long story short, if your sick then stay home... If your not sick, then go out  Nothing to fear... The flu is way worse than the omicron

Truth:
>If you're sick, stay home.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think the flu is a serious illness. If it is, it is not a serious one. We can do what we want to do to prevent it from happening, but we can&#37;t go out on NYE without fear of getting sick. If you are not sick, then go out. If your not sick then go home. If not, then stay home. </p>
Ip>If you don&#39;t want to go out, then go out. If you do, then stay home. If your not, go out for the flu vaccine. If not, then come home for a cold. If someone does, go home for the cold vaccine. Even if you don’t get the flu, go back to work. If a cold develops, go to the doctor. If the flu develops, stay home.</p>
<p>I have no idea how many people are sick, but it&#39;s likely that many people have the flu. I&#37;m not sure if the flu is just a virus or if it&quot;s a disease, but if it is a virus, then I don&#34;t know. I suspect that people who are not ill will go out to get vaccinated. If they are not sick, then go out. And if they are, then stay home. If you are not, go out and get vaccinated.</p>

I'm a bigot against something that doesn't really exist.  You are a bigot against women in the way you belittle their importance and their reality of existence.

Truth:
Being against homosexuals, makes you a bigot.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you&#37;re a bigot for women. I think you are a bigot against women, and I&#38;m going to use the term ""bigotry"" to describe the way you&quot;re portraying women. It is not true that women&quots are inferior to men, but it is a valid way to describe them as a whole.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a bigot. I think it is a good idea to talk about women in general because I think that women are more open to discussion and discussion. I&#37;m just saying that women&#38;re not the problem here. I don&#49;t believe that the problem is that women have a hard time understanding the meaning of what a woman is, and that women need to be treated with respect and respect. I mean, women&quot; are not inherently inferior.</p>
<p>You think I&#39;m a bigot against women?</p>

So the women had it coming.  Gotcha.  Blaming the victim.

Truth:
>A woman who gets raped shouldn't blame Men, she must blame other women.

Prediction:
<p>The victim is a woman. The victim isn&#39;t a man. She is a man, and she is not a woman.</p>
Ip>The victim didn&#39;t come to us. The victim did. The woman did.  The victim was not the victim, she was the victim.
<p>It’s not about blaming the victim. It’’t about blaming them for something. It is about blaming themselves for something.</p>

You claim to have heard it all, but fail to address their arguments. Interesting

Truth:
>and don't read it because you're not entitled to have me doing your research to disprove your claims.

Prediction:
<p>I think it is fair to say that most of these people don&#39;t have a good understanding of the arguments they are making. Some are actually quite good, some are quite poor. Some of them are just not as good as others. Some may be better understood, but they are still not as well understood as others, and that is a shame.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t address their arguments, then I have no idea what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>They’ve already heard it all.

TIL people are so desperate for things to complain about that they've turned to candy

Truth:
>Candy is usually short for Candice.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you should have to complain about candy to be able to get a response.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that a lot of people are tired of whining about things they don&#37;t like. The problem is that people are just tired of hearing about it.</p> </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think people should complain about things that are not their fault.</p>

Was this written for a shitpost or something, surely this was written by a shitposter because everyone else worldwide knows he will pay more than 11bn in taxes this year.   To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.

Truth:
<p>I think you don&#39;t understand it if you think the way he hasn&#39;t paid taxes for decades are the same rules that apply to everyone? Who gets offered their entire compensation in stock? The top 0.01%? What proportion of those can borrow enough against those stocks that they never have to sell and can afford to live like the top 0.001%? How is that the same rules that apply to everyone?</p>

Prediction:
<p>If you&#39;re implying that Tesla should pay taxes on its profits, then you are being willfully ignorant. If you&quot;re suggesting that Tesla must pay taxes for every dollar of revenue that it makes, then that&#37;s not a valid argument at all. It is a fair argument to make, and one that is not based solely on your view. If we were to assume that Tesla would pay taxes in the year that ended in January, then it&#40;s a reasonable argument to suggest that the company should be able to pay taxes to the US&#
<p>I think it’s fair to say that Musk has a lot of money to invest in Tesla, and therefore should pay taxes on that investment. This is not the case with Tesla, but it is the case in general. The fact that Musk doesn’t have a ton of money in his bank account is a reflection of that fact. In fact, his wealth is not going to be used to pay taxes, but rather to make investments in other companies. He’ll be required to pay $1 billion in taxes on his investments in the future. This would make sense if he were to pay
<p>It&#39;s not like Tesla has to pay taxes for every $1,000 of revenue it makes. It&#37;s just that Tesla&#38;s CEO is not paying taxes on every $100,000. The only way to change that is by making sure he pays taxes on the profits of each single $100 million of revenue that he makes. The fact that he&#40;s paying taxes is the reason why he is so wealthy. </p>So, if you want to change your view on taxes, you&#47;re going to have to

>I'm a Canadian and I'm genuinely disturbed by the amount of people involved in the recent protest ~~against vaccine mandates~~ and vaccination in general who are claiming to be acting out of patriotic sentiment.  I literally already quoted your own words to you where you stated this, but I will again.   You cannot only choose to give deltas to people who agree with you.   If you only want to talk about the vaccines you can't also present the mandate protests in your original post.   You did.   If you refuse to give credit where someone has changed your view enough that you're literally telling me you no longer wish to talk about the vaccines, but also refuse to admit to a view change - even a SLIGHT - one - you just plain aren't out to even admit your view CAN be changed at all.   So you're posting persuasion propaganda if you aren't out to actually see other people's viewpoints or even consider them, when they actually RELATE TO THE ACTUAL WORDS OF YOUR OP.  If you want to preach to people about the need to be vaccinated, that isn't a CMV.  Those who refuse to play by the rules always win arguments because they cheat. So way to win an argument by not even playing by the rules of this sub. Are you proud??

Truth:
<p>As for vaccination, I’m not sure it’s relevant whether you consider it a good thing. Others don’t, and they’re entitled to make decisions on their own reasoning unless you’re proposing forcing them. And I don’t think you can tell them what is or isn’t rational, because it depends on how they personally weight different concerns: for instance, minimising the likelihood of death from COVID might be less important to them than, say, taking a stance against what they feel is a politically objectionable programme. I don’t know - I can’t really give voice to their concerns because I’m not in their head, but I know many people are implacably opposed to it, and I’m not clear on whether you’re proposing forcing them or simply trying to convince them.</p>

Prediction:
<p>The vaccine mandate is not a mandate. It’s a fact of life. The vaccine is not something that is an absolute necessity for everyone. So why is it so hard to justify the mandate in the first place? Because it is an important part of life, and it&#39;s an issue that can be hard to change. The reason the vaccine has become so controversial is because it is so harmful to the human body. If people want to fight for it, they can do so by doing so by saying “vaccines are bad” and “well, I don&#
<p>I&#39;m not a vaccine advocate, but I do think the vaccine is a good thing. It’s good to have a conversation with people who disagree with you about it. I think it’ll be interesting to see how people respond to that conversation. If people respond in kind to what you’re saying, then it will be interesting. People will respond with a response to the same question they’ve been asking for months, and then you will have to respond to them. This is why I’m not going to defend the vaccine. I don’
<p>I&#39;m concerned about vaccine mandates. I think it is reasonable to expect people to be concerned about the safety of vaccines. I&#37;m not saying that vaccine mandates are bad, but they are a huge part of our culture. And I don’t mean to be anti-vaccine, but I think people should be aware of the risks and benefits of vaccination. I also think that vaccination is an important part of the American way of life, and I think that the vaccine has a lot to do with that. But it&#38;s also a part of how

Fuck off. You're a rape apologist. You deny women assault men.   You deserve worse.

Truth:
But yes I said that these impacted women more. And many women don’t report rape as well?"

Prediction:
<p>You&#39;re a rape apologist. You&#37;re not accusing women of rape. Just accusing them of not being aware of it. You are not accusing the women of being unaware of it.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe me, then you’re a rape apologist. If you don&#39;t, you are a rapist. If someone does, you”re a hypocrite. You’ll be accused of rape.</p>
<p>So you&#39;re saying that women are raped because they’re afraid to speak up. I&#37;m not saying that all women are rapists, but it&#38;s true. Women are raped to a degree that they&#40;re afraid of speaking up. You&#41;re not saying the women&quot; are being raped by men. You are just saying that. You don&#47;t have to be the one to say that. </p></p>

Prediction:
<p>Your face is not a reflection of your body. You are a human being with a deformity. You were born with a face that was not shaped like a human body. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t get a mohawk, you can still get a tattoo on your back.</p>

Is this a cmv or a King of the Hill appreciation thread?  The creators clearly make Dale a stand in for anti government cranks in Texas, and from there his character's lack of understanding of reality amd knee jerk anti authority personality creates a lot of comedy.  He is a great character. No way i could change your view on that though.

Truth:
<p>For the most part yeah. The TV hosts are exaggerated characters they play up to drive interactions and get publicity through controversy, and with politicians, especially at high levels, it&#39;s which guy do you dislike the least.</p>

Prediction:
<p>You seem to think that Dale is a bad actor. He&#39;s not. He is a morally superior man and a great comedian. I&#37;m not saying that Dale&#34;s bad actor, but he&#38;s a good actor. The fact that he is a good person, and the fact that his character is not bad at all is just a reflection of his character&#47;s character&quot; and the character&q;s personality. I think that&#49;s why he was so successful.</p>
<p>The point of this thread is that I think Dale is a good character. He is a successful actor, and I think that's a good thing because he's a great entertainer. He isn&#39;t a bad actor, but he&#40;s a great actor and a good entertainer and a great comic. He does not deserve to be called a King of the Hill, but I think he could be considered a good actor for the job. He&#37;s an interesting character to work with and a very engaging one. He plays a great role in the series and is
<p>I’m not sure if you’re referring to Dale as a king of the hill. I’d say he’s a king, but I think the name is more of an insult to the people of Texas who are supposed to be anti-government. If you want to change your view to “well, let’ve go with Dale”, then that’ll be the best way to do it.</p>

Why? The first part was stupid. why would the last part be better?

Truth:
The rest makes sense but that part is definitely stupid."

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think the last part of this is stupid. I think the first part of the entire post was stupid. The second part was dumb. </p>
<p>I think the last part of this is pretty stupid. I think you should just read the whole thing. The last part was stupid. </p>
<p>It&#39;s stupid.</p>

The typical counter points are: 1. It offends god.  2. It upsets people because it reminds them of their own mortality. 3. It could be abused and people could be coerced into ending their own life. 4. Mistakes with diagnosis’s could result in people needlessly ending their lives. 5. New treatments for previously incurable conditions might come available after someone has ended their life. 6. Friends and family will miss out on precious time with their loved ones if they end their life earlier than their disease does.  I think that most of the counterpoints.  Personally I don’t hold any of these as being adequate justification for prohibiting the practice but they are the reasons that are offered by many and they think they are sufficient.  I’m lucky enough to live in a state where euthanasia is legal. Having seen the horror of final stage cancer looks like, it’s very comforting to know I have an option.

Truth:
2) If euthanasia is legal to some extent, people can still choose not to do it for themselves because of their own beliefs, but if it's completely illegal, people won't be free to make that choice for themself, no matter what they believe.

Prediction:
<p>So why is it so hard to end someone's life, regardless of their diagnosis? It&#39;s hard to say, but it&#37;s not impossible to do. But it is hard to see why people would choose to end their own life in the first place, and it seems to be more likely to be a result of a lack of awareness of the risks of death. So why would people choose to choose to die in the second place?</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a cure, it is a disease. It’s a disease that can be controlled by the government, and if it&#37;s controlled, it will be the death of the person.  It is not the end of the world, and it is not an option to end life. It is a choice that is not made by society.  If people decide to end their life, then they will be able to save their own lives.  They will be healthier for it.  </p>
<p>I think that the counter points are counter-productive to the idea that dying early is better than dying later.  I think that people should be more aware of their own mortality and not be afraid to choose their own life.   It&#39;s not about life itself, but about what it&#37;s like to be alive.  If someone dies early, it&quot;s about how their life is going to be better.  Maybe they&#38;ll be more accepting of their dying early, but that&#44;s a long-term, and

Maybe get a sense of humor, Jesus Christ dude.

Truth:
Lmao, grow up and talk to a woman.

Prediction:
<p>You’re not going to laugh at me for being so ignorant, I guess. I’m going to try to be more mature and not get offended by people’s jokes. You’ll be able to laugh a little more if you see the humor in my jokes. That’d be great for me, but I‘m not going into details here. I just want to get a sense of humor.”
<p>It&#39;s funny to me that people can laugh at jokes that are a bit too far out of place to be funny.</p>
Ip>I think humor is the word of the day. I think it's a good thing that humor exists, because it's not just a matter of being funny. </p>

There's alot of dumb takes on this sub but this one takes the cake

Truth:
Keep in mind, there’s a difference between an actual dumb take and a take you just don’t agree with.  </p>

Prediction:
<p>This sub is just a dumb sub. I&#39;m not going to pick the one that is dumb because it’s dumb.</p>
<p>I think you&#39;re right that this sub is dumb.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to take the cake here.</p>

Just because you say no it doesn't make it true. If you want it to be true, address my points.

Truth:
Because it's not true?

Prediction:
Ip>The point I made was that you said it was true. Just because you don&#39;t say it is true doesn’t mean it&#37;s not true.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you are saying yes to my point. I just think it is a valid point to make. If you don't agree with my point, I&#37;m not going to argue with it. If I do, then I will agree with your point. If not, then you are not doing this.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you&#40;re saying no, I&#37;m saying yes. But yes, you are saying yes, and I think you are not saying no. You are saying no because you aren’t willing to go along with it. So I guess I&39;m going to be saying yes because I&&#47;m not willing to pay for it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are a pussy. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that you are being a pussy, and I don&#39;t want you to be a pussy. You are not a pussy.</p>

This is pretty rich coming from a former kid.

Truth:
If a ‘rich kid’ was featured as a genuinely hard worker he/she would be blasted as “well no wonder they accomplished that. Mommy and Daddy did it for them with money” in many parts of the media and social media."

Prediction:
<p>If you want to know why I don&#39;t know, you can ask me. I don’t know. Maybe I can figure out what happened to me, but it seems like I was the one who was responsible for the death of my parents, and that is not a good way to go about it.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you are a former kid, but I think it is fair to say that you are. Maybe you are, but you are not.</p>
<p>I’m not a former kid. I was a kid and I was raised by my parents. I’ll never be a kid again. I have no idea what it’s like to be a teenager. </p>

Only the true racists are obsessed with racism. (Oh yeah, it's "litany")

Truth:
Whether that counts as ""racism"" depends on what definition you're using.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think the term is used to describe racism. I think it is an umbrella term, and I think you can say that many people are not racist, but I think the word is used in a negative way to describe people, specifically minorities. It&#37;s a term that literally means ""racist" in a positive way." </p>The problem with racism is that it can be misinterpreted as a negative term. The problem with that is that the label is vague. It is not meant to be used to refer to anything other than racism.
<p>I don&#39;t think you can really be racist without being a racist. The term is mostly used to describe people who are obsessed with racism. If you want to call them racist, then you can use the term ""p>#39"; to refer to people who have a negative view of racism. </p></p>
Ip>I&#39;m not a racist, I think it's just that there are a lot of different types of people who are racist.  And I don&#37;t think there are many different types that are as racist as you are.  But I do think the term is one of the most common ones I use to describe people that are racist, and I think that is a good thing.  I don't think that's a racist way to describe it, but I think there is a lot I can do to identify with that, and that's something I can identify with.

Yeah, it’s super great for children to have a mass shooter as a parent

Truth:
<p>We have seen CHILDREN slaughtered in droves over the past few decades. Sometimes with extremely dangerous types of guns in cold blood - much less the every day accidents. The idea that this country is going to sit down and have a conversation about it after the 11,000th mass shooting is blind naivety. </p>

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s great to have a parent who cares about your kid. If you don’t have a kid, that is a really bad thing. But if you do have a child, then you are going to be responsible for them. </p>
<p>The fact that a parent is a parent isn&#39;t the reason that a child is killed by a shooter is not the reason why a parent should have a gun. The reason why it’s not the primary reason is because the parent has to be the one responsible for the child. They have to be responsible for it.</p>
<p>It’s not like you’re forcing your kid to be a parent. You’ve got to be willing to help your kid be a good parent. It&#39;s not the same as being a parent, but you have to be able to support your kid in a positive way.  This is why we have a lot of gun violence.  The only way to prevent it is to have them be parents.  You can’t prevent it by having them be kids.  </p>

Not the same at all.

Truth:
Not the same thing.

Prediction:
<aphrase: Not the same at all
<p>I&#39;m not sure how the two paraphrases work, but I think they are similar. I think it is pretty clear they are very similar. They are similar to each other in that they are both very similar, but there is a difference in the phrasing.</p>
<p>That sounds like a pretty similar approach toaphrase, but it&#39;s more complex.</p>

>No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow.  Fuck you. Eat a dick.  >Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.   >   >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  Learn how to read retard.

Truth:
<p>I assert that being a pedophile means you have an &quot;urge&quot; and having an &quot;urge&quot; automatically means there&#39;s a risk. Now, defining &quot;high&quot; is complicated. Personally I think human sex drive is pretty strong so in my opinion it&#39;s &quot;high&quot; enough to be concerned. Just be happy that we&#39;re not in the world of <em>&quot;Minority Report&quot;</em> and we do wait for people to actually commit the crime before giving out punishment.</p>

Prediction:
<p>It&#39;s true that many people are sexually attracted to children, but not all of them are victims of domestic violence. It&#37;s not a question of whether or not a victim is a victim of sexual assault, but rather whether or how the victim feels about the crime. If a victim feels the same way, it&#38;s likely that the victim is not the victim. The victim is an adult and is not a child. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not a crime to harm a child, it&#37;s a crime of being sexually attracted to someone. And the harm that someone did to a child is a crime, not of being physically attracted to that person.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#39;s almost impossible to say whether or not the crime was committed because of the person who was sexually attracted to the child. It&#40;s entirely possible the victim is an adult. If the person was a child predator, the crime&quot;s not possible because they were sexually active, but because they had a sexual relationship with the child that resulted in the sexual assault.</p>

OP clearly does not have kids, otherwise they wouldn't be asking this question.

Truth:
<p>You didn’t answer my question: do you have kids? I suspect from you avoiding this question that you don’t. Which is a pity because I’d have been interested in what you practically did in parenting terms if this is your real view. It seems more likely now that you’re making a silly argument in the abstract which is a lot less interesting.</p>

Prediction:
< I don't think OP has kids, I think it's fair to assume OP does.
<p>So OP doesn&#39;t have kids. So if OP has kids, then OP would be the one to have them.</p>
<p>I’d say OP doesn’t have kids, because they’re not the ones that are having kids. They have kids. </p>

They’re weak AF and grew up in a timeline with low interests rates.  By the time they’re in the mid to late 20s we might have double interest rates on mortgage for people with bad/ low credit.  Automation should be advanced enough to replace all the menial repetitive jobs.  Social media has created this illusion that everyone is living their best life….   Covid 19 called BULLSHIT on everyone !! If it wasn’t for the government welfare programs many people would have lost everything.

Truth:
Ultimately, we need to accept that automation is coming to replace some, probably even many, jobs. There's no getting around that. It's going to happen no matter what we do. We need to accept that and find ways to structure society to still allow everyone to get their needs met without forcing them to take poverty wages. This is where something like a federal jobs guarantee or UBI can help pick up the slack when the private sector lays people off."

Prediction:
<p>The problem is that people have too much debt. They have too little money to pay their mortgage.  The government should be doing more to help them.  If they were to do more to pay off their debt, they would have less money to invest in their education.  This is why we have so many people who are poor.  They have very little interest to pay on their debt.  And in addition to that, they have too few jobs to do. </p>
<p>If people were to be able to pay off their loans in their 20s, they’d be much happier. They wouldn’t have to worry about paying off their student loans in the first place. The problem is that people would be more likely to have less money to spend on their homes. They’re not going to have to pay for everything they have. The same is true of people who are already working full time. People who are not working full-time would have little to do with their lives. So they would be a burden to society. They would have to be forced to
<p>If you think about it, it’s not a big deal that people are still poor and have little to do with their lives. If they were rich and had a job well into their 40s, they’d probably be able to pay off their loans in a few years. They would still be working hard, but they would be more likely to be unemployed. They’re not going to have an income to support them. They are going to be forced to work hard, and their income will be limited to a few hours a week.  That’ll be the case with the

Are you seriously stupid its not just for voting. ITS FOR IDENTIFICATION. which everyone all over the world has to have beside aboriginal tribes. Every established country has a form of ID

Truth:
<p>For some reason people have the notion that large amounts of people who are legally allowed to vote in the US don’t have IDs.</p>

Prediction:
<p>And ID&#39;s not just for voting. It&#59;s for self-identification, as we have seen with many other countries, including Canada. And some countries have laws that allow for the identification of people. Some have laws which allow people to vote without having to pay for it.</p> </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think voting is for the purpose of ID. It is for self-determination.  Voting is for identity. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t understand ID, then you are not voting. If you do, you are doing it for the wrong reasons.</p>

lololol right?! Fellow house husband and parent here, this mf’er had absolutely no clue about the realities of parenting, partnering, or adulting. What a rube.

Truth:
>Fine: you think single-parent households are lacking something.

Prediction:
<p>This is not a discussion about parenting. It’s about the realities of parenting, and the potential consequences of it. If you wish to discuss parenting, I’m not going to argue with you, but if you want to discuss it with me, you can. </p>
<p>That&#39;s not a good reading of parenting. My point is that most people are not fully understanding how parenting works. Some of them are just ignorant. Some are not. Some may be ignorant, but most of them have no idea about parenting at all. Some people are simply not aware of the realities of parenting or how it should be done. Some have even gone so far as to believe that it&#37;s just a process. Some might think that parenting is an art, but I&#38;m actually very open to learning about it. I don’t think

Again, everyone is dead against racism…. Unless it’s anti-white racism. Then it’s just harmless.   Mongoloids I swear

Truth:
<p>Racism is ugly at best and lethal in many cases. </p>

Prediction:
Ip>The problem with racism is that it’s almost always white people who are anti-racism. It&#39;s not something you can actually say. It is something you have to go through to make sense.  But if you can&#37;t do that, then it&#40;s a big problem.   If you can’t see it, then you’re not racist.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think racism is a crime, but I think it is.  I think people should be able to fight racism because it’s not harmful.  But I think we should be concerned about racism in general.  And if people want to fight it, they should do it with their own hands.</p>
<p>So I don&#39;t think racism is a big issue in the US. I think it is, and I don’t think it’s a big part of the problem.  I think the problem with racism is that people who are white are often afraid to speak out against it.  If they don”t, then they will be afraid to talk about it. So if they do, then it is just a part of racism, and they’re afraid to say “I’m against it”.  They are afraid to go against the grain

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‘debate’ (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I’m going to guess that you’re in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you’re willing to let me know your state, I’m happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I’m critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.

Truth:
It sounds like you've gone through a lo of awful trauma, and the things you describe sound like attempts at abuse and gaslighting, and not actual, real beliefs that people hold."

Prediction:
<p>If you&#39;re in the US, then you need to reevaluate your therapy options. If you don’t, then I can help. I’m sure you’ll find a therapist who will help you. If not, I will. But if you don&#37;t, I‘m not sure what to do with you. I&#38;m not going to go into the details, but I will summarize what I have found in my experience.
<p>If you’re willing to discuss therapy, I’d be happy to discuss it with you. But if you don’t want to talk about it, I think you need to get out of the house. If you don&#39;t, then I”m not going to go into the details of how therapy works. I“m going to assume that you have some experience with trauma and are willing to talk to therapists about it. If not, then the only way to do so is to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>We’re going to do what we can to help you, but if you don’t have access to the resources that are available, I’m not going to take you up on it.</p>

It suggests it because men and women's sports are clearly separated by a wide performance margin.  You people are literally insane. Go look through the banned list of substances in USADA and come tell me with a straight fact that being a biological man doesn't have a difference in your physical attributes.  If this were true we wouldn't have the WNBA, everyone would just be good enough to play in the NBA. But that doesn't happen because biology is real and matters.  It's really lunacy to suggest there is no difference. Pick any physical sports and compare men's records to women's records. Suppressing your hormones for a few years doesn't negate that advantage.

Truth:
There is evidence to back up men performing better in many physically based sports than woman however there are not real studies as to WHY. We assume it is increased muscle etc and that is a reasonable assumption however when we close that gap significantly with hormones people still want to argue the other physical differences. My issue with this argument is there is currently no evidence one way or the other and literally every human is physically different in some way."

Prediction:
<p>I think the point of the argument is that men are more likely to be successful in certain sports than women because of their ability to compete. The point is that women are more talented than men, which is why they are more valuable to the sport. Women are less likely to have problems with the sport they love, because of the biology of their bodies. So the point is, men are better than women. Women have more athletic bodies. The only thing that makes them better is that they have more ability in certain areas of the game. So it’s not a question of whether or not they can compete
<p>It&#39;s not about the sex, but about the body. So, if it&#40;s a biological sex, then the women&#41;re in the same boat. But if it is a biological gender, then it is not a biological difference. It&#37;s about the physiology of the body, not the genetics of the individual. If it was about the biology of the human body, then there&#44;s no difference in the ability to compete. That&#47;s why men&quot; are more likely to compete in the
<p>In the WNBA, men are ranked higher than women in the top 100% of the points scored, and women are ranked lower than men. So if you want to argue that women are better than men, you can argue that men are better at it, but women are not. So why should we be concerned with whether or not women are good at it? </p>

Ahh, I see you have the I'm right and you're wrong mindset.... Very Devine of you oh great one.   Read my post and you will see that's exactly who I was talking about. You brought it to the extreme to try to win an argument that isn't an argument. Then try to mock me for having a conversation with different view points. I have pity for you.   We all know evil things have been done in this world. Gross and disturbing acts, things that make stomachs crawl but I am now convinced nothing was as bad as not having you aborted. Even with that being said, I'd be happy to teach you to comprehend what you read better because no one is below redemption.

Truth:
>Instead I said that your arguments you are using to prove that killing is evil are not working. They reach conclusions you do not agree with so you should come back again with another line of reasoning.

Prediction:
<p>I’m not going to rephrase your argument because I think it’s pretty clear that you’re wrong. I don’t believe in abortion or anything like that. I’ve been in a lot of situations where people have had to abort their babies in order to save their lives. I think this is a fair argument to make, but it seems to be the case here. This is the reason why you are so successful in your arguments. You’ll be able to change your mind in a few years when you are older and you”ll be more accepting
<p>If you&#39;re wrong about abortion, then you have a valid point. I hope you can come to the conclusion that it&#37;s not the case. If you&quot;re right then I hope that you can find the solution to your problem. If not, then I&#49;m going to go back to my point. If the solution is to have you aborted, then the solution will be the same. If it isn’t, then why should it be? If you are wrong, then your argument is flawed. And if you are right,
<p>I’m not saying that you’re wrong. I just think that it’s pretty clear that you have a valid point. I’d say it”s not the same thing as having someone aborted. You’ve proven your point by having the abortion itself. I have no idea what your point is, but I think you”ve proven yourself wrong by having people abort you. It’ll be hard for you to change your mind, but you have to understand that there”t really any other way to go about it.

I completely agree.  The modern xbox controllers are nice, and have a great feel, and the fitment to my hands is excellent, but the drawbacks keep nagging me.  It feels like the left stick is placed in the perfect spot for games where you have to push the left stick forward 95% of the time.   On 2D or isometric games it's cramping to pull that stick downward for periods of time, I usually end up repositioning my thumb and holding it near the knuckle.

Truth:
<p>I hate the switch controllers. The Playstation 2 dual shock controller is the greatest controller ever made. It fits nicely in my hand and all the buttons are in convenient locations. There&#39;s a reason why USB controllers nowadays typically copy the PS2 controller&#39;s design, and the later generations of Playstation controllers saw minimal change.</p>

Prediction:
Ip>The problem with xbox controllers is they’re not designed to be used for all types of games. They’ve always been designed for the specific type of games, and you’ll never see a controller that’s not optimized for that type of experience. They also have to be very precise to fit your body and make sure you don’t have to constantly push the stick forward. They don”t do that for 2D games, or for video games. If you have a video game where you want to play a game with the left stick, you can simply lift
<p>The only problem I have with xbox controllers is that they don’t allow you to hold the left stick in your hand for long periods of time. The only way to get it out of your hand is to hold it in your right hand, without pulling the stick out of the hand. The problem is that it’s not as comfortable as the controller you’re using, and the controller is not as responsive as you would like it to be. If you want to use the right stick for a long period of time, you can just hold the stick with your hand and let it go
>p>The problem with xbox controllers is that they don&#39;t fit the right side of your hand. It’s like a joystick, and it’ll be heavy on the thumb and the index finger. They’re also uncomfortable to hold, and they can’t be used as a joystick. They are very hard to hold in the hand. They also have a lot of room for movement, so they can only be used in the right hand, which is not a good thing. They can also be uncomfortable to use the left hand, because they can feel the thumb pulling

Stop being pedantic, OP's argument is pretty understandable and you dufuses are trying to catch them on a pointless technicality like a shitty lawyer.

Truth:

<p>The OP is pedantic, I don&#39;t think you are pedantic.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you&#37;re pedantic.</p>
________________________________________________________________________________
Op is arguing in bad faith, they agree that it’s not offensive to them, but then state that they don’t speak for all white people.  You can’t change their mind because as they said, they don’t speak for all white people. This just a dude with hot take trying to get karma.

Truth:
And let’s even suppose that you’re right (which you’re not because the argument is a racist hasty generalization) that whites don’t like talking about race. Your solution is to have a forum dedicated to hating white people and make fun of them? That makes no sense. If anything, seems like a good way to make whites resent other races."

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you can change your mind if you think that white people are offensive to you. You are doing that by saying that white men are inherently bad people. I think it’s fair to say that they’re not. But if you try to change your view, you’ll be getting a lot of backlash from people that think that is racist.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that they don’t speak for all white people, but I’d say that it’s entirely fair to say that they’re speaking for all people. I would also say that I don&#39;t think that they are. I think they are doing the same thing with their own views, but they are not speaking for ALL white people. Maybe they should change their mind. If they want to, they should. But if they don &quot;t, then they should stop.
Ip>I don&#39;t think you are offended by white people’s views. I think you&#38;re not offended by the way they are speaking, but I&#37;m not offended at all by it. It&#47;s not an issue of racism. It is a matter of how white people respond to each other, not how they respond to one another. And I think this is the best way to respond to that, because it is a valid point to make.

Another day - another [misogynist mass shooting ](https://www.newsweek.com/denver-shooter-lyndon-mcleod-guns-misogyny-social-media-1663930?amp=1) based on the radicalisation of men.   In response, maybe we should *checks notes - ban FDS?

Truth:
I’ll admit I steelmanned FDS in my post, because I wanted controversy and because the hate for FDS is a bit over the top. But this thread is full of replies highlighting the darker side. particularly, their attitudes towards mentally ill men are reprehensable. I won’t be defending the sub in the future, although i’m not convinced it deserves banning.

Prediction:
Ip>It&#39;s not about banning FDS. It&#37;s about banning hate speech. This is about how we treat people who use hate speech and violence as a tool to justify violence. </p>The point of this post is that we should ban hate speech in general, not just hate speech, and use social media to speak out against hate speech.</p>
<p>We should ban FDS. No one should ever be forced to kill anyone for being a woman. It’s a sad sad day.  I’m not saying it’ll be easy, but we should do it. This is one of those things we’ve seen in the past. We’re not talking about the death of a woman or the rape of a man. We are talking about a man who is transphobic.  This is a sad day, but it”s a good day to be a woman
<p>Again, we are seeing a lot of men being subjected to the same kinds of violence. It’s not like we’re going to ban FDS because men have a lot more power. This is an example of how we have been treated in the past, and how we can continue to treat them in this way. We’ve already seen this in the UK, in the US, and in Europe, and it has been shown to be a big problem with the way we treat women.

I hundred percent agree, but with older, current, and newer generations we have been so caught up in our emotions that we have forgotten what is important and what matters( for example, advancement in technology, outer space, and in general society). Sure, gender might be important to you, but what will that bring in the end. Ask yourself that.

Truth:
Everything I say here is in the context of the acknowledgement that Gender is a social construct and that it is possible for it to outlive its usefulness. I don't think we're there today and won't be there for a long time, but it is what I advocate for."

Prediction:
<p>I think you’re right. I’m not saying that it’s solely about gender. I think it is more about how society treats us and how we respond to it. It’d be easier to think about it if we had a discussion with someone who was in the same boat as me about it, but I think we’ve lost touch with that conversation. We don’t need to discuss it with each other, because it”s not about gender or anything.
Ifp>It&#39;s not about gender. It&#37;s about society. The world is changing and changing. The people who are working for it are changing. In this way, it&#38;s a good thing to be able to be open to change. But in the end, we are not going to change that. The only way we can change that is by changing the way we think about it. The problem is that society is changing.
<p>That’s not to say that gender is irrelevant. It&#39;s just that we&#37;re not a nation of people who are sexually active, and that&#38;s not a reflection of who we are. The fact that women&quot; are sexually attractive is a fact of life, and I&#34;m not saying that men&quOT; are not important to us. I think that &quot: is what you are saying, because it&#47;s irrelevant.

You whine more than a kid at a restaurant.   You don’t own the world, you’re not owed a child-free restaurant any more than parents are owed a night out with their family.  Go to a different restaurant or work somewhere else if you can’t handle it.  How are parents supposed to teach their kids how to act in public if they never bring them out in public?   You’re evidently child-free, so why don’t you go enjoy your water in a place that doesn’t allow children?

Truth:
I addressed this argument. Are you also one of those insufferable people that think it's ok for a child to make a giant mess in a restaurant and the parents just leaving it behind because ""ThEy pAy pEoPLe to ClEAn""? That's the same kind of bullshit attitude.

Prediction:
<p>The only way to make sure a kid is allowed to enjoy their water is to let them go out and enjoy their food. It&#39;s not the same as having a kid in your house, and it&#37;s a violation of the law to have a kid with you in a restaurant. The problem is that kids are not allowed to go out in public, and the parents are forced to take care of them. This is why we have to have parents who refuse to take their kids out to eat. They are not responsible for their own food and they can&#38;t
Ip>If you&#39;re a parent and want to take your kid out for a dinner, then why not go to a restaurant with a kid?</p>
<p>It&#39;s not fair to assume that every parent is responsible for their kid’s behavior. If the parents are responsible for your child”s safety, then they are not responsible for the safety of their child. If they&#37;re not, then the parent should be responsible for it.</p>

What is woman? As a human with the anatomical organs that make me a woman in your eyes this question is so ridiculous. Woman is everything and nothing. Woman is anything she wants to be. Just say you’re a bigot and call it a day bud.   I swear if conservatives spent a quarter of the energy they do on worrying if peoples genitals matched their pronouns, we would solve world hunger. But no you guys are more worried about a person being a different gender on the inside.

Truth:
Most people are expected to be a man or a woman, this is gender. It have no basis in biology. You could very well socialize someone born male as a woman if every interraction this person have consider her to be a woman and this despite her male genitals.

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m a woman, not a man. I&#40;m not a woman. I am a woman because I am an individual. I have a body, I am not an individual, I have my own body. I feel like I am called a woman by my body, and I feel that people should be able to identify me as a woman regardless of gender. I don&#59;t think people should have to choose between two genders to be a woman&quot; because I don’t feel that way. I think it’s a good thing
<p>I think it’s fair to say that a woman is a man. A man is a woman. A woman is female, and a man is not a man.</p>
<p>A woman is a woman, not a man. You&#39;re a woman because you are the woman. If you&#37;re not a woman then you are a man&quot; and your job is to be a woman. I&#38;m not saying that&#40;s a woman; I just mean that I&&#47;m a woman&#34;m NOT saying that you are not a person, but that you&quots are a bigot for being against gender. You are being sexist for being sexist, not for being a woman

There's a lot of people in this thread arguing about individual rights and government over reach as if they were still alive in this scenario and were safeguarding against tyranny. You're dead. You are no longer in possession of this bag of useful tissue. You are no no longer part of this decision making process. It should be up to the living to figure out how best to use this resource.

Truth:
<p>Governments never handbag authority that has been even temporarily even to them by the people of the countries. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan government authority is the closest thing to eternal life we have on this planet, if the government mandates that sound good it’s a vaccine, they can mandate you to do anything they want to do with your body. Either governments believe in “my body my choice“ or they don’t. When they stop believing that you have an individual right to choose what goes into your bloodstream and what doesn’t, then individual rights do not exist anymore. This is not a slippery slope fallacy, and governments do this sort of thing all the time.</p>

Prediction:
<p>If you want to go on to argue that the rights of the individual have no value, then you can. But if you don&#39;t, then why are you going to argue with me about it?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think people should have to die to be able to exercise their freedoms. I think it’s a fair argument to make. They can’t be forced to do anything about it. They’re free to do whatever they want with what they want. They are free to make their own decisions. They have no obligation to do what they choose to do with whatever they choose. If they choose, they’ll be free to free themselves from the constraints of government. </p>
<p>You&#39;re dead. I&#37;m not arguing for your rights. I am arguing for their right to life. You have the right to choose how you want to live. You are free to make your own decisions. I don&#38;t have the power to force anyone to do that. I think it&#40;s fair to assume that if you&#41;re not willing to give up your rights, then you have the ability to do so. </p>

I don’t see a single attempt to change your mind that isn’t clearly a case of “no, I got fucked over, other people should, too” or “this world is tough and cruel [the one they didn’t choose to be born into], they gotta learn that.”  OP, I agree with you. No child chose to be born. In that way, every single hurdle they face is, at heart, the parents’ fault. There are plenty of problems that bad parenting specifically creates, to boot. In the end, unless you can be 100% sure that some obstacle or problem a child of yours faces is PURELY their own fault, and not contributed to by you or the world YOU CHOSE to bring them into, you ought to help them to the best of your ability, until the day you die.  FTR, I have a 21 and 18 year old, so please don’t try to claim I don’t have experience.

Truth:
<p>You’re right. Some parents are shitty. Real shitty. Some of us are doing the best we can. There is no manual or handbook that gets given to you when you’re discharged after giving birth. Most of us do the best we can, provide necessities, some wants, and lots of love. The younger generations are depressed because of their own actions. They are mostly disillusioned because they don’t have a good concept of reality, which is evident by your stream of conscious post here. None of us can change your view because you don’t want it changed. You came here to rant about how much you hate people with children. </p>

Prediction:
<p>I see a lot of parents who have had kids who have been through terrible parenting, but they are not the ones who are responsible for the problems. They’re the ones that have had to go through this long and hard cycle of bad parenting. If they can’t change that, they’ll have to learn to live with it. But if they can, they can&#39;t change their mind. They have to do it themselves. They can”t do it alone, because they have to be the parents. No single parent is responsible for their child’s
<p>No, it’s not about the parents. It’ll be about the kids themselves. It&#39;s about the parent. The parent is the parent, not the child. The child is the child.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see how it is possible to change your mind and not have a child, regardless of what you think. If you think it is unfair to make a choice, then you are wrong. If your child wants to grow up to be a successful person, you have no choice. If they want to be successful in life, they have to choose to be in the world they want. If their parents want to change their mind, they should do so. If someone wants to have a kid, they can do so without having to go through a lot of therapy and therapy. If the

Everyone here acting like the rules don't **heavily** favor offenses in the NFL.  YoU hAd A cHaNcE tO sToP tHeM.  No shit? And the other team would have to stop them too if both teams were guaranteed a possession.

Truth:
Football meanwhile offers so many variations it's not funny.  I've seen games where the opponent completely stops an offense from scoring, but then that team's defense drops a couple of pick-sixes and wins the game.  That's like playing a grandmaster.  You might have captured their rooks but then they'll proceed to beat you sideways with bishops.  There's always another option."

Prediction:
<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that the rule is a fair one to use against the other team. I think it is fair to assume that if both teams had the same amount of possession, then the other would be able to stop them. If both teams have the same number of yards, then it would be fair for both teams to try to stop each other. But if the other side has the same possession, it would also be fair to expect the other to try and stop them as well. If they had the chance to do so, that would be fine.
<p>It’s like the NFL is set up to allow offenses to go after a defense. The only way to stop an offense is to make it impossible to stop it. If the defense had the ability to stop the offense, it’d be a lot easier to stop them. If they had the option to start the defense, it would be harder to stop their offense. They would have to be able to take advantage of it. And if they did, the defense would be forced to play hard to defend the quarterback. That would be a bad thing, because it would also make it harder for the
<p>The only way to stop offenses in the NFL is to stop them. But the NFL has a lot of rules that actually allow for that. The only rule that actually allows for that is that the offense has to be able to control the defense to get the ball to the quarterback. That&#39;s not a rule that allows for the offense to be shut down by the defense.</p>

European here, just don't mutilate your children regardless of gender.

Truth:
What you have to understand is that here in Europe, we don't mutilate little children like the 'greatest country on earth'. It's not a debate here. Doctors and medical organisations oppose it and there is no 'debate'. If you want to sit there and compare male genital mutilation to vaccines, you may as well be defending clitoral hood removal (female equivalent of foreskin). We see you as barbarians for performing this evil, but I prefer to educate rather than insult, and I always try my best to do that. If however, you want to insistent on entrenching yourself into your position and carry on defending this evil because you don't want to consider the possibility that a part of you was damaged before you could consent, or that you damaged your own sons, it's going to go about as well for you as everyone else who's done that, so you might want to get a preview by checking my post history regarding this issue."

Prediction:
Ip>I don&#39;t think that people mutilate their own children, and that is a pretty common thing in the US. It is not the case in the UK. People mutilating their own kids for some reason. It’s not a common practice in other countries. I think it is a fairly common phenomenon in some countries. But in the U.S. it seems to be more common in the majority of countries. The exception is in the United States, where children are mutilated by their parents.
<p>I don’t think mutilate your children because they are different genders. I think mutilation is wrong. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe you can discuss logical fallacy with a logical person, but if you can, then you can. I think you are going to be able to do that by simply stating that logical fallacy and then going on to say that it is a logical fallacy. </p>

I should have known; the typical Reddit ‘research’ take is to directly google for data to support your conclusion, then browbeat with it with some superfluous grammar that suggests superior intelligence, then pray that no one reads it.  Or more likely, pray that if they do, they don’t understand it’s implications and limitations that you weren’t able to grasp yourself.

Truth:
You can't have a meaningful conversation if all your rebuttals are ""Yeah but this unnamed study I won't show you says you're wrong""."

Prediction:
<p>My point is that I don&#39;t know what you mean by superior intelligence. If you do, it&#40;s because you are not willing to study it, not because you don’t want to learn it, but because you want to make sure that you aren&#37;t ignorant to it. </p>
<p>I think you are correct in your conclusion that the average person is superior to average people, and that is the only reason I’m not doing this.</p>
<p>I think you’re right to say that I’m not actually interested in research. If I were, I wouldn’t be able to share my research with you. I feel like it’s a waste of time. I don&#39;t know how you feel about it, but I think it is worth sharing my research. I think I can understand your lack of interest in research, and I hope that you can understand that. But it seems like you don”t understand the entire point of the argument. You seem to be a skeptic of the whole thing

This whole thread is like society, fucking annoying.

Truth:
<p>I feel like the society is the main issue.</p>

Prediction:
Ip>I don&#39;t think society is a perfect place to be a social influencer. I think you should stop doing that.</p>
< this is like a society, society is not for everyone.
Ip>I don&#39;t think it’s fair to call this a society, because society is not fair to you. </p>

I think the amount of people who buy that soul mate crap is smaller than you imply.   Most people are fairly practical in my experience.   &#x200B;  edit. Reading the comments here maybe I'm wrong. People are sappy and retarded.

Truth:
<li>People really only have a small amount of mates, usually 3-20, pirates share to tens of thousands of complete strangers. There are many things in our world that are fine at one scale but not at a completely different scale. For example, sex with someone who&#39;s 6570 days old is fine. With someone who&#39;s 70 days old is a heinous crime. If someone stole 3-20 pence from me, I&#39;d not bat an eye. 100 pounds though, would have me frothing. Scale can be and often is the difference between the benign and the malign, something I&#39;m sure you understand.</li>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think there is a lot of people who buy that soul mate crap. I think it is a waste of time and effort to justify it. People who buy soul mate shit are doing it for money. They are not doing it to save their reputation.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not about the soul mate. It&#37;s about the amount of people who buy that soul mate, not the type of person who is willing to pay for it&#38;s sake. </p>
<p>I think the percentage of people who buy that soul mate crap is smaller than the percentage who don&#39;t buy it. </p>

I think your reading comprehension is to blame here but nonetheless: Google this discussion and you’ll find countless more studies. HMU when you’re done reading those if this one wasn’t clear or sufficient for you.

Truth:
Multiple other studies I linked do exactly that. Feel like I was pretty thorough in explaining it.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you should be reading the whole thing. But I think you are reading too much into the subject to not be able to read what I said. I think that is the main point of the whole discussion. </p>
Ip>That&#39;s not a good reading level. You&#37;re not reading enough. You’re reading too much. </p>
<p>So, if you don&#39;t understand, then you don’t know what you’re doing. </p>

I refuse to believe you're this obtuse. Maybe just don't reply next time you're this determined to avoid saying anything of substance. Have a good one.

Truth:
Are you really that obtuse?

Prediction:
<p>If you&#39;re not willing to respond, then I think you should. I&#40;m not sure why you&quot;re so obtuse. I don't think you are. I think the most intelligent person in the world would be the one who would respond to me.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not about the substance, but the level of level of substance.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you are being obtuse by responding to a response that isn&#37;t directly addressed directly to me. If you were, I would expect you to respond to the first thing I said.</p>

Great point

Truth:
Good point!"

Prediction:
<p>I agree with your point. I am not going to go into detail about what I said here, but I think it’s pretty clear that you’re making the same argument. That is the point.</p>
<aphrase:
<p>I’m not going to argue here, but you’re right, it’s a fair point. I’d argue that the only way to address this is to use the word “prophecy” instead of “phrase”.</p>

The phrase "gender identity" might be somewhat recent, but we have data about people identifying with various genders that dates well over a thousand years.  By the way, the term "constructive conversation" doesn't mean just lying down and accepting whatever factually false bullshit some random bigot on the internet throws at you. It is reasonable to continue the conversation without pretending as if the wrong transphobic bullshit you write was true.

Truth:
Often these conversations stem from the question ""how do you know you're trans."" The first answer most people will give are things like ""I didn't align with stereotypical preferences/ ideas of (x gender people).""

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think we can have discussions about gender identity in the same way we did in the past. People are not saying that everyone identifies as the same gender, but I think it is fair to assume that people identify as different genders regardless of gender identity. The difference between genders is that the difference in gender identity is not necessarily a result of the gender itself. It is also based on how people feel about each other and how that feels to them. I&#37;m not saying people are transphobic, but that is the point of the conversation.
<p>I don’t think it’s a new definition. I think we’re seeing more and more people identifying with different genders. I’m not saying people are inherently transphobic, but I think the term “transphobic” is a useful term to describe people who identify with a particular gender. It also implies that people are not afraid to voice their opinions in the face of bigotry, and that people should be able to speak out if they want to. If they want, they should be willing to speak up.
<p>Transgender people are different from the rest of us. It’s not just about gender identity. The rest of the world is about gender identities. People identify as different genders. The majority of people identify as either a man or a woman. You’re not the only one who identifies as a man. You are the one who is not the one. If you want to engage with someone, then you must first go through the process of identifying as a woman and then identify as a male.

I’m not religious, but I learned about this argument in a college class I took on religion- they call it “the problem of evil”, which states that if god is both Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent, then there can be no evil in the world. Therefore, since there is undeniably evil in this world, god can’t exist as defined by the major monotheistic religions. It’s an interesting debate!

Truth:
Maybe you can't believe in an omnipotent god, but maybe god isn't omnipotent and is only being described as omnipotent because the people who believe the stories of god use that word to describe him. Have we seen him try to make a stone he can't lift? Why does he have to be omnipotent according to our flawed language system that would make that paradoxical on purpose just to prove he doesn't exist? This entire argument that you need human words to describe superhuman entities and concepts in order for it to exist and make sense in your brain doesn't hold much water. Things can exist regardless of our words for them.

Prediction:
<p>The problem with religion is that it’s not about religion. The problem is that religion is about evil, not God. God is not evil. God exists in this world, and the only way to do that is by using the power of God. So, God exists. God has no power. God can’t do anything. God cannot do anything to change the world. God lives in another world. He exists in that world, not in another. So the problem is not about God, but with God.
Ifp>I’m not religious, but I think it’s fair to say that we have some form of God. The God that created the world exists in the first place. God is the God of the universe. So if we have a god, God exists in this world. If we have an omnipotent God, then there is no God. If God exists, then we have no god. If there is an omnipotence, then God exists. So God is omnipotent. God does not exist in the world. So we have to have a God.
<p>The problem with God is that he is omnipotent, and the only way to control that is through God. God is not omnipotent. God exists, but he is not omniscient. God cannot be omnipotent in the world. God can be Omnipotent, but God cannot control the world by his actions. So God is the omnipotence of the world, and God has no power to control the universe. God does not have the power to make the world go round and round, but He has the power of the universe to make it go around and around.

Why would you think id find value in a CNN article when the two news orgs on the list I gave you are known for being not bias and are a gold standard for reporting?  Hence the primary reason in listing them in the first place.    Beyond that, its an article about how a few people feel.    Can't read the wapo one due to paywall, but kamala staff departures is the title, and I'm a little confused about what her staff leaving has to do with being part of an administrations inner circle? Staff departures about this time have been common on every admin I can recall going back to at least obama year one.    It's also a two way street.  Its hard to argue that someonse veep, and someone who is apparently going to be his running mate in 2024 is somehow not part of the inner circle. If not the VP, then who is the inner circle?  Most people would argue the cabinet is also part of the inner circle.  And here is a picture of that.  Now im not arguing the title is accurate (or inaccurate), but this is a pic of his cabinet, and its a far far cry from lily white as has been described....  There's a lot to bitch about, but diversity in the inner circle does not appear to be valid?  https://www.facebook.com/POTUS/photos/a-cabinet-that-looks-like-america/171170408292829/  1

Truth:
<p>So you honestly think that CNN, MSNBC, NBC, etc. are center or unbiased? Maybe this was the case 20 years ago, but it&#39;s not anymore. If you think that the above are not left-wing, you&#39;re being either willfully ignorant or are behind the times. </p>

Prediction:
<p>I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but I’d guess that the only way you can comment on this is if you want to find out more about it. If you are, then you need to read my entire article. If not, then why are you doing this? If you don’t, then your article is not going to be worth reading, because it’s not a good read. The only way I can find out is if someone else wants to comment. If someone wants to know the reason why someone is leaving the administration, then I
<p>I don&#39;t think there is a single news outlet in the country that has been consistently biased. If there is one, it is the New York Times. The New York Post. The Washington Post, for example, is one of the few outlets that is not biased, and not the only one that is biased. The Times is one that has consistently been biased, but it is not one that, in my view, has been biased in the past. They have been consistently negative in their coverage, and are now actively trying to do so. The NYT has been a perfect example of that.
<p>I don&#39;t think you are going to go on a rant about the lack of trust between the Trump administration and the media and the left. The left is a good place to start, but the right is a bad place to go. The right is to go after the left, but we have to go with the right, and we can then go back to the left and change the channel to make it better. They have a lot of power over the left.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think OP is OP. I think OP would be more accepting of OP than OP. OP seems to be more open minded than OP, with a lot of respect for OP and OP.

No. That's still being a selfish piece of shit. These aren't imaginary people. Those are real people that assholes like you are killing. And believe it or not, plenty of folks can give a shit about strangers. That's just you and people like that only care about people you know. That's kind of a staple for conservatives and libertarians. You don't give a fuck unless it's at your door.

Truth:
Several times now, I've encountered strangers on the internet making flip passing jokey comments about killing themselves – which seems to be exactly the thing and the sort of people you are dismissing – and reached out to them privately, only to discover they were, actually, acutely suicidal and not under any sort of psychiatric care whatsoever, and, yeah, actually did need someone to rescue them.  Sometimes I've done this, and found out, they did have mental health care, and it was being dealt with – but they were grateful to find out someone noticed and was looking out for them.

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you are a hypocrite for giving a shit about strangers. I think you have a valid point here, and I feel like you are, in fact, giving a damn about people you know. I&#37;m not saying you are wrong because I don't think that is the case, but you are not doing the same thing. You are not giving a fuck about people that you know, nor are you giving a fucking about them.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think people should feel that way about strangers. People should be treated with respect and respect, not as a burden.</p>
Ip>You&#39;re not being selfish, it&#37;s not about you. You&#38;re being selfish. You are being selfish and not giving a shit about people you know. I&#34;m not saying you&#40;re selfish, but you are not taking responsibility for others.</p>

This is objectively the worst answer of all.    Saying you haven't done your research so you can't be at blame for making bad decisions is just awful, really bottom of the barrel mentality.  Everyone is accountable for their choices in life, being uninformed is no excuse.

Truth:
The problem we have is people enjoying looking at situations with hindsight, having looked at all facts and spent many hours considering what the correct actions should have been. Rarely do they ever consider what information was available in the moment or what the instinctive reaction is to the situation, and even fewer seem to care about what the potential ramifications are for making the wrong call."

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not going to go into all the details here because I don&#37;t have the data to prove that you were wrong. The only thing I can say is that I think it is pretty fair to assume that you are responsible for your decisions.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you can be held accountable for your decisions. I think you should be able to take responsibility for your actions, but you are not the one who is accountable for them. Maybe you should just do it yourself. Maybe that will help you in the long run. Perhaps you could learn from your mistakes. Maybe it will help your self-awareness, but if you know how to do it, then you are the one to learn from them.
<p>This is not an answer to your own question. It’s not an actual answer. You’re making decisions that are not your own. They are your own fault. You are not responsible for your own actions. I’m not going to go into details because I don’t have the data to do so, but because I know what I know, I know the consequences of my actions. The consequences of those actions will be enormous.</p>

Stay ashamed

Truth:
The reason you should go out of your way to be ashamed of this is because there's no quicker way to remove your own bigotry.

<p>I don&#39;t know how you got to this point, but I hope you will.</p>

I'll take this even further. It shouldn't be an option at all. Anyone who dies should have their organs available to someone in need, period. Why does anyone care? Just remove the entire thing from the driver's license and make everyone an organ donor. Done. Lives saved.

Truth:
If someone wishes to mitigate that risk by not being an organ donor, that should be their choice."

Prediction:
<p>If someone dies, there would be no need to donate their organs. If you want to donate your organs, you can do so by clicking this link. If someone wants to donate a kidney, then they should do so. </p>
<p>Why isn&#39;t it an option?</p>
<p>It&#39;s an option to donate organs to people who need them, not to people in need. Don&#37;t do it. Don't do it.</p></p>

Failures in human memory are one thing, intentional malice is another. She lied about him being 100% the one responsible. She lied about him in her book. She lied about him having a record. She lied about him greeting her. What many of you believe about the police could be a lie as well. She has some mental illness issues going on and trying to downplay her vile acts call into question the quality of your character.

Truth:
You witnessed a fairly serious crime.  Even without the cooperation of the victim, the police could move forward with a case against the guy based on the evidence of injury and your testimony and getting her out of that situation."

Prediction:
<p>I think it is fair to say that she lied to police about her relationship with her ex-husband. She lied to the police about what happened to her ex. She also lied to her parents about her job. She used to be a very active social worker. She never went to work. She was a very serious person. She didn&#39;t do anything to deserve to be treated this way. She is a very vulnerable person. I don&#40;t think she has any mental illness. She doesn&#38;t have a high IQ. She does not have a social skills
<p>I think you’re missing the point here. If you think she’s intentionally lying to you, that’d be an incredibly stupid thing to do. She’ll never be able to stop lying to me. She lied to me about what happened to her husband, and then lied to the police about it. She also lied about her mental health, which is entirely unrelated to her actions.</p>
<p>You are being disingenuous here by trying to imply that her actions were intentional. She is not blaming anyone for her actions. She’s blaming someone else for them. She never said anything about it. She was just a victim of a terrible crime, and she is not accusing anyone of anything. She just wanted to make it clear that she was not blaming someone for her own actions.</p>

Do me a favor. Pull up google maps and tell me where Ukraine is located relative to Russia. Ethnic Russians are also the largest ethnic minority in Ukraine since Ukraine has been a part of Russia since the 1700s.   It doesn't matter what Ukraine wants. Ukraine can go ahead and make that decision unilaterally (like a naive fool), but not expecting heavy pushback from Putin is just retarded.  Russia did not get Cuba. The Soviets bailed on Cuba as soon as it got heated with the US (i.e. Cuban missle crisis). Russia tried to foolishly extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, across several continents, the Atlantic Ocean, in order to try to drink America's milkshake.   America responded in a very predictable, realistic fashion: "Go fuck yourself, Cuba's mine".   Is your peanut brains connecting the dots yet?  America is overreaching and attempting to extend their sphere of influence halfway across the world, all the way to Russia's border, trying to drink Russia's milkshake, and retards like you think everything is going to be kumbaya and Putin is just going to let this fly.

Truth:
Okay. Russia turns their attention to financing and building a working political relationship with Mexican cartels. They fund them so well that these cartels take over both de-facto and de-jure control of parts of Mexico. Russian forces legitimately and legally move into Mexico at the invitation of a Mexican state and given the green light by the Mexican federal government.

Prediction:
<p>I think it’s fair to say that Ukraine is far from the center of the Russian sphere of influence. The center of Russia is a large part of the U.S. economy. The rest of the country is in the middle of the US&#39;s economy, so the center is a big part of what the US is doing to Ukraine. So, if the US wants to take control of Ukraine, it should be done by the Russians. If the Russians want to take over the country, they should do so by themselves. Otherwise, they’re going to have to do it
<p>If you want to know where Ukraine is, you must first go to Russia. If you don&#39;t know, there is a country in the Russian Federation that is not part of Russia. It is not Russia, but Ukraine. The country is part of the Russian Empire. The people of Ukraine are not the people of Russia that are not in control of the country. They are the people who are the ones who are in control and who are making decisions that are actually going to benefit the Russian people. They have the power to do whatever they want with it. They can do anything they want.
<p>I think it’s fair to say that Ukraine is not the only country in the region that wants to be part of Russia. It is not like that the US is unwilling to give up its sphere of influence to Ukraine. This is because the US does not want to give Ukraine the power it needs to make decisions on its own. The US wants to make sure that Ukraine has the power to make those decisions without the need for Russia to do so. Russia also wants to get rid of the Soviet Union. Russia doesn’t want to go through that process.

Truth:
You don't need a reason to take free money.

<p>You&#39;re being rude, and you&#40;re not getting free stuff. </p>

Logically you are correct  if it's offensive to do it to one culture its offensive to do it to all cultures. But the die hard sjws only care about nonwhite cultures being appropriated. Because cultural appropriation is racist and you can't be racist against white people because they have all the power. At least that's how my former liberal friends screamsplained it at me when I made tacos for my superbowl party.

Truth:
<p>And even then, these SJWs usually don’t listen when people from the actual culture they are getting offended for tells them that it’s not offensive, since of course they all know better. </p>

Prediction:
<p>How is it that you don&#39;t think white people are racist? I&#40;m not saying this is just a cultural appropriation, but I think it is a fair way to think about it. It is a form of cultural appropriation. It does not mean that people don’t want to do things for other people. It just means that they are more likely to feel the same way. It also means that people who think they are racist aren&quot;t racist, but they are. They are not the problem here. They aren&#37;t. They
<p>I think that is problematic because I think it&#39;s racist to think that white people are inferior to other people. And if someone wants to use white people for their own purposes, that&#37;s fine. But I&#38;m not saying that all white people&quot; are inferior, because they&#40;re the same. It&#34;s just that there&#30;s a lot of people who think that the same way I do. They&#47;re ignorant and want to do things that are racist&#44;
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#40;s offensive to do it to one culture. It&#47;s not offensive to say that&quot;it&#34;s racist to say so. It &#39&#37;s just the way it is. And I&#38;m not saying that&#44;s okay to do things like that because they&#43;re not racist. But the way I&&#49;m saying it&quOT; is that a valid argument to make against white people&#50

I guess I have to block you since you can't seem to be able to read a room.   Good bye.

Truth:
<p>Basically, all I am saying is that it&#39;s good to learn to read the room.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I&#39;m not sure if you can read a room in a room, but I think you can. If you can, then I will be able to read it. If not, then you will.</p>

Adding to what you said, I think it's pretty sad that nowadays people still consider good & evil in politics as being a thing.  &#x200B;  People still treat those conflicts as if they weren't just different empires trying to acquire more influence and territory over different regions.

Truth:
Would it be fair to say that both sides of that conflict were worthy of being called bad?

Prediction:
<p>I think it&#39;s sad that so many countries have a similar history of conflict, and so many of them have had to go through wars to win over their populations. The idea of conflict is that it’s a form of oppression and exploitation. The only way to stop a conflict is to stop it from happening in the first place, and then you’re going to have to put up with it. This is not something that you were just talking about in the past. It&#37;s because people are used to conflict, not because they’ve been forced to
<p>It&#39;s sad to see so many people still think that wars are evil.  I’m not saying that wars aren’t bad, just that they&#37;re more of an issue than anything else.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it’s fair to be treated as evil in this way.  It seems like the only way to describe it is to make it seem like it”s a kind of “righteous” kind of conflict. </p>

Why not? Because it’s not all about us. It’s not all about you

Truth:
>Its not about you.

Prediction:
<p>It’s not about you. It’d be silly if you didn’t think that. But I think it would be silly to think that this is all about you and not about us. I think that you would be more open to the idea that you’re the hero of the day, but that’ll be a distraction from the real story.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t have to be a bigot to understand that. It&#37;s not about you. It’s about your actions.</p>
<p>You’re not all about me. I’m not talking about you.</p>

You deny it happens.    If millions of men are being sexually assaulted and raped by women each year, that is a "massive number."

Truth:
My apologies, I misspoke, probably because my attention span regarding someone with zero capacity to address my points is dwindling. ***Women are literally 9 times more likely to be raped, than you are to be murdered as a man.*** As per statistics that I have ALREADY LINKED AND EXPLAINED

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I know that women have been assaulted and raped in the past. It&#37;s not like I&#38;m the only person who can say that.  I don't know how many women are assaulted by men, but it&#40;s pretty high. I know there are a lot of women who have been raped by men and I&quot; I know a few of them. They are often very angry and upset about it and want to make a change.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it’s a big number, but it is a huge number, and it”s not something that’d be easy to dismiss as “just a small percentage”. And it is not something you should be dismissing. It is a very serious issue. It’ll never be eradicated. It will always be a problem, and there will be a lot of people who will be uncomfortable with it. But there is a lot that can be done to prevent it from happening. And there are lots of people that will never be able to
<p>It’s not just the number of women who have been raped. The number of men who are sexually assaulted is also not a single one. It’d be a lot of people who think that is a good thing to have a healthy relationship with a woman. I’m not saying that is bad, but it”s a lot more than I think. If it was, it would be a huge number. But it is a lot. It is not something you’re saying.

Lol a cracker would say that

Truth:
There's no dark history behind the word ""cracker"" lol"

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think a cracker would say cracker is a bad word.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a cracker, I&#37;m a generalist. I&&#38;m just saying that because I think crackers are inherently dangerous to society, and I think it&#40;s fair to say that a lot of people are susceptible to being targeted by the same type of violence. It&#47;s not just about the word crack. It is about the ability to speak and act in a certain way that makes sense to me.</p> </p>
<p>Cracker&quot;I&#39;m not a cracker. I&#37;m a person who makes a lot of noise, and I don’t care about that. The problem is that crackers are not the problem. They are the problem.</p>

>I also think fraud is not an issue, but I just think that asking for ID isn't a bad thing if implemented right      hahahahahahaahaha

Truth:
But what’s your opinion on people who refuse to have an ID regardless of its cost?

Prediction:
<p>As far as ID is concerned, it&#39;s not a problem with ID. It&#37;s an issue with people who are afraid to use it because they don&#38;t want to pay for it. It’s a problem in itself.</p>
<p>No, ID&#39;s not a crime. It is just an issue of being able to identify yourself without fear of being found out by a police officer. I’m not saying that ID&quot;s a crime, but it is a very serious issue. I think it’s a good thing to be able to ID someone without fear or embarrassment. It’d be a lot easier to know if they were aware of the situation. That’ll be the main point of this post.</p>
<p>If ID is required, there is no reason to ask for it. ID isn&#39;t required. ID is not mandatory. ID should be required to show ID. ID does not mean you are a fraud victim. ID means you cannot be a victim of a crime.</p>

does my username have a mod next to it ?    so how could i threaten a ban ? it's not up to me   i warned him that being rude gets people banned bc being rude gets people banned and he was name calling instead of debating   kinda like your comment wishing rude voodoo hexes on internet strangers just bc you disagree with them... all the people i know who spend their energy being trashy and negative like that usually do so bc they're already pretty negative and miserable themselves and are trying to make others like them.     so i don't need to wish anything negative back on you bc your life is clearly already the equivalent of ... infinite phantom sneezes . take care tho

Truth:
Don't be rude. The mods will ban you."

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think you should be banned for being rude.</p>
<p>If someone does that to you, then I don&#39;t think you&#40;re a threat. If someone does this to me, I&#47;m going to ban them.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if you have a mod or not, but you are a troll. If you don't, then you&#40;t have to do it.</p> </p>

Misogynistic as well. Nice one, what other nuggets can we get out of you?  Either you are extremely dim or selectively discriminatory. Regardless, thanks for making your own CMV massively laughable.

Truth:
<p>This CMV is about proving you can’t be sexist about dating preferences but you can be racist about dating preferences or the inverse.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think you are misusing CMV as a tool to justify your gender biases. I think CMV is pretty sexist.</p>
<p>I think you&#39;re misusing the CMV to label women as inferior.</p>
<p>I think you are the definition of a sexist. The definition of the word sexist is that it means that you are a bigot. I think it&#39;s pretty clear that this is true. I don&#37;t think the definition is the same as that of a non-binary person. I&#38;m not going to go into detail about this here, because that&quot;s not the definition I want to use.</p>

Oh so you are an annoying pedantic that can't understand context?

<p>I guess you can also extrapolate from context instead of trying to make a general argument, but that is not the point of this thread. It is an attempt to clarify things. If you can’t understand, then you’re just going to have to assume that the context is the same as the context.</p>

As someone who has been using a flip phone for the past 5 years, I can honestly say I'm not missing anything. I deleted my Facebook bought a flip phone and a Garmin gps. I can honestly say that I'm in a much better place mentally and I've been way more productive.

Truth:
<p>The twist is that we&#39;ve hit the phone where smartphones don&#39;t improve that much from year to year. It used to be every year added a new crazy feature. Now the pace is slower. So no phone is <em>much</em> better then the competing or previous one. For example, the much hyped 5G functionality is useless for most people around the world (and definitely in the US) since there is so little 5G coverage right now.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I think a flip phone is the best way to recharge your phone, and I don&#39;t have to worry about it constantly. I can’t go back to my phone without it being in my pocket. I don”t think I’m going to be able to go back there in a year or two. I”m not going back to that phone, I don't have a phone, but I am going to keep my phone. It’s my phone and my job, and it’ll be mine for a long time to come.</p>
<p>I’m not going to go into detail about the flip phone and its usage, but I’ll be honest with you and say that it’s not the case that I”m missing out on much. It”s just that I have a lot of things to do, and I don’t feel like I have much time to do anything about it. I don&#39;t have a ton of time to spend with my family and friends, so I“m going to do what I can to make the most of it.”
<p>That’s not to say that I’m not using a flip phone. If I was to take it and use it every day, I would be doing so in a heartbeat. But if I take the plunge and go for a walk instead of a run, I‘m going to be in a better place. I feel like I can do more with it than I did before. I don’t have to put up with a lot of effort to do that. I”m doing it all the time, just to be more productive. </p>

Since we are checking post history, it appears you spend half your time arguing against the behalf of white people on Reddit lol I will politely block you and move on. Idiot.

Truth:
<p>You are arguing with a caricature of me and not with what I&#39;m actually saying. You assume that the only way that I could hold this position is if I was white (I&#39;m not and neither is OP) and if MY personal feelings have been hurt in the past by being called a racist. </p>

Prediction:
<p>You&#39;re completely ignoring the fact that white people are in the minority. You&#37;re not a minority, and you are not the minority.</p>
<p>The only thing I’ve seen is a lot of white people fighting against white people. I don’t think it’s fair to assume that people are fighting for their own rights, but it seems like you’re fighting for your own. I think you should be able to do that. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think white people should have a say in this. I think it is a fair assumption that the majority of white people are not the ones who are being attacked for being racist. I don’t think that’s fair, but I think there should be a discussion on how we should respond to people who are offended by someone who is not white.</p>

To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.  You are chamging the premise previously agreed upon to win the debate, ie false premise fallacy.

Truth:
I in no way deny systemic racism, just you're analysis of it. Systemic racism is the product of a class based society where inequality is baked into the social structure.

Prediction:
<p>If you want to call racism a racist, you should first check if the term is used to mean systemic racism, or if it’s just a term that you use to label people as racist. If you think racism is a racist by definition, then you’re not talking about systemic racism. The term “systemic racism” is used specifically to describe racism that is based solely on the idea that people are inherently biased against each other. So if you think that racism is inherently negative, then that is just because people are biased against the people they disagree with.  If you look at
<p>If you think that racism is systemic racism, then you’re wrong. If you think it’s systemic racism then you are wrong.</p>
<p>Racism is a system of prejudice based on race. It’s based on the assumption that a person is inherently prejudiced because of their skin color.  This is why racism is so important, because it’ll be perceived as a “systemic” effect.  It is not a race that is inherently bad. It is a systemic form of prejudice.  The root of racism is prejudice based upon the skin color of a person.  Racism is the result of a particular person or group of people, and racism is also a social phenomenon.  So the term “

> NATO is not recognized as a regional organization  Please stop spreading these lies. NATO is a regional organization as far as the UN is concerned, it's right here in the UN's own words: https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/UNRO%20Cooperation%20between%20the%20UN%20and%20Regional%20Organizations.pdf

Truth:
I agree though, NATO should be disbanded. Europe should provide for Europe's defense"

Prediction:
<p>NATO is not a regional organization. The UN does not recognize NATO as a regional body. The only way NATO is recognized as such is by the UN. The United Nations does not support NATO. The US does not want NATO to be recognized as a region. The UK does not. NATO is not part of the US. </p>
<p>NATO is not a regional organization.</p>
<p>NATO is not a regional organization. NATO is a regional institution. NATO has been recognized by the United Nations for over a century. NATO does not have a single member state. The UN has been called a regional body since 1948.</p>

“If the kid is ….crying, you’re kind of an asshole”  Lol.  No, you’re kinda of an asshole OP.    Kids cry.  If mom and dad aren’t doing anything to try to stop it , or taking baby away if it can’t be stopped , they might be assholes.   But crying happens.  You live in a society , get over yourself. This is a brutally bad  CMV

Truth:
It's all about knowing what kind of cry it is, how old the kid is and how to react. Some cries are ok to ignore and others are not."

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think a parent should be responsible for their child’s emotional well-being. If a parent doesn’t take care of the kid, then the parent shouldn&#37;t be responsible, either. If the kid is being a burden to the parents, then they are not responsible for the care and care of their child.</p>
<p>If your kid is crying, you’re an asshole. If they are, well, then you are an asshole.</p>
Youp>So if your kid is crying, you&#39;re being an asshole. You&#37;re not doing anything to stop it. You are being a hypocrite.</p>

Google exists Ok lets say a new reddit user wants to hide a post and sees the "hide" button. What is the most rational thing to do? 1. Press hide, sees post is hidden, thinks post is hidden or 2. Use Google. 90% of people will choose option 1. What is there to argue about? No offence but are you autistic? I have a sorta friend who has autism and he argues with me over every single little details.

Truth:
<p>Google could actually do something useful for once and make it so that you can create a Google account at whatever age you want, but restringing what content you can access while being logged in (and instead of banning comments, just don&#39;t show them to kids ffs). And yeah, I know you could just use incognito... But at that point there&#39;s nothing you could do stop those who use it xd. I mean, obviously there would be ways around it. It&#39;s a matter of making it less accessible, because yeah, nowadays an actual toddler could by pure accident end up watching a bunch of NSFW content. If you just make it less accessible to minor, they would have to be actively trying to access that content. And at that point the damage is already been done. You can&#39;t do nothing against that, really.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I believe that the only way to find out if someone is autistic is to go to google and check if they are. If they are, then you are right there is no point in trying to figure out if they have autism. If you don’t, then it’s your choice. If someone wants to hide their post, you can do so by clicking the link below.</p>
<p>If you want to hide a post, you must first check if it’s hidden. If it isn’t, then you must check if the post is hiding.</p>

People should stop being "triggered" by words.

Truth:
<p>Anyway. Don&#39;t like something? Look away. &#39;Being triggered&#39; is not a harm. People get triggered at all sorts of things - opinions, designs, etc. However, society would be destroyed if there were to exist a cause of action against people who engage in activities, say things, etc. that trigger people.</p>

Prediction:
<p>I don&#39;t think people should be treated as if they are a part of the problem of the world, but I think it is possible to be treated that way. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not about words. It&#37;s about how people are treated. It is about how we think about things. </p>
<p>I think that it&#39;s best to stop being "triggered" by words.

Don't have to, it is irrelevant. He is a troll who took another identity and posted under a fake name and then pretended he was a victim.
